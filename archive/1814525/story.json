            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up in an enclosed space that barely fit your tiny body. You were immediately swelled with information but none of it made sense. Well some of it did, like how to fly, walk, run, eat, and a host of other abilities that you had no business knowing but did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were what was known as a Dark Hunter King. The title \u201cKing\u201d was given when a Dark Hunter was born that had a defect. Dark Hunters were essentially the top species of Dragon in this realm. They ruled far above in the peaks where their scales could be fed by the sun. The realm you were in was known simply as Base realm. Basically your realm was shared between Dragons; who ruled over the predators and animals and of course the Dark Hunters were the strongest Dragons. The humans were extremely advanced in magic and most of all in portal magic. Most of the dragons in other realms came or originated from the breeds from Base Realm. Because of this the Dragons protected the humans so they could send their children to live in other realms if it became too crowded and food was scarce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Hunters were pretty much like the Spartans. At birth, if they had any defects what so ever they were thrown off their home peak and were left to plummet to the ravines below. Dark Hunters identical look was one everyone knew in this realm; Their scales, bones, and other outside parts were so jet black that they were invisible in the dark. They had retractable spikes and horns that could cover their body or retract for human riding and other than individual features the females had glowing blue eyes while the males had orange. The only other color eyes was when a King was born and had glowing red eyes. There were maybe 20 of them in all and a Queen was the one in charge. Dark hunters were the biggest, strongest, fastest,\u2026 of dragons while most dragon\u2019s size maxed out at 150 feet long Dark Hunters maxed out at 300 and that was what the queen was. However she didn\u2019t allow any other Dark Hunter get over 200 feet long or they would be able to challenge her for leadership. She would kill those who reached that point and breed more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had an almost backwards society. Female Dark Hunters were in charge and overall more impressive both in size and intellect. Males were basically grunts but as they were weaker and smaller than the females they were kept out of site in chained cells and used exclusively as breeding machines. The only exception to this was, once in every 50 generations a King was born that was not only capable of unknown power but also had the genetic memory of all the Kings that came before, including their power and learned abilities. One of those abilities was the reason for their immediate extermination was the ability to turn human at will while retaining all his draconic abilities, including transforming parts of himself, like growing wings or a tail out of his back when needed. Other than their eyes, the only way to know for sure that a baby was a King was that he would hatch as a human than transform as into a dragon. Kings were hated and despised and while they were just like any other newborn after hatching, they could grow to the full size of 500 feet long and able to understand all the genetic memory at the age of 12. Kings were the biggest threat to a queen so if for no other reason they were slaughtered for that reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou banged on the inside of your shell with your tiny fists, trying to get out. You heard the squeaking and roaring outside as your apparent brothers and sisters were breaking free. You so much wanted to join them but these human fists were not working and even though you didn\u2019t know how you knew but you did know that once you hatched you would be able to transform into a proper dragon. But now was the task of getting out. Then a thought out of nowhere came. You extended you arm and then out of your wrist you protruded a spike that you guessed would be one on your dragon body if you were in that form. You used it on the shell and finally it cracked. You brought your spike back into your arm and with all your might recoiled and slammed into the crack you made. The shell broke and the pieces flung away from you as you collapsed in the sudden freezing temperature of the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see a huge snout looking at you that you immediately rendered as your mother. You were about to get up when another series of spasms came and then immense pain as your body began changing. You cried and screamed as your body was ripped apart and your dragon body was formed. Finally you were free of the pain and lay, whimpering and screeching like the other baby dragons. What happened next was cemented into your mind. When you got up and looked longingly into your mother\u2019s eyes she looked back into yours with utter hate and disgust. Then, without warning she snarled and caught your body in her jaws then bit down and sank her fangs into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are no son of mine.\u201d She said after a few chewing motions than spit you off the mountain and into blackness. Your last site of her was her grinning and hate filled eyes with her mouth dripping with your blood. You lost consciousness as you plummeted down to your death. That is when your wings spread out on their own. You were doing it but not consciously. They caught the wind and you bagan to glide down until after a day your body hit the ground and you came to a stop. Your wounds were already healing but at the size of a large rat you were extremely vulnerable as it stood but at least you were alive, for the moment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you came to it would be because something shook you awake and when you saw you were in a cage and the person holding it saw your eyes open he grinned then shook the cage violently. The pain from your wounds would force you back into unconsciousness and this happened enough for you to actually prefer the nightmares of your mother trying to kill you. However, finally you woke as you were dumped out of your cage and into a larger one. Whatever time in the sun had healed your wounds nicely but they were still sore as you flopped onto the ground below a human before he left and a few more came into your\u2026 cell to evaluate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Scar be careful. He may be an infant but he is still a dragon and capable of much damage.\u201d Said one of the humans which only got the fat man that had bent over to look at you closer to straighten and snap his fingers to the man. The man was taken away and thrown to a pack of lions, who greedily tore the man to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone else feel like giving me orders?\u201d asked the human known as Lord Scar to which no one addressed it and he put his nose up then looked down at his new prize\u2026 you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were limping around your cage now as you smelled the area up to the bars and was snapped at by the animals in the neighboring cages. You didn\u2019t know why but you were getting a bad feeling about this and somehow you were already disliking the fat human that was giving the orders. He was large and tall, nearly 7 feet tall and easily 400 pounds and not of muscle. His bald head and plump features adorned with a single scar across his face were masked with expensive and overcompensating clothes and jewelry. You whimpered at his gaze and as you backed away from the clawing animals in the cages next to you, trying to get at you as if you were their next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this won\u2019t due. Rose!\u201d Called Lord Scar to which a very young but fit young lady appeared and you could smell different animal scents on her, both alive and dead. He grabbed at her butt and massaged it before separating and going toward you, giving you a swift kick that made you fly against the nearby and back wall. You crumbled to the floor and whimpered there as you looked up at the cruel man. \u201cI was told I got a dragon, not this whimpering piece of trash. You are no longer tied to any of the other animals. This is your main priority from now on. You will make me a fierce dragon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That means none of this\u2026 weak and pathetic garbage. When I have guests I want them to marvel at what I have, not be disgusted with it. Do this\u2026\u201d he said as he looked at the dragon with a glint in his eyes then came over as if to entice her to do his bidding rather than threaten her. \u201c... and I will make sure you are the richest and well looked after servant in all my empire.\u201d He whispered into her ear. It was obvious from her heartbeat that she was more disgusted with him then appealed, but for the sake of being fed to one of his animals or the dragon he was referring to she played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be done my lord.\u201d She said as she continued to play along to which he grinned evilly then headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and one more thing. Make sure that the little monster is used to the taste of fresh human meat. You have our entire dungeon and staff to choose from.\u201d Lord Scar said as if he just thought of it as a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my lord.\u201d Rose replied as she bowed to his exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was out and the others were out of sight she bent down to you and picked your currently fragile body up. Unlike the evil human, she was tender in her touch and soothing to be around. She sat against the wall and took something out of her pocket. It was some king of herb and she applied it to what remained of your wounds. You growled slightly as she touched them but she continued and soon your growl was a purr as she made the previously injured spots painless. By the time she was done she found you purring and nuzzling into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello little one. I know you are young but is there a chance you can understand me?\u201d she asked as if hoping you could to make her job easier. You cocked you head in confusion as the strange words rang in your ears. \u201cThen this is going to be harder to accomplish than I thought. Unlike the other animals they have me train, you are the first with a mind. I know you will eventually be able to understand but even so. You should know that while we both are going to have to do some things we don\u2019t like, we are in it together.\u201d She said as she pet you and you moved into her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really understand yet what was going on but this human female was the first nice person that you met and you instantly felt a connection with her. The current events happened so fast that you adopted her as your mother to hopefully erase what your actual mother had done to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing Rose?\u201d asked a guard to which her head didn\u2019t move as she looked at you. She knew better than to react to anything anyone said, if for no other reason than to not show a connection to things that could be used against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d she asked in a clearly different tone as she was previously speaking to you. It was more ruthless and directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dragon his Lord Scar\u2019s, not yours. It looks to me like you are trying to make friends with it.\u201d He shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow I train him is none of your business you pathetic man. However, I do believe he is getting hungry and Lord Scar gave me full reign on who to feed to his new favorite pet, guards included.\u201d She sent back with a glare that indicated that she was considering him as the first candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just hold on there Rose. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Was just worried someone else would report you was all.\u201d he stuttered in clear fright as he rushed to make up a believable excuse then equally rushed out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my little Max. It looks like that while there are some downsides that there are some upsides as well.\u201d Rose said to which you licked her face as she nuzzled you back in a fashion that solidified her standing as your new mother, in your eyes anyway. You took in her scent and everything about her so that you would never be confused. You knew she wasn\u2019t a dragon so you had to make sure that you never mistook her for another human by mistake. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were moved shortly after arriving into a large and bare room that was inside Lord Scar\u2019s castle. He wanted a prize so he insisted on you being something both fierce and house trained. That and he had to keep his prize a secret from the prying eyes of outsiders and more importantly other dragons. The room was huge with a thousand square feet of dirt ground and was furnished with trees and some other things to make an eventually full grown dragon feel at home. The habitat was self sufficient in that way and the sun that fed the plants also helped you. Even if it was a magically made sun it still helped. Rose was there constantly as she was in charge of you and everything you did. At first you were curious on why she fed you human meat every day but as your mother you didn\u2019t complain and it was rather delicious. After two weeks you were near a large dog size and far less skittish than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how is my prize doing today?\u201d asked Lord Scar as he came in for the first time since he kicked you against the wall. You growled at him and was ready to pounce but as soon as Rose pointed down you sat straight up as if nothing was wrong. One of the \u2018tricks\u2019 she taught you to control your behavior. She rewarded you with a pat on the head. \u201cHe seems to like you more than his master.\u201d He accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly for the moments my lord. I believe he has imprinted me as his mother and you as his father. Dragon father figures tend to be more aggressive and so his instincts are guiding his actions. I do believe that this is an excellent starting point to establish an effective base for ensure his obedience. The love of a mother and the rule of a father, my lord.\u201d She reported, sensing that he was close to replacing her so he would higher on your list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is\u2026 interesting my Rose. I was beginning to feel that he would take your orders over mine?\u201d he asked but more as a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not my lord.\u201d Rose replied with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, then he won\u2019t mind a treat from his master.\u201d He said as he snapped his fingers to which a young man was brought out. He was naked, beat up, and scared from torture. His walk was barely anything more than a husk\u2019s walk with nothing on the inside as he walked forward then stopped to a guard\u2019s prod then waited. \u201cWell, eat.\u201d He commanded as he looked at the dragon then at Rose, again with not a very good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order to ensure obedience he only eats on command my lord.\u201d She stated then whispered the command into his ear. At this point you could understand her quite a bit and she knew it. His eyes sparkled at the idea and information as she gave you a reluctant wink to tell you to do what he said. While it was true that she had a specific word to tell you to feed, in order to ensure you ate what she was providing and not those that brought in your\u2026 meals, but you didn\u2019t need it as you followed what she said without question. This wouldn\u2019t be the first human you had torn apart and you both new it wouldn\u2019t be your last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a brilliant idea my fair Rose. FEED!\u201d he commanded and with Rose\u2019s previous instinctive wink and your overhearing and comprehension of the situation, you immediately sprung toward your new meal and tackled him to the ground. You were by no means as ruthless as it looked and didn\u2019t enjoy making your meals suffer so you latched onto his throat while still in the air and tore it out. You knew the impulsive man wanted a show so you put one on for him as you ripped and tore your feast up, devouring it bones and all. After about 15 minutes of him being memorized by this you trotted over to a small water source and dragon, cleaning your mouth out of blood as well as your jaws, knowing that Rose wouldn\u2019t go near them if they were still covered. You sat in a similar position as before as you licked your chops and waited for Rose or\u2026 him for their next command. Usually when you ate she comforted you and soothed your belly with a rub but you knew that would have to wait while\u2026 HE was here. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something so beautiful in my life. Rose, keep up the good work.\u201d He said as he rushed out of the room and you could smell the distinctive scent of arousal from him, which almost infuriated you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Max.\u201d Rose said after the doors were shut and she was able to come to you. She said this after every human meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t mind eating humans but you did if she had a problem with it. However, you knew by this point that she was bound by something and how you acted. But you already made up your mind. If that fat bastard ever told you to eat her. You would first only do so if she told you, and if she didn\u2019t\u2026 oh how you would be gorged on 400 lbs of fat. You would defiantly kill him before her and, if you had a choice, before anyone else. Despite her words he was not your father but knew what she meant and your roll in her safety. You nuzzled her face a little and whined to her tears then lightly licked them of her face before they got too far. She smiled at the soft muscle against her face. She knew it was the same one that just lapped up a man\u2019s blood and reseeded behind the same set of teeth that took a man\u2019s life and consumed him. But she completely trusted you and as your mother the feeling was mutual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you my little Max\u201d came her typical saying as she hugged your neck and body to which you draped your head down and across to hug her back. You wondered if she would still call you that when you got even bigger. \u201cOk, let\u2019s get that belly of yours comfortable.\u201d She suggested and you licked her as she got up and trotted over to a soft spot far away from your usual feeding spot. This place was thick and soft with moss and dirt but not enough dirt showing to dirty her clothes or persona. It was just a soft and gentle place where she could rub your stomach and encourage the digestion process. This usually continued until you were in a deep sleep and probably well after but as you were asleep you could say for sure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However your growth didn\u2019t stop and in 3 months time you were a little larger than a horse. As far as your body was concerned and your head toward over Rose at near 10 feet tall and a tail that was proportionally long for a dragon of that size. However she still called your \u2018my little Max\u2019, similar to how she would her own child, which as far as you were concerned you were her child. By now she knew you could fully understand her and she knew you could probably learn to speak. However she needed excuses to tell Lord Scar when he came why she needed more time with you. Either way you were stuck with normal dragon type grunting, growling, snarling, and other body motions to communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you want to fly but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let his prized pet out.\u201d Rose said as she pat you on the neck. You had been flexing your wings then flapping them strong enough to knock her over at times in hopes of being able to fly. But she was right and both of you knew it. There was no way he would let you out and he would probably discipline you both if he did and you didn\u2019t know how to fly. Luckily you got a few hours in when you were smaller but you still longed to go soaring in the sky that you only saw maybe twice in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and placed your head back on her lap as she leaned against your body. Lord Scar had ordered he to live with you and pretty much be with you 24/7 so she was. Not that it was a strain on either of you besides getting out for her. Unlike you, she could go outside and get a breath of fresh air. She also had other related tasked to do but this position was the one you two used the most to fall asleep. Your head was like a blanket while your body kept her warm and hidden from the occasional guard that came through your room. While they may have tried and failed a few times to take advantage of her before, they were nowhere near as stupid to do so while you were with her and pretty much on top of her already but not in the fashion they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. Max, someday we\u2019ll be out of this place and you\u2019ll never have to see or hear your master again. Heck, don\u2019t tell him this but he is one guy I wouldn\u2019t mind you taking a bite of on our way out.\u201d She almost whispered to you to which you huffed an affirmative as she stroked your muzzle. No one except you would be able to tell that she wanted out that badly. Well, no one actually liked Lord Scar but they liked money more than their desire to be free and they got a lot of money for staying around him. But once you were in his dept you never got out. \u201cYou know Max, as much as I hate the idea of you eating people, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get sick of this sound.\u201d She said as she leaned her head back on your body to which she could hear your stomach gurgle with the day\u2019s contents digesting away inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she liked it and she knew that you knew. She also knew that was why you sometimes took the extra effort to swallow things whole.  For one there was less cleanup and for another they tended to last longer if they were still alive and wiggling around. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only time she moved that fast in relation to a noise was when Lord Scar was coming in or calling. She was already on thin enough ice the way it was and she was the more secure people in his employ. You also got up and ducked into the growing brush that was near to the feeding area as she ran over to the edge and stood waiting the heavy, thick, and steal door to open. It was quite obvious when Lord Scar came in as he used this large door to further raise his status in even his entrance to a room. The guards and others used the normal doors. Thankfully the large door took a few minutes to open completely and allow entry. So you and Rose had a few minutes to get ready for him. You hardly had to do much except be unseen or awaiting his arrival. She on the other hand had to ready and looking to attractive for him to get rid of. This also made her exercise and keep her body in top shape. She had more than seen what happens to women like her who lost their attractiveness, they get fed to you or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, my dearest Rose.\u201d Said the bald and intrusive, not to mention disgusting, man. He was walking in with a crowd of almost 15 people at his heel. They still looked like they were walking on egg shells but they also had one more thing in common, that was their attire. They all looked just like him in stature and dress. Most weren\u2019t as physically disgusting as he was but were equally or more sadistic and callous looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, My Lord, where is this prize you boasted about?\u201d Asked one of the more stuffed up looking humans following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good question.\u201d Lord Scar said and looked his usual offended look to Rose to which you knew to mean she only had a few seconds to explain herself and compliment him to regain his waning and temperamental favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lord. He is practicing his latest accomplishment. He has been practicing his stalking. He has become accustomed to training to his meal\u2019s expense and is quite accomplished in taking them down either without them knowing or scaring them almost to death. He has also been accustomed to your most generous gifts so he is excited for such things but wishes to impress you. He will do as you command, as always.\u201d She replied with a bow and a presentation that both complimented him, and worked on his bloated and sadistic imagination. It also told you that you were to follow his orders. You did were already an expert at stalking. But you understood that her saying it like she did made it sound like she trained you to this extent and thereby further put value on her position and status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what I like to hear my dearest Rose.\u201d He said, as he was next to her now and grabbed her but with a firm squeeze then moved on as if he wasn\u2019t really concentrated on her but still indulged in his right to sexually harass her. Once again she put on a sensually appeasing face to keep his mind working. For such a profitable business man, his mind wasn\u2019t that hard for her to control. \u201cMiss reporter. You seemed to be the most skeptical about my claim to have a dragon at my command. Why don\u2019t you walk with Rose here and see for yourself. You will be a most excellent gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d The woman said as she stuck her nose up to much for her to see Lord Scar whisper something in Rose\u2019s ear as he grasped her breast in a  one armed and sideways hug. You could hear Rose\u2019s heartbeat sink but her expression showed the opposite as she seemed delighted, on the outside, to what he suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way Ma\u2019am.\u201d Rose said as she gestured for her to follow her to your normal feeding spot. It was a good thing that she kept it clean, as the sight of fountains of blood would\u2019ve gave it away. \u201cIf you wait right here, he will be around to\u2026 greet you in a moment.\u201d Rose finished then walked to join Lord Scar, fully knowing that another round of groping would ensue but more importantly it gave you an understanding what was going to happen. The woman was smack in the middle of your feeding area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFEED!\u201d Lord Scar commanded but nothing happened. To which he squeezed the breast he was holding a little harder than was necessary in his sudden anger to why his \u2018prize\u2019 wasn\u2019t doing as commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so this is the mighty dragon you so prized in.\u201d Said the reporter as she laughed at him that only got him to squeeze harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplain this at once.\u201d He whispered so that is guests didn\u2019t think he was not in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsh\u2026 He has learned that you like a show My Lord, so he is giving you one. He only wishes to impress you as his master.\u201d She said in a teasing tone that enticed him back to his normal state and to lighten his grip on her now probably bruised or at the very least sore breast. But she wisely didn\u2019t complain about it or even do so much as a wince. He began to smile as he saw you stalk out of the bushes in her blind spot as she looked back at the crowd of people. They, unlike the ignorant reporter, knew not to anger or even slightly insult Lord Scar. If he didn\u2019t really have a dragon than he sure as hell had a few lions or other ravenous beasts to feed them to. But now they looked on as you crept so silently that the arrogant and ignorant reporter was boasting about her safety and the lack of dragon despite you gaining on her form. She continued to do so as you got closer and closer. You were making sure that you were moving in a way they, and more specifically Lord Scar, would greatly enjoy and probably whack of later about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI come here to report on this prize of Lord Scar\u2019s collection and I have yet to see anything of\u2026\u201d She continued but was stopped as some of your drool dripped on her shoulder from your now open mouth above and slightly behind her. She looked at the substance and draped a finger through it then saw another drip and followed the saliva string up and back as your jaws were had just stretched to their maximum to accept her. At the peak of the moment/show you thrust your jaws down just as she let out a ear splitting scream you knew he loved before her head and shoulders were lodged in your jaws up to her upper chest so her arms couldn\u2019t do much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing your teeth as your sank only slightly so some of her blood was tinting the otherwise bland taste of her clothes. But you didn\u2019t puncture too much as to even come close to major harm. Her scream could be heard as you snapped at her form and swallowed in a well practice motion. They all watched as the struggling lower body was forced up into the air and down your throat with blood barely but present on your teeth at times until she was sliding into your gut and with your licking your chops to Lord Scar\u2019s delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expected it to be more\u2026 painful.\u201d Lord Scar said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is his other gift to you My Lord.\u201d Rose said as she motioned for you to come over as she told you to expose your slightly distorted stomach. \u201cCan you see and hear it My Lord?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh! Get me out of here. It\u2019s burning and I can\u2019t move. Please, someone help!\u201d came the sound of the woman from the inside projecting to the outside as you leaked some stomach acid in, just enough to get her moving and audible. You weren\u2019t about to have a sensation that would normally last a few hours be done in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d Lord Scar asked with more excitement than you had ever seen on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, My Lord. He is slowly digesting her. He has found it particularly pleasing to feel his meals wiggle while fighting a fruitless battle to survive his digestive system. It usually lasts at least a few hours. Sometimes he can get them fighting and pleading for a whole day before his stomach acids render them unconscious from the intense pain they feel. Even at that point they can still feel it as his stomach digests them, Very Slowly.\u201d She said, again in a way that would entice him and it looked like it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again, my dear Rose, you\u2019ve outdone yourself.\u201d He complimented then went right next your wiggling stomach. \u201cYou hear that? You are going to be in immense pain until my pet\u2019s stomach is done with you\u2026 have fun in hell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he stayed around for little bit then left satisfied with you and Rose. Rose accompanied you to your bed and laid against your stomach as it digested but while she like the sounds of digestion, she didn\u2019t like her sounds of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please end it so we can get some sleep?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d came a voice as she screamed in pain but only for a second as you digest her to the point of unconsciousness then allowed your stomach noises to lull you both asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk, this is going to be a secret, you understand?\u201d Rose asked to which you nodded. She was strangely serious for a moment and you always obeyed her as your Mother. \u201cI know you can hear and understand me, but I am quite frankly tired of one way conversations. So, I am going to teach you to speak. But you can only speak to me. If Lord Scar even assumes I\u2019ve been doing this than he will force feed me to you himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got you to take this more seriously. Yes you wanted to learn to speak. But not if it made your Mother lose her life. Even worse, you knew Lord Scar had ways of forcing you to do things. You would be damned before you would put your Mother in danger like that so you concentrated hard for a few weeks. You soon found that while you knew the language, speaking it was not as easy as you thought it would be. Your deceptively long tongue got in the way or your normal dragon speech would say things instead of the human speech. On top of that you were still growing. Not much but now you were near elephant size, well your torso was at least. It was kind of pointless to measure your tail, neck and head as they would constantly change. But now you could nearly fit a whole human inside your mouth. Now just the legs were sticking out just above the knees. With your growing vocabulary of verbal words you were able to speak with your Mother but didn\u2019t know that word for a while. It was necessary but it did come up eventually and it took a while to figure out the right usage. But now you knew the human word to go with the status Rose had over you. You didn\u2019t speak very loud to avoid any listening people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, lunch time.\u201d Rose called as she brought in two humans tied together with rope. She had long been desensitized to both you eating people and your preferences in such. You didn\u2019t like clothes so she had them prepared without them as much as she could. At first she\u2019d blush of look away from a guy\u2019s\u2026 tools or a woman\u2019s parts for a bunch of reasons. But now she was just used to it. That and your growing body needed more food which meant more people to be eaten. Most of them were almost brain dead already from being in a prison or torture room. But this time it looked like both had their minds very much intact. As the guards secured the rope to the waist high pole in your main feeding area you saw them both. One was a young woman, perhaps one that had angered Lord Scar or wasn\u2019t useful to him anymore. The other looked to be a well built but sadistic looking man. But the one thing they both had in common other than being nude as their fear of their situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell. What did I do to deserve this?\u201d asked the man as he looked into the relatively fake jungle around him for his future death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must\u2019ve done something.\u201d Rose said. While she didn\u2019t get to know your food she wasn\u2019t heartless either. She more than made an attempt to save them any pain or make their last moments at least partially pleasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d He snapped at her viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that it takes a lot of but kissing and work to keep my living and useful status. Lord Scar isn\u2019t one to tolerate anything less. Heck, even more than useful people to him have been fed to his pet here. Now that I\u2019ve answered you question I would strongly suggest you not insult me again. Max, the dragon, doesn\u2019t like it very much.\u201d Rose responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I care? I\u2019m going to the same place no matter what I do. Might as well end it on my terms you selfish, slutty, kiss ass, piece of\u2026\u201d he continued for a while till Rose gave up and sat on a log waiting for you to arrive. She knew you were stalking them and would usually eat the girl first. You didn\u2019t want their last moments being plunged into a soup of blood and guts as they digested away in your stomach. But when someone was like this, you would rid the area of such talk quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crept as close as you could to them and waited for the man\u2019s back to turn before rushing out and slashed the rope that held them. This got the man to run right into your snout. He didn\u2019t notice until your snout started rumbling as his hands pushed against it to get back firmly to his feet. The rumble was you growling at him. He backed away slowly from you but you stalked him into the woods until he tripped and tried to run. But you caught him by the foot in your jaws. He yelled and cursed as you drug him toward you. Then you stood up and flicked him up so he was airborne and heading straight for your jaws. Your aim was perfect as he was sent to your gut almost before you could snap your jaws closed. With a lick of your chops you turned to the girl, who had her head buried in her hands as she coward on the ground. Perhaps hopping that if she couldn\u2019t see you than you wouldn\u2019t be able to find her. You started the digestion so the man was receiving a painful punishment for ripping on your Mother like that. But luckily the painful exclamations didn\u2019t make it out of your thicker stomach walls for others to hear, unless they put their ear to it. You slowly and quietly moved toward the other and got a look from your Mother. You knew it as a \u2018be nice\u2019 look. You were intending to anyway but either way it got you to nuzzle the young woman in the back like a dog might with an immobile plaything or hand that would preferred be petting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO AWAY!\u201d screamed the girl. The sudden words and volume got you to cringe back. Here you were trying to be nice to her and she was just screaming at you. Sometimes humans made no sense to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not very nice young lady. I do believe Max is trying to be nice. If he doesn\u2019t eat you than not only does he get punished but I do as well and you get eaten by an angry and starving lion or something like that. At least he is giving you a more pleasant option.\u201d Rose defended for you. You knew how to speak well enough by this point but not enough to comfort a distraught young woman. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young woman wept for a while before hazarding a look up. She stared at your new position behind your Mother and your head down near the log so she could lovingly pet your head while they waited. She was still shivering at the sight of you and/or her relation to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much time as you need,\" your Mother said soothingly. \"Lord Scar won't be back from his trip until the full moon and any guards know better than to bother him during feeding time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't do anything. C-Can't you talk to... t-them?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry my dear. I've tried before. I even suggested that someone be a week long meal. As grewsome as that sounds, Lord Scar still didn't agree to it. The most I can do is help this be as pleasant as possible for you.\" Rose answered to which the woman buried her head in her hands and tried to weep again, but was all out of tears, or so it seemed. \"How about we change subjects and just talk for a little while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok, he won't try to rip me in half of something?\" She agreed then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you start being civil. You do know that dragons have minds even smarter than a human's right? He understands just fine. Lord Scar might have a blind eye towards it but we know what it means. Even if he can't talk in a way you can understand, yet, he can sure as hell understand us, right?\" Rose asked you, to which you rumbled an affirmative then nuzzled her a little before soaking up her petting you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, if it's ok, can I touch him? At least a while from the outside before I have to go inside?\" she asked, still not moving from her terror ridden position as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I think he would like that. He doesn't want to harm you. Even if he finds us delicious, he is far too kind to wish harm on someone as innocent as you. But we don't all get what we want. I'm guessing you know that better than most. We know it isn't fair, but it can be pleasant and even enjoyable, if you let us take care of you.\" Rose answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thought about it for a while. Then finally forced herself to her feet to face the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it is all the help I am going to get. If you... two, are being pleasant and thoughtful, than I should be as well.\" She concluded than made her first step toward you. The trip was agonizingly long, but eventually she was sitting on the same log but opposite side of your head. She rose her hand and touched you. It took some silent convincing before she moved her hand and started to pet you like Rose was. \"He's so warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he is.\" Rose agreed with a smile. You took the innitiative and nuzzled into her hand and body a little. She froze when you moved, at first, but calmed as she realized what you were doing. Her body was also warm as she didn't have any clothes to get in the way of her skin or the scent that was teasing you. The two of them talked about meaningless girl stuff. Things that had no real meaning other than social interaction and keeping her mind off her impending fate. But that was interupted as your stomach growled a complaint at being empty once again. Both woman looked at it, at you, then at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that is my call.\" The woman stated as she got up and stood in front of you. Rose got up and gave her a hug before stepping away slightly. She didn't need to worry about blood splatter when you were eating like this, or fighting. You gave a whine and nuzzled her hand again, as if asking for her to stay longer. This action seemed to bring a smile to her face, as if confirming that you didn't actually wanted to eat her despite her delightful taste, that Rose had explained to her indirectly in their conversation. \"Awe, I'll miss you to. You be good and obey your Mother. And when the two of you finally do get out of here... make sure that fat tub of lard we call 'Master' gets a not nice visit to your belly. But don't you dare digest him into your body. I don't want to be stuck being a part of a wonderful dragon with the knowledge that he is to. ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I PROMISE\" you said with a heavy dragon accent but not enough to not be understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a wonderful voice.\" she complimented as your snout came up to her face to which you gave her a small emotional lick to her check. \"Ok, take me before I loose my nerve and say something stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll make it as pleasurable as possible and not digest you till you can't feel it.\" Rose informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she replied with a smile to her then to you as you rose up more and she gazed up and into your opening jaws. \"Wait, let me go in by my own power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never eaten anyone like her before. They all at least needed you to seal the deal. They could never feed themselves to you. The fact that she was doing so without suicidal mind in play hit you with a large pang of guilt. You didn't even know what the emotion was at this point but you now HATED Lord Scar for this even more. But you couldn't let that take away from this Woman's final act of kindness and selflessness. So you lowered your head and reopened your jaws in front of her till they were sore at the gap she now looked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, the woman grabbed your top jaw and put her legs in first. She carefully swung and placed herself on your tongue, but her head and shoulders were still out of your mouth... or at least past your teeth. Your taste buds started to soak up her flavor and make you drool a little as she wiggled her tasty body on your tongue. You didn't dare move to taste her though. One wrong move and the part of her that was over your teeth could be shredded. When she stopped moving you started closing your jaws. You closed them just enough to make her snug and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His tongue is so soft, yet I have no doubt it could be unpleasant if he wanted it to. It makes his kind nature even more visible. Seeing my world through the jaws of a dragon. Call me crazy, but I can't think of a better way to go or a more pleasant last sight. I will forever be part of this magnicificent being. May both of you be free and at peace one day, for making me such in my last hours.\" The woman said then grabbed your teeth and pushed, sending her feet and calves into your throat and the rest of her body splashing onto your tongue just as your jaws shut and you started swallowing out of instinct. You couldn't help running your tongue around her as you pushed her back and let your throat take over. The last thing you felt of her in your mouth was her hugging your tongue before kissing it and letting your throat take the rest of her. But that wasn't the end of her. She worked on your stomach from the inside. It felt like she was giving it a massage from the inside. The feeling was different than the fighting you usually got. Maybe it was the emotion with this one, but this one felt better than the higher stimulation of a fighting meal. You would miss her and never forget that feeling... as well as your promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course you got bigger over the next year. By now, it took about 5 humans just to quell your appetite for a day. Sometimes, when Lord Scar couldn't afford to lose that many, he would send in a large animal in instead. This was appreciated, as it took the emotional edge off. But, for both your sake and your Mother, you acted like you didn't like the downgrade. That seamed to please Lord Scar. As if feeding you humans was now a treat instead of a main course. They stopped measuring you after you ate one of the servants that was overly rude and... touchy to Mother. But all they needed to know was that you were getting VERY big. Instead of a human just barely fitting in your jaws, now a full sized cow was the new measure. Your body was large enough to barely fit through the doors, if they ever were to let you out. Because of this, and a few unschedualed meals on your end that took some of Lord Scar's favorite servants, they made a new form of feeding method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst; your mother, Rose, was sealed in the room with you. Lord Scar thought it was a fitting punishment and a viable incentive to help her teach HIS pet better control over his urges. On the surface she was shocked and appologetic, but underneath and when alone with you she couldn't be happier. Sure she missed getting out into the fresh air, but she could handle it if you were there, and you had a similar feeling about her. The second part was more of a show now. They added a section above you with a small platform above your reach, or what they thought was your reach, and an opening in the wall. This opening had a plank of sorts that went out a few feet and was on a hinge. This is what they used to feed you now. It was just big enough to hold an elephant if needed. For they made it in the thought that you would need such large prey eventually. But the primary purpose was so that Lord Scar could hold events to watch you eat and feed his... unagreeable buisness partners to you as examples. As your head reached about 100 feet at this point, the plank was set to 300 feet, in the expectation that you would be growing, the cieling, with this new addition, being at 400 feet high. That was, you came to see, your way out. If they kept carving into the ceiling like that, eventually you could blast it open with your secret flame breath and escape. But it was still too thick, currently at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you and your Mother kept all your growing skills a secret; your growing speach, flame breath, convertable tail, intellegent mind, and most importantly your desire to escape with your Mother. As for the humans you were fed when Lord Scar wasn't there. You had to catch them in your jaws as they dropped. Sometimes you used the momentum to just gulp them down. If they were bad you could chew them apart. If they were good, you waited till you were alone with Mother and let them out for a while then ate them like the girl before, as comfortable and nicely as possible. But if you didn't catch them, they died from the fall. Another one of Lord Scar's ways of controlling HOW you ate. But, thankfully, he had much else to do and was only 'observing' once every month at best. Unless on holiday, then he was there every minute of every day, sometimes overstuffing you with victims and... satisfying himself as you ate. This made you hate him even more. Getting off on the innocent screams and terror of young people. You counted the days until you would make him suffer in your gut. At this point, your Mother totally agreed with it. In fact she suggested you keep him alive for a year in your gut, digesting him partially, healing him painfully, then repeating the process. But that was beyond the point right now. It looked like it was feeding time, and it was your 'special' meals that Lord Scar was giving to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lord Scar, I will do better. I can make you more money than you could dream of. I will be of use to you, I know it!\" pleeded an old man that you had seen in his group of observers from time to time. He was stripped of his clothes except his small undergarments. Lord Scar made the women be completely naked, for obvious reasons, but the men had a small cloth covering their privates. He had no desire to see a males... anatomy, but the blood from visible wounds he thoroughly enjoyed. Your mother tapped you on the leg. You looked at her and she gave a throat slash signal. That meant it was ok to get a little messy. She only did this with members she knew that were 'rotten'. Then she went off to a seating area she made, under the cover of some fake trees, so you knew where she was and didn't acctidentally harm her as you fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have no doubt about that. You served me well enough over the years. But, you committed the one crime that I will not forgive, ever. You stole my money!\" Lord Scar stated then pushed the man out onto the plank. The man stopped before he fell off and looked down for a second to see you circling below him, looking up, licking your chops, then circling again. It was a show you put on for them, so they were happy with Mother teaching it to you. Particularly when HE fed you. As if he was your favorite. The man snapped his attention back to Lord Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only gave that coin to the poor lad to improve your image in that sector. If you appear to give to the poor in that area, they will sell you their soul for more, like an addict would, just for one more. It would win you their support! Please, I have so much more planned to help grow your empire. Soon, the whole country will be yours, and you won't even have to life a finger. They will abandon on their own, to come where the money is.\" He explained quickly. He was good. He knew, like everyone else, that the one thing he loved more than his own pleasure and superority was MONEY. He played his emotions like a harp and it looked like he was considering it. But then you saw a beautiful young lady approached and hugged into his arm seductively. He turned and grabbed her and forcably started to make out with her, shameless in any advance he pleased before seperating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid my dearest here has a better... tongue, than you do.\" He joked to which she laughed with him. Her hair was a mess at this point and her clothes torn, showing one of her breasts that he had been manhandling. \"Will you do the honors dear. Then we can watch as my loyal pet feasts. That would be a good start to our time together would it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure, my Lord.\" She responded as she teased the man on the plank with her finger over the button. He looked down again, out of fear of what was to come, to see you pause than look up, visibly drooling for him, growling for your meal. Again, all for show, but he didn't know that. As he looked back to her pleadingly she seamed to climax as she pushed the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!!\" screamed the man as the plank fell and he was falling toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a will practiced move, you crouched then lunged as soon as he was in range, but not jumped. You didn't need them knowing you COULD reach the platform, if you wanted. With this lunge you snapped your jaws shut partially as you caught him with his head and one arm outside. Your teeth squewered him in well aimed places to maximize the blood splatter for HIS entertainment. You flicked him up once, as if to get a better grip. This time he was screaming in pain. You saw Lord Scar's eyes widen with this new trick, then your jaws snapped shut with the man inside. You made a few chewing motiongs with your lips raised so he could hear the man in your jaws squeal before swallowed him in segments. You looked up, as if asking for more, but only saw the raised legs of the woman beyong the observing barricade. If you didn't have any hold on your emotions, you would've leapt up and ate them both. But your time was not yet there. There was still much to wait for, and you trusted your mother to decide when the right time was. But it didn't make it any easier for you. Despite your love of the taste, you didn't like the thought of eating human innocents, sometimes children on occasion, just for his sadistic pleasure. Now that you thought on it, one year of torture in your belly would be a gift compared to what you wanted to do to him. But that was later and this was now. </span></div></div>",

Having sensed the presense of a human, as there was, in fact, a human man nearing you at that moment, you instinctually shifted back into into a form that resembled a human. <br>\r\nThe man hailed from a rare, self-sufficient kingdom that managed to stave off dragons, yet he also had an even rarer combination of curiosity, wisdom, and kindness. He, upon seeing what resembled an injured infant, dropped the supplies that he was carrying and rushed over to you. He gently picked up your unconscious and wounded body, and began examining you, too see how poor of a condition you were in, and whether you could be saved from your grievous wounds. It was to his great surprise, however, that upon ovening your eyelids and studying your eyes closely, that he gleamed a hint of your draconic nature in then. Being a kind man, albiet startled, he knew that he couldn't leave you, this strange human-like non-human, so he performed the only other option that he had: taking you with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years later, you were living with your father, just as you had always been. The kind man that had found you took you in, as his own. You had lived with him, worked with him, trained with him, and spent your life with him. He had kept no secrets from you, and you remained knowledgeable about how you were found, your abities, and much more, though some of this was due to the man's own interest in you. He had long held you as the most important part of his life, and longed for every moment that he spent teaching both himself and you about, well, you.<br>\r\nTogether you learned the extent of your abilities, and which abilities you were capable of using. Having the great jumble of knowledge that you did, there were many times that you attempted to use something far too powerful for you to handle. As such, you were left with relearning almost everything that you couldn't perform instinctually or easily. This may have been a good thing, as a younger, more impulsive you may just have attempted to take over the world, and easily succeded, had you have had full access to your potential.<br>\r\nOne of the powers that you both were most facinated with, however, was your ability to change form. You found that you could even change bits of your appearance, on occasion, should you attempt enough. Eventually, you perfected your draconic form to just how you liked it:</span></div></div>",

You have great, for your young size of 20 feet, webbed wings that are quite normal for a western dragon, such as yourself. Your many, shining scales reflect a great many colors, but the pigment that radiates most brilliantly is a shade of blue, not unlike the stone of your namesake.<br>\r\nYour gender, however, is something that you have had a much more difficult time deciding on, compared to the appearance that you have your heart set on. You've never had any preference for one or the other, and have found switching between the two much easier than something like changing the color of the scales all over your body. \"Besides,\" you figure, \"I'm still quite young, for a dragon. Why should I settle for one gender now, when I might desperately wish for the other later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from your struggle to achieve asthetic perfection, you have found yourself remaining in a male human form. You stay male, as it was the gender your father discovered you in, and consistant switching between the two would be both disconcerning as well as confusing. Besides, when you do become female, it allows for anonymity, which in turn allows you to do several other amusing things.<br>\r\nGenders aside, you have found yourself remaining in your human form, as you happen to reside in a kingdom that has remained seperate from dragons. As such, one of the peasants there suddenly becoming a dragon would be much more than simply a surprise. You would likely find yourself under attack from the same guards that are meant to protect the peasantry. At one point, the fear of this occuring became one of your predominant thoughts. You went around without looking anyone in the eye, out of the fear that someone might notice the slight difference in your pupils that distinguishes you from the rest of humanity. It wasn't long, however, before you realised that it would take not only the knowledge of this difference existing, but actual, lengthy study of your eyes to even catch a hint of your species. As such, your fears were quelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your fears about your species and the knowledge that came with it faded, you quickly found yourself wondering what you were to do with your excess of wisdom. You found yourself leaning between a simple learning, and mastering, of hunting - something that your dragon-self could partake in - the chivalrous actions of swordplay - something that would open paths to gallantry and heroism - and the vast world of magic - the likes of which composes a significant portion of your knowledge.<br>\r\nAll three paths held drawbacks, however. Should you decide to hunt, you held the chance of poaching the wrong beasts and getting caught as a dragon. Should you take up a sword, you may find yourself too weak to even hold it properly. Should you fancy yourself a magician, you run the risks of being an outcast, and accidentaly casting spells that you know of but cannot handle. It was a decision that you had to think long and hard on.</span></div></div>",

Had you chosen to just ignore all of the knowledge that you had been born with, it would have probably driven you crazy with both temptation and curiosity.<br>\r\nFortunately for you, however, is that you had just chosen to invest time in furthering your magical skills.

Today, you intend to make use of your potential and find yourself a proper mentor. You have known magic your entire life and have even bothered to spend the time to gain control over a few minor spells, but the knowledge you hold tells you that you are capable of so much more. With this in your mind, you grasp the shoulder of the only soul who, thus far, has truly cared about and for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged man with the appearance and demeanor of someone much older and wiser awoke with a start. Abruptly sitting up in bed, his arm immediately latches onto yours, holding tightly, as his eyes search the room frantically. After a short moment, the terror leaves his deep, blue eyes, and his grip loosens. He clasps your hand with his own free one, he exhales in a long sigh, calming himself. You assume that he had awoken from yet another occurance of a particularly common nightmare of his, in which he gets skewered by some sharp projectile, be it a spear or a thrown dagger. Whichever of these it might be, you figure that it was to your advantage that you had taken him out of said particularly stressful situation, given what you were about to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found this unecessary, however, as his face seems to even light up when you confide in your goal of furthering yourself in wizardry. He simply retorts, \"We were born with a brain in each of our heads instead of rocks for a reason. It just so happens that you've gotten stuck with an exceptional one, and it is far past time that you use it.\"<br>\r\nHis words struck you hard, and almost like being stricken in the chest literally, you found yourself struggling to breathe. With liquid now streaming down your face, you gave your father-figure a hug to trump all hugs, thanking him. Soon, you clad yourself in travel gear rather than tears, and found yourself traveling with a strange, new longing for the home you had not yet left. With a few crucial belongings in tow, you left your long time residence, knowing that it would be a great day indeed when you made your return.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to be able to spend your time training and learning, not looking for someone to train and teach you. As such, you began displaying what skill you did have in performance-like situations. You helped a pet out of a tree in a fanciful display of levitation, with a few harmless shimmers and sparks added in. When asked to light a small fire, you lit a huge, yet contained, one without any fuel. You certainly attracted quite a bit of attention, and for a while you considered hosting an actual show to entertain folks, while also bringing in some revenue to buy your way into an apprenticeship. You decided against this, however, as you were afraid that people would shift from thinking you as an impressive rookie, to a shallow conjuror of cheap tricks. Heck, you were already running a significant risk of that with what you were already doing, and began having second thoughts about luring invitations to yourself rather than seeking out a mentor. You figured that even if you managed to attract some wizard, he might only wish for you to entertain him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese fears proved to be at least partially for naught. Apparently, you managed to impress the right person at the right time, as within a month of your partial-performances a courier addressed you, with a message directly from the royal court. It instructed you to show up with rather oddly specufic directions as to when and where, down to the second and inch, for an apprenticeship. While said instructions were slightly discomforting, more-so than this was the idea of who exactly was summoning you, as the message stated that it was from simply the royal palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what you, and just about everyone else, knows about the palace is that it is ruled by the fledgling king Stephen the First. Unlike most arrogant kings of this age, Stephen understood his newness and thus hired the three men that he considered wisest for him to consult with. Them actually being the wisest is something much debated over, however, as the three are quite different from what most people would consider wise, atleast from the rumors about them. The disconcerning part about this situation was that all three were dabblers in magic, and the chances are that one of them requested your presense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the three is likely the only one that could be considered wise, due to his age, though it would seem that he never acts like it. Merlan(No relation to any wizards of legend) seems to be quite hot-headed, even going so far as insulting his employer during their frequent arguments. Outwardly, he would generally seem to actually be quite wise, judging from how he positions himself, and the discerning look that the goggles he alwats wears gives him only adds to that.<br>\r\nThe second of the advisers goes by Jade O'Conner, and he dons a rather peculiar garb the likes of which's color matches the stone of his first name's namesake. His long, light brown hair in addition to his dress-like clothing has gotten him mistaken for a female on more than one occasion. Garments aside, Jade wouldn't be one that you would quite consider wise, due to his relatively young age. His remarkably expansive intelligence and his unsettlingly calm and cold manner of acting would contradict this, however.<br>\r\nThe last advisor, Henry Pluss, has the direct opposite attitude, however. While Jade's calm aura cracks quite often to give way to the occasional quip or witticism, Henry's consistent smile is said to never leave his face. He is arguably the strangest of the group, bearing an attitude of joy in any situation. He also remains the youngest of the group, though one wouldn't guess it from his pure, white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of these wished for you, however, was something you would have to find out when you got there.</span></div></div>",

First of all, even showing up placed you in at a great risk. A person with a dangerous secret really ought not to go placing themselves anywhere near the three wisest and most likely people to figure it out. But, it really wasn't like you had a choice in the matter, as denying a request from royalty would probably be even more dangerous fou you, given the amount of suspicion it would place on you.<br>\r\nSecondly, you were nervous about the exceptionally convoluted instructions that were delivered to you: \"Arrive and stand six yards, two inches, nine centimeters, and three feet away from the southernmost rosebush along the castle at thirty-six seconds past noon a week from two days before this was written.\"<br>\r\nLastly, you knew that you were well past the time that you were asked to arrive. It really wasn't your fault, given that you had gotten the letter three days after it was written while you were on the very outskirts of the kingdom. It was actually a feat within itself that you managed to make the trip back to the center of the kingdom in just over two days when it took one of the fastest messengers more than three. Never-the-less, you were late, and unsure of yourself and your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, was what you realized upon your arrival. Upon reaching the castle's southern wall, you noticed a straight line of rosebushes, running east to west, directly alongside of it. As such, you felt forced to figure out exactly which bush was the southernmost, and where exactly you were supposed to stand away from it, making you even later than you already were. Eventually, you pick out a spot to stand, and simply wait there for a good while, all the while wondering whether you were in tne right spot, of if you just showed up too late.<br>\r\nAfter a but longer, you sigh in defeat, and walk over to the eastern side of the castle where the entrance is. The two guards in front of it, whom you had noticed glancing at you consistently while you were shuffling around earlier, glance at each other for a moment with smug grins on their faces before turning to you. You explain your situation to them, and even show them the letter that you had received, before they stand apart and permit your entry inside. You're certain that you heard quite a bit of snickering as you walked inside, though....</span></div></div>",

You hadn't even been in there long enough to finish the thought you had about where in the world you were supposed to head from where you were when you spot someone else in the hall. Someone who happened to be coming at a speedily pace directly towards you, with a facial expression, and a flushed face, that told you that he was in a mood even worse than yours. From a distance, you first questing why in the world he was wearing a robe as dirty as his was in a place like this before you realized that it simply looked that way normally, which, apperantly, makes it look normally filthy.<br>\r\nThe next thing that grabs your attention, though snatched would be a better word, was the stave that the man was using as a walking stick. Without it, at the speed that he was moving, you figure that he would trip over himself. More interesting, however, is the staff itself. The thing appears to be intricately carved, even having a 'p' shape, handle-like decoration on each end. It's condition can only be described as poor, though. It has what appears to be dents covering it, as if from repeated bludgeoning. It seems to be so worn down that the center of it is actually visibly thinner than it's ends. There's even a clear crack running around it near it's center. It is quite an interesting object for anyone to be carrying around. So interesting, that it holds your attention enough for you to not notice the blue goggles and chest-long beard adorning the man's face until he's virtually in yours, less than a foot away and glaring at you.<br>\r\nHe begins talking, in a loud, boisterous voice that only slightly matches his appearance. \"I was asked to bring you here. I did. I was asked to prepare a welcome for you. I did. I was asked to perform it for you myself, and I set it up, and waited. I did, I did! But you, you just manage to mess it up.\" Before you can open your mouth and say more than a few startled stutters in your defense, he somehow manages to manuver himself to directly behind you, his hands on your back, shoving you down the hall into one of the rooms adjoined to it. He moves you into a position next to a window through which you can see a fairly pretty field. The one you were meandering about in earlier, you realize. Before you get to think about this further, the man, who you now, suddenly, notice bears the features of Merlan(no relation to any wizards of legend), raises one of his arms up to the window, pointing out of it. He says, then shouts, \"See? SEE?!\" all while shaking not just his finger, but his hand, as if for emphasis. As if on cue, a butterfly previously flitting around spontaneously bursts into flames. And sparks. Many sparks. It would actually be quite pretty, were it not coming from a combusted butterfly. It's then that you divert your attention to the grass, if only for the fire, due to the excess of sparks, that was starting there. You notice that a rather significant portion of the grass isn't grass. It's dirt, void of plants, forming a circle with a bit more missing within it in the shape of some foreign symbol. You groan inwardly, quite painfully, atleast to your pride. It's a glyph. Something you should have noticed much earlier. You snap out of this when you remember the fate of the butterfly, and begin to ponder the implications of this, You are snapped out of this, as well, by a flash of light behind you, and the sudden appearance of a previously white and clean, black, and soot covered, butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, knowing that it wasn't your demise that was being prepared for, when Merlan sighs as well, apparently calming down, if only somewhat. He moves you, less forcefully, out of the room, and points down the hall before giving you one last shove. \"The one who wants you is right down there. Go.\"<br>\r\nYou, however, turn to face him. \"But, which one is it? Jade O'Conner or Henry Pluss?\"<br>\r\n\"It's Pluze.\" he snaps back at you.<br>\r\n\"Oh? Henry it is, then.\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" he snaps again, \"His name is Pluze. With a 'z' and an 'e'. You did it wrong.\"<br>\r\nYou reply, \"But, isn't that how I pronounced it?\"<br>\r\nHe nods, before turning and walking away, leaning on his stick, again. \"Yes, but not how you spelled it.\"<br>\r\nYou tilt your head and squint your eyes in confusion before giving up, and turning towards the door down the hall, and towards the actual answer.</span></div></div>",

At first, you can't help but wonder who exactly really is behind this last door, especially since one of the possibilities has now been eliminated. Then, you are sudden onset with relief that Merlan(still no relation to any wizards of legend) was now, for certain, not the one you would be apprenticing for. Certainly, not dealing with his attitude was a plus, but there was more to it than that. The way you figure, Merlan put you in far more danger of being discovered. Him being as up close and personal as he is, as you just experienced, he was bound to notice some difference in you that gives you away eventually, and with his attitude, you would be turned in within minutes. Jade would likely find out as well, but you would probably hold too much interest to him for him to turn you in and let you be removed from where he could observe you.<br>\r\nAs for Henry, you guess that he would be far too lackadaisical to find out in the first place. And, as it turns out, that will be put to the test. Having reached the hall, you open the doors and step inside the chamber beyond them, only to be standing face to face with the biggest smile you have ever seen. Er... someone wearing the biggest smile you have ever seen, that is. It really is the best grin that you have come across, and it seems to be simply plastered across his face, seemingly taking up far more room than it should. It even seems to push his other features out of the way, what with how his eyes are squinted, almost to the extent of being closed. Though, even with so little of his eyes available for you to see, even those seem to be smiling towards you.<br>\r\nAside from his face, the young man is wearing what, at first, and second, glance, appears to be a robe several sizes too big, with it's sleeves going far past where his arms end. The rest of it, however, seems to be tailored to his body perfectly, with the bottom only just above dragging on the floor and the body of it snugly matching his body. It's color is, aside from a few lines and symbols for asthetic purposes, is completely white. The pale color of the robe pales in paleness in comparison with the man's pale hair. He wears his hair rather freely, with a few strands going this way and that, but it lays flat in a bowl cut, for the most part. Its color is almost indescribable, as it would seem it be past bleached, with the most pure, white color you had ever seen. At first, you ponder how he created such a dye, before realizing that it wasn't dyed at all, but was his natural hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts are suddenly interupted when he turns and notices you, spreading his smile seemingly even larger, if that was posdible in the first place, before him practically yelling out to you, \"Hiya! Nice ta meet 'cha!\" You stand, still in the doorway, with your mouth slightly agape, surprised at Henry Pluze, despite the rumors preparing you for him. Before you get a chance to recover and say anything in response, he practically skips over to you before continuing, \"I'm Henry! I'm glad to see that you've gotten here about on time and hopefully without any trouble. That is, assuming you are who I think you are. OOH! Or, if you're someone who killed the person that I think you are and stole their place! Nya ha! That sure would be an interesting turn of events.\"<br>\r\nYou quickly manage to regain atleast a piece your composure upon being called an imposter and muster up a reply. \"N-no, sir. I'm Opal, here responding to a letter that I received about a potential apprenticeship, and was told upon arriving that you were the one to see about that.\"<br>\r\n\"Nya ha ha! You're right about that. I figured that I may as well get an apprentice, bucause why not? All of the cool wizards are doing it! And you, from what I've heard, are just good enough, and flashy enough, to fill the spot. Interested?\" Upon asking this, his smile lessens for the first time, looking much more like a normal face, but still never leaving his.<br>\r\nBesides taking note of this, you immediately respond, \"Certainly! Yes, please. Just tell me what I need to do.\"<br>\r\nHis smile pops right back onto his face. \"Great! And what you need is a weapon to channel your magic through properly.\" He turns around, rolls one of his rediculously long sleeves up to his shoulder, seemingly only so he can hold his arm up and wave a finger around while he explains. \"Every half-decent wizard, or mage, or any spell-caster has something to channel through. Merlan uses his 'ultimate staff' as he calls it, while Jade has a preference for polearms and spears. Given your current build, you'll want a really bulky weapon, like say, a tree trunk! Or, atleast a thick quarterstaff. You see, given the fact that you're sure to grow, you'll be better off with something you can grow into than something you're comfortable with now. You wouldn't want to be waving around a toothpick once you get all bulky, would you? Heh heh.\"<br>\r\nYou decide on</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After consideration, you figure that Henry is right. As you intend to learn magic, you figure that it would be rather counterproductive to have to take time to learn how to adapt the stances that you 'remember'  for several different kinds of weapons to your body, given the time it would take. No, it would be better to get one kind of weapon, and one you can grow into, especially given the large span of time that you'll have to grow, given the rather long life-span of dragons.<br>\r\nSo, you follow Henry to a room with several weapons to choose from, while you're still thinking about which kind exactly you're going to choose. Given that it is right next to the gymnasium-like room that you were already in, it wasn't much of a walk. Henry throws the doors open, quite literally, as he sends them open forcefully with a blast of magic. Inside is an assortment of mostly organized weapons, with staves, bows, daggers, longswords, and shortswords all lined up on racks and shelves along and on the walls, respectively. The weapons not stored were just that, and remained littered upon the floor in an unorganized mess, though some appear to have even been shoved into a pile. It really takes away from the general feel of awe that the organized, ornate weapons would have given off, otherwise. Stepping inside, you begin shuffling through the room, careful not to injure yourself on the weapons on the floor. You disturb and replace several of the weapons on the wall, taking a a few thick staff, a couple of especially long longswords, and even try to pick up a greatsword that looked to be longer than you are tall.<br>\r\nYou step back and look over the room, sighing. Seconds away from asking for advice from Henry, a glinting handle, sticking out from the aforementioned pile, catches your attention. The handle itself looks rather ornate, too ornate to fit in with the rest of the weapons in the room. Yor move over to it and get a closer look at the blade as you slide it out of the pile. The handle has a ring made out of a gold-look-alike material around the top of it, with spikes pointing up from it. Were it not in a rectangle shape and leading up into a blade, you figure that it would resemble a crown. The blade itself is long and wide, obviously crafted to be used in two hands. Taking it out of it's sheath, you begin handling it. You're quite clumsy with it, given that you're brain is telling you to move it with arms much bigger than yours, but you manage to not look like a complete idiot in front of your new mentor with it. You take note that despite it's girth, the blade itself is surprisingly thin, along with two sided, symetrical, and engraved in symbols that you, surprisingly, don't even recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry, who has somehow managed to fall asleep while leaning against an empty spot on the wall, still with the same grin, wakes up upon your approaching him. \"Hm? Oh, that's the one you want? Heh, alrighty. Really won't be a big deal, in the long run. Given that magic will be your real weapon, what you've got there will be more of a means to an end. Chances are, you'll eventually find something that you work better with, but you won't want to continuously replace it, given how your weapons will get stronger the longer you use them, as they'll become more attuned to your magic the more magic that you channel through them... Waitaminute.\" He leans in forwards, and you would guess that he would be squinting at your weapon were his eyes not already performing that task. \"Isn't that... Yeah! It is! That's so cool! What you've got there is a sword that was made as both an alternative for and replica-ish sword for our own king. He sort of decided that he prefered his old one and didn't like how it was being copied, so he up and threw that one out. Wonder how it ended up here... Meh, who cares! You've got it now!\"<br>\r\nHe goes and skips, or, atleast you guess that it's skipping that he's doing under his robe, back into the large, open room that you came from. But, he then turns back around to you, and opens up his robe, reavealing an almost pitch black vest underneath it. The robe itself has several pockets inside of it, each of which containing a book of some sort. Given the bulky size and number of the books, you're quite surprised that they weren't visible from the outside. he ends up surprising you by taking out one of the books and tossing it into the air before doing tne same with four more books. He catches each, tossing them up one after another - it dawns on, and amazes, you that he's juggling them, about at this point - and after a moment of repeating this for a few more cycles of gravity and tossing, he looks down from his activity and to you. \"These here are my 'weapons', if you want to call them that. Given how much I like to read, I ended up casting several spells while I was cramming in information from my favorite book. Eventually, it got attuned to my magic. However, this effect can be forced, so why don't you go ahead and try it out?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You nod back at Henry, and move your line of sight to your sword. You're rather certain that this task will be easy for anyone with any inherent magical ability at all. Given the magic nature of your species, it should be a snap for you. Or, at least you think so. Focusing energy along with an incantation is simple enough, but you can't very well do that here without catching your blade on fire or blasting it out of your hands. After a moment of nothing more than staring, you relax and look back up to Henry. Once again, he is looking at his five books, which, somehow, he is still managing to juggle. <br>\r\nWithout looking down to you, he continues with his own personal experience, \"Of course, a person's favorite book eventually changes, especially after being read for the twentieth time. So, as time went by, I ended up with several different titles. I tried to make each one have a different set of materials, like different covers, binding, you know, bolk parts. Just like the experiences of others, each one had the same qualities after a bit of charging. Seem as though you could hold a rock and it would work just as well, heh. Unlike other wizards, I ended up holding onto my old 'weapons' after getting a new book. Ol' sentimentalities, I suppose!\" He shrugs and laughs for a bit before composing himself and moving on. \"Given the fact that my channeling weapons are books and not actual weapons, it also kind of helps that I seem to have picked up the ability to channel through more than one of these at once. It's allowed me to create all kinds of combinations of spells with ease. I once drowned a guy while burning him to death! Neat, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately try and shake that image out of your head, and after failing, go back to focusing on your weapon, if for nothing more than a distraction. You hold it straight up, this time, and look at it in the dead center before closing your eyes altogether, so you can think. You begin trying to think about magic in general, and begin trying to think of it as a physical force, imagining it running through you. You think of it as in your veins, your nerves, and then as you as a whole. You are a magical being- no, you are magic itself! Your eyes snap open, and your pupils have dilated to tiny ovals, oh-so slightly revealing your draconic nature. Your breath becomes shallow before you begin holding it altogether. You begin focusing even more intently on your sword, going cross-eyed. You hold it even higher, with the hilt just under eye level, and the golden colored decoration on the blade being just inches away from your forehead. Then, a foreign thought enters your head. You're certain that you didn't put it there. Suddenly, you are envisioning your sword as an extension of yourself, with magic flowing through it just as easily as yourself. Time around you seems to slow, and your lungs seem to be ready to burst from holding your breath, but you find yourself unable to exhale. Your arms feel suddenly weak, but you are unable to let go. Your senses seem to disappear: you hear nothing but your own heartbeat, seemingly slowed down to a constant rythym of once every ten seconds. You see nothing but the sword in your hands, darkness seeming crowding around you. You feel nothing, as even the floor under you seems to melt away, though you would swear that a gentle breeze was blowing through your hair. Slowly, the gold ornament above the hilt seems to grow. The spikes on it seem to get larger and larger, growing upwards to the top of the sword, meeting at it's tip.<br>\r\nThen, you're completely overloaded with the return of your senses. Time returns to normal, you can hear Henry, still juggling and speaking, not ten words into his new topic, and the floor returns to under your now slightly numb legs. Then, all at once, you look away, towards Henry, exhale, release the sword, and let your legs give out. Simotaneously, the golden lines adorning the sword seem to both explode and implode, as the lines both shoot out an assortment of sparks and seemingly melt away into the blade, turning it's color into a bright, hot red. The sword, as you relinquish its hilt, doesn't drop to the floor as you are currently doing, but flies away from you. As you hit the ground, eyes still open and pupils returning to normal size, you see the sword across the room, along with Henry's smiling face turning from looking at it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you experience before succumbing to sleep is Henry yelling, \"Do that again!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you next awake you aren't actually, well, awake. You find yourself looking at what looks like yourself in a rather surreal experience. You look quite different than your usual self, both being female in appearance and ragged in your clothes' appearance. You're walking down a corridor- er... the you that you're watching, that is. The corridor is iluminated directly around yourself, though no further in either direction, and glancing around, you find it nearly impossible to determine where the light is coming from. The corridor itself seems to be natural in its construction: a cave, perhaps.<br>\r\nThe further that both you and the other you advance down the corridor, the more defensive the other you seems to get, and reasonably so, given how the area is getting dimmer. Soon, you brandish the same sword that you had been handling outside of the dream, as the your actual self curses the blade, and yourself, for causing the trouble you figure you're in. <br>\r\nSuddenly, you - the other you - begins to channel through tge sword, the same action that had knocked you out. However, despite watching it occur outside of your body being surreal in itself, none of the surreal effects that happened to you happened to this version of yourself. However, something new did occur, as after the golden lines formed from the ornament and met at the top, they seemed to expand, covering the whole of the blade in a golden glow. Seems that this glowing effect was quite fortunate, as a few steps after creating it, the light surrounding the area vanished, leaving the only thing in your field of vison the sword's glow. But, while the sword seemed to be giving off light, none of it could be seen as reaching the floor, as if the light was being devoured as it reached the ground instead of reflecting back to your eyes. You don't give this any thought, though, as you're in a dream and don't even have eyes for light to reflect into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments into this almost pitch-black scenario, you see another hint of light, though not from another light source. Looking closer, you see that it's actually another sword, reflecting light from yours. You can tell that some words are said, though, to you, they sound like nothing but someone gargling water. This sound soon stops, as you enter a defensive stance as the sword that is not your own comes swinging towards you. You resist the urge to try and dodge, given that you're simply an observer in the situation. The other you stays put as well, opting to parry, allowing the overhead swing glance off before swinging your sword around for a counterattack. This is met with another parry, this one from your opponent. You soon lose track of the fight in a fast clash of metal moves around with skill that you don't even remember 'remembering'. Your efforts to pick back up on the fight are abruptly stopped as one of the swords swings to the location your head would have been, were you an actual person there, observing. More than cutting your would-be head, your vision of the fight also seems to have cut out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with nothing but the surrounding darkness, you find yourself thinking about exactly what happened after you passed out. You had both caused an explosion and demonstrated your capacity for magical output. You could have started a fire, in the castle, no less. More importantly, you could have also been discovered while you were out! It would seem you're about to get your answers, as the darkness gives way to an intense light as you open your eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awaken to an unfamiliar set of four walls surrounding you in a rather close proximity. Sitting up, you find that you are - er, were - lying down on a bed inside of what must be the smallest bedroom that you had ever seen. That is, until you noticed the tiny table jam-packed with medical equipment hinting towards the fact that this probably isn't a guest room. Still, even for, or especially for, an examining room it was far too small. It barely had room for your miniscule bed and the other man in the room, whom you just realized has staring directly at you since you woke up, interrupting your thoughts about your surroundings.<br>\r\nHe breaks the awkward silence and staring contest between the two of you. \"Ah, I was expecting you to wake up right about now. Right on time, actually.\"<br>\r\nYou respond with your own query, apparently having decided to skip past any introductions or pleasantries, \"On time? Er, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had you figured for waking up, right about now. If one could simply observe another's unconscious eye movements to tell when they were about to awaken...\"<br>\r\nHe trails off, raising an eyebrow at you along with a hand to his chin, giving him a pensive look. You kind of feel pressured, as the way he's looking at you simulates the way someone looks at an fool who doesn't know what century he's living in. Feeling the need to explain yourself, you quickly blurt out, \"I've never heard that in the countryside before. It would actually be useful, if you would teach me what to look for.\"<br>\r\nHe raises his other eyebrow before continuing, \"...it would be rather neat.\" His previously stone cold face cracks for a smirk before it settles down and he continues talking, \"You really ought to let people finish their thoughts, lest you risk asking for things that don't exist. Might make you appear as hasty and foolish.\" He juts his hand straight out, requesting a reciprocation to complete a handshake, which you oblige. \"My name is Jade, and I've been treating you since you knocked yourself out. I hear you got too hyper in trying to resonate with a weapon and replicated yourself a reoccurrence of some of the very first grand wizards' attempts. Henry was probably right with what talent he saw in you. Probably. Anyways, I am an actual doctor, certifications and everything.\" As he stops for a moment and shrugs, you take note of the fact that he looks clad in gear for killing people, not healing them. He has a rather intricate and blue vest on over a set of chain-mail with the added touch of having small metal shoulderpads on. What really seems over the top is the fact that he has three weapons strapped to his back: a spear and two bows. Why in the world he would have two bows and no quiver to use with either one of them is beyond you.<br>\r\nHowever, he picks upma nearby knife and continues before you get the nerve to ask about it, \"My doctorate isn't actually in the medical field, mind you, but that really shouldn't be a problem, especially since that'll stay between the two of us, right?\" He runs a finger over the blade of the knife in his hand, as if to accentuate a threat the likes of which he hadn't made. You nod frantically at this, overcove with a sudden onset of fear that isn't becoming of your stout personality. He nods once back at you before tossing the knife in the air, only to catch it and set it back on the table. As he turns around to head out the door, you swear that you caught a glimpse of the same smirk that you had seen earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he walks out the door and shuts it, you breathe a sigh of relief. You then mentally berate yourself for getting so frightened in a situation where there wasn't any definite danger to yourself. But, there was just something so menacing about that man. Perhaps it was his attire, or his cold facial expression, or even his aura of authority. You note that the last of those also came from Merlan in the few moments that you had met him, and, now that you think about it, it probably comes from being advisor to a king, which you now recognize Jade as being. The last of the three advisors was certainly startled you the most, though after a moment of thought, you realize that you were the butt of two jokes that he had laid out. Having been led into both 'interrupting' him and into thinking that he was threatening you, you feel just a bit foolish for walking right his jokes.<br>\r\nBut, then, you really do need to do some walking. Out of this tiny room, that is. You get out of the bed and open the door, thinking that you're ready to face whatever is next for your training, despite never having really started it.</span></div></div>",

Glancing out of a nearby window, you note that you are atleast on the second floor - the likes of which you had never even had a chance to venture up to before. As such, with Jade already having walked out of sight, you find yourself completely lost. So, as any lost young person would do, you start wondering around. This may not have been the best method of getting yourself un-lost, but you did manage to mentally map out a good chunk of the castle before you stumble upon a conversation between the three advisors you previously met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first voice you hear, you recognize as your own mentor's, Henry's. \"...alm down will you two? Well, atleast you, Merlan. I'm not sure what a more composed Jade would be like. He would probably become too concentrated and start sucking the composure out of everyone around him!\"<br>\r\nThe second belongs to the wizard of your initial encounter, Merlan. \"Don't be preposterous, Henry. Jade knows better than to try and treat injured people. He would keep them alive, sure, but the man went and scared off the nurse the last time he did.\"<br>\r\nThe third to chime in is the one Merlan was scolding, Jade. \"I object to that, Merlan. I did what I needed to do to save that man, and you know it.\"<br>\r\nGiven the intensity of the conversation, you follow it to a door, but remain outside of it as you doubt that it would be wise to interrupt, especially given how they are likely talking about the fact that Jade was in the medical room with you. Also, the conversation is simply interesting, and you'd like to hear it to it's end. As if to your wishes, Merlan continues, \"Sure, if you consider Necromancy to be an art of healing. That Luke fellow was dead in the bed in there for an hour, yet now he's walking around, though he acts as if he was still mostly dead. You scared the daylights out of Anise so badly when you 'saved' that Guy that she insisted on leaving this entire land, the dear. She was such a nice nurse, too. It really hurt me so see her leaving in that cari van. As such, I don't want to see you messing with any patients in the near future.\"<br>\r\n\"Now, that's just unfair and unreasonable,\" Jade started before getting interrupted by Henry.<br>\r\n\"Come now, guys, don't you think that this is a bit much? There isn't even anyone in the medical bay that's dead and needing of reviving. Unless, of course, you killed our newest apprentice while you were in there. Nya ha!\"<br>\r\nBoth Jade and Merlan answer at the same time, \"NO.\" before Jade continues with, \"It is much better to deal with a potential problem before it arises.\"<br>\r\nTo which, Merlan interjects, \"No, this is a matter of principle! New corpse or not, you should not touch any patients. I don't want to lose another nurse!\"<br>\r\nTo this, Henry simply bursts out laughing, and tries to say, \"Alrighty, I tried!\" over the incoherent squabbling that suddenly breaks out between the other two. At this, he opens the door that you were standing behind and listening through and walks through it. He just stands there, clutching his side with one hand and laughs for a moment before he seems to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Great timing, er, Opal, right? Right. Well, I think it's riiight about time that you go and really prove your worth to this castle and its people, and more importantly, to me. I want you to do two things. First, go and get some rice and bring it here. We're out, and I simply can't seem to find any in town. Now, for the significantly-easier-than-finding-nonexistent-rice task, go wipe out the dry bandits. They seriously need to stop robbing people, but they're super cowardly. Heck, I heard that two of them ran away from a ten year old kid, once. The trouble with them is finding them. Past that, you could really just explode them into a pile of blood and guts. Mmm. That actually sounds pretty fun. Well, you should do just that: have fun!\" He then abruptly skips off down the corridor, leaving you to listen to the bickering if the other two advisors and to your thoughts. Rice can come later. Defeating bandits won't be at all easy for you, unless you tyrn into your dragon form. But, that runs the big risk of getting caught.<br>\r\nWhat. To. Do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light burned into your red eyes as you woke. The sun had aided in keeping you fed like a normal Dark Hunter for whatever amount of time it was that you were unconscious. Then you remembered what happened and after looking around you started to cry. You looked at your body and saw the scars from where your mother\u2019s fangs had chewed your tiny body in her attempt to kill you. You knew but as a child didn\u2019t understand why your own mother would do something like that. But you had little time to dwell on it as you opened you eyes just in time to see and dodge wolf\u2019s jaws that snapped where you used to be. You bolted behind a tree and looked at the wolf as it readied itself to chase you. You then climbed up the tree with relative ease and too quick for the wolf to catch you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roared at the wolf but at your small size it only sounded like a squeak. You soon found that drawing attention to yourself was not a good idea as a hawk was the next to attempt to make you its lunch. You were able to use your tail to slice at it. Your tail, like all Dark Hunters, was usually normal looking but could flatten into an ultra thin but ultra strong serrated blade that had a spade shape to it. The serrated parts worked like scissors but could come together to slice depending on the dragons needs. Your tail sliced off the hawks talon and it screeched but sped away. This time you didn\u2019t hazard a roar as it didn\u2019t work at your current size. It was more of a dinner bell right now than a proper roar. You saw a hole in the tree and made a quick dash for it. You learned from your first two encounters to not take it for granted that you were safe so you propped the hole with your keen senses. After finding nothing dangerous you went in and coiled around so your head was facing out and your tail was protecting you. In the dark of the hole you were near invisible, except of course your blowing red eyes as they quivered at the prospect of the dangerous world around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor months you steadily learned the things every predator should know. And at your current size, flying didn\u2019t cause any attention so you developed it was well. Like your other talents like mind reading, fire breath, magic, your healing saliva, and a host of other things the genetic knowledge gave you, it came almost naturally as you needed it. However you still needed to practice. For instance you could hear conversations from the few humans that came by while you hid or when they attacked you but when you tried to talk back they would only hear growling, hissing, and snarls. You quickly became afraid of humans, even if you could turn into one. You didn\u2019t use your human form as it left you to vulnerable at the moment but when you found a cave behind a waterfall that no one knew about and the water washed away your scent so you couldn\u2019t be tracked there, you started training that part to. Not much, just walking, running, using your arms and hands. You even found out how to combine your dragon half with your human half. Like when you got big enough but another wolf found you. A one year old human doesn\u2019t have a lot going for them in defense or offense. So your human fingers grew into claws and a tail and wings grew out of your back. At that point you had wolf for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were lonely and with no one to talk to you just kept on living and growing up, learning what you could while practicing what you thought you might need, talking being one of them in both forms. You thanked the out pouring of knowledge from the past Kings, otherwise your vocabulary would have been limited to what the hunters and knights that attacked you. Those weren\u2019t very nice words. But you were still growing and hoping that one day you would be able to make a friend or at the very least not be alone.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You whimpered as you swallowed the remains of the human you were eating. You didn\u2019t like eating or killing humans but they always attacked you and even after you ran they would find you and try to kill you. A few times they almost succeeded. You even fired warning shots and then verbally warned them but it did little good and they would almost force you to counter attack. The human you just ate was what was left over of a knight that was on one of those \u2018holy missions\u2019 they go on to slay dragons. The humans from this realm knew better than to attack you as they knew that Dark Hunters in general were not dragons you looked for on purpose much less attacked. Heck most of the time when a Dark Hunter was around the humans laid their weapons down or in the other direction. However sometimes a few would come through a portal on their missions and search dragons out for multiple reasons. If they didn\u2019t force you to they were safe, from you. Most other dragons could smell the difference and ate them regardless. Only humans from this realm were protected by Dragons. The humans or creatures from other realms were fare game. One of many reasons you hated dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange but you thoroughly enjoyed humans, even if all they did was curse, attack, or fear you. However as a 500 foot Dark Hunter King you ironically hated other dragons with a passion. Most of the time if you saw a dragon, which was often because you could see pretty far, you killed and/or ate it. Besides you figured that they had more meat on them anyway. Even the longer snake types that were the one dragon that was larger than Dark Hunters at 800+ feet you took down. Those usually lasted you a month as you rationed the meat. However other Dark Hunters were your favorite. Not only did they taste almost as good as humans but there was another reason that was the spawn of your hatred for them. A reason you had buried and rarely addressed but was still there. The unspoken and unfounded hatred that was shown to you when you were young was now unconsciously reflected on them. Didn\u2019t matter if it was a baby or full Queen, if they came to close to your territory they died and most of the time before they knew you were even there. Needless to say, fighting such difficult opponents all the time toned you quite well and gave you a decent amount of hidden scars that most never were close enough to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in your new cave that easily fit and hid your frame. It was on the side of the mountain and not easily found. It usually took extremely skilled hunters and knights days to find it. Then they could only get in if you left the door, which was a large boulder, open. You tossed the armor from the knight into a side room along with his blade and shield, trying to forget him and the fact that you had been forced, yet again, to kill/eat him. You stretched your wings as you left and rolled the door closed with a bit of magic. It was impossible to close it without magic from the outside as the large bolder was on the inside and was quite heavy, even for you. You looked around and then took to the sky after making sure no one was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you saw something you had never seen before, as you soared far above so you looked like a bird to any human on the ground. You could of course see them just fine, you could even see the ants under the ground if you desired to. But this was a new site for you. A dragon was walking on in a city. You marveled at him and the fact they actually figure out you wouldn\u2019t attack them if they were invited by humans. You saw the street clear and any humans that were outside quickly went in doors. The situation was getting more troublesome by the moment, even more so when he snarled at a few guards as the dragon entered the town center and went for the center. In the center was a little girl, not any older than you were, strapped to a pole in the traditional sacrifice manner. Seeing sacrifices to dragons were common and you never accepted them but usually the sacrifices were thieves or criminals that were going to be executed. You decided that this dragon might be worth breaking your usual rule of entering towns to deal with. So you ducked in the nearest clouds and road them down so you were a thousand feet above the town square without being seen. Then you observed, maybe there was a good reason they chose this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d the dragon said as he circled the obviously frightened girl. \u201cI said I wanted a meal not some abused little human that is nothing but skin and bones.\u201d He snarled at an old man that was the only other person in the center of the town square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, have mercy!\u201d the girl begged and cried but the man slapped her in the face and from the look of her not for the first time. She slumped in her binding from the force of the slap as the mayer turned fearfully to the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are working on breeding you more meals. The only others we have are the men or too old. You said you liked the young women so we brought you what we had. There should be a few coming from other villages next month. We will keep them here for you if you will accept her now. She may be small but I\u2019m sure she will be more than satisfying.\u201d He said as he brought his hand to her near naked body. Most dragons that received sacrifices don\u2019t like the taste of clothes so they have them prepared without them. The dragon walked up to them and sloppily licked the girl as if giving a taste test. She was uncontrollably whimpering as she probably crying all the tears she could already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, for a human, you have excellent taste in women. She does in fact taste to die for.\u201d He almost growled and gave a toothy grin that made the girl turn away in fear and the mayor become uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease someone, anyone, help.\u201d She whimpered, not expecting anything to save her as both the mayor and dragon looked at her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she still has the hope that someone will save her. That always makes them fight longer. I am really starting to get excited.\u201d The dragon said than got close enough to her that his tongue was touching her as he spoke. \u201cNo one cares about you little girl. No one is coming for you. Only me and my tummy.\u201d He said in a arrogant voice that you had enough of. You either needed to kill him or save the girl. You didn\u2019t have time in one pass to do both. If you landed in the square you would wreck some of the buildings and maybe hurt some of the innocent humans. So you had to choose; to save the girl or eat the dragon for by the time you had time to do another pass the girl would be dead or the dragon would have left. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as the dragon said his last words the girl looked up than gasped at you as you revealed yourself. You size and proximity to the ground made a shadow pass over them. The dragon and mayor noticed this and as you roared loud enough to shake the buildings they saw your form. Your kind was well known by the humans and you were well known to the dragons for your actions. So both of them settled back in defensive positions as you took an angle and swooped down. You had one chance at this. The pole the girl was on was too thick to break without your teeth, claws, or tail if you wanted to not harm the girl on it. Since your claws were going to be out of range and your tail was what you were going to attempt a slice at the dragon with that left you teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave another roar as you came closer that effectively froze everyone in terror. When you got directly over the girl you put the hole pole in your mouth and bit, severing the pole at the base and trapping both the pole and the screaming girl in your mouth. With the follow-through you draped your tail down and flattened it and your aim was dead on. As you took back into the air the dragon\u2019s head was rolling on the ground as the mayor fainted. At this point you were glad no one was watching as you didn\u2019t want the rep of attacking villages. You stripped the mayor of what happened other than a Dark hunter took her. You made sure he thought it was a female and not you. As soon as you got to your cave opened your mouth and carefully pulled the pole with the girl out. The girl was unconscious, probably fainted from shock. You looked her over and after a bit you sliced the ropes holding her to the pole which was the only thing keeping her from being completely naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now what do I do?\u201d you asked yourself. You now had a naked 12 year old girl in your claws that looked the definition of an abused child; malnourished, beaten, emotionally scared, and dirty. You figured that humans liked being clean so you blew some flames into a waterfall that sat to the right of your cave so the water was comfortably warm for humans and put her under it. You thought she would wake with the water but she didn\u2019t. In a way you were glad so you could wash her off without her screaming at you. After you finished you carried her into your cave and shut the door. You lit some torches that you had built in the wall while in human form. Unlike you, humans couldn\u2019t see in the dark. Your cave was now flooded with an orange flickering glow and you lit the fire in the center as well to keep the now shivering girl warm. But it was too hot of her so you placed her just far enough were you saw that her body was acting kindly to the warmth and not shivering. You then laid down on the away from her and against the far wall so she could wake up without having a heart attack. You knew that humans didn\u2019t like you for some reason and didn\u2019t like all the screaming and when they tried to attack you. You were actually scared of it. Not what they could do to you physically but you hid from the mental abuse that every attempt brought. So with that done you hesitantly fell asleep to the smell of the fire and a human in your cave. It was a pleasant smell and you slept soundly, for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke to a sound of a grumbling stomach. Not yours as you had eaten that human and a dragon in the last week. It was the girls and as your eyes darted open you saw she was awake and must have been formerly scavenging around for a way out but now, with the loud sound of her stomach, she was staring at you. Probably more so now as she saw your glowing red eye dart open and looking at her. Your head was turned so she only saw one eye but it was big and bright enough to notice you were now awake. Eventually after a few minutes her current pose was too much for her to maintain so she straightened and faced you. She was still looking for and exit but now also trying to find a way to remain on this side of your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry if I\u2026 woke you.\u201d she said and you just laid there. This was the first time a human had talked to you without including the word beast, monster, dragon, or other like words. Your slit eye followed her as she moved and she must have figured there was nowhere to hide from you in here. Her stomach growled again and she held it as if to tell it to be quite. After all it was her stomach that got you to wake up in the first place. But you could tell she was very hungry, if nothing else as evidence to her malnourished body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get up and she backed against the far wall, thankfully away from the door. You then opened it and walked out, then closed it despite her sudden pleading to keep it open. You had saw her shiver when it opened and didn\u2019t need her dying on you either from the cold or running off and into another predator\u2019s stomach. You went off and retrieved some deer than came back. You opened and closed the door as before and she had taken her place on the back wall as she saw you bring in the three deer that were in your jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit them out and heard once again the girl\u2019s stomach growl at the sight of them, even uncooked. You then retrieved a large metal grate of sorts and placed it over the fire. Then with expert precision you began gutting and cleaning the deer, eating all the insides yourself as to not waste any food. When you got done skinning them you cut the meat off and started placing them on the fire and they sizzled in the heat as they cooked. You had learned a while back how to do this in both forms. Dragon form was a little harder as your claws were too big but your tail was more than sharp enough to do this kind of thing. And if that didn\u2019t work you always had magic you could use. You ate the rest of the three deer and let about half of the last one cook for a little bit. Then when it was done you placed them on a shield of the knight and carefully nudged it over to the girl. She flinched at first but her hunger was far out weighing her technical reason and after you put some distance between and laid back down where you had started she dug in. You growled a little as you saw her eat which made her stop. You didn\u2019t know much about normal humans but you had seen a beggar eat like that once and he actually died from it. Something about his stomach not being able to handle the mass quantities of food. She tried to grab another but you growled again and her hand backed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more?\u201d she asked in a wary tone. You came over again and grabbed the shield with the end of your teeth as she sat where she was frozen. You dumped the meat in a mixture of salt and other magical substances you made to preserve it than threw the shield back in the room with the rest of the armor as well as the grate you used to cook it. You then opened the door again and went out but didn\u2019t close it. You laid down outside until she made her way out and saw you were there waiting for her. \u201cAre you letting me go?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled in return and then looked over to the stream and waterfall then back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, suppose I can\u2019t have a decent meal without something to drink.\u201d She said and she went to the water and drank from it. \u201cWow this water is amazing!\u201d she said as she continued to drink but you saw the same problem and growled to correct it and she looked up at you as you approached and got the message as you corralled her back into the cave and close the door behind as you both got inside. You went and lay back down and she watched you for a while but then another noise came from her stomach and she looked at your once again opened eye with fright but relaxed as your stomach gave a similar noise as it digested the deer. You watched her and after she sat at the opposite end of the fire for a while she lay down and went to sleep and you did as well. You weren\u2019t sure what to do next as it seemed to be doing well for now. You thought you might be able to talk to her but that might make her more scared and you didn\u2019t want that. Maybe she would talk first, you hoped so, after all that other dragon could talk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ate just enough and then you went out and let her drink. When she wanted to bath you allowed it but watched her closely and skewered a few fresh water predators as they got too close to her. She thanked you as she saw a large wish and a hippo looking thing but when you brought a croc out that was easily twice her size she decided her bath was over and she didn\u2019t need the hint to go back inside to which you closed the door again. This time you went out on a limb and sat closer to the fire. At first she retracted to the wall but she was a smart girl and probably figured that if you wanted to eat her you would and shivering away from the fire wouldn\u2019t change that. So she sat on a chair of sorts that you picked up a while back and would occasionally look at you as you stared back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 umm\u2026 can you talk?\u201d she asked as she didn\u2019t want to wait in the uncomfortable silence any longer. You raised your head to this and after a thought of how you should answer you slowly nodded at her. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you? At least tell me why you brought me here. I can\u2019t tell if I should be thanking you or waiting for you to get hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d You started and watched as her eyes almost immediately shot to your teeth as you started. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d you said and shrunk back a little as you tried to look as nonthreatening as possible, which wasn\u2019t really working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful but\u2026 why did you bring me here?\u201d she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you being sacrificed to the dragon. I didn\u2019t want you to die so I took you instead. I usually don\u2019t do that.\u201d You said in a bashful voice or as much of one that your incredibly deep voice would allow. This new revelation that you intended to save her was a pleasant reprieve but then she noticed your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you \u2018don\u2019t usually do that\u2019?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSacrifices to dragons are common. But usually they are criminals or at the very least someone old enough so their spot could be taken. I\u2019d never seen a child on as a sacrifice before. Plus I don\u2019t really like going into human towns. They usually try to kill me and stuff.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I guess I should thank you for saving me. Thank you Mr. ...?\u201d after a moment she noticed that you weren\u2019t getting what she was trying to ask. \u201cDo you have a name?\u201d you just shook your head and she saw a twinge of sadness in your eyes from her question. \u201cMine is Sarah but I can\u2019t go around calling you Dragon so\u2026 do you mind if I give you a name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you want to give me a name? I would love that!\u201d you exclaimed but perhaps too loud as she winced at the outburst. You wanted to nuzzle her but when you brought your head forward she got visibly more nervous so you just settled in a neutral position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok. but I only know human names. Is that ok?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever name you pick will be perfect.\u201d You replied and she smiled involuntarily at your seemingly childish behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I name you after\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all you had kill and eaten more dragons that any human was ever done so the term fit rather nicely, even if you were a dragon yourself, well half dragon at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dragon slayer\u2019s name was Max. He was known because he was able to take down any dragon he came in contact with. He died do to old age, which is unheard of for people in his profession. Do you like it?\u201d she asked as she was unsure of giving a dragon slayer\u2019s name to a dragon but it was the best she could come up with, as her education was far below despite her apparent intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d You said and brought your head down. You hesitated and she flinched but you both, at the same time reached out for the other. She with her hand and you in an attempt to nuzzle. It ended in her petting the front and side of your snout, first with a extreme amount of nervousness but as she saw you liked it she grew more bold and continued until you both drew back. \u201cSarah? Why were you chosen as a sacrifice?\u201d you asked and you immediately saw that her face expression changed to a sad one. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have asked. You don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s ok. I suppose you should be entitled to your curiosity just as I am. I am sure we both have loads of questions for the other.\u201d she said as she forced a smile then sat on the chair. You hesitantly scooted over and placed your head to her side within arm\u2019s reach of her. She was anxious at first but relaxed when you stopped moving, with the exception of your eye. \u201cThat dragon was very specific with his sacrifices. He wanted fit young women and if my village gave him anything else he would disembowel them and leave them there, demanding double payment for the next month. My family\u2026 let\u2019s just say they never really cared for me. My father was a drunk, my mother an overpaid and arrogant prostitute, and my brother a sexually abusive military brat. Being that I was the youngest they would each use me in whatever way they wished. Wither that be for beating, selling me to clients, or as a\u2026 sexual outlet. This sacrifice was no different. When they found that there was no one other than my mother to sacrifice they eagerly gave me to the task. Now that I think on it you saved me from more than just that dragon.\u201d She said and reached out to pet you on the ridge above your eye. You purred lightly at this which made her freeze at first but she quickly realized the difference between your growl and a purr so she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we have more in common than I thought.\u201d You said but you quickly lowered the profile of your speech as you saw her freeze in momentary terror at your teeth when they were visible. She looked at you quizzically at first and especially when you pulled away and leaned so your underside was facing her. You then extended a wing s she could see the ever present scars of where your mother sank her teeth into your hide and wings. She gasped at them as she first thought they were just how you looked. But when she followed the pattern and saw they were jaw and teeth marks she just stared at them for a moment in disbelief. She had never seen such a bad injury that didn\u2019t result in death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026? What happened?\u201d she asked in a combination of wonder and disbelief. You retracted your wing and sat back to where you were before, but with your head snaked around in front of her so you could more easily talk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother. My kind has strict rules on what is allowed to live as far as newborns are concerned. Any that have even the slightest abnormality are killed and discarded like trash or worse. When I was born she\u2026 well she didn\u2019t have a problem with showing me she didn\u2019t want me around.\u201d You said and met her gaze as she looked into your glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what abnormality did you have for her to do that to you? You look more than capable to me.\u201d She said and you forced a smile, being careful not to show any teeth so not to frighten her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Sarah, however that was the abnormality. I am what is known as a King in my species. The males of my kind are usually vastly weaker and insignificant than females, mainly kept around as breeding slaves and such. But once in many generations a King is born with the genetic knowledge of all the Kings before it. A King is the biggest threat to a Queen\u2019s rule so they are taught to be hated and killed on site.\u201d You explained and she was trying to come up with ways to make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they obviously failed, you\u2019re too good for them.\u201d She said in a tone that indicated she was trying to put you on a pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for lack of trying. If my genetic knowledge didn\u2019t cover an advanced healing ability I would be dead. My mother was the Queen and not by any means incompetent. She truly thought I was dead or she would have sent the whole clan after me if need be. However, word of my existence has gotten out and they do send queen ranked dragons to take me out from time to time. Just means more food for me.\u201d You said, the last part more casual as you tried to bring the mood of the conversation up some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you eat other dragons?\u201d she asked and a hardened expression came over you that had her flinching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate other dragons. All they do is push their weight around and put humans down whenever they feel like it. I hate all of them, every last one.\u201d You growled at the thought of other dragons but then snapped out of it when your eyes saw Sarah\u2019s fearful reaction to your sudden anger. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. You don\u2019t need to fear me. I don\u2019t harm humans, well most of the time I don\u2019t.\u201d you clarified but the last part you hung on for a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018most of the time\u2019?\u201d she asked and you supposed it was a fair question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I don\u2019t go looking for fights or humans to eat. I even flee a fight if I can. But sometimes they catch me in positions or follow me back here. I do everything I can to get them to go away and stop trying to kill me but\u2026\u201d You said and looked over at the pile of armor and weapons. Sarah followed your gaze then looked back at you. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy it at all but it does happen from time to time. Mostly those knights that are on those \u2018Holy Missions\u2019 they do to slay dragons. I just wish I could talk with them, with anyone but most humans either run or attack, never anything in between.\u201d You said and slumped down as your head lay on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you have me\u2026\u201d she said as she came over and rubbed your snout, trying to make you feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to stay? Even if I kill and eat humans?\u201d you asked, perhaps a little less gracefully and you could have phrased it better but she got what you were asking just fine. She was still wary of your teeth as you spoke but didn\u2019t move like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t act like those other dragons and go looking for humans to eat than yes, I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d she said and from the little she knew of you she knew that strategically placing the dragon trigger in the sentence would help drive the point further in. \u201cBesides, both of our families pretty much suck so we can start a new one with the two of us.\u201d she said and smiled but noticed you still had something on your mind and hoped it wasn\u2019t something to do with what she just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah\u2026 before you say that there is one more thing you should know about me. It is the primary reason why Kings are killed by both humans and dragons. One of the default abilities or information is that I am not completely dragon or human I am half and half but stronger than both. I retain all human traits as a dragon and the same in reverse as a human. It is probably why I like humans so much but the feeling is not usually returned.\u201d You explained and you hoped that she would take it well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI have heard of that before. Every human in this realm knows what to do if they meet a human or dragon that can turn to the other. We are supposed to identify as much as possible and tell the royal city so they can destroy the threat. We are told that these half breeds are vicious, death dealing creatures that only wish to destroy and rule both sides, dragon and human alike. They are considered worse than demons.\u201d She said with her hand still resting on you lightly. \u201cMax, you are no demon. You\u2019re my family now, half breed or not. I don\u2019t care if I am considered a traitor. As far as I\u2019m concerned they all betrayed me and are the real demons.\u201d She said and ended with her hugging as much of your snout as she could, which wasn\u2019t much. You didn\u2019t really know how to hug her back so you brought your tail over and lightly pressed it against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You said which made her moved back and you retracted your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see you in human form?\u201d she asked with a curious gleam in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but I gotta warn you. I\u2019m not too good at it yet. I always forget something.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget something?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like the first time I transformed so that a human wouldn\u2019t run. I couldn\u2019t understand why they did anyway. I wasn\u2019t showing red eyes or wings or anything. It was on my way back when I heard a young man say as he went by to put some clothes on. He didn\u2019t say it very nice but I got the message. Don\u2019t know why you humans use clothes but I use my scales to look like clothes. But I think it still needs work.\u201d You explained and she laughed at you then slightly covered herself for the first time. She was naked after all but this was the first time she noticed her indecency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, you don\u2019t happen to have any I could wear do you?\u201d she asked a little bashful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I know a little magic that can materialize them for you. Just think of what you want. Remember to think practically as we are in the mountains and those human things called\u2026 dresses are too drafty for up here. Make sure it is through to. I can only materialize what you think of. I don\u2019t know enough to fill in any blanks.\u201d You said and she nodded sheepishly and she closed her eyes and thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019m ready.\u201d She said with her eyes still closed. You reached into her mind and saw the outfit she wanted. It was simple enough; sturdy pants that you saw some female hunters wear as well as the typical and over used body covering for female hunters. They were all leather and with a fur coat for windy or cold temperatures. Gloves and wrist braces for top and a type of shoe/boot hybrid and shine guards for the bottom. Along with some small undergarments you saw no use for but materialized anyway. After the light from the spell wore off she opened her eyes and looked at herself. \u201cWow, thanks for the clothes Max.\u201d she said like a teen age girl that went to a mall for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Still don\u2019t see why humans wear them to begin with.\u201d You said and just left it there. \u201cOk now for the hard part.\u201d You said and then with a snarl that drove Sarah back a few feet as she saw your muscles flex and your claws start to dig into the solid rock under you. Your teeth were bared against the pain as you continued to growl and snarl. Slowly your body started to shrink and morph into more and more of a human shape until you lay on all fours with spikes that were usually on your head and back left and scaled cloth coverings formed black pants, boots, and a sleeveless shirt. Your hair was just over an inch long but spiked back and of course black like your dragon self. You were completely ripped and not a single ounce of body fat was visible. You stood up after breathing hard and steam rose from your body as your human body cooled its temperature to a human\u2019s level, your red eyes dimming into a dark blood red color that settle and was hardly noticeable. Even if you were only 12 you had he body that could have been made out of solid rock and just lightly tanned as the temperature from the transformation always burned it that color. \u201cAh\u2026 transforming is sure a pain, literally. Specially into a  human form like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 you scared me a little. You didn\u2019t tell me it hurt that much. You were snarling really bad and stuff.\u201d She said as she walked toward you. You were actually smaller than she was like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was trying to keep it down. It\u2019s just it hurts a lot to transform. My body literally has to rip its self apart to do it. But once I\u2019m changed I can do all kinds of cool stuff.\u201d You said as your tail swayed behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you missed a spot.\u201d She said as she looked at your tail and you followed her gaze. You hadn\u2019t even noticed until she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, I always forget something.\u201d You said and simply retracted the tail into your back and stumbled a little to gain balance. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you humans do it without a tail.\u201d You said then after you got your footing you looked at her and saw her confused face. \u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt to do that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean growing and retracting parts, like my tail or wings?\u201d you asked and she nodded, not wanting to get closer until she knew you were done snarling. \u201cGrowing individual parts is no problem, it\u2019s the anatomy and size that are a pain. Humans and dragons are just as different on the inside as they are on the outside. That is the stuff that really hurts. Can I ask which you like better?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter?\u201d she asked, not quite catching what you were saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon or human form. I would prefer the dragon one but I can really stay in either. Since you\u2019ll be sticking around you should have a choice in the matter. Just don\u2019t ask me to change on a dime or whim.\u201d You explained and she agreed than thought about it. Having a dragon as family could be interesting not to mention cool. But the size difference not to mention his full set of teeth made her cringe. In human form it would be easier in that regard but harder on you, if nothing else a conflict with your personal preference. But then again you wouldn\u2019t have asked if you weren\u2019t willing to stay in either. So which one would she pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not gonna lie, I prefer dragon form over human. Well unless I am going into a town. A 500 foot dragon is easy to see.\u201d You said with a laugh than stretched a little for the oncoming task of changing back. \u201cRight, transforming part two.\u201d You said than bent over in pain but caught yourself on all fours. You grunted and gritted your teeth to prevent from yelling or screaming. That was until the dragon parts began to show. You started to hit the ground with your fists until claws appear to which you just sank them into the same grooves you made earlier. Grunting and gritting was replaced with snarling and growling, you actually foamed a little bit at the mouth as you bared your teeth. Your skin started to visually burn off and were replaced with scales. And both your wings and tail formed. When everything was said and done you were frozen with your joints locked until your breathing and the pain subsided. It was then when you saw Sarah bracing against the far wall in sheer terror but was coming back down from it as you were no longer snarling and otherwise scaring the crap out of her. You started to walk over but collapsed onto the floor with a thud. You tried to get up again but your muscles creamed at you and you had no choice but to listen to them as you winced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok Max?\u201d Sarah asked in her position against the wall as she saw you struggling a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little tired. Transforming takes a lot out of me. My body just needs time to recover, that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be moving for a the rest of the day though.\u201d You said with you head on its side as you talked. Your breathing was still a little heavy but it was coming down. You felt a small presence near the V your neck and head had fell into. Sarah was there and after sitting down she leaned against you and placed an arm to rest just above your eye, her hand gently caressing its ridge. You purred at this and she smiled into your large blinking eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so warm. If it is ok with you, can I sleep here tonight?\u201d she asked as she snuggled deeper into the relatively soft underside of your head and neck. The scales there were no less resilient but felt more like snake skin but warm, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love it. Goodnight Sarah and thank you for everything.\u201d You said, careful not to move your jaws to much when you spoke do to her proximity to them and your teeth, that she was still wary of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for family, Goodnight Max.\u201d she said than fell asleep against you. When you had enough strength you draped your wing over her as you coiled your body as much as possible and followed her into a dreamy state. Finally you had a family and you loved the feeling not to mention her smell. It wasn\u2019t like a predatory delicious smell. Rather like a smell that completely relaxed you and just made you happy. You couldn\u2019t describe it but you fell asleep to the lovely scent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One year went by in no time. You and Sarah we as close as you could get for a couple of thirteen year old kids. She taught you what she had previously learned in school while you taught her predatory and fighting basics. She could pretty much hold her own in the wild as long as it wasn\u2019t a dragon she was fighting. She wasn\u2019t at Knight level yet but she was definitely getting better. You both got kind of down when humans came to kill you. Sarah was insanely smart so she was able to talk them down a few times but there was a few of them that didn\u2019t back down and you had to deal with them. Sarah didn\u2019t look while you fought them which usually ended with you eating them. Not that you wanted to but if you left corpses then others would be drawn to you or the other dragons would eat them and blame it on you. Either way, eating them was just more logical and you were more than willing to let them go if they decided to not attack you anymore. You even puked one up after he apologized, and that was after he saw his armor melting in your stomach. Normally they were dead before you swallowed by a multiple of causes; teeth, claws, tail, height, fire, ice,\u2026 but occasionally you if you thought your stomach would convince them to save themselves you made an attempt to let your fleshy organ negotiate with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, not again.\u201d You said as you plopped a bear you just got done lugging back for your and Sarah\u2019s dinner. Sarah looked to the entrance, which you rarely left closed anymore, and saw a single knight standing there with his sword drawn and shield between you and him. Not that shields did much against you. You typically steered clear of them because they made great serving dishes, but only if they didn\u2019t have holes in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the name of\u2026\u201d the Knight stated in a speech that you heard dozens of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Sarah interrupted and the Knight looked at Sarah, who was just sitting in a new chair she made for herself. \u201cYou are here to kill Max for some lord or great noble cause that a blood thirsty beast like him would never understand. Does that about cover it?\u201d she asked in a board tone and you just snickered at her complacency and familiarity of their \u2018holy missions\u2019 or \u2018just causes\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing girl? That is a dragon!\u201d he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, he sure has a brain on him. You think you can reason with him while I get dinner ready?\u201d you asked and she waved in a \u2018yeah, I got this\u2019 motion. You then went over to the bear and began your work as usual and within moments had fresh slabs of meat cooking on the fire, and of course you gobbled up the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo brave knight, do you have a name?\u201d Sarah asked politely as she got up and addressed him but far enough so that he couldn\u2019t \u2018save her\u2019 like others tried to do at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick.\u201d He stated still in a defensive position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Sarah, it is a pleasure to meet a knight that doesn\u2019t just blindly attack and throw around insults like most do. They don\u2019t tend to last long around here.\u201d She said, the last part in a warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are in league with this\u2026 dragon?\u201d he asked as if to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least he didn\u2019t say monster or beast. That\u2019s a step up.\u201d You said and got Sarah to giggle a little and make the Knight get confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are asking if I live here and call him family than yes. If you are accusing us of some kind of act you will have to be more specific. We get a lot of\u2026 intruders here and they all accuse him of something, most mind you are false.\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I even touch the family part, I will state my claims. It is said that there is a dragon that slaughters humans and dragons alike. A dragon that feels nothing even for his own kind. I will grant you that there are many dragons so I may have stumbled into you by mistake. Your apparent relationship is intriguing so I am willing to hear you out.\u201d The Knight stated and you looked at Sarah then gave her a nod to which she sighed and faced Nick again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, you do have the right dragon and place. But each of those things you mentioned has an aura of rumor over fact. Max has\u2026 good reason why he hates his own kind and to his credit he always does more than enough to try and persuade humans and would be attackers from making him kill them. He eats them after so other dragons don\u2019t flock and attack the nearby villages. And lastly he is strong enough to make normal fights seem so one sided they could be considered a slaughter. So he is technically guilty of al you listed but then again, as a knight, haven\u2019t you killed dragons and humans as well?\u201d she explained and he both flinched and relaxed at certain spots of her claim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point. I have killed many men and a few dragons in my time. But I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a murderer. I can\u2019t kill him on suspicion or false rumor. But then again I can\u2019t just leave until I know for sure.\u201d He stated and lowered his guard but was clearly keeping his senses on high alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you have dinner with us? Max is an exceptional cook and we are having bear tonight.\u201d Sarah suggested and pointed to a chair next to her\u2019s but so she was between you and Nick. He took a bit to consider it than sheathed his sword and placed his shield next to and leaning on his chair. He looked to be observing every move you made and would become unnerved when gazing into your glowing red eyes or if you spoke and your teeth and mouth were open in such close proximity to Sarah. Half the time he looked like he was ready to attack and the other looking for an excuse that he didn\u2019t have to. As you moved around and spike he seemed to realize that you would be much tougher than any dragon he ever faced. But he was teetering on the edge of that choice. You hoped he didn\u2019t attack, you didn\u2019t want to kill him. He seemed different than the usual.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWater?\u201d Sarah asked Nick and he accepted it but it was getting dark and you wondered how long he planned one staying. You rarely closed the door but the night was an exception. You both slept a lot easier if the door was closed so you didn\u2019t have to worry about a croc coming in during the night from the stream and taking a bite at Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. I don\u2019t mean to be rude Nick. But are you planning on staying the night?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d he asked still a little coldly to you. You didn\u2019t care that much as you just took it that he was being careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax closes the door at night.\u201d She started and pointed to the large bolder. \u201cHe may be a dragon but I am human and this mountain has many predators still around other than dragons; wolves, crocs, bears to name a few. They don\u2019t really bother Max but they would take a bite out of me. We just sleep more soundly if we don\u2019t have to worry about it. Kicker is that Max is the only one that can open or close the door. So if you want to stay or go than now is probably the cutoff point.\u201d She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know if you can be trusted. So I will be staying the night.\u201d He said to you in the same tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d you said and got up and headed for the door. You slowly pushed it closed then lit a few more torches in the walls so Nick could see. You and Sarah new this place by heart but Nick needed a little more light to see around properly. You then cleaned off the grate and put the meat into the salt substance before putting the grate with the other armor that Nick was purposefully turning his back to. Even though he knew why they were there and that you didn\u2019t murder them he still had the thought lingering that they all passed through your jaws and that made him more anxious than anything. You than lay down and coil around yourself. Sarah got upand after cleaning herslf off went over and took her usual spot by your head and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mick asked in a concerned voice and she looked up as you blinked an eye open to look at him as well. She rubbed your eye ridge and you purred to which she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to bed. It can get cold at night and there are few things that are warmer than Max.\u201d she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be safe. What if he rolls or yawns in his sleep?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I fall into his mouth. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time it happened but I\u2019m still here. I trust him and he trusts me. We are close enough that even if he does eat me in the night by accident his body stops itself. You might want to keep your distance though.\u201d She said and just smiled before settling down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d he asked, not believing what her just heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be serious with you for a moment Nick.\u201d You said from the other side of your mouth so Sarah didn\u2019t have to move. \u201cYou may not trust me but I definitely don\u2019t trust you. If at any time I believe you are a danger to Sarah I will not hesitate to remove that danger. I trust you understand that it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant if it came down to it.\u201d You said with a growl and a deadlock glare to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough you two!\u201d Sarah said and you stopped your growling and both of you stopped your glaring. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to bed, so goodnight to both of you.\u201d You both took your turns returning the gesture then Nick headed for the wall and leaned against it and his sword and you spread your wing over Sarah and your head after you were mildly content on Nick\u2019s position. It took you longer than usual but you finally went to sleep but kept and ear out for either of their heartbeats. If they so much as increased by a single beat for any reason you would know about it. And with that you attempted to get some rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cKnock, Knock, time to get up sleepy head.\u201d Sarah said playfully as she lightly knocked on your eyelid. She didn\u2019t do it hard or anything but it was the most sensitive place you had for her to get your attention if she had to get up for any reason. You quickly checked on Nick to be sure he wasn\u2019t standing with a sword out to kill her or something. When you heard his heartbeat in the same chair you felt satisfied and retracted your wing for her to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Sarah and good morning Nick.\u201d You said sleepily after Sarah got up as did you. You stretched and yawned when Sarah was far enough away for you to do so. Then went to open the door and check for danger. As you opened it you were the first outside and you looked around for a while. There were times when a dragon or such would follow a knight\u2019s scent and be waiting for you to open the door but you let one dragon go as a request from Sarah once and since then you didn\u2019t have that problem. You went over to the stream then Nick and Sarah came out into the morning air. Their heads snapped to you as a hiss and a growl filled the otherwise quite morning air. They saw a rather large croc on the stream\u2019s shore and you growled at it, causing the croc to retreat down river. After taking a drink and checking the bed of the stream for threats you walked away from it. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my breakfast, is the bear meat good or do you want something fresh?\u201d you asked more to Sarah but Nick was standing near her so the question was open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, rabbit sounds really good right now if you can find any.\u201d Sarah asked and you smiled and headed off to hunt. As you did you started thinking about your and Sarah\u2019s situation with Nick here. He obviously had more up to date information and he could teach Sarah how to defend herself more than you could. He looked highly trained so it was possible he would be a better teacher. But he must also have a life that would prevent him from staying. You would have to ask him when you got back. After catching a few wolves and a half dozen rabbits you carried them all back and when you got back you saw Nick talking with Sarah but was more silent when you came in. You deposited the wolves and rabbits in separate areas so you could eat and they could fix them how they like. And after Nick got the cue from Sarah that this meal was for them to work on he took half the rabbits and helped Sarah prepare them. It was well into eating your meals and you finished when conversation sparked up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where do you come from?\u201d you asked Nick to which he snapped his head to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so you can go there and attack the village?\u201d he sent back and you broke eye contact, this was going to be harder than you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick, that was low. Max has only gone into a human village once and that was to save me.\u201d She said when she saw the effect it had on you. She knew you didn\u2019t like the stereotype you were given as a dragon and really didn\u2019t like when people used it despite any good deeds you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why does he want to know where I live?\u201d he argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you would have to ask him.\u201d She said and she turned to you and gave you a look to answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I was\u2026 I was wondering if it was possible for you to come back here after you left or if you needed a ride back. I usually don\u2019t go beyond the Cape village, where Sarah is from but I could fly you part way.\u201d You offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want me to come back? So you can e\u2026\u201d he started but then got and elbow from Sarah before he could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking. Sarah doesn\u2019t get to hang around many humans or have any to learn from. I don\u2019t want her to leave but\u2026 if you were able to teach her stuff or take her into town to shop. It might make her happy to see other humans other than when they are trying to kill us.\u201d You clarified while Sarah and Nick\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to leave?\u201d she asked with a slightly hurt voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No! That\u2019s not what I meant. I just\u2026 I see the way you look at villages and other humans when we fly around. I know you want to interact with them. But I can\u2019t take you to those places if you want to do it normally. You\u2019re my family, I don\u2019t want you to leave for good. But if going into town every once in a while makes you happy, than it would be\u2026 useful if Nick would be able to take you around.\u201d You explained and she looked down as if she said something hurtful, which she did. She should\u2019ve known that you didn\u2019t want her to leave like she said, and to say it like that was a little hurtful. She then looked up after clearing her mind of it and smiled at you lovingly which made it all better when she said stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Max, I do need to get out more. Maybe some shopping and mingling with others will do some good. I certainly sounds fun.\u201d She said and gave the part of your snout she could reach while in her seat a rub. \u201cSir Nick, do you live far from here? I can\u2019t really go back into Cape, not that I want to.\u201d She asked and she must have told him her past because he looked to completely understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot far at all Miss Sarah. It is only 30 or so miles to the east of Cape. It is known as Crobalt and it has a fine assortment of activities and things that may interest you, as well as very high defenses.\u201d He said, the last part directed to you. But to his credit it contained the smallest sliver of concern in the tone that you barely picked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can drop you two off anywhere you feel it safe.\u201d You confirmed but his eyes were still stern. \u201cAnd I can wait high in the air and out of site until you call.\u201d You said and he just barely nodded as he was still highly concerned about his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really need to fly there. The journey would take only 5 days.\u201d Nick said as another option, probably to avoid relying on you at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, Max can span 30 miles in a very short amount of time. But I suppose a long journey would be more\u2026 normal.\u201d She said as she seemed to be torn between the two. She loved flying with you and it did make sense as far as time was concerned. But then again you knew she had been thinking about having a normal life as a human for a while. You both loved each other like family but she did have\u2026 needs that you could never please. Even if those needs were a simple interaction or tea party. Things that little girls should be able to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave it up to you Miss.\u201d Nick said and you nodded in pretty much the only agreement since you two met.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You flew high above the landscape with both Sarah and Nick at the base of your neck and beginning of your back. You used you protruding bones to make a sort of saddle for them to use as well as safety belts of sorts so they didn\u2019t fall off and they could keep their hands free. That part was necessary for Nick because he refused to have you hold his shield and sword in your storage gut with Sarah\u2019s belongings. He put on a brave face but you could tell he was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of flying and the look of things from the air. Sarah always loved it, especially if you picked up you speed, but for the sake of Nick\u2019s breakfast she settled with the default. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is. Crobalt.\u201d Nick said as you circled the second town you had found in this direction. It was more like a city than a small town and you saw what he meant by VERY well protected. You guessed you would not like trying to force your way into that place. \u201cThere should be a large field to the north of the city. You can set us down near the tree line.\u201d he said and you located the spot then carefully used the clouds to cover your decent. You landed gently without any humans seeing you, even if some farm animals in the field were running like mad away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll head up to the sky until you call me down.\u201d You informed after you brought up Sarah\u2019s stuff from your storage gut. It was a little slimy but fine after she wiped her sword and coat off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d Nick said, Sarah and you looking at him confused. \u201cThey will eventually notice a dragon circling the village no matter how high you go. I own this field so just lay down among that tall grass and out of site. That way we will know exactly where you are when we come back or need you.\u201d he said and you looked to where he was pointing and noticed the grass there was tall enough to hide you rather well and nodded in agreement than turned back to Sarah. Then materialize and sack then carefully picked it up with the front teeth and gave it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure you have fun ok?\u201d you said and when she opened it she quickly closed it again than with a smile lunged at you and gave your neck a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, thanks for this Max.\u201d she said into your neck than backed off and after a wave she started walking with Nick toward the city. You could hear him ask what was in the bag and she showed him the large bag of gold coins you gave her. You didn\u2019t need such things but you knew humans went wild over the stuff so you weren\u2019t surprised when he shot a glance to the spot where you were now hidden thoroughly surprised that you could do things like that. You then laid you head down and as you had nothing better to do took a nap as the warm sun beat down on you and energy filled you as its warm rays penetrated your scales pleasantly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleep was good to you and you got a lot of rest as your body felt relaxed and energized due to the sunbathing. However as darkness fell you just rested in you spot until you heard footsteps coming and of course other stuff a predator is keen on; heartbeats, scents, brushing bodies against the terrain, metal sounds to name a few. You left your eyes closed as you knew from Sarah that they could easily give you away in the dark if you weren\u2019t careful. You smelled Sarah and Nick but there were a lot more with them. If you had to guess you would say soldiers and other knights. You heard chainmail and the clanking of different weapons. Horses and their noises as they began to sense you were nearby but to weighed down and directed to do more than follow their orders. It was well over 50 humans fully armed coming your way with your sister. The only thing that kept you from suddenly grabbing Sarah and bolting was that she was completely calm. You could hear her heart beating as if she was just taking a stroll. This was just getting weird and you wondered what they were up to, but you would find out soon enough as the light from their torches grazed the long grass where you were waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, Dark Hunter indeed. If we were going to try to fight him now we would be in big trouble.\u201d Said Nick as their eyes searched for you. Dark Hunters were definitely rare and approaching one in the darkness was an idiot\u2019s errand. They could sneak up right behind you and in some cases people have walked straight into their claws, tail, or mouth without even knowing it until it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, it\u2019s ok. They just came to bring you to the castle. Lord Hizer has offered to put us up for the night or maybe more.\u201d She said as she searched for you as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so many humans?\u201d your deep voice came as you addressed them but they still could find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey need to escort you and make sure no one panics as you walk down the streets. They are just here to provide any who see you with misguided comfort of mind.\u201d Nick explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess if they don\u2019t attack or anything it will be ok. Do you trust this Sarah? You think it is a good idea?\u201d you asked as you did sometimes when you were unsure of human behavior. She was infinitely better at reading humans than you were, minus reading their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, I spent a very pleasant half the day with Lord Hizer and he seemed ok to me.\u201d She said and at this you opened your eyes and the company suddenly noticed the glowing red orbs mere feet from them. You got up and shook the extra grass, dirt, and other things that fell on you during the course of the day. You gave a yawn and shook your head a little which made most if not all the other humans quiver. They could barely see you the way it was and their torches reflecting off your teeth weren\u2019t helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have fun today?\u201d you asked as you brought your head down near Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes! Load of fun. I got to shop and talk with the other girls. I even ate this new pastry thing they were making. I also won a sword dueling contest, they only used wooden swords but it was fun none the less. Well for me it was, the boys I beat weren\u2019t very happy.\u201d She said as she smiled, very pleased with herself then jumped on your head and snout to get closer to both eye then hugged the top of it. \u201cBut I missed you. All day I kept asking you questions before I remembered you weren\u2019t there.\u201d She said and just lay in her hugging position. You raised you head a little, perhaps more than Nick was comfortable so you could lay properly in the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s this human Lord want? I mean not a lot of humans like dragons around, present company excluded of course.\u201d You asked and she didn\u2019t even bother sitting up as she must have been tired out from the day\u2019s events. Made sense, you two were usually in bed by this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething about better you being on the inside than the outside. He kind of lost me with the technical stuff. But I thought you would like it if you were near more people. They may be afraid of you for a little while but at least they aren\u2019t attacking you right?\u201d she asked as she wasn\u2019t sure if she had done the right thing by volunteering you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus you finally get to sleep in a bed again right?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeds are overrated. You\u2019re more comfy.\u201d She said sleepily as she was trailing off to sleep as your warm body soothed her to sleep. You used a careful claw to pick her up and place her in her usual spot at the base of the neck. And after she was secure and at this point sleeping against your neck you turned to Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re spending the night.\u201d You said and it was all the agreement he needed to just motion you forward and the soldiers nervously surrounded you in a large escort formation. You stepped as light as you could to prevent Sarah from waking as you followed Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little intimidated by the large walls and gate that were many times bigger than you were as well as the weapons on the walls pointing at you as you approached. You followed Nick through a deserted street and to the castle. You occasionally saw a face in a window that quickly ducked in as you passed or a human in one of the areas between the buildings. You smelled so many smells that you thought you were going to be sick, everything from grass to rotting blood. It got better as you reached the castle and when you passed its walls the smells were more distant and stronger more pleasant smells were present. You were brought into the inside and into a huge room that was far bigger than your cave. You smelled lingering scents of hundreds of humans and you looked around to grasp where you were as the door closed and locked behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where my lord will meet you in the morning. Since we are unsure where to place you and I doubt you will allow us to bring Sarah to a separate room, you can sleep here tonight.\u201d Nick said as he gestured to a spot at the back of the room but more than enough room for you to curl up or stretch out comfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you N\u2026 I mean Sir. Nick.\u201d You said as you caught the gesture from some of the others who had addressed him. He bowed politely as you saw the others do for him and left you alone with Sarah in the large, now dark room. You curled up and carefully placed Sarah in her usual sleeping position to which she subconsciously snuggled into you. Taking in her scent you covered her with you wing and went to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You immediately woke up when you heard doors around the room open. You didn\u2019t move or open your eyes but you kept you senses open. You smelled fire then light fell on your eyelids. The sense of fire was dispersed to a few places and you reasoned it was torches like back home. Then you heard multiple footsteps around. At first they were light and shaky and you didn\u2019t hear the clanking of metal like a knight or guard would have so as soon as you heard them shy away you opened your eyes. Some saw this and were quivering as they did tasks from cleaning to arranging. A few looked brave enough and they took the chance and clean closer to you and were glad that you weren\u2019t moving at the moment, and probably that you weren\u2019t eating them either. Your observation was interrupted by a loud thud at the door as a man in full armor but his weapon not drawn came in with more than a dozen guards. The man stopped a decent distance away and looked at your eyes as you looked back. He ushered for a guard to do something and you watched as he got closer. You didn\u2019t mind until he started trying to lift you wing where Sarah was. You growled a little and he jumped back as if expecting you to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 No growling this early in the morning.\u201d Sarah wined groggily and you immediately stopped then retracted your wing so she could get up. She leaned on your snout as she stretched and got up. She looked around and was confused for a moment to where she was. after she took a few steps away you joined her in stretching and yawning. The other humans didn\u2019t like it but what else was new, only Sarah was comfortable around you at this point and that was good enough for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Sarah, did you sleep well?\u201d you asked and she nodded then looked at the heavily armored man and the guards as if she couldn\u2019t figure out why they were here. \u201cThat human lord you spoke of let us stay in the castle. You were asleep when we got here. Sorry about the growl.\u201d You said and she noticed it was probably towards the armed men that were facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Beltree, what the hell are you doing!?\u201d came a serious voice as Nick came from the still open door. He looked enraged at the apparent Captain and his guards aiming their weapons at you and probably more specifically Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were only trying to bring the girl to a safe room for the morning when this beast growled at us.\u201d the large Captain accused. You ducked your head a little at his remark and Sarah came over and gave your draped head a little attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky all you got was a growl. Taking anything away from a dragon is not advise, much more someone he is protecting. And you dare raise your weapons at honored guests of our lord Hizer?\u201d Nick rebuked and the Captain suddenly seemed to get a fear in his eyes and immediately sheathed his weapon as well as dismissed his men. You were pretty sure Nick was mad because Sarah was involved but either way you appreciated his support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Nick! Good morning! Thanks for letting us sleep here for the night.\u201d Sarah said with a smile and he bowed politely to her in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome child.\u201d Said a voice from a smaller door as an old looking man came out, well dressed for a human, and came near the Captain and Nick to which they both knelt in a bow Sarah also looked at them and took a similar pose. You couldn\u2019t exactly do as they were so you just tilted your head down and then back up in a bow attempt with your neck and head. Then they all got up with a gesture from the man. \u201cIt is wonderful to see you again Sarah and of course Max is it?\u201d he asked politely and you nodded to answer. \u201cIt is an honor to have a distinguished dragon like yourself as a guest. I am Lord Hizer, I assume you met Sir Nick and the Captain of the guard Sir Beltree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mr\u2026 Ah Sir\u2026 Umm\u2026\u201d you stumbled as if not really sure how to address him personally and looked at Sarah and she leaned over to you to whisper advice. \u201cLord Hizer\u2026 they treated me with a very warm welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you are too kind. I know they can be a little harsh, however they have never met a dragon they didn\u2019t have to kill for the safety of the city before. They mean well and are surprisingly selfless in that regard.\u201d He returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying\u2026 Lord Hizer. You seem to be handling my presence in a way I\u2019m not used to. Well other than Sarah your Captain and Sir Nick are as good as it gets. I am curious to why that is.\u201d You asked in a serious gaze. You couldn\u2019t tell what it was but you didn\u2019t like the way this Lord smelled. But you couldn\u2019t put a finger on it. Whatever it was he was about to answer so you listened carefully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think I\u2019ll show you instead.\u201d He said and you sat up properly as he motioned for a large door to open on the opposite side of the room he entered. It almost looked like a hidden door because you didn\u2019t even notice it until this point. Sarah was off to the side near you and Nick and you caught a heightened sense come from both Nick and the Guard Captain. This sense wasn\u2019t like they had for you but similar. More of a threat respect but not fear. You then got a whiff of an unmistakable scent that made you lightly growl, just enough for Sarah to recognized it as it was lower than the rumble coming from the doors were opening. You stood up at the scent your muscles began to flex a little as it opened. Your head came instinctually down like a dog or wolf does when pointing, low enough for Sarah to reach but not on the ground either. You didn\u2019t want to alarm anyone or act until you were sure but the scent was very strong, the scent of a dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara can you come out and meet our new guest?\u201d the old man asked sweetly like a grandfather would to his granddaughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if in slow motion a small horse dragon that was little bigger than 30 feet long came out, a baby or what a dragon equivalent was. The dragon was slight blue and almost birdlike with her wings carrying feathers in some places but only on her wings. Her face was innocent looking with blue eyes that matched her scales and wings. The rest of her was delicate and actually quite beautiful if you had to place a word on it. But that was for the others, you went into a full on snarl and continuous growl as spikes came out of your spine which was your equivalent of a wolves hair standing on end. With your teeth bared your claws began to dig into the floor in preparation to leap forward and to tear her apart. Upon seeing this everyone was driven back in sheer terror including the young female dragon, but her door was closed so she was in a corner as she curled up whimpering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax no!\u201d you heard through the blood rage that was coursing through your veins at seeing another dragon. The only voice that could reach you like this was Sarah but you were still snarling and a single flame from that dragon could have set you off. That was until you felt a pressure on your snout and a scent that gently started to calm you. \u201cIt\u2019s ok Max, please don\u2019t. You\u2019re scaring everyone, you don\u2019t want that do you? I told you that you don\u2019t look nice when you\u2019re like this. You need to calm down.\u201d She said slow and lovingly and your muscles started to relax and she soothed you until you were laying down and other than a slight and random growl you were finally laying on the floor with her stroking your large snout. The same snout that no one would have gone near for all the money in the world as you were just seconds earlier. People die when dragons get that mad, period. The feat that she was able to calm you not to mention that you were a Dark Hunter amazed the rest of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does he hate me?\u201d came a voice from a whimpering dragon that was curled up in the corner. She was crying but and it got everyone to look at her with pity except you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t hate you my dear.\u201d Said Lord Hizer. \u201cBut I would like to know what that was all about.\u201d He said as he looked from Kara to the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually he does.\u201d Sarah said as she saw your full attention was still on the dragon in the room, crying or not you still let out random light growls that she had to soothe to stop. \u201cMax\u2026 he\u2026 well in short he hates all other dragons. It isn\u2019t that he hates her in particular but she is a dragon and\u2026 well he usually  rips them apart when he sees them.\u201d She explained and they could see that Sarah was pretty much the only thing keeping you from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does he hate his own kind so much?\u201d Hizer asked and Kara looked over but like a child trying to hide her gaze. \u201cThat is not just a normal hatred that can be quelled in a short time. That is deep, I can see that he still just want to\u2026 Why is he like that?\u201d he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax can you show them the\u2026 you know.\u201d She asked and it snapped you back to her and her request. It was a good thing she knew the whole story because you didn\u2019t like to revisit it. You gave the little dragon a final snarl before turning ad rolling onto your side and opening your wing to display the horrible scars that covered your body. You stayed that way for a bit until you heard a scratch of the other dragon\u2019s foot move. To that you spun around and snarled at her again as she was trying to get closer or at least in a more comfortable position. She froze but there was Sarah\u2019s hand on your snout again an you lay your head on the ground and she continued to sooth you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy word, what horrible wounds. What happened to him?\u201d Nick asked in disbelief. He had inflicted far less sever wounds on many dragons and they all met their end. For you to still be alive not to mention at your current development was baffling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis mother happened. The day he was born his mother hated him and, to her mind, killed him. For years after what must have been a miracle he was targeted by both humans but more specifically dragons after they learned that they failed. So when he was strong enough he fought back and now that he is\u2026 well more than they can dream of being he sees his mother trying to kill him and the thousands he has seen die at the claws of other dragons. I myself was almost eaten by a dragon when he saved me. So that just adds to it. I don\u2019t think he had met a dragon that he hasn\u2019t eventually killed or eaten.\u201d She explained and as they soaked in the information it started to make sense and the little blue dragon stared at you in a strange longing that replaced her fear and sadness. They didn\u2019t really like the eating other dragons part and Sarah didn\u2019t even bother with you only being half dragon and had eaten humans. One surprise at a time you supposed. However you just couldn\u2019t shake this feeling when Kara\u2019s gazed at you. Her gaze seemed familiar and not a bad light but like you were looking at you before Sarah showed up. At the very least it took the edge off the rope of your emotions and you suddenly stopped growling all together but continued to glare at her as if the slightest false move on her part would warrant her death.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax?\u201d Sarah inquired and your eye closest to here came to rest on her. \u201cI would like to go and make sure that Kara is ok. But I don\u2019t want you to be mad or angry.\u201d She said and you brought your full attention to her. You definitely didn\u2019t like that idea. \u201cMax, I want you to try and get along with her. If nothing else just don\u2019t\u2026 you know. Please, for me.\u201d She asked, almost begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to beg Sarah. What makes you happy makes me happy.\u201d You answered and looked back over at Kara and let out one last growl. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to like it though.\u201d You finished then as Sarah started over to Kara you reluctantly and slowly followed her and reached out with your mind to the young dragon. \u201cI want to make one thing clear to you little dragon. If you harm Sarah, ever, I will make you suffer before I gut you and use your for an ornament. Clear?\u201d and she nodded furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of that Max.\u201d Sarah instructed as she gave you side a slap that you made a mock sense of pain. She knew pretty much everything about you, including your mind reading and was well aware that you could have complete conversations in the confines of you mind. But she was quickly rubbing the spot she slapped as she was never able to stay mad at you for long. Sarah gave Lord Hizer a nod as she knew that he was hoping the dragons would get along and this was the best shot currently at making that happen. You flexed your wings a little as you saw Hizer move to Kara to comfort her as well as calm her as you and Sarah approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to kill me is he?\u201d Kara said as she put her head on the ground and tried to look as small as she could so you didn\u2019t even expect any aggression from her. As you reached her you brought your snout down and smelled her more closely then brought it back to full height. Then at Sarah\u2019s silent request you reluctantly curled up in front of her with your head facing her. You could still snap her head off at this distance if you wanted but you just lay there as Sarah gave your head a pet before walking over to Kara, your eye glued to her and her safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he isn\u2019t. He needs to learn that not all other dragons are bad. Can you help me with that?\u201d Sarah asked as she instinctually stroked the wincing dragon\u2019s eye ridge and she purred like you would. It was a definite surprise for Lord Hizer for it was evident that he had not been able to cause her to do that. She lifted her head a little and nodded, making sure it was low profile enough for you to deal with \u201cI\u2019m sorry that he scarred you Kara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really hates us that much?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons? Yes he does. I\u2019ve only got him to release one other dragon before. To be honest, even if you two become friends and such he will probably still feel that way with others. You don't have to tell me but why are you here. You seem a little young to be on your own.\u201d Sarah asked in a tone as she sat by her and continued to pet her neck as she raised her head to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am kind of like\u2026 him.\u201d She started and this perked you up a little. \u201cI understand there are many reasons for each type of dragon to abandon their young and mine were no different. They just didn\u2019t try to kill me at that point. I was born last among my siblings and as tradition would dictate. The last dragon born in a litter has to be sent away as part of a superstition of back luck or something.\u201d She stopped as she held back some tears but Sarah\u2019s comfort as well as Hizer\u2019s attempts at the same did her good in controlling them. \u201cSo when I hatched I didn\u2019t find myself in a nice cozy nest with siblings I found myself on the edge of a cliff and almost fell off as I got my bearings. I learned quickly that crying about it wasn\u2019t smart because after a few minutes of me crying for my mother a mountain lion took a swipe at me. I was too little to fight back so I leapt off the cliff. I didn\u2019t know how to fly but I found gliding to be pretty easy and despite the bitter cold of the outside around me I kept up my attempt to get away from the mountain lion. The thing was far gone but I thought that if I could fly he might be able to as well. I landed in a couch next to a sweet old man and he took care of me after that. That about sums it up.\u201d She said and with a smile nuzzled the old man gently which gave his old face a smile, again like a grandfather would give to his grandkids. After a little while Sarah got up and came back over to you and sat against you so you could talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer story sounds familiar doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked in a sad tone that matched yours at hearing her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbearably so. What is it with my kind and dumping their kids?\u201d you said softly with a bit of anger mixed in with the sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Max, would you mind helping her out?\u201d she asked and you looked at her in surprise but she didn\u2019t see it as she was still looking at the interaction between Hizer and Kara. It was similar to yours with Sarah. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not asking you to go out with her or anything. It\u2019s just she doesn\u2019t have another dragon to teach her the basics or even any extra passed down knowledge like you have. She even admitted she can\u2019t fly. She needs you Max. That man won\u2019t be around forever and when she finally is alone she will need someone.\u201d She said and you sighed as if about to go do a lot of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I ever just say no to you?\u201d you asked a little playfully and she gave you a playful pat and got up then approached the other two to which they looked at her and you as well. It looked like she was going to say something but she just stood off to the side and nodded to Kara for you to say something. At this point you had your head raised enough to be above hers but not enough o strain necks to look you in the face. What are you going to say to her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The question caused the whimpering and scared dragon under you to freeze in a collision of emotions. She didn\u2019t know what emotion to act on but finally joy won out and she, without thinking lunged forward and nuzzled your lowered neck and her body against yours in a dragon\u2019s version of a hug. You raised a claw out of instinct but held it as the Lord gasped, seeing what you almost did. You then just placed it back down and sighed in a sort of defeat. This was the first time a dragon had gotten this close to you without you killing it or getting very close to doing so. Nick immediately took you too out to the guard\u2019s training field so that she didn\u2019t wreck buildings with her landings or yours for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow take it easy Max. She needs to learn not get herself killed.\u201d Sarah said up to you and you just nodded than looked at the smaller dragon beside you. As everyone got clear so you could start you quickly grabbed Kara and took off into the air. The site made some almost panic and Kara started to cry again. You didn\u2019t address it until you felt you were high enough so she could learn and if she didn\u2019t you had enough time to catch her. You gave a few extra thousand feet of a buffer beyond that point then started to sore with the crying little dragon still in your claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop that!\u201d you said in an irritated tone. \u201cIf I wanted to eat or kill you all the crying in the world wouldn\u2019t stop me from doing it.\u201d You reasoned and she sniffled and stopped until she was proper enough to address you or at least here instruction without distraction. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been able to take off anyway. Taking off and landing safe enough for humans is going to be the hardest part. You need to learn to fly in general before you can take off, otherwise what\u2019s the point?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She said and looked up at you then down as you soared. You could tell she like the feeling and was amazed at the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to drop you now.\u201d You warned and before she could argue you did it anyway. She flailed around in the air pathetically until she used her gliding she already knew to catch the wind and rise a little and at the very least wasn\u2019t falling as fast. You came near her as she circled. \u201cNow go higher.\u201d You instructed and she tried batting her wings and she made some progress before losing control and catching her fall in a glide again. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bird so stop flapping around like one! You\u2019re a dragon so fly like one.\u201d You said as you flapped your wings in a more solid and complete sense and climbed a little then circled to see her try. It took her multiple tries but after expending multiple tries she got her wings to work right, probably out of blind luck, and she ascended to your level. She took a moment to level off but now she was soaring rather than gliding, pumping her wings like you did to keep the height at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You can be sorry on the ground when you or those you\u2019re carrying aren\u2019t in danger of you crashing. Keep your mind on flying. If you lose control I\u2019m not going to catch you so you will just plummet to your death. Keep that in mind.\u201d You said and she stared at you for a moment but almost lost control then nodded in understanding. \u201cGood, lesson one complete. You can now fly up and maintain your level. I am sure you can figure out getting down as gravity is the best teacher on that. Let\u2019s try something more\u2026 fun.\u201d You said and she looked at you than with a large build up you pumped your wings and shot passed her into the sky with dizzying speed but not a speed that she couldn\u2019t match. You saw you look at you and surprisingly quick she observed your movements and started to accelerate and in a short time she was chasing after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this too fast?\u201d she asked as she was just keeping up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you have another dragon on your tail wanting to eat or kill you.\u201d you said than with another aerial maneuver you appeared behind her and snapped your jaws behind her tail. Her fear came back and she began flying away from you and making sharp turns to avoid your jaws as you made swipes for her at different angles. She was learning quickly, granted if you really wanted to catch her she would be but she was flying better every second as she dove and ascended, twisted and even fired a few fire balls at you mid slight. But one false move and she began panting as she was rather tired. She slowed for a few seconds and you caught most of her body from her front legs to the top of her gut in your jaws, careful not to actually injure her. However injured or not she was freaking out as your jaws were now around her. You left her there for a moment than grabbed her with your claws and held her steady as you release her from your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was\u2026\u201d she started but you growled and she stayed quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you think just because you are tired your enemy was tired to? Would you risk whomever you have with you on that fact?\u201d you asked and even though she was facing you instead of down she lowered her head. You dropped her again and she quickly caught herself. \u201cIf this was a real fight and I was trying to eat you along with whomever you let fly with you. You would have been solely responsible for their and your death. You\u2019re never safe up here and neither is your rider. If they fall you catch them, if you fall you make sure they don\u2019t die, if you are attacked you keep going to protect them until you have no life left. If you fail in this your enemy will win and you will die, period.\u201d You said and she thought on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, thank you\u2026 Max\u201d she said in a pure gesture of her phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d You said with a momentary lax of emotion. \u201cNow, for the hard part, landing.\u201d You said and you dove to the ground and Kara followed you to her next lesson in flying. She was tired beyond belief but she wasn\u2019t going to show it. You smiled at yourself as you glanced back at her than you continued your lesson.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lessons went like the first one. Despite most everyone\u2019s disagreement with your methods she was making significant progress in the areas you were teaching her. In particular she was an expert flyer. She had even evaded you at times when you were actually trying to catch you, not for long but not too many could out do a Dark Hunter in anything so that she able to come close was impressive. She didn\u2019t have the same luck in other aspects though. While you worked on them with her; her flame was weak and inaccurate, her fighting on the ground was pathetic unless the other was on their back, and she had virtually no hunting skill what so ever. After about a week you insisted that she receive no food unless she could catch it. This was another topic but Kara accepted and if worse came to worse she would use a dive bomb snatch and grab to attain her prey. She was also used to humanly prepared food so she was exceedingly wasteful until she started getting bigger and needed all the meat she could get. With the no feeding rule in play she had to make the most out of her meals but she still didn\u2019t eat the insides at all, to her they were \u201cGross\u201d, even more so when you lapped them up so the evidence of her meal was no more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular day Lord Hizer had received a notice that a rouge dragon was making trouble near the end of his lands. You volunteered to \u201cdeal with it\u201d which was understood what that meant if they sent you after it. Lord Hizer agreed but only if you took Kara with you as the dragon was smaller than she was (now 60 feet long) and she needed to learn to defend from a real threat. You and Kara soared high above in the sun so others wouldn\u2019t see you two and you both soon saw a small dragon attacking some humans but hadn\u2019t managed to get any yet. The dragon would roar like a vulture then swoop down and scare all he could. You could see the burning homes and dead livestock that were spread around from this dragon\u2019s fun and you started to snarl a little, not wanting to give away your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I do it?\u201d Kara asked as she saw the look of bloodlust in your eyes. She obviously wanted to prevent yet another dragon from you and you looked at her than back at the dragon on the ground. You figured the dragon was small enough so you didn\u2019t see the harm if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. But you need to make sure he knows to never come around here again. If that means killing him than you need to do it. If that dragon thinks he can just attack later, than more will die because of your sympathy. Make no mistake though. No matter what you promise him, if I see him again I will gut him.\u201d You instructed and she nodded in understanding than dove down to the soaring dragon below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other dragon barely had time to think before a shadow hit his eyes and she slammed into him, forcing him to the ground on his back with her snarling at his well restrained and almost broken body. You had to admire the combination of restraint and power as any harder would have caused his wings to break but any weaker and he would have evaded it. You watched the conflict as she spoke with the other dragon and after a while she got off him and did something foolish, she turned her back to him to fly away. You could see that whatever they had agreed on he had no intention of upholding. And with a quick few attacks they had switched places and he was on top and under his mercy. Then you finally heard what you were waiting for as she called your name and you dove down to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax? what is that your boyfriend?\u201d the other dragon asked with a laugh. While you two had gotten close neither of you had even thought about that before. It was easy to forget with you constantly threatening to kill her every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly you smelly lizard. He\u2019s my teacher. He told me that I should kill you, I should have listened.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you should have.\u201d He said as he licked up her neck and face with a slimy lick that was purposefully more sloppy than any you gave her on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou creep! That was disgusting! Max! get this loser off me!\u201d she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoser?!\u201d the other dragon snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you would\u2019ve killed him like I told you this wouldn\u2019t have happened. But I guess this way I get lunch.\u201d You said after sneaking behind him to the point where you were towering over him but not making a shadow on him. Before the dragon to back of her you swiped him with a claw and pinned him down with it, once again on his back. \u201cI told you before Kara, you and I are rare and most other dragons act like this guy. Give them a little and they will demand everything.\u201d You looked down and saw a wiggling in his stomach or rather felt it under you clawed hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even take the courtesy of killing his meals before swallowing them. Like others he wants the feel of prey still moving in his gut. Probably turns him on.\u201d You said as you adjusted your hand so she could see what you were talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my is there still people in there?\u201d she asked in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir my prey!\u201d the dragon tried to roar but you just took a claw from your other hand and sliced his gut open, spilling two young kids not older than 9 onto the grass. They shivered as they were introduced to the comparatively cold air outside the stomach. You could see some acid burns from early parts of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore they\u2019re not.\u201d You said in a cold tone as the dragon screamed in pain. \u201cKara, why don\u2019t you take them and clean them off. They still have a little stomach acid on them that could do some damage. I\u2019ll join you when I am done with my lunch.\u201d You instructed and she, without any sympathy for the screaming dragon grabbed the two little kids carefully in her jaws, as she they were to fragile at this point to ride on her back, and took them out of human earshot from the screaming dragon than placed them down and started to lick the acid off. She obviously didn\u2019t like the taste but she was dead set on not letting it harm the little ones any longer. When she was out of the way you looked down at your meal and with no emotion what so ever you took his head and upper body in your mouth and severed it from the rest. You may hate most dragons but you still had the courtesy of putting them out of their misery. You gulped that down then the lower half. You licked the remnants of blood and what not off your muzzle, claws, and teeth then went to join Kara as she Kids were now clean, wet with drool, but clean. \u201cGave them a tongue bath huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said to get them clean?\u201dshe asked confused as the children were shaking more out of the fear of getting eaten again than the cold. A crowd with an assortment of weapons that were mostly farm tools surrounded you and approached slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you could have heated that tub of water over there for them and let them bath themselves. But I guess clean is clean and they are out of danger at least.\u201d You said and Kara looked at the freshly filled water trough you were referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She said and looked down again at the two kids. \u201cWhy are they still scared?\u201d she asked as she was not used to human interaction like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were just eaten and almost digested by a dragon. After that all dragons pretty much look the same. Not to mention they probably don\u2019t know or had a tongue bath before. They probably thought and still think you are just tasting them.\u201d You said then brought your head down to them. They closed their eyes in fear but you just breathed a gust of warm air at them which dried them almost immediately. When they noticed this and that they weren\u2019t in another mouth they looked back at you while you retracted your head a little. \u201cYou can go little humans. We aren\u2019t going to eat you.\u201d you said and they quickly got up and ran to a pair of extra anxious and approaching parents. \u201cNow we wait and see if they attack or not.\u201d You said to her as you both lay down comfortably in a less threatening position.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the kids were ushered by their mother away to join the others somewhere the father and apparent leader of the small group of people came forward. Unlike the others, who were armed with an assortment of useless farmer\u2019s tools that wouldn\u2019t even scratch a dragon, this man had a sword and held it like a knight would. This told you that he at the very least had some training and could pose a problem if he attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are the dragons that live at Lord Hizer\u2019s castle in the city of Crobalt?\u201d he more stated than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, we are\u2026\u201d Kara started but the man\u2019s sword was instantly raised at her speech to him. \u201cWhat? Did I say something bad?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsh.\u201d You started. \u201cHumans get nervous around us when we talk. Especially when we get bigger. All they see is a flapping mouth full of deadly teeth. So don\u2019t talk unless you have to and even then do so without opening your mouth so much.\u201d You instructed as you talked in a manner that demonstrated the technique to which she nodded and looked back to the human that was talking before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked, still with his sword pointed more at you than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were asked to stop a dragon that was causing trouble. That dragon won\u2019t be bothering you anymore.\u201d You said and the man must have seen you eat because he looked immediately at your chest and stomach than back at you. You knew your eye unnerved most people so you did your best to make yourself look as nonthreatening as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would say that you were a little late as most of the buildings are in ashes. But then again without you here my boys would still be in that beast\u2019s stomach.\u201d he said and lowered his sword to which the rest of the people around did likewise, some a little hesitant but still. \u201cSo I guess the only thing to say is\u2026 thank you.\u201d he said in a pained face that was clear he was forcing himself to say it. This was normal since most had lost much to dragons so trusting or thanking one was against what they knew. However the moment was broken by a young little boy, not more than 8 years old, running around and into the circle. He was out of the human\u2019s reach before they knew it and he came crashing into you. He fell back and you instinctually looked at him. He looked up at you with an innocent face as if not knowing the potential danger he was in. The adults were back in stance as they awaited what you would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! A dragon. You\u2019re big.\u201d He said and Kara chuckled a little and you just smiled down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok little one? I didn\u2019t hurt you did I?\u201d you asked and the boy just shook his head and scampered up to his feet then looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a little kid! My name is Richard and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d He said as he crossed his arms in annoyance at being called little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d you said in a mock sense of fear that made the little boy proud. It was at that point when you noticed a little wooden sword in the kid\u2019s belt. \u201cYou must be a brave warrior.\u201d You said and the kid took out his sword and started swinging it around like he was fighting then looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just brave, I\u2019m going to be a dragon slayer when I grow up. I\u2019ll be big and strong and make sure no nasty dragons attack my family again.\u201d He said with that same innocent confidence that most kids his age had. You could see that the humans around you cringed and were even more anxious as the kid said this. Admitting that he wanted to slay dragons in front of one was usually not smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I better watch out then.\u201d You said and he was so busy waving his sword happily after your compliment around he didn\u2019t notice he was coming closer to the humans that promptly grabbed him and took him away when they could. \u201cCute kid.\u201d You said then turned your attention back to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you eat him?\u201d a woman asked and you winced at the question. \u201cHaven\u2019t you eaten humans before?\u201d she said before another human came and calmed the emotional woman down from asking such questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like harming humans. I admit I have\u2026 well I try not to but\u2026 yes I have eaten a few. If it makes any difference it was only after I exhausted all other options. I am a dragon so humans try to kill me a lot. If I can\u2019t run or they are threatening a human I care for than\u2026 well I do what I have to.\u201d You tried to explain but there wasn\u2019t really a nice way to say that you eat humans. You looked away for a bit then back at the man, hoping for a change in topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t very convincing. It doesn\u2019t exactly look like you\u2019ve missed a meal. You even eat your own kind so why not a human?\u201d another said and the man began to see that the situation was spinning out of control as you ducked again at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at his eyes. If that doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s bloodthirsty I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d Another man said with a raised pitchfork. With the loss of his control the leader looked at you and nodded up for you to leave while everything was relatively ok. You did the same to Kara and in a gust of both wings the crowd turned mob were taken off their feet by the wind while you and Kara took off into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy were they acting like that?\u201d Kara asked as she still didn\u2019t get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans are afraid of what they don\u2019t understand. Oddly enough they are much more respectful when they are running for their lives than if you were to have a conversation with one. But there are a few that know better like Lord Hizer, Sarah, and that little boy.\u201d you said let out a smile at it which Kara saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was cute for a human. But don\u2019t you eat dragon slayers?\u201d she asked and you just sighed and she immediately regretted the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, I have a feeling that Sir Nick is a dragon slayer to have been able to defeat so many in his life. I am technically one as I kill more dragons than any human does. I just eat the ones that put me in a corner and I find that they would eventually be a danger to Sarah. They tend to do anything to win, including using humans as bait. If that Kid wants to be a dragon slayer, hopefully there will be two dragons that he doesn\u2019t come after.\u201d You said and it was her turn to smile as she like little kids like that. In the castle they usually play on her if she isn\u2019t busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax?\u201d Kara asked but her voice tone completely changed and you waited for her to continue. \u201cAre we friends?\u201d she asked. You were just going to give a hardened answer but you could tell it was a serious question. Sure she had many humans that served her under Lord Hizer. But she wasn\u2019t really friends with any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Kara we are.\u201d You said and you could feel her joy as she flew beside you. \u201cBut don\u2019t think that means I\u2019ll go any easier on you in training.\u201d You said and she groaned while you laughed at her sudden change in reaction. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As time went by and after Kara had learned more than enough to hold her own, not against a Dark Hunter but with most others which included a deep gap between her own kind. You also started to train when you both got to the point of letting riders on you. Sarah was the only one allowed on you the two of you became a deadly combo. Kara mostly took your roll in dealing with the dragon intruders to the land but as more dragons saw humans living with dragons the more it spread. The castle started to have dragon visitors, mainly in the clans surrounding Lord Hizer\u2019s land. You and Kara had either driven out or killed every dragon and they were getting rather nervous of the power Lord Hizer had under his command. You of course weren\u2019t under his command and you made sure Lord Hizer and some others know that you and Sarah were not to be bossed around and that if they wanted you to do anything substantial that you didn\u2019t feel like doing that Sarah was the only one to convince you otherwise, even if Kara was getting closer to you and you gave and received advice with her even she knew that Sarah was in a league all to herself. So it came to her to calm you when dragon representatives came to see Lord Hizer. You would sit or lay like a statue in a corner of the room with your eyes closed to prevent an outburst. Many times you were mistaken as a statue and the dragon they smelled was Kara who was on the opposite side of Sarah as she sat between you but close enough to pet  both of you. There was only one instance where you intervened and it only took the opening of your eyes to quell the visiting dragon\u2019s attitude. Otherwise there was a constant, low, rumble in the room when another dragon was in it other than Kara that was white noise to most except for those who knew it to be your growl. It was during one of these visits when you had an unexpected surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRarely do we have two dragons plead their case to me.\u201d Lord Hizer said in starting. \u201cI am honored to have you. Should we start out with a\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe want our daughter back you thief!\u201d the female dragon roared and it hit all in the room weird. There was only one they could be talking about as they were of Kara\u2019s kind, known as Sky darts as they were near the fastest dragons in terms flying. However you remain in your posture and Sarah\u2019s hand momentarily froze as she soothed you but started back up after your growling started rumbling her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere must be some misunderstanding. I found Kara yes or rather she found me. I took care of her and had here trained but she is free to leave if she wishes. If you really are her parents than I am not the one you need to convince. I did not steel her nor am I holding her here. She stays because she wants to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInsolent human, I will hear no more of you lies!\u201d the male said and lunged forward. You would have moved but you felt as Kara\u2019s warmth left your side and you heard a round of snarls and growls as Kara got in between the dragons and Lord Hizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe may be humans.\u201d Sarah said as she pet you and the dragon\u2019s head looked to her as she spoke. \u201cBut we have been more family to Kara than you.\u201d she said in a cold tone that infuriated the male as they snarled at her. At this you opened your eyes and gazed at them while parts of your snout were rolling into their own snarl but Sarah played with them and you just gazed at the now quivering dragons in front of you. They were by no means scared of Kara as they thought themselves higher than she was, even if it was a false assumption. However you were pretty famous for your\u2026 activities and even if you weren\u2019t Dark Hunters were never taken lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah is the last human in this room you want to snarl at.\u201d Kara said. \u201cShe is the only thing keeping Max from doing what he will with you or any other dragon for that matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you protecting them our daughter? Dragons are above humans, they are nothing compared to us.\u201d the apparent mother said and was about to continue when you let out another snarl at this. Understandable since they had just insulted every human in the room including Sarah but she just soothed you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I am something to them.\u201d Kara said and her parents\u2019 heads snapped to her. \u201cMax and I have something in common we both had our parents abandon us. These humans have been and will continue to be my family. Everything I am today is because of them not for anything you\u2019ve done since throwing my egg away.\u201d After she got done with her little emotional tirade she took a breath while her birth parents took it in. They had obviously expected that she choose them over humans so this was a surprise if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do want her to go with you anyway?\u201d Sarah asked and they all looked at her including Kara. \u201cKara is loved here and we would like her to stay but of course we won\u2019t force it, that is why we want her here. But what is your reason why she should go with you?\u201d Sarah asked and Kara took a moment to soak in the LOVED word but with that little hesitation she missed her blood father\u2019s tail, perhaps instinctually, moving to impact Sarah for her words. Dragons in general weren\u2019t used to humans speaking to them and if they do they are used to being both feared and respected. They usually had the power to force such treatment. Sarah was thankfully paying attention and the moment she lifted her hand off your snout you darted forward and within inches of the tails impact it was pulled away as you grabbed the comparatively small dragon in your clawed hand, and perhaps too hard, slammed his back and wings into the stone floor. Your claw covered half of his upper torso which included a well placed claw over the base of his neck and digging in a little. The weight you were putting on him was nearly suffocating him while one of your rear legs pinned his tail so he could trash around. You snarled viciously at him with your teeth slightly open but fully showing, like you did when going for a kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFilthy dragon.\u201d You snarled as you pinned his head to the ground with your other front claws and prepared to rip out his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice came as your jaws just made contact with his neck. You froze at her word and after a little growl retracted your teeth from their target and then looked back at her. \u201cRemember? Not in here.\u201d She said. You had reluctantly agreed after the first dragon tried attacking when meeting Lord Hizer. You had of course caught the dragon in a similar fashion and ripped it apart. But it took 2 weeks to get the blood out of the room from the multiple places it went with the act. So you were not to do a like event inside if you could help it. Your muscles flexed a little in an obvious attempt to restrain them as you took the your claws off his head so he could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry that again and these walls will be coated with your blood.\u201d you growled quietly into his ear, to quite for the others to hear. It wasn\u2019t really necessary to say as he got the message quite clear already, as did the other dragon as she cowered but whimpered for her mate\u2019s safety. The site of you upon them was enough in of itself, factor in that you nearly killed him and threw in a death threat only solidified the fear. \u201cDamned rat\u2026\u201d you snarled as you took your weight off him and went back to Sarah were she calmed you until you were in your previous position. She at times had to tap a tooth that was showing to get you to cover them but you were back to a low continuous growl but you were now watching them with very attentive eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a stupid move on your part.\u201d Kara said to her parents as they recovered. \u201cMax hates other dragons, as it stands he might try to follow you after you leave to\u2026 well do whatever he does to dragons, mostly eats them. I wouldn\u2019t push him further in that direction if I were you. A little hint; he cares for Sarah more than anything so be careful how you treat her.\u201d she warned and they gave an overly frightened look to her than back to you as they steadied themselves and the male checked the small gash left over from your claw that was barley bleeding but it was still noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we have the formalities out of the way. Care to continue?\u201d Lord Hizer asked in a more authoritative voice than his earlier one.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked inside her as you had enough of it and saw a certain amount of sincerity to her words as the father nursed the cut on his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne again, it is not me you must convince.\u201d Lord Hizer said. \u201cShe is here because she wants to be. If you want her to go with you than you must convince her. I know that you are her blood parents by how you look at her. But as far as raising her as a proper dragon and the person she is. That is my doing and her dragon training was from max. We are her family and we will accept any decision she makes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara\u2026 that is the name you were given, yes?\u201d her mother asked and she nodded in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should come home with us.\u201d her father said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Kara asked rather coldly. This made both parents look at her with a mixture of anger and confusion, but they dared not to act on them from what happened last time. \u201cYou wanted me to die even before I hatched, and now that I have made some friends and family that actually care about me you want me to leave it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are not your family!\u201d her father boomed, angered that she would consider humans higher than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays you.\u201d Sarah said and they looked over at her but cautiously as they were forcd to look into your eyes as they glared at her. \u201cTrue she is a dragon and from what Lord Hizer said you are her blood family. But that is where your involvement with her ends. I am both proud and unmistaken when I consider her as my sister, and Max even closer than a brother. I love both of them more than my blood relatives and we have taken care of one another like a proper family should, regardless of if they are dragon or human. You best look for another strategy to convince her to leave because convincing her we aren\u2019t family won\u2019t work and Max trained her enough to take both of you on and still have enough energy to do a few laps so you can\u2019t force her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about it!?\u201d the mother roared but was silenced by an escalated growl from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one thing that binds Kara, Max, and I to each other. It was the reason Max left her alive in the first place and rescued me from a dragon\u2019s belly. We have all been thrown away by our parents. No matter how hard you try you can\u2019t know what that feels like. I have more in common with Kara than you do at the moment. You have nothing to force her to your side.\u201d Sarah said and with that the father began to cough up something from his storage gut. When he was done there was an egg of sorts on the ground. He put his good claw on it and tapped it just hard enough to make a sound but not damage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have this.\u201d her mother said and you felt a type of magic coming from it that you didn\u2019t recognize. You didn\u2019t know what it was but the smell only brought pain to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Another egg for you to discard?\u201d Kara asked with a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this egg was made by a combination of a blood mage and dragon fertilization. Such eggs were made in order to identify King dragons, normally in human populations.\u201d Her mother explained and you looked at Sarah and her back at you with a bit of fear. \u201cAs you know a King Dark hunter, also known as a half breed, are the scourge of both dragon and human races. Not to mention they have enough power to cause a lot of damage if left unchecked. One ability they have is to turn into either form, dragon or human at will. The vapor in this egg will force the half breed to transform into its other self thereby identifying it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead. The legends say that the half breed is a demon. There are no demons here. I will even go as far as to order the death pentalty if you can prove a half breed is here.\u201d Lord Hizer said before you could stop him. The father smirked and you knew that he was thinking one of two things. He could release the vapor and get the humans you loved so much to turn on you. Or her could use it as a blackmail tool to make you convince Kara to go with them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait don\u2019t!\u201d Sarah said but with a smile the Kara\u2019s father lifted his claw and brought it down on the egg. The vapor was like a green mist that billowed and exploded out, covering the whole room then it seemed to seep into your very skin which cleared the air but brought everyone\u2019s eyes to you. Your eyes closed and Sarah moved away as you began snarling uncontrollably as the intense pain that came with transforming took over your senses. It continued until you were completely changed but was on all fours like you were as a dragon but breathing very heavily. \u201cMax!\u201d Sarah said as she caught your falling body. The mist must have done more than just force a transformation. It must have emptied your reserves as well as part of the forced transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeize him!\u201d came Lord Hizer\u2019s voice. You didn\u2019t take offense to the action for two reasons. One he had promised something and Lord Hizer always kept his word. The second being that he had been brought up, like everyone else, to hate and fear half breeds. In fact, that was one of very few things that humans and dragons came together on. You hadn\u2019t interacted very much on a personal level with him so this action was\u2026 predictable. However before the guards could get to you and Sarah a snarl drove them back as a blue body stood over the both of you. Kara stood in a ready position to defend both of you, her fangs and teeth bared and her tail swinging in a sweep that covered her back side from any attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, what are you\u2026?\u201d started her father but was cut off by a roar from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shut up! You had no right to force your way. As far as I\u2019m concerned the only thing you\u2019ve done here is prove what kind of filthy dragon Max thought you to be. You are not getting your way in this. Max and Sarah are my family, I don\u2019t care if he is a half breed. One thing is for sure, he is no demon or he would have killed me and everyone else already, that includes you two.\u201d Kara roared at the two dragons and turned their grins into angered expressions. They were hoping that showing her \u201cfamily\u2019s\u201d lack of trust for her would force her away but this was exactly the opposite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, I\u2019m sorry my dear but the law is clear and I agree with it. Laws are there for a reason and it clearly states that half breeds must be purged. I have no choice in this.\u201d he said as he waved a hand which brought scores of guards and knights into the room, past the other dragons, and all aimed at Kara and the humans she was protecting. \u201cKara, you have one chance to stand aside before we must include you in the half breed\u2019s fate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is max! And I\u2019ll die before I give my family up.\u201d She roared and then noticed a tap on her paw from you. She kept her gaze but was now listening to your barely audible voice as you fought the fatigue that was pressing in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWall is weak behind me. Leads to the outside. Use a\u2026 fire\u2026 weaken and fly\u2026 away\u2026 fast\u2026 take Sarah.\u201d was all you could say before you passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried for the life of you to remain conscious but you couldn\u2019t and you drifted off into blackness, a weightless void until you saw a light. Nothing worked right but your body was being pulled toward it. When you finally could move your eye shot open but stayed still. You found yourself back in your cave. You recognized the smell and the cold. But then you felt warm all around you. You looked down to see Sarah cuddled into you but sandwiched between you and a blue scaly wall that took you a moment to identify as Kara. You looked up to see her wing above you like you do for Sarah when she sleeps. You looked to your right and see an eyeball looking at you. It almost made you just as the sudden realization that someone was watching you. You finally understood why humans were frightened by your eyes so much. Not that her eyes were scary but it was just the situation and the sudden realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood you\u2019re up.\u201d Said a groggy voice as Sarah lifted her head and met your eyes. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if you were going to make it after you passed out. That mist must have had poison in it because you have been out for 3 days.\u201d She said and you were noticeably surprised at the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you worry.\u201d You said and she just laid her head on your chest. \u201cI suppose this means you were able to get away.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCompared with running away from you, they were easy.\u201d Kara said and you smiled at it. \u201cEven had enough time to go the other way and lead them in the opposite direction of your previous cave.\u201d She said and with a motion that indicated you were starting to sit up she removed her wing. You braced yourself as Sarah held on to you and you leaned up against Kara\u2019s body while looking at the cave in the darkness. It hadn\u2019t changed at all, except of course their meals littering the floor in places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d You said and she looked at you confused. \u201cI\u2026 we had every intension of telling you about\u2026 me but it turned out we waited too long. We should have told you sooner.\u201d You said and her face turned to a concerned looking one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Sarah already filled me in on everything. I never really knew why your mother did what she did. Even if I still disagree with her and love the two of you\u2026 it just makes more sense now.\u201d She said and you smiled back at her with a silent thanks. \u201cIt also makes sense why you like humans so much. Not that I like them any less but you can actually become one. Still weird that you hate dragons though, but I understand that to.\u201d She said and chuckled a little but got a tired mumble from Sarah\u2019s sleeping form for the movement. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quickly recovered but for some reason you were unable to transform into full dragon form. You had been able to almost do it and each day it came a little closer but it was still not enough. However you were far from defenseless as you retained all your draconic power in your state, a fact you made painfully obvious when you resumed training with Kara and Sarah. You could easily fly and fight in human form, remembering all you had seen Sarah learn while at Lord Hizer\u2019s castle. However Kara was now the one that had to deal with intruders of sentient origin. She began to see why you had made it sound so ruff. While defending herself was a breeze, dealing with them after was almost more than she could bare emotionally. She hated eating dragons and you constantly took them away and burned them to ashes if you could. She also strongly disliked eating humans regardless if the flavor was enjoyable. If for no other reason you tried transforming daily for her sake. You promised her that you would handle them once you could and she agreed but you couldn\u2019t help see that she was feeling guilty around you and Sarah and you knew exactly why. She had tasted human flesh and being that you knew the taste you also knew she craved it, regardless of her moral objections, as did you. However you knew it was only a matter of time before someone of legitimate stature would come for you and as you heard the sound of a horse and a heavy metal thud you knew another knight was approaching as you all rested in the cave. You and Kara recognized the smell as Nick so you let him come in further than others were allowed before a confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been here before.\u201d Nick said as you all looked at him. You and Sarah were leaning comfortably on Kara\u2019s side as he approached and stopped a little ways away but close enough to be friendly. \u201cI here you have gone back to your old habits.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you heard wrong. I haven\u2019t been able to change back to dragon form for weeks now. I do take care of some of the garbage from time to time but not like I used to.\u201d You said and he lowered his head then looked back to you. \u201cAre you here to slay us Sir Nick. I would prefer not to have to fight you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNor I you, although I have slew my fair share of dragons even I know you are far beyond my skill. I am not suicidal but I did come here because I was wrecking my brain on a solution to our little conflict and I think I came up with something. The portals.\u201d He said and you all caught your breath than looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to exile us?\u201d Kara growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not all of you.\u201d he said quickly and you all listened to him in an attempt to explain. \u201cLord Hizer still has a duty to purge the King Dark Hunter but that is all the law says. It doesn\u2019t say that the purge must result in death. He still cares deeply for all of you but is caught between the law and his honor as a friend to you all. We both feel that way and so we thought hard about a way to solve this without death. Now this may sound harsh at first but please listen. We want to send Max through the portal.\u201d Nick said and before any of your could speak he continued. \u201cIf we do that and somehow Max is able to come back he will be in a loop hole. The law sais you must be purged but it only sais to do it once and it never states that you have to die. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Max comes back from one of those realms the law can\u2019t touch him.\u201d Sarah said and Nick nodded, glad that Sarah was able to sense out the advantage of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat of Sarah and Kara? If I go into the portal what will happen to them?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will have technically helped purge you so they would considered heroes and receive appropriate compensation. At which point Lord Hizer would be more than happy to look after them until your return.\u201d He said and you all started to see the positives of the suggestion. \u201cThere is one thing though that I should mention. Not a single person has ever come back from a journey through the portal. However we know it is possible because that is how humans go here in the first place. We are hoping that Max being a King will help his journey to return. So in short, there is a very strong possibility that you will be stranded there, never to return and even then it will be a while.\u201d He said and you all fell back into the weight of this decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d you asked the two beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are exiling you, which is not fair, but then again we are kind of exiled now and I miss Lord Hizer.\u201d Kara said in a pang of guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you go Max.\u201d Sarah said as tears began to grace her face. \u201cBut if you go than you will be able to return and we\u2019ll be able to live in peace or relative peace. Not to mention this is the only way to prevent more bloodshed and death. If we don\u2019t agree we will have to kill every human and dragon we see and if we accept Kara and I will be looked after. Selfishly I want you to stay but I don\u2019t want so many to die for it. So whatever you think is best.\u201d Sarah said as she buried her face in your shoulder as she thought her time might be limited with you. You cupped her head with one hand and stroked Kara\u2019s eye ridge with the other. You didn\u2019t want to leave either but if you stayed they would only be in danger. What should you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAre you ready son.\u201d Said Lord Hizer as you stood in front of a portal the size of a human. The big portals that transported dragons were in the capital but each major city had one just in case such an occasion should arise. You were able to transform back to dragon form but didn\u2019t as they advised you that any realm you went to would probably more easily accept a human over a full sized dragon that was at this point was more than 500 feet tall and proportionally long and frankly too large to expect an immediate pleasant reaction. There was no knowing for sure what realm you would be deposited in and because no on e had ever come back no one knew the first thing of what would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d You said looking back at Sarah and Kara. They were both crying as neither of them wanted you to go and in a way that made you feel good. Knowing someone on this end cares did wonders for your resolve and motivation. \u201cIf there is a way back I will find it.\u201d You assured them and they each forced a smile and you did the same, each knowing the other couldn\u2019t form a real one but not from lack of trying. You looked to Lord Hizer to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will make sure they are here when you return. They will come to no harm.\u201d He said as if he was reading your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u2026 Lord Hizer.\u201d You said and her smiled as this was the first time you addressed him so formerly and knew it was a very high level of respect for you to do so. Then you looked at the portal and with a deep breath as if you were going swimming you walked through it. As you entered you felt your breath leave you despite your efforts to keep it. You were spinning and almost suffocate as the spinning was so severe that you couldn\u2019t take a breath. You were tempted to put your wings out to slow yourself but you thought that might just break them off so you waited and hoped it would end soon. Just as you were about to pass out your lungs took in a breath. You greedily took more of it in and then a light hit your eyes as you were forced from the blackness and spat out onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dizzy and highly disoriented but alive as shapes began to form and you saw movement. You tried to smell them but that was more out of whack than your eyesight and hearing was. You grabbed your head as you nurtured the worst headache you had ever had, even after free falling and hitting your head from 2000 feet up with Kara. The trip must have been designed to level any opposition if it was a means of attack. You felt energy around you like the energy you used to walk on walls and water even air, but it was weaker as it was coming from infants. The spinning kept up and soon you found yourself dreaming. You didn\u2019t realize it at first so naturally you tried to moved but that didn\u2019t work either. When you finally noticed you were dreaming you woke yourself up but not before wondering what realm you had crashed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ok, just for clarity, the options are not there to limit someone\u2019s creativity. You don\u2019t need to stay true to either story for two reasons; 1) Max doesn\u2019t watch TV or read books, yet so he knows nothing about preserving the realms accuracy 2) Neither has a giant dragon in them so that in of its self changes things. If you want to direct it to one side or another than add and take control of the realm\u2019s accuracy or lack thereof. Just don\u2019t rip on anyone\u2019s ideas if you weren\u2019t willing to take a risk and write it yourself. That being said have fun and enjoy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You fluttered open your eyes as and they painfully adjusted to the light that was coming in from the window. Your eyes may have been overwhelmed but your body was thanking whoever put you in this bed as it soaked up its rays. You quickly sat up and placed your back against the head board and wall to hide your eye from the intense light and let them adjust more slowly. When they had your other senses came on high alert as you realized your situation. While in no immediate danger you were in a bed and some kind of nurse or maid was in the room near the door. However as soon as you looked at her she ran out of the room and called for a name you didn\u2019t understand or know. You looked down at your hands and moved them to see if you were\u2026 the way you used to be. You felt normal and grew a spike just to be sure then put it away. You looked around and you noticed you still had your vision and all your other senses were just like they were when you left. You heard down the hall as the nurse told someone you were awake and a set of footsteps came down to your door. You grabbed your head as you wondered what to do. You wanted to start looking for a way back home but you didn\u2019t even know where to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are still in pain I can call in a nurse.\u201d Said an old man as he walked in and shut the door behind him. He had a primarily red colored set of clothes with a hat that looked to be more ceremonial than having any practical use. You walked over and stood to the side as he let you take in his presence. You could sense that of all the people around you that this guy smelled and felt the most impressive as far as maturity and potential ability. The energy that you felt rivaled dragons back home, not strong ones but to even be on their level at all was remarkable for a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I... feel ok. A bit confused. Who are you? Where am I? Are you gonna try and kill me?\u201d you asked in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on there little one. You are in a Leaf Village hospital. We brought you here to heal you not to cause you any harm. But you must be far away to not know of ninja or our world. I am the third Hokage and otherwise leader of this village. Now it\u2019s your turn, what is your name?\u201d he asked in a kind manner that you studied for a few seconds then began to relax. If this man meant you any harm he sure wasn\u2019t showing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 my name is Max.\u201d you said and he smiled in response and in a way was its own reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Max, do you mind telling me where you are from? It might also help to know who it is that is trying to kill you. I wouldn\u2019t want them surprising us.\u201d he said and you looked down a thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy home is called Base realm. I was exiled and left to die for being\u2026 different. If you haven\u2019t heard of my home than it is certain that I am not being followed. I would really like to go back but no one has ever returned from exile before.\u201d You explained and the man rubbed his chin wondering who would exile a child like you. You didn\u2019t look that threatening to his eye and you looked barely 12 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I feel sorry for you and what has happened for you. Under normal circumstances I would hand you over to your village as it would only be proper. But seeming that you have none I am at a difficult spot. We can offer you a place in this village if you wish but under one condition. That is you must attend the ninja training academy. A young boy like you should be in school.\u201d He said as he looked at you with a half serious and half cheerful face. But he noticed that you still weren\u2019t completely relieved yet. \u201cWhat is it little Max? you look troubled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I assume this ninja school place is some kind of training for children my age. If that is the case I gratefully accept I just\u2026 well I don\u2019t have a place to stay. I don\u2019t want to be a burden to you. You seem nice and all but\u2026\u201d you started, not exactly sure how to say that you didn\u2019t want to be abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what you are worried about? Little one, there is plenty of room for you in the village. We\u2019ll get you set up in a dwelling of your very own before you start your schooling. How does that sound?\u2019 he said in a similar tone of voice and body language that Lord Hizer used with Kara. Like a grandparent  and a smile grew from ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you, thank you very much\u2026 MR\u2026 Sir\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d you stumbled as you weren\u2019t sure what to call him, you didn\u2019t want to be rude to this nice man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Hokage.\u201d He hinted as if telling you a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u2026 Lord Hokage.\u201d You said and thought that things couldn\u2019t have gone better for meeting your first human in this new realm. Not only was he the leader but he was an insanely nice man. You weren\u2019t concerned with whatever school they had as you had watched Sarah study and, due to the King\u2019s genetic knowledge, you were already pretty smart. Sarah used to tease that you were only half as smart as she was and it was probably true but that was like comparing a stone to a mountain so you took it as a compliment. Either way you were looking forward to what was coming up for you. Despite the urge to get home you almost immediately felt the need to help this man or at the very least do whatever he told you to do. It was strange but you felt more at ease at this moment than you had ever felt in your whole life. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were put in a dwelling and while it was small you didn\u2019t really care. You didn\u2019t need a human dwelling that much anyway. It was just there to keep your books and other school or human related things. You were delighted to learn that the Ninja training was rather interesting. You always felt energy inside you but other than using it to fly, help you climb, or fight you didn\u2019t know about these things called Jutsu, techniques that could be used by using your energy or \u201cChakra\u201d as they liked to call it. The learning of these jutsu or other things weren\u2019t hard, in fact they were so easy you began going and inventing your own jutsu or copying ones you saw the older ninja do. You particularly liked shadow related and transformation jutsu. With this new understanding you developed a more instantaneous way to go from Human to Dragon form and it didn\u2019t hurt that much. Well it did but it was kind of like jumping into the water rather than slowly wading into it. You only experimented a few times so not to reveal your true nature to anyone. However certain Jounin level ninja looked at you different if you did too well on school stuff so you toned it down a little. Your classmates were pretty much all wimps except one kid. You could feel his energy and it almost rivaled yours although it wasn\u2019t all his. It was like there was something inside him that was like having a living power plant in his body. The kid was always getting into trouble but you looked past it, as well as all the cold stares he got and saw he was a rather interesting kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, show me. I need to learn how to do the Shuriken Jutsu.\u201d Naruto said as he begged you for the hundredth time to teach you. He was far from pathetic but he was nowhere near the other students either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just need to practice. There is no magic trick to learn it Naruto. That\u2019s the trick with any Jutsu really.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d he started and you could see you weren\u2019t going to get any sleep or rest from this kid unless you helped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you got some Shuriken?\u201d you asked and he responded with twirling a few on his fingers. \u201cOk, hit these marks.\u201d You said and you made marks in a practice board then stood between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026 get out of the way.\u201d He said a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the way. You can see all the targets and I have seen you hit your mark in class. So hit them. If you miss I\u2019ll be dead.\u201d You said without flinching at all or having the slightest amount of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. I\u2019m not going to throw them while you\u2019re standing there.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou asked for my help and this is it. If you can\u2019t do it than just say so.\u201d You said and you could tell her was battling with his pride and his morals. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll make it easier on you.\u201d You said and threw a Kunai with a paper bomb on it right behind him. \u201cIf you try to run it will go off and if you don\u2019t throw a Shuriken in the next 30 seconds it will go off. So throw one and don\u2019t miss. The only way to get out of this and neither of us dying is if you hit one of these marks. Time starts now.\u201d You said as the paper bob started to fizz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c20 seconds.\u201d You said in a calm tone that you rarely differed from. He held one Shuriken and aimed, sweat rolling off his face. Then with 5 seconds to go he threw it than closed his eyes, hearing a thud as it hit its mark. The fizzing behind him stopped and the knife disappeared in a puff of white smoke, signaling a deactivated clone. He looked up at you, afraid of what he might see and to his surprise and relief his shuriken was planted in one of the marks, dead center. \u201cLesson complete.\u201d You said in a casual tone as he fell over. You came over to him as he panted with exhaustion. \u201cDon\u2019t doubt yourself so much. I knew you could hit the mark and I was right. Now you need to see it. You can do anything you put your mind to.\u201d You said with a pat on his shoulder than walked away. \u201cSee you in class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that point Naruto never really asked you for any help with his training but every time he threw a shuriken in class he looked over at you than always hit his mark. Other than that he was in constant competition with just about everyone, especially some Uchiha kid that was always above him. You watched as a stead rivalry grew but the lonely kid that played jokes on people never did it to you. Mainly because your little training had scared the crap out of him not to mention it caused him mto have a deep respect for you that he would never admit to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept as far away from the spot light as you could and observed everything you could. Sometimes you would go to the great stone faces and just stare over the village as you watched them below. Your senses could observe them in great detail as well as when the leaf ninja silently protected the village from random threats that were dealt with so quick that word never even reached the crowds the fight was held in. Every once in a while you felt someone watching you but that was fine. You just didn\u2019t do anything worth mentioning when you felt that feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou steadily made your way with the class and eventually graduated with Naruto. It was quite a surprise to see him graduate but then again you felt he had enough potential and saw a future beyond his troublemaking antics. You wondered as you sat waiting for the announcement of your Jounin instructor what was going to happen. Teams usually consisted of four members which meant three students for each instructor. However with you in the class there was one extra and you wondered how you would be sorted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were pleasantly surprised when you got assigned to the same group as Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. The other three all had different reactions. Naruto was excited about being in the same group as Sakura but disliked being with Sasuke and almost crapped his pants when you were named as well. Sakura was highly irritated when she heard Naruto was in her group but that was overshadowed when Sasuke\u2019s name was mentioned, she really didn\u2019t know or care on your presence. Sasuke just looked like someone had shoved a pencil up his butt, you could tell he didn\u2019t dig the whole team thing. When you were all dismissed you waited around in case they wanted to meet up but they all went their separate ways. You really didn\u2019t need lunch so you just sat in the window soaking up the sun as you waited. Class was over so there wasn\u2019t really a reason to sit in a proper desk and you watched as the other teams left. When Kakashi finally showed up and told the team what he thought of them \u201ca couple of idiots\u201d you just silently followed him out the door until you were all sitting down and introducing yourselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you.\u201d Kakashi said as you were last in introducing yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Max. I like learning new things and making true friends. I hate dragons. My hobby is observing people and learning about them. My dream for the future is to gain a family and get home.\u201d You said as each topic brought up a different set of emotions but to the untrained eye were invisible from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons. There is no such thing as dragons.\u201d Sakura said in an almost degrading manner but also to show off her knowledge to Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, I still hate them.\u201d You said with a clear bloodlust in your eyes but only Kakashi saw it and that was only for a second until it went away. Your tone of voice however got Naruto to flinch but otherwise nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, you each have your own unique ideas. We\u2019ll have our first mission tomorrow.\u201d Kakashi said and they again bombarded him with questions and he answered them in an elusive yet skillful manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he dismissed you and you went straight to the practice field to wait. There were three posts and you leapt on one then sat on it with your leg draped over the side of it. It was early the next morning when the other kids came and late in the morning when Kakashi got there. You all stood and took in your task as he presented you with two bells and easily subdued Naruto as he tried to attack before Kakashi said \u201cstart\u201d but once he did you faded into the forest and used your heightened predatory instinct to outmaneuver him. You watched as beat a few of naruto\u2019s attacks back without breaking a sweat as Naruto plunged into the river. You had preiously tried to speak with the other two but Sasuke told you to get lost and Sakura said something similar as her one and only concern was Sasuke. So you waited for Naruto as he was flung into the river then got stuck in a trap. You waited as Kakashi was attacked by Sasuke then left to \u201cteach\u201d the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Naruto.\u201d You said as you threw a shuriken and cut his rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah what do you want you crazy coot?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought you might want to work together to get the bells.\u201d You said as you threw another shuriken and cut a rope of another trap he was about to step into. You then walked to him and he finally located you as you had made your voice come from a different direction in case Kakashi was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet real.\u201d He said as he crossed his arms and turned away. \u201cI already figured out how to win.\u201d He said and before you could say anything else he ran off and you were left alone in the field. You sighed then slipped back into the forest and pursued Kakashi as he subdued the others one by one with a variety of basic moves and jutsu until he was lecturing Sasuke then took off a little. He was still reading when you appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot to admit, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Kakashi said as he still had half his attention in his book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t see me take these either.\u201d You said as you held up the two bells. He felt down and saw the wooden replicas that you had coated with a light Genjutsu so they seemed real. You then threw them to him and he caught them, confusion on his face. \u201cI tried to work with them to have them help. But they aren\u2019t much for the whole team thing yet. If you need to send someone back then send me. They may be rough around the edges but I can see they have potential.\u201d You said then started walking to the posts where you smelled Naruto already. You walked back to the posts while Kakashi went ahead and tied Naruto to one. You leaned against another post as Kakashi explained their position and their lack of teamwork despite your efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know that Max was able to take the bells.\u201d Kakashi said and they were shocked them looked at you as you sat there and looked down a little as they stared at you. \u201cHe said that if I was going to send anyone back that he should be the one, that is what teamwork is supposed to be like.\u201d He said than lecture them some more and gave them a second chance and left them to eat lunch but gave specific instructions not to feed Naruto. After a little while they heard Naruto\u2019s stomach growl and then gave in and fed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you helping? And why aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d Sakura asked when she and Sasuke saw you still weren\u2019t moving from your spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lunch. I don\u2019t need one. You only need food if you need to build up strength by nourishing our bodies. I have conditioned mine so I don\u2019t need to eat as much. As for helping, if Naruto would just push out than he would see that his ropes were cut from a Shuriken I threw 5 minutes ago.\u201d You said still not looking at them. You heard Naruto push out and with some effort his ropes fell free. At this point Kakashi came back and tried to scare the four of you but the others stood firm and after a little deliberation he looked to you as he pressured them. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them to do it. Looks like they figured it out all by themselves. Although I might have thrown a shuriken and it just might have lodged into the post at a downward angle that cut his ropes free.\u201d You said with a smile, completely unaffected from Kakashi\u2019s theatrics. After that he congratulated them at the aspect of passing and lecture them about the nature of those who abandon their friends, being worse than scum. As he dismissed the four of you he had questions for you as did the others but both wanted to ask you in secret but were unsure of when or how. You were obviously allot more experienced than you let on but they couldn\u2019t nail down why it bothered them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Kakashi said as the others on the mission to escort the bridge builder to the land of waves lay asleep while you leaned against a tree and watched over them. You needed very little rest when traveling in the sun all day so it was not strain to stay alert at night. You looked to him as he took a seat to the side of you so he could both face you and the others as well. \u201cAre you going to tell me or am I going to have to guess?\u201d he asked. You looked down for a moment then back up and more into the night then at anything in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much to say. I\u2019m sure you were told that I wasn\u2019t born here and probably were told every event from the point I arrived to now. What no one knows is why I was exiled. I told the Third that I was exiled for being different but I didn\u2019t tell him what that meant. He probably thought I was just a victim of some random family feud that left me stranded in the village or something like that.\u201d You said and paused for a moment and looked up to the sky as you longed to soar in it like you used to. Kakashi seemed to pick up on this as he too looked up than back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team Max. You can trust us.\u201d he said in a kind tone like the third addressed you with and made you look at him with your red but not glowing dragon eyes. Most people just thought your eyes were weird and didn\u2019t bother asking about them. After all in the world of the ninja there were far more impressive eyes than your human looking ones, even if they retained some draconic traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I can. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want to lose that. I guess there is no easy way to say it.\u201d You said and waited a second for Kakashi to ready his mind then continued. \u201cI am only half human. I can change from human to my other form at will while losing none of my abilities or power. That is how I am so advanced in most areas. I am what my people call a Half Breed. They exiled me for it and here I am.\u201d You explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are half human than what is your other half?\u201d he asked and you looked to make sure the others were still sleeping then looked him deep in the eye as he looked to be gathering information like a true ninja would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon. I am half human half dragon but stronger than both.\u201d You said and he looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he said perhaps a little too loud not enough to wake anyone. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he asked as he settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You said as you flashed your eyes red so he could see them then turned them back to human again. \u201cI can grow dragon parts at will like wings, horns, teeth, eyes, tail, and scales to name a few. Actually transforming is quite painful and even though I have made a Jutsu to help make it more instantaneous but I still don\u2019t look forward to it.\u201d You now looked away as you continued. \u201cI did a little research on what the equivalent power measurements are. According to the records my Chakra level is higher than the nine tailed fox.\u201d As you said this his eye strained in surprise as well as concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, you said you hate dragons.\u201d He said as if trying to discout part of your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. When I just hatched my mother tried to kill me. She hated me and after doing her best to rip me apart she threw me off a cliff for what I am. After I was well again and she heard rumors of me alive she sent some dragons kill me so I ran and hid until I could defend myself. After I grew to full size and had enough power to confront them I was permanently bias against dragons then from that point I killed and ate them whenever I saw one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate them?\u201d he asked as his expression changed a little as he saw how answering his questions were effecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragons are big and if I just kill them than not only does meat go to waste but another smells the scent and it becomes a never ending cycle of search and attack after that point. If I eat them or burn all the evidence than they wouldn\u2019t come, but burning it would again waste meat. Another reason I kill them is that dragons tend to have a superiority complex towards humans. Most in my realm eat humans and push their weight around as much as they could. Just another reason why I hate them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have never eaten a human?\u201d he asked and you winced at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is complicated. I tend not to spread me being a dragon around because of slayers that rise up to kill me. Not just me but everyone around. Most slayers are so cold they would sacrifice their own mother to get a better chance to slay a dragon. I tried to run and turn them away but eventually they put me in a corner and I have to fight back. Like I said before, their scent would attract dragons as well so if I have to kill them I eat them so not to draw dragons around which would cause me and the villages I protect any more problems. On my realm, I sadly have eaten quite a few humans like that. If it makes any difference, I haven\u2019t killed anyone since I got here.\u201d You said and Kakashi looked at you in a stunned glance than up to the stars as he thought about what you told him. He then sighed and looked back to you. \u201cSo what now?\u201d you asked as you looked down and expected the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that you were right not to spread your\u2026 other side around.\u201d He said and you waited for his decision. \u201cWe will eventually have to tell people and they should be some of the first.\u201d In a clear tone that he was ok with your condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you are ok with me being a Half Breed?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinja are used to large animals around, we summon them to fight like the fourth did against the Nine Tailed Fox. You being half human is all I need to know to accept you. You being half dragon just adds an extra skill set that I can really on in the future.\u201d He said and you looked up at him as he placed a hand on your shoulder. \u201cYou can trust us Max.\u201d he repeated and you looked deep in his eyes as yours looked full of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Kakashi Sensei, you don\u2019t know how much that means to me.\u201d You said as you looked away and wiped some tears that leaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk about your assets one the way back so the rest of team knows. Until then just act like you have and if you have to use your\u2026 other side than say it is a Jutsu and make it believable.\u201d He instructed and you nodded to which he smiled warmly at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walked it wasn\u2019t long before you started to smell some other ninja in the area. You told Kakashi about it and he noticed as well. They were comparatively low level to him so he told you to let them come so he could assess what they are after. You obeyed and walked along with them until you passed a puddle. You both glanced discretely at it then when two ninja\u2019s attacked you Kakashi feigned his death to observe. You grabbed the bridge builder and put some distance between him and the attacking ninja while the others attempted to fight him. You stood guard and ready as the two came after him. You looked over at a tree where Kakashi was and he nodded that you could take them out but, as he said before, not kill them. He needed to question them so you used a wire attaching to Kunai and threw it so that they were pulled to a tree and the wire wrapped around them. You quickly ran forward and with a gut punch knocked them both out. You removed them of their weapons and neatly placed them off to the side. After addressing the others and the bridge builder he dealt with them and you all headed off when Naruto drained the poison he got from the two ninja. The bridge builder explained on a boat ride about hireing them and the ninja that were after him, under the employ of Gatou. So when you got to shore you were on your way to the Builder\u2019s home. Naruto was mad embarrassed by Sasuke saving him so he went off as you and Kakashi looked around for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d You said and the others looked at you but Kakashi nodded as you both were on high alert. Just as you pinpointed the attacking Jounin a large sword came into view as it was hurled and narrowly missed everyone as they dodged then a man you didn\u2019t recognize stood on the its hilt as it buried itself in a tree, which made the miss look intentional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked and Kakashi introduced Zabuza to the group as well as being introduced in return. The Sharingan was introduced and the fight began while you and the others took protective stances to guard Tazuna. No one could see them as you were only looking one way but your eyes glowed as your full dragon vision was observing every move this Zabuza made. You followed him and noticed some Chakra appear behind you and you knew it to be a water clone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Zabuza said which got everyone in the group gurading Tazuna flinch except you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell it is.\u201d You said and your tail came out of your back, cutting the clone in half than retracting before even Kakashi noticed completely but he was able to fill in parts from what you told him before. To most everyone it looked like the man just exploded in water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice move, for a kid.\u201d Said Zabuza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYours is a little overdone. But I guess whatever works, for an old man.\u201d You retorted back and a growl that sounded comical to you came from the mist around you. Zabuza came out and tried attacking you but Kakashi came and took him out but it was only another water clone. Zabuza sliced Kakashi in half but Kakashi had copied the water clone Jutsu and came up behind him. That one was also a water clone and Zabuza finally attacked the real Kakashi and it ended up sending Kakashi into the water to which Zabuza used the water prison Jutsu and sealed him in a sphere of water. At this you all were scattered out of your previous formation. \u201cThat\u2019s a little more like it.\u201d You complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, the kid is impressed. Glad you enjoyed it. Now that the main threat is out of the way\u2026\u201d he said as he formed a water clone and it moved to confront the group. The others tried attacking it but the clone was easily more powerful than they were. And soon you were the only one between the clone and Tazuna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mr. Tazuna. You aren\u2019t afraid of fire are you?\u201d you asked him as you tried to figure out a way to protect him and fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot especially.\u201d He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, don\u2019t move and you won\u2019t get burned.\u201d You said then started a Jutsu that you were working on. Zabuza watched as your made your final hand sign then place your hands on the ground. The ground began to rumble and seconds later a large barrier of fire rose and surrounded Tazuna. The barrier was special as it was hot enough to render steel to ash but on the inside it didn\u2019t cause any ill effects to even a leaf that was inside. Using the distraction Naruto worked together with Sasuke and was able to break the water prison apart by a complicated bunch of team work and a well thrown Shuriken, which was actually Naruto. The whole thing was rather impressive and while the clone looked at what he missed you sliced him in half then joined Sasuke and Sakura as you watched while the freed Kakashi started to fight again. \u201cNice move.\u201d you said and Naruto joined you and laughed as they watched Zabuza fight with Kakashi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got lucky. But you\u2026?\u201d Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, how did you do that?\u201d Sakura asked as she looked at the wall of flames that protected Tazuna from even to water flying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI live by myself, what do you think I do when I wasn\u2019t at school? I am particularly efficient at fire type Jutsu so I created my own set of Jutsu that utilizes it.\u201d You said and they looked at the wall of flames then their attention was snapped back as Kakashi was forming water dragons and you almost growled at the site of them. In fact a little bit of it escaped and the other two noticed as you released the fire barrier and Tazuna was able to watch the show as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, you hate dragons.\u201d Sakura said as they looked at the two water dragons right as did their masters underneath. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d she asked Tazuna as he was splashed with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t see anything from in there but I\u2019m alive.\u201d He said as you all watched the fight. You could sense another ninja watching but with all the mist, commotion, and the water washing off all the scent you couldn\u2019t smell where the other one was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were all slightly surprised when the other ninja finished off Zabuza with ease and after a little explanations on tracker ninja he took Zabuza to \u201cdeal with the remains\u201d. Naruto didn\u2019t like him getting away but was calmed by Kakashi but when you all started moving Kakashi started to fall and you quickly caught his suddenly unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened? Kakashi Sensei!\u201d Naruto exclaimed as the others rushed over. You could here his heart beating in a pattern that indicated extreme exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s ok, just tired. His Sharingan must be hard to use and it must take its toll on his body. Zabuza was no lightweight you know.\u201d You said and they all felt a little better at this and as you picked him up. \u201cWe should get him to a place where he can rest properly.\u201d You said and Tazuna started to escort the four of you to his house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make a mark at the highest point without using your hands then try to get past it the next time.\u201d Kakashi explained as he started the tree climbing exercise with your squad to help your ability to control chakra but you already knew how. Heck you could climb trees, walk on water, and even walk on air to an extent but that last one was extremely tiring so you rarely did it. However it was useful if you had to slow your decent in a free fall if your wings weren\u2019t usable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the knife Kakashi gave you and watched as each of you picked a tree. You didn\u2019t even both running and just climbed it with hardly any effort at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201d you asked as you hung in a similar position as Kakashi was, on a branch and held to the bottom of it with your chakra. You gave Kakashi a look as if to say \u2018You expected any less?\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you good at everything?\u201d Naruto asked, thoughtly confused and irritated that once again you were far above his skill level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said. I live alone so I have a lot of time to learn this kind of stuff. I admit I wasn\u2019t aware of the precise mechanics of why it works but I still can do it all the same.\u201d You answered then dropped to the ground while Kakashi made his way as well. \u201cBut it looks like Sakura has a good handle on it as well.\u201d you said as Naruto and Sasuke both looked at her while she was sitting on a high branch smiling. Kakashi addressed each of them with praise and motivation and afterwards he left you there to help them if they needed it while he went back to Tazuna\u2019s place. You then sat against the tree and watched as the three of them worked on it. Naruto finally had enough of falling down and knew better than to ask you for help in this kind of stuff so he went to Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d asked Sasuke as Naruto refused to help him in telling him what Sakura told him. They were after all fierce rivals and pride would dictate a certain amount of hostility but also a healthy cooperation when needed. \u201cWhat is the secret to doing this?\u201d he asked and you saw Naruto laugh as he remembered his training lesson with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will help.\u201d You said as you touched his feet and they immediately began to burn. The burning didn\u2019t injure him but it did all the other things that standing on hot coals would feel like. \u201cNow you don\u2019t have to climb the tree. Just concentrate your chakra like you should when you climb the tree. If you bring the right amount the burning will stop. After you reach the top of that tree the effect will wear off and you will have learned how to do it.\u201d You said and he first plunged his feet in water but it didn\u2019t help at all. Finally he concentrated and as he brought chakra to his feet and they began to feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell! I asked for help not for torture!\u201d He yelled at you but cringed as his concentration moved and he brought it back to soothing his feet. Then he looked to a laughing Naruto. \u201cWhat is it looser?\u201d he said and Sakura looked at him then you as if you had committed a crime then to Naruto to hear his anser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is how Max helps train people. You\u2019re lucky, when he trained me on how to throw a Shuriken he threw a paper bomb Kunai next to me and gave me 30 seconds to hit a mark he set near his head. If I missed he died and if I ran or took longer than 30 seconds the paper bomb would have killed me. He definitely taught me how to throw a Shuriken. That is just how he trains people.\u201d He said as Sasuke worked on it as you looked at him with an unwavering gaze. He walked around as he learned and Naruto got higher and higher. Finally as Naruto was able to get to the top Sasuke also was able to do so and the burning stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d Sakura said after you got back and you all ate dinner. She had waited for the others to rest before talking to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been nice if Zabuza came by and they weren\u2019t ready either. It helped didn\u2019t it?\u201dyou asked and she looked at you then after thinking for a while then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t teach me anything.\u201d She said and you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise to wait for you to ask before I set your feet on fire.\u201d you responded and she nodded again with her smile then went off to sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even when the others were having some trouble you were told to let them handle it so you did. You were surprised to sense the massive amount of chakra when Naruto went berserk for a moment but that only lasted a short while. You also constantly watched as each fought and put every Jutsu you saw into your memory, more particularly Kakashi\u2019s lighting blade. But when everything was said and done Gatou came forward, approaching the dying Zabuza and the already dead Haku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got this.\u201d you said as you stepped in between the large crowd led by Gatou and the others. They looked at you as if you were crazy. \u201cI just need to stretch my legs a little.\u201d You said as you let your eyes glow in the clearing mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only need to take out Gatou. Don\u2019t kill anyone else.\u201d Kakashi instructed and the rest of them now looked at him the same way they looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it. Didn\u2019t want to kill them all anyway.\u201d You said as you started to run at a speed they could all follow. You made a bee line straight for him and when necessary went through someone but, true to your word, didn\u2019t kill them. Gatou was at the edge at this point and with one quick move you took out an edged spike and cut him in half vertically. His insides spat out into the water as he fell off the bridge and the two sides of him plummeted into the water, staining it red. You then looked back at them and let out a low growl that shook the immediate area. The large group was stunned and scarred out of their minds at what you did. \u201cBeat it.\u201d You said as you nodded to their boat. You got no argument as they trample over each other to get off. They would have ran toward the tired ninja but the whole town had come to help drive them away. After they left you walked over to Zabuza as he lay next to Haku, soon to be joining him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he spat and as it stood Kakashi was the only one in earshot of him or you so you knelt down to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a Leaf Village Ninja.\u201d You said simply and he looked at Kakashi who nodded to him then returned his gaze to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d was his last words as he faded out, getting one last look at Haku and the snow that was falling. This battle was over and he left in a strange form of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater.\u201d You waved as your squad left the village. Naruto was almost Idolized in the village by that point and the bridge was completed so your team\u2019s mission was over. Tazuna asked you a few times about yourself but you gave patented answers but ones he accepted. You also had helped bury Zabuza and Haku. But for now you drove that from your mind and followed the others as they all said their goodbyes and you started back to the Leaf Village. However you wondered as you left if Kakashi was going to make you tell the others or to transform for that matter. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had stopped for lunch and were talking about the mission. Your own abilities, not to mention your previously glowing eyes, were mentioned more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, crap.\u201d You sighed as you hung your head a little in an attempt to brace yourself of even the idea of transforming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for what?\u201d Naruto asked as he was the more vocal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the way to the land of waves Max shared something that we both agreed should be kept a secret but not from us. We are all a team and no matter our differences it is safe to say we all care a great deal for one another. Which also means that we trust each other.\u201d Kakashi explained. You rubbed your head and neck, hoping you didn\u2019t have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so special?\u201d Sasuke asked and you looked at Kakashi who nodded for you to continue and so you did. You didn\u2019t think that just words would be good enough so you let your eyes glow again and then grew wings and a tail. They looked on, including Kakashi as this was his first time seeing any dragon part of you, with surprise and amazement as you swished your tail and flexed your wings than returned them to your back and changed your eyes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that?\u201d Naruto asked as he was usually the first one to blurt things out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uhh\u2026 They are my wings and tail. I can form them in human form along with other aspects of my\u2026 other side.\u201d you explained and rubbed your head to try to find a better way to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat other side? What are you talking about?\u201d Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d you started then looked again at Kakashi who was now next to you and placed a hand on your shoulder in support. \u201cI am only half human. My other half is\u2026 Dragon. I am a Half Breed and can transform into either side at will but retain all my abilities no matter what form I\u2019m in.\u201d you started, trying to get as much information in at one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Dragons don\u2019t exist!\u201d Sakura said and you just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have to show you then. Damn this is going to hurt.\u201d You said as you got up and walked to an open part of the field. You didn\u2019t lose nearly as much energy as before and if you used the Jutsu you made it was better. But you had a feeling that they wouldn\u2019t believe you if you did it in one big poof so you prepared yourself to change. \u201cKeep everyone back. I\u2019m going to do it slow so you can see it, which is going to make this hurt like hell.\u201d You said to Kakashi and he nodded to you. You started and as you punched at the ground and began changing the others almost immidiatly tried to help and were confused as to why Kakashi wouldn\u2019t let them. But little by little they watched as your grunts, yells, and sometimes a scream turned into snarls, growls, and bared teeth. After you had changed you stood there breathing heavy, like usual, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as before. Besides it was a while since you had been in dragon form so you stretched out and flexed your wings than gave them a few courtesy flaps before turning your huge frame to your team. Your gaze was no doubt frightening as they had never seen a dragon before. They went on alert and raised their guard as you brought your head down to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax?\u201d Sakura asked, hoping it was still you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still me. This is what I look like as a dragon.\u201d You said and took this as a sign to lay down to appear less threatening as well as lowering your head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d you said as if reading most of their thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why were you growling and snarling at us?\u201d Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt hurts a lot to transform. I developed a Jutsu to help it become more instantaneous but I thought you four deserved to see if done the original way first.\u201d You said then as your moving mouth was still unnerving them a bit you placed it on the ground and sighed. It took a few moments before you saw Kakshi come over to you. He had his Sharigan out and you could see he was on his toes. You thought he would be ready for it after you told him but to his credit he was holding together quite well. He reached out a hand while the other held a Kunai. His hand eventually made contact with your snout. You looked at him then away as your eyes were causing him to shake a little. After a good deal of time he straightened and put away his knife. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You backed your head up a little so talking didn\u2019t cause a heart attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for all that, I know what I look like.\u201d You said slightly off but holding it together for now. He smiled, or at least you think he did with his face almost completely covered with his ninja gear. He then called the others over and you backed your head away a little but stopped when Kakashi motioned for you to move forward as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dragon.\u201d Sakura said in amazement. \u201cOh sorry, half dragon.\u201d She corrected herself, hoping the 500 foot tall dragon before her wouldn\u2019t take offense to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is why you are so good at fire jutsu?\u201d Sasuke asked and you nodded slowly as any quick movement seemed to scare them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re like me.\u201d Naruto said and the others looked at him. \u201cWell not exactly like me but\u2026 you have a great power inside you that everyone is afraid of.\u201d He said as he grabbed as the seal on his stomach. By this point you all had your suspicions of what was inside him. You knew from the research you did that it was the Nine Tailed Fox. It was probably the reason you seamed connected to him sense you came to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d was all you could say and looked away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I?\u201d said Sakura as she came a little closer with her hand out in an obvious petting or at least touching gesture. You responded by slowly bringing your head down to her and made contact with her hand. Her heart rate quickened as she rubbed around your snout. You closed your eyes and rested your head on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m touching a dragon. This can\u2019t be real.\u201d She said with more fascination than fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we need to get moving.\u201d Kakashi said which broke all their concentration on you. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you carry us Max. You may not be able to fly without causing a panic but it would save a lot of time, even if you are just walking. Not to mention we can get to know you in this\u2026 form while we travel.\u201d He suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I guess that works. But if any of you tell me to giddy up or any of that crap you\u2019re walking.\u201d You said in a comical tone indicating that you weren\u2019t a pack animal but would carry them if they were polite about it. You were still unsure about others riding you other than Sarah but Kakashi had a point, as he usually did. The others tensed as you said it but were overall more relaxed that you were telling jokes instead of snarling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Naruto asked as he was the first to jump on. He was referring to the spike you strapped him down with. You snaked your head around to where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t have you falling off if you fall asleep.\u201d You said and he just shook his head and agreed as there wasn\u2019t much he could do about it. The rest got on and you did the same for them. When they were all comfortable you started to walk silently through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know for how big you are, you can sure move quietly and pretty fast.\u201d Naruto said and the others looked at him as if they weren\u2019t ready for him to ask such questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to be to catch food like this. Toppling over trees tends to scare off all the wildlife.\u201d You responded and he nodded in understanding but was interrupted by a rumble from your stomach which made them all turn pale. \u201cSpeaking of which, do you mind if I catch something to eat?\u201d you asked and they all agreed, secretly relieved that they weren\u2019t on the menu. You crept through the woods and soon came upon a herd of deer. You snatched a few that didn\u2019t look to important to the herd and wolfed them down in gulps, you didn\u2019t think that your passengers would like to see you tearing into your meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you always swallow your food like that?\u201d Asked Naruto with another set of looks for the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, if I can I like to savor them and take my time with them. I just didn\u2019t think you four would like to see me eating them like that so I just skipped a step.\u201d You said and they again nodded and thanked you for your consideration. For the rest of the trip they asked you questions and Naruto always tended to ask the ones you didn\u2019t want to answer. But by the time you were half way home they had asked and learned everything that you had ever experienced and fell asleep on your back. You were glad it went so well but you hoped that if anyone else found out that it would go just as smooth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you all got settled back at the village you all went on more D rank missions. They were still a little nervous around you despite you being in human form but they quickly got over it as you helped with the missions a great deal. Naruto was too busy anyway competing with Sasuke to dwell on it for too long. Kakashi had you talk to the Hokage about your dragon half. You were once again pleasantly surprised at his kindness even when you transformed for him. He was certainly a very exceptional man. He agreed to keep your nature as closely guarded as Naruto\u2019s condition. He had to let curtain people know in case they needed you but it had yet to affect you at all. After a little bit you began smelling other scents in the village that you didn\u2019t recognize and you were particularly interested in one of them that smelled like Naruto as far as potential power output goes. You hoped onto a fence that overlooked a squabble between a newcomer and Naruto. The guy that Naruto was yelling at had a weird outfit on and had something on his back, wrapped in bandages. He was holding up Konohamaru in a rather rough manner. You were quiet enough that no one had notice you sitting on the fence as you were. You then spit a little flame at his wrist that was barely larger than a needle but effective enough to make him drop Konohamaru and put out the little flame from is clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, I can here you from across the village. Ninja are suppose to be quite.\u201d You said and he stubbornly turned his head then consoled the little kids while keeping a lot of attention on the two that were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to do that.\u201d Said Sasuke as he juggled a rock in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t wait for you every time. I get board to. Besides these three smell weird.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, more weaklings to piss me off.\u201d The painted face guy said as you could see a little embarrassment. \u201cNot to mention dumb as a rock. Can\u2019t you leaf ninja count? One, two, where do you see a third?\u201d he asked in a clear attempt to demean you. You simply pointed to a branch next to the one but on the other side of the truck that Sasuke was on. His face immediately drained of color as he saw a red haired boy with a gourd of sand on his back. The one that was then addressed as Kankurou started to stutter out excuses until he was silenced by the one they called Gaara, under the threat of death no less. The girl named Temari had mostly kept her mouth shut so she just went along with it. You could also see Gaara assess you and Sasuke before he started to walk away. They were stopped by Sakura asking questions and was answered by Termari informing her they were here for the chuunin exams. Sasuke and Gaara exchanged names and as you remained relatively silent Gaara almost overlooked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is your name?\u201d he asked. You leapt of the fence and landed near Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, just Max. Can I ask you a question?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou answered mine so I\u2019ll answer one of yours.\u201d He informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll make it quick. You seem\u2026 different than most people. I know about certain seals of certain\u2026 things that they seal in people. My question is do you have a similar situation?\u201d  you asked in a cryptic tone that you saw him understand right away. In a way his reaction was all you needed to know he had a tailed beast in him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer if it too personal. I understand that some things must remain hidden.\u201d You said and the boy turned and started walking as if holding something back. You turned to the rest of them. \u201cWell that was fun.\u201d You said sarcastically than started to walk off. Soon you were called with the others and Kakashi gave each of you Chuunin exam applications. You took it and went off. You observed many other Genin from other lands and was attacted by Iruka as a test. A test that was over as you easily identified him and he left agreeing that you were ready. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched and almost laughed at the other candidates\u2019 attempts to intimidate you. They were all a little cross with your group because yours was the first in the exam\u2019s history to have more than 3 people in it. But you just kept you composure and made it to the written test. Ibiki was good at getting under peoples skin but you weren\u2019t effected at all. You looked at the test and before he even said start you had all the answers figured out, one of few perks behind having memorized every word of every book you could find. Originally you did that to learn obscure Jutsu or help you create others but it formed a double purpose. As soon as he said start you magically wrote the answers down and flipped over your test. This caught the attention of a sentinel but because you were doing absolutely nothing accept leaning back he couldn\u2019t do much about it. However that was what you looked like you were doing, you were really figuring a way to help your team mates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d you said in their minds and each of them jumped a little. They knew you could read minds from their questioning while you were a dragon but this was the first time you talked to them like this. \u201cDon\u2019t react just look down and act like you are concentrated on your test.\u201d You thought to them and they did so. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all figured out that this test is actually designed for you to cheat so it can test your ability to gather intelligence. I already finished my test so I am going to magically fill your tests out. Just don\u2019t react and act like you are working on it while I do. Then turn them over so no one can cheat off your answers.\u201d You instructed and you saw their bodies twitch and Naruto nodded a little but not enough to arise suspicion. At that point you took your answers and magically filled their tests out like a magical stamp. Within 5 minutes it was all done and they all turned their tests over. \u201cNow they can\u2019t nail us for cheating. It may be obvious that we did something but I can read that they can\u2019t figure out what. So we pass and don\u2019t worry about the last question. If needed, I\u2019ll answer that one as well.\u201d you thought to them. Naruto was laughing a little but otherwise the others just relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you are doing?\u201d asked Ibiki as you opened your eyes from feigning sleep. He was trying to be intimidating but you just looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking a nap.\u201d You said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this is a joke?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s the Chuunin exams. We already finished and you can grade them if you like. But I\u2019m not about to act like I am paying attention just so I can be docked for cheating. The safest thing for me to do is to make it obvious that I am not cheating. And what better way than to take a nap?\u201d you asked. Ibiki turned around your test and looked in shock as all the questions were answered perfectly than placed it back on the desk and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that little interaction the test went on and finally the final question was brought up. You had to admit that Ibiki was doing a pretty good job scaring everyone but one outburst from the charismatic Naruto and everyone stood firm. He then surprised everyone that the last question wasn\u2019t really a question, well a not a written one anyway. So you all passed and in the middle of a good moment a loud cranky woman burst through the window and gave directions for the second test and dismissed you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Max.\u201d Naruto said as you were all walking from the exam room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor helping us with the test.\u201d Sasuke clarified as you all walked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we were going to pass anyway so I didn\u2019t really do much. I doubt the next test will be so easy.\u201d You said and they all were quite as they thought about it. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we can handle it. If I have anything to say about it we will all pass no problem.\u201d You said and they smiled at this. Having you around defiantly took the edge off. Who else can say they have a full sized dragon on their team?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On top of everything else it isn\u2019t fair for your team to not only have more members but also someone that is more than capable of finishing on his own to add to the off balance. It was either this or withdrawing you out of the exam all together.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can find you guys and help you out. At the very least you don\u2019t have to worry about having a dragon as an enemy.\u201d You said and they all nodded and Kakashi disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you around.\u201d Sasuke said and you waved and went to turn in your consent form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou received your scroll and headed to a gate. You could sense hundreds of threats in the forest as you gazed into it. You had given your scroll first and without hesitation so you were near Anko to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou scared?\u201d she asked in a voice that was there to freak you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, just not used to not having them around. It\u2019s quieter without Naruto around. I don\u2019t like referring to them as enemies.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to focus on the threats in the forest, they can take care of themselves.\u201d She said and you nodded in understanding. \u201cWait, you\u2019re that kid aren\u2019t you?\u201d you looked at her as if to be more precise with her question. \u201cYou know, the one that\u2026 has a thing for dragons.\u201d She asked as she found a way to ask without saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d You said and flashed your eyes at her as confirmation. She took a step back at this and you sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not like that. You\u2019re safe, I am half human you know and if nothing else a Leaf Village Ninja.\u201d You said and she relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that takes a load off. You know I was expecting you to be a little more intimidating.\u201d She said with her crazy smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am still only 14 years old so I\u2019m still a kid. That and my dragon form is much bigger. Even had Kakashi Sensei losing it for a minute when I showed him. It isn\u2019t something I like to show people. They tend to either run or try and kill me. Not too thrilled about either reaction. So it is just easier for people to see me like this than as a full grown dragon. Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do cool stuff though.\u201d You said as you grew wings flexed them for her than drew them back into your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, but I hope I never have to see it.\u201d She said and you smiled back at her which got her off the hook. You both talked for a little bit about the test and other things that she was curious about. Not to many recognized you so now that she knew who you were she had a bunch of questions that most everyone had that knew about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So as soon as the gate open you sped as fast as you could and with your quick and silent movements reached a team grabbed their scroll and headed for the tower without them even knowing you were there. You easily avoided the dangers and in a total of 10 minutes you were in the tower and finished the exam. You were greeted by an Anbu black ops member as you sat waiting for the others. Garra also got there pretty quick but sense you were already done you couldn\u2019t help anyone inside. That was until the Anbu approached you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Max?\u201d he said from behind his mask but you could see he was a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnko has requested back up but we don\u2019t have anyone available for a few hours. Can you go and make sure she is ok?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d You answered and with a silent relief the Anbu left and you walked off into the forest again. You made sure no one was around after going into the forest a little than used your transformation jutsu to get to dragon form. You shook your head then took off silently to the air in the dead of night where you would be nearly invisible. You followed Anko\u2019s scent than found her staring down some rather large tigers but she wasn\u2019t really at 100% and they were ready to attack. You quickly landed behind her with a thud as your claws shattered the rock and wood under them. The tigers moved toward Anko with a growl but you returned one and stepped over her in a clear sign of possession and protection to predators. Anko looked up at your  growling head as you forced the tigers back than to run. When you were certain they were not coming back you stopped growling and looked to the injured Anko. \u201cYou ok?\u201d you asked and she jumped as you spoke to her. You had moved around to face her but she was by no means ok with seeing you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to speak when she collapsed with pain as she grasped her neck. You saw a mark on her that you didn\u2019t like the smell of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d you said and she looked at you, still not over you yet. \u201cI finished pretty early and was just sitting around. An Anbu said you needed help and said they wouldn\u2019t have someone available for a bit so they asked me to come by. You need a lift?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Yes, take me to the tower.\u201d She said, at first more contemplative but the rest more serious. You lowered your neck so she could climb on. She slip to the bottom and you wrapped her with a spike. She quickly learned the function as you took off and fly to the tower. It would take a few minutes so you had plenty of time to let her enjoy the feeling of flying. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d She said finally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s most human\u2019s dream to fly and you are the first human in this realm I let fly with me. Mostly because I am too visible during the day. It does feel good to stretch my wings again though. Haven\u2019t flown in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are ok with people riding on you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, as long as they don\u2019t plan on attacking me or acting\u2026 uncivil. Although for future reference, I don\u2019t really enjoy carting around people I don\u2019t like. For example some of those arrogant ninja or lords that come by every once in a while. They tend to think I\u2019m a toy or pet that they can just order around. Or at least that is what they are like in my realm. But people like you or other respectable ninja, it is a pleasure to help someone out if I can.\u201d You said then took her down just behind the tree line. You let her off and changed back with a puff as you both made your way inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the ride Max.\u201d she said before rushing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d You said but it was unlikely that she heard. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would prefer to trust you over pampering.\u201d You answered and they all looked tired. \u201cBut you all got here and are alive so it ended up alright.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the Third was joined by some of the other Jounin to explain the preliminary round. A call was made to see who wanted to drop out and a few did. You were first along with a sound village ninja named Dosu. You had watched and figured out his attacks and other than comparatively weak skills he had that nasty little sound thing on his arm. As the others left you stared down the ninja then looked at Kakashi who gave a sign for you to take it easy and you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make this quick.\u201d Dosu said as he looked at you with that uncanny look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d You said and made a few hand signs that visually didn\u2019t do anything than ran towards him. At your approach he swung at you and when his fist was going to glance you, you purposefully got in the way and let the punch connect. The moment it did you exploded in a furry of fire that destroyed his little toy. He was equally shocked at this as he was that you exploded so you took advantage of it and used the headhunter jutsu you saw kakashi used to bring him under the ground with his head the only visible part above it. You also pricked him with a poison needle that prevented jutsu like clone, replacement, and Substitution jutsus then leapt above ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, you exploded.\u201d He said and you smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a fire clone. Something that I have been working on. Still haven\u2019t figured it out completely so they have a nasty habit of exploding when destroyed, making them useless in a team battle. However in a one on one battle they are quite useful.\u201d You explained which made some of the others quite interested. As far as you knew no one had ever used a fire clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d he said as he tried to wiggle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d You said and gave his head a light kick as you went by, effectively knocking him out. You were declared the winner and joined the others on the platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d Naruto said as you got to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire clone, when did you learn to do that?\u201d Sasuke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame time as the shadow clone. I am pretty good with fire you know.\u201d You said and they smiled at that. \u201cI just never used it because of their tendency of exploding when they are destroyed. But it was the perfect thing to use to get rid of that pesky sound maker of his.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough. You also used the Head Hunter Jutsu. That\u2019s pretty advanced\u201d Kakashi added and they looked at you just for you to shrug and look at them as if to ask \u2018are you really surprised?\u2019 \u201cright.\u201d Kakashi said then the rest of the preliminaries came and went. There was a bunch of neat Jutsu that you put on your to do list. When Garra took his turn he was a little arrogant after to which you just ignored him. You could tell he wasn\u2019t used to being ignored so he followed you as you went home that night. You had requested a place that had a little more room and they had given you a dwelling that was little better than a shack but the outside was more than adequate as you lay on the grass and look at the stars.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sometimes enjoyed just observing life in its natural state. With your heightened senses you could sense everything within a great distance but your moment of tranquility was interrupted by a presence that only could have been Gaara. He was coming to you and you just sighed, knowing this guy wouldn\u2019t leave you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaara, I doubt you came here for small talk so what is your purpose for disturbing my peaceful rest?\u201d you asked without even looking at him as he came to you from your left. He was rather quiet and probably could have sneaked a lot closer if you were someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came to kill you.\u201d he said with very little emotion and the only emotion that was present was desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, and what makes you think that you can? Perhaps you think because you have a tailed beast in you. That it makes you strong, or perhaps you think that all people are as weak as the people you have killed so far.\u201d You started and his eyes showed their first emotions since you interacted with him. He was surprised that you knew what he was and confused that you were so calm and confident. \u201cI have no desire to fight a weakling like you.\u201d you said with no emotion and continued to look into the forest. You felt sand run across the ground toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI exist to take life and I will not cease to exist.\u201d He said with a slight urgency as his sand wrapped around you then lifted you off the ground. You had seen what it was capable of and at his current strength your scales were more than enough to hold his sand at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ignorant fool. You are already doing that by yourself.\u201d His eyes increased in bloodlust and tried to crush you but you weren\u2019t affected. \u201cEveryone dies eventually and there is only one way to live beyond that point, at least that I know of. That is in the hearts of those we touch. After I die I will live on in the hearts of those I have touched. But you, you will die alone and be forgotten like dust in the wind. If you kill everyone there you will cease to exist when you die. No one will remember you, no one will miss that you are gone. Because of your actions you will be forgotten.\u201d You said and after he exhausted enough chakra trying to crush you his sand dropped you and retracted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not cease to exist, I won\u2019t!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen prove me wrong Gaara. Touch someone so they carry your existence to the next generation and make you immortal.\u201d You said and he looked up at you as you looked down at him. He was after all just a little kid. You didn\u2019t have any intension of killing him. \u201cI like to rest on the grass so clean your sand up when you leave.\u201d You said as you headed out into the forest, the same forest of death that the others had just got out of and feared. However this was a place that you could relax as a dragon without prying eyes. It was also an awesome place to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d said Gaara as he looked at you with longing eyes. \u201cAre you my friend?\u201d he asked as he obviously had a very limited definition of friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Gaara, I\u2019m not. You have to earn my trust before you can have that distinction. Trying to kill me is not a good way to start. You need to learn how to make friends instead of killing everyone you meet. I am not scared of you so I am not going to sugar coat this. If you want to be friends with me you need to prove to be what I consider to be a friend.\u201d You said and his eyes went wide as if you broke his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if I am not your friend than why did you not kill me when I tried to kill you?\u201d he asked, obviously not getting your thought process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I put a high value on human life.\u201d You said and the words hit him and you started to walk again than vanished into the forest but left him with a few last words. \u201cThat and I would like to be your friend in the future, if I can trust you.\u201d you said then left him to think on it and off to catch your dinner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had seen a lot of useful jutsu and you soon learned them all, definitely not as good as their original wielders but learned them all the same as well as counters for them. However no matter how hard you tried you couldn\u2019t figure out how to keep you fire clones from exploding, and in only got worse when you were in dragon form because of your size it increased the explosion. But you had shadow clones you could use so you weren\u2019t too worried about it. Waiting for the applicants to finish their matches in the exam was long but entertaining. You got to see Naruto use the Nine Tails charkra, and a host of other jutsu from the others. However a genjutsu fell over the arena to which you broke its hold on you then joined Kakashi as he fought the invading ninja. You were all relatively surprised at the attack but had little time to dwell on it. There was scores of enemy ninja as well as giant snakes that they summoned. The villagers were out of the way but they were causing a lot of damage. Then it came to Kakashi giving you and the others assignments. A group went to go help Sasuke but you were held behind for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d Kakashi said as you knocked out an enemy ninja at his back before Guy Sensei got there. \u201cWhile the others are concentrated on the ninja I need you to take care of the snakes.\u201d He said and you looked at him as if to ask if he was sure. Taking care of multiple animals of that size in a manner he was referring to required you to change to dragon and he nodded than looked back and deflected an incoming Kunai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about after I\u2019m done?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you think you can take out such enemies by yourself?\u201d Guy Sensei asked in a clear jab at Kakashi but in a rivalry sort of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you are done assist from the air with the other ninja. You are free to use lethal force but try not to kill too many of the ninja. You can destroy the snake anyway you wish.\u201d He instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood Kakashi Sensei.\u201d You returned and jumped to the field. A few kunai immediately came at you but you deflected them with your now showing tail. You transformed with you jutsu which made the rest of the incoming shuriken and kunai bounce harmlessly off your scales. You blew the smoke away and both the enemy and your allies were stunned for a second at your sudden presence but the current battle drew them back in as you let out a growl and took off to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you keen eyes you saw almost everything that was going on and quickly located the snakes Kakashi was talking about. They were nearly as long as you were if short by 100+ feet. The first one you came to was attacking a gate with the guarding ninja not doing so well. As the snake attacked you blew a fire ball and its head erupted and was burnt off its body, the snake crashing down dead. You soared past and ninja were scared but, like the arena, they were quickly snapped back to the battle. You reached your second target and this one was too close to humans to take out like the other one and it had enemy ninja riding it. You roared to catch its attention and as it stopped mid strike from a downed set of Leaf ninja you dropped on its body with your claws piercing multiple parts of its body. With a quick snap you grabbed the half of the snake\u2019s head in your jaws along with some of its neck and dug in. Ripping the piece from either side with a few enemy ninja along with it, you chewed a little and gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuck, these snakes taste like crap.\u201d you said which broke the stunned silence in the area and you took into the air to go for the next target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the others out as quickly as you could and finally there was only two left. They were together in an attempt to use numbers in sight of you taking out the others one by one. One of the snakes watched you fly towards them while the other had some guy that was near their size. You assumed it was Chouza, Chouji\u2019s father in his full expansion jutsu. The snake was constricting the man and you saw another corps the man must have killed. With only a second to decide you went straight for the one around Chouza. You were able to grab the snake by the neck with your jaws, jaws that were by this point dripping with snake blood, and ripped the head off and gulping down the meat still in your mouth. But even though it was the right move it wasn\u2019t the smart one. The act left you completely vulnerable to the other snake and it stuck, wrapping a few coils around you then squeezing. Unlike most enemies this snake had enough strength to cause you serious injury like this. You snarled and growled as it quickly worked on you. But it forgot one thing, your tail. With a quick flick you flattened it and started swinging it back and forth, cutting snake coils as it hit them. Eventually it minced them all the way up to the head that was clamped on your wing but it soon became lifeless and dropped. With a little more effort you slit the coils off Chouza as well then toppled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d You said as you tried to get back up. You felt poison coming from the wound on your wing, not to mention the few broken bones from the snake\u2019s constriction. They must have coated the snake\u2019s teeth with it before the attack, or possibly during after you started killing them. Some enemy ninja saw you collapse and tried attacking but you breathed a heavy amount of fire at them, which incinerated any in the path they were coming from. But then you fell over again, snarling and growling you tried to get up but it wasn\u2019t working. You could even transform. As the poison crept through you induced that it must be powerful, enough to instantly kill a human. But sense you weren\u2019t human it merely paralyzed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chouza finally asked after he got up. He was bigger than the others and you were sprawled out almost limp so he thought it ok to approach despite your still blood soaked jaws and your snarling. Most of the Jounin were informed about you and at this point glad for your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoison. I think they laced the snake\u2019s teeth with it. It\u2019s paralyzing me.\u201d You said then tried to get up again but a hand rested on your side, pushing you gently back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax is it?\u201d and you nodded against the ground your head laid on. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough, rest and recover.\u201d Chouza said and you once again nodded as you were too paralyzed to speak. You were also exhausted from the poison. You drifted off to sleep and hoped everyone would be ok.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke a few times as you slept but only for a brief second as you went in and out of consciousness. You were being moved but you didn\u2019t know where or how. However when you finally got to wake with a majority of your strength restored you still couldn\u2019t move. Not because of the effects of the poison, as that had already been purged from your system. The snake had either been really smart to bite you in your comparatively weaker skin on your wings, or just really lucky. You felt most of you injuries were healed minus a scare where the bite was, yet another one to add to your collection. But you saw the reason you couldn\u2019t move was a generous amount of restraints. You were in one of the practice fields but a makeshift building had been erected to shield out onlookers with Anbu guarding the entrances. You didn\u2019t know if it was intentional but they had left windows in the ceiling so the sun was covering for your lack of food. You tried to move each part of your body but almost every inch of it was chained to the ground so you couldn\u2019t get so much as a twitch of momentum to possibly break you binds. The chains rattled as you tried anyway but without any room to move you couldn\u2019t muster enough strength to break them. You decided after trying for a bit that it was wasting to much energy for just the sun to replenish it so you just looked around. If push came to shove you did have a few things that could get you out but they were crazy and wouldn\u2019t even consider them unless you had no other option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even bother.\u201d Came a voice and your eye on that side of your head snapped to the source. \u201cThose binds are treated to resist chakra so you really have no chance of breaking them.\u201d An old man said, being accompanied by an old woman. You didn\u2019t really know their names but they were known as the \u201celders\u201d in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Third might have been ok with you wondering around but we sure aren\u2019t. It is unfortunate that he has passed but it does give us an opportunity to remedy some of his mistakes.\u201d The woman stated and your eyes narrowed at the news. The Third Hokage was dead? You couldn\u2019t believe your ears. Who could have killed him? Why would someone want to kill such a kind man? Then anger started to combine with your sudden shock and grief. You didn\u2019t know why you had neglected this before, perhaps because you were in human form a majority of the time. But your retracted spikes started to come out and shredded the chains enough for you to move and there by easily break the rest of them. The two headed for the door but your blocked it with your tail. An ominous growl hit the air as you brought your head down to face them, there wasn\u2019t much room to stretch in the thin building anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho killed him?\u201d you asked, still in a growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrochimaru\u2026\u201d one said in a whimper in response to your demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d you asked next in a clear indication on what your intensions were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know, none of us do.\u201d Said a voice from your right, it was Kakashi\u2019s. You turned to look at him and another who was standing next to him. To most your eyes were very frightening and unreadable but Kakashi and a few select others could, to some degree. Your were not in a bloodlust at the moment or even that angry, more sad and guilty. There was also a strong tie to the Third as well as your loyalty to him that dictated an almost vengeful response. No one picks on people close to you without serious consequences. You then looked at the older pair for a moment and now saw they were scared pretty bad so you retracted your tail and transformed to human again. Your tail and wings were still out as you walked around trying to deal with the information you were given. Your wings flexed as they were unable to in full dragon form from in here but they did so now as your tail twitched and cycled. Your tail in human form was just as long, if you wanted, but more proportionally thick to your human body. Eventually you had to cool down and take a breath so you went to a wall and sat against it, breathing hard but making a noticeable attempt to calm yourself and slow your breathing as your dragon parts retracted fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 anything.\u201d You said simply and buried your head in your hands to relieve some of the stress but it didn\u2019t seem to be working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d Kakashi said to which you looked up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s out job. Let us worry about it.\u201d He said and you nodded than started to look around again then your eyes fell on the broken chains you were held with. \u201cWe told them they wouldn\u2019t hold you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a mistake to try.\u201d Came a voice from the man. \u201cWe know next to nothing about dragons. Even if it was right to do, which it wasn\u2019t, there is no way to know what would work without a dragon testing it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is dangerous. Just look at what he did to those snakes. If he were to\u2026\u201d started the old woman but was silenced by a glare from the man near Kakashi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe exposes himself and gets poisoned for you and your reward is to throw him in prison. That is not how the Leaf treats its own and you know it.\u201d He said and the elders looked like a dog with their tail between their legs. Whoever this man is, he is respected enough to make them think about their actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no choice Jiryaiya. He originally wasn\u2019t from our village. The law dictates that we need to confine dangerous elements that\u2019s origins are not of the leaf. Noble as his intensions are we must follow the law until a new Hokage is installed and can override them, like the Third did.\u201d The elderly woman said. This little bit of information hit Jiryaiya like a sour lemon. It looked like he was looking for a way out of this mess but you had your doubts at the moment, although those doubts could\u2019ve just been an aftermath of the information that was just shoved at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was decided that you would remain in dragon form and in the Forest of death until Mater Jiriaya and Naruto got back from retrieving the Tsunade and she became the Fifth Hokage. You were allowed to do pretty much anything inside the forest, barring burning it down. This was because Kakashi and Sasuke were hospitalized after a run in with Itachi Uchiha, and since Sakura was pretty much attached to Sasuke\u2019s bedside there was no one willing to take care of you in a prison setting, mainly feeding you. But the forest of death had more than enough room and food that you could chow on. A barrier was erected so no one could see in and you couldn\u2019t leave, unless you destroyed it. The barrier went straight up so you could fly around to stretch your legs, or wings as they were. Humans weren\u2019t allowed in so anything in the area was fair game. There was even a few enemy ninja that had used the forest as a haven when they couldn\u2019t get away from the leaf in time. You escorted them out and they were very surprised and grateful that you didn\u2019t eat them, as you told them that you were authorized to. So it was a surprise when you saw a group of people in the forest near the tower and in a field that was big enough for you to land. You observed them from high above what a normal human could see and when you saw that the people the woman in the green coat had with her were; Kakashi, Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Jiraiya, and a few Anbu you descended to meet them. You fly over them once close to the ground then landed gentle enough to not cause any damage, minus your body weight and claws. You circled to meet them, felxing your wings before you laid down so you were more on their level. Although for some reason you smelled a peculiar scent in the air, if you didn\u2019t know better you would say that it was Sarah. But you didn\u2019t see her and the scent was ominous instead of directed so you brushed it off, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi everyone, long time no see.\u201d You said in a calm voice. It had been a little while and as you looked at the woman in the green coat you had to admit that she gave off the same feeling as Master Jiriaya did. Although she was visually in awe of your presence rather than frightened, which you didn\u2019t mind in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can talk.\u201d The woman in the green coat said in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can talk. All dragons can talk, well in different fashions but still talk none the less. My name is Max and yours would be?\u201d you asked as politely as possible and without opening your mouth to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s Lady Tsunade and the fifth Hokage.\u201d Kakashi explained and you looked directly at her with the statement, making her flinch a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honor to meet you Lady Tsunade.\u201d You said more formerly with a slight but noticeable bow of your head and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really are a dragon.\u201d She said and this time you just nodded then smiled without showing any teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max!\u201d interrupted Naruto to which you looked at him as Lady Tsunade continued to look you over. \u201cWe got a surprise for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it\u2019s another half cooked dairy cow. The thought was nice but it was a little messy, not to mention unsightly.\u201d You said and the half that knew what you were talking about laughed a little. You had admitted that you liked both cooked foods and raw foods. So he tried to do both of them but it was rather\u2026 interesting and not in the good way. The raw parts mixed with the cooked which made both rot and stink so bad it took a month to get the smell out of the ground where Naruto dragged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this one presented herself. She asked for you and we thought bringing her would be a way of saying sorry for them locking you up in here after saving the village.\u201d Kakashi said and you sighed out a sigh of relief. One of the Anbu came forward and after a second she rid herself of the black cloak. It must have been treated to hide scent because after that Sarah\u2019s scent came from her and when she rid herself of the mask you froze in awe as Sarah stood before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen\u2026, how\u2026, Sarah you\u2019re here.\u201d You said, stuttering over your words as you brought your head closer and she was at this point running and threw herself on your snout when she got there. You were both 16 years old at this point and you couldn\u2019t be happier at the moment as she hugged the top you\u2019re your snout as much as her arms would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I missed you.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to look for a way back. I couldn\u2019t find one\u2026\u201d you started but Sarah sat up and shushed you while petting you like she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you did. I was told that there was none from this side. Kara and I rose so much hell to find a way that they sent me here. Kara remained there because she couldn\u2019t fit in the portal. Luckily your Sensei was the one to find me and here I am.\u201d She explained then slid off of you so you could talk easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. But are you ok with staying here in this realm, probably forever?\u201d you asked with a little worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came here already knowing that. Plus you\u2019ll show me won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I may not be the best but I can teach you a few tricks. But if you want actual training you\u2019re going to need to ask them.\u201d You said and you turned her attention to the others. They all seemed content with you saying hello to Sarah and were observing highly so they knew what you were referring to. Someone who knows little about Ninja wouldn\u2019t last too long so the question was if they would train her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You said your goodbyes and she was escorted by the Anbu before the rest of you started talking again. It was understood that you might not see her all the time, but some is better than none. As you turned your attention back to Lady Tsunade she seemed fascinated with you and took every move you made into her mind to process. You were the only dragon around so there was hundreds of things buzzing through her head, from stories to ingredients for new her medical needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lady Tsunade.\u201d You said to her with an obvious gratitude that almost radiated from you. \u201cIs there anything I can do for you? Perhaps something you are afraid to ask or would otherwise be improper?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh well\u2026 no that\u2019s ok. It is the job of the Hokage to get to know and help those under her.\u201d she said to relieve you of some dept to her for excepting Sarah into the village. But you could still see there was something just on the other side of her mind. You were tempted to read it but you had promised the Third to never do that unless you were asked or to an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha\u2026 She wants a ride into the sky.\u201d Naruto said then received a whack over the head by Sakura. Lady Tsunade seemed embarrassed and almost instantly annoyed at Naruto for saying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the Barrier still up?\u201d you asked to Kakashi and he shook his head. \u201cThen I guess I could drop you all off instead of walking through the forest again.\u201d You said and Naruto almost jumped onto your back. The others looked at him but you just smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s Naruto, what\u2019re you gonna do?\u201d you said and they all agreed. Trying to keep a lid on Naruto was a losing battle, for anyone. You lowered your neck so they could step up more easily and reluctantly at first but they all got on. Most, even if they don\u2019t admit it, dreamed about flying. Since there wasn\u2019t a lot that could take them into the air you were the next best thing. As they got settled in you strapped them down with spikes that Kakashi explained to Lady Tsunade and Master Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, take it slow Max.\u201d he said as you started moving and spread your comparatively massive wings. You looked at the two new ones and they both had a death grip on the spikes you provided for them to hold on to. You nodded and with a few waves you took off and headed for the sky. You were going slow but for them it was a pretty decent speed. You went higher and higher until you were above what little clouds there was that day. Once you hit a very decent altitude you leveled off and soared at an angle so they could see the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that?\u201d Tsunade asked as the village was still visible but not very clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Village, yes it is. How far up are we Max?\u201d Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 30,000 feet give or take.\u201d You said back as you flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought he said to take it slow.\u201d Master Jiraiya said as he just got over his upset stomach from your ascent to this height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was as slow as I could. It was about 1% of my speed.\u201d You informed and he looked like he swallowed a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you take us down? Not that I mind the ride but I still have a lot of work to do. Those old relics are so eager to bore me with their \u201cnecessary\u201d prattle.\u201dTsunade asked with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be easy. I accidently scared them to much when they told me about Orochimaru. Got to say that I don\u2019t envy you in that situation. But if you ever want to fly again all you have to do is ask.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks but doesn\u2019t it feel\u2026 degrading for people to pet you and ride you like an animal?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is what they think of me when they are doing it than yes. But otherwise no it feels natural. There is a reason why Dragons usually had riders with them. As much human there is in me there is an equal amount of Dragon as well, as you can see. That means I have the temper of a dragon while the reason of a human, the Knowledge of a human but the wisdom of a Dragon, and yes as the instinctual side would dictate, I do enjoy getting pet and being useful like an animal or dragon in my position would. Though if you ask me to carry someone that treats me like a pet or toy and they get to much they may ride the rest of the way in my stomach.\u201d you said and you could hear an audible gulp. \u201cI have two stomachs, one for digesting food and the other for storage and healing where someone is safe and protected. But if someone doesn\u2019t know any better, the moist and dark environment could easily be mistaken for the digestion stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHealing?\u201d Tsunade asked and the others clued in as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know magic as well as healing jutsu. But the main problem for both is that you lack the concentration to effect the whole body at once, even if it means your hands aren\u2019t that big. Well if the person is surrounded by me I can contract the stomach walls to press on them all at once and heal them more effectively. Kind of like healing a bird that is small enough to fit in your hands. But I\u2019m not sure the extent or the effectiveness it has. The only one I tried it on was Sarah, when she was badly injured. So I know it works on potentially lethal gashes and cuts but beyond that I\u2019m not sure.\u201d You explained and most got it except, of course, Naruto. All he got was that you could swallow people and either heal them or digest them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. Now if you don\u2019t mind taking me to my new office. You can land on the ceiling if you want.\u201d She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish. Hold on.\u201d You said and as she did you dove to your destination with some of them screaming in a combination of fear and thrill. You were pretty sure Master Jiraiya would lose his lunch but for now they were all enjoying it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course size was an issue so you had to remain in human form but she also let you fly around in either form which helped. Not that you had a lot of free time while helping the village rebuilding and Sarah train. She had a lot of catching up to do and was moving along insanely fast. Her high intellect had her learning things in a small fraction of the time, she was already performing midlevel jutsu and getting closer to beating Skikamaru at different selected strategy games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you could go on a mission for me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a Leaf ninja, of course I will. As long as it is clear that I am doing it for you because I trust you, like the Third I have a lot of respect for you. You are the only one of the nations that has a dragon at their full disposal. So use me in whatever area you need.\u201d You answered and she smiled at the sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat word has spread pretty far as well. It makes it easier to send you on missions if I don\u2019t have to worry about keeping a lid on you being a dragon. In fact this mission was sent in hoping you would be the one to be assigned.\u201d She said, holding a paper that looked like a message. \u201cIn a village on the edge of the land of fire someone is causing trouble. Something close to an army of soldiers come through their streets every night. Until recently they were just a weird occurrence that caused no harm. They are not human they look like puppets that puppet master would use but for there to be so many is unheard of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said \u2018until recently\u2019. Does that mean something happened?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the last month people have gone missing or have been attacked by them for no apparent reason. Your mission is to solve this problem. If you want to address the leader or try to do it without fighting or destroy all of the puppets, it is up to you. But you are there to stop them so act accordingly.\u201d She instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d You said with a bow than turned to leave. When you closed the door to the room you saw her smile at you but not for you to see. Ordering around a dragon must be exhilarating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, you\u2019re going on a mission?\u201d Sarah protested as it meant you would be gone for a good amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt comes with being a ninja. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d You said and she pouted at it. She didn\u2019t like being away from your and almost demanded that you take her flying on almost a daily basis. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a lot of jutsu to learn and I can leave you with a new one to learn.\u201d You offered and handed her a scroll with a shadow hiding jutsu that you just learned. She liked shadow and lightning style justu the most. She almost forced Naruto to show her the Shadow clone jutsu and Shikimaru the shadow possession jutsu. Kakashi wisely avoided her when she was in the mood to learn the lightning blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s ok. But you are spending the whole day with me when you get back.\u201d She demanded as she took the scroll and gave you a little kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I look forward to it.\u201d You said and with a few more goodbye remarks you headed off to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to your word, you hurried there at a very high rate of speed that sometimes shook the trees as you went passed them. Finally you reached the village and saw almost nothing as you walked through the streets. It was morning by this time and either they were all still asleep or they were hiding from whatever army it was that came through every night. You continued to walk through the village until you got to what looked like a main building for whomever lead the village. You could sense multiple eyes on you but you paid them no heed as you knocked on the door. You heard voices inside but no one answered. You knocked again and still there was nothing. So you looked around and ground a lost near the front of the building. You made your way over and sat with your back against it, waiting for someone to come so you could start the mission.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The village remained silent until you heard/felt large thuds from a currently unknown source. You Smelled around and found the scent of something like a human but much bigger coming your way. You thought it might be someone from the town at first but the quivering humans in their homes negated that theory. You saw a few faces poke out of windows and a cry off in a remote part of the village but other than that the constant thuds were only joined by wood clanking sounds. Finally you saw who was coming, A large 60 foot tall human woman and about 100 puppets around her. She was either a giant of using the expansion jutsu, either way you could sense chakra threads connecting her to the puppets as they marched in front of her. She was very voluptuous, perhaps too much. Kind of like those people who are at the top of the \u201chot chart\u201d but tries to improve herself more and it backfires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, have to say that I wasn\u2019t expecting the village to comply so quickly.\u201d She said as she looked down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are referring to. I was sent here from the Leaf Village to sort out trouble with puppets. No one answered when I came knocking so I decided to rest here, end of story. Judging on the puppets you have I would guess you are the one controlling them and causing all the trouble, am I correct?\u201d You asked as you stood up to face her. She on the other hand laid down so she could better observe you. She flaunted her body but you were unaffected. If you wanted a big woman like her you would have taught the expansion jutsu to Sarah or brought Kara along to this realm. No this was just bordering on annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, and what are you going to do about it?\u201d she asked then pushed you with a giant finger to which you went flying but easily caught yourself and stood back up like nothing happened. \u201cLittle man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the Hokage gave me free reign to deal with you as I saw fit. So it comes down to what you decide. I will ask only once that you stop your behavior and to stop causing trouble. If you accept than mission accomplished and I can go home. If you refuse than I guess I\u2019ll have you for lunch.\u201d You said in a bored expression as your stomach growled. You didn\u2019t relish the thought of eating her but you were hungry and it would be better than killing her and leaving her body to rot. But your contemplation was interrupted by her laughing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny little man. You threatening to eat me, I do believe you have it backwards. Perhaps you don\u2019t know who I am. I am Selina, the last remaining giantess and I eat people your size for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Max and even if you haven\u2019t heard the name you should have heard of me indirectly. You should ask yourself why the Leaf Village sent me out by myself instead of in a squad like they usually do. Then ask what one unit in the Leaf Village could handle a mission like this and threaten to eat you. I gave you enough clues the way it is so let\u2019s see if you can figure it out but my offer stands. I strongly suggest you figure it out before answering.\u201d You advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to stuff that far away. So why don\u2019t you just tell me what you are referring to and I\u2019ll decide.\u201d She said as she playfully blew a gust of wind at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dice lady. I don\u2019t go around flaunting myself to others. If you don\u2019t already know that that is your fault for not paying attention. So this decision just got a lot more difficult for you. I have given you a warning so I\u2019m free from any moral obligation after you answer. Know that no amount of begging will help you if you choose the latter of the options I gave. Besides I have a feeling that if you don\u2019t choose to leave on your own than you will just come back when I leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerceptive aren\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think I will give up such a rich feeding ground to you.\u201d she said than made a grab for you. You thought about dodging but you needed to get out of the village or your transformation would wreck more than you wanted. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere more private little man. Wouldn\u2019t want my little feeding ground getting all messed up now.\u201d She said seductively and walked off to an open field behind a wall of trees. This was perfect as you could fight and transform without anyone seeing you, well most of you. You were big enough to dwarf the trees around you but even so it was better than nothing. As soon as she sat down again and started to \u201cplay\u201d with her food you broke her hold and jumped a good distance away. \u201cOw!\u201d she said as she nursed the part of her wrist you whacked with your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t say that I am happy with your choice, but at least this way my mission is completed and I get a free meal out of the deal.\u201d You said then with a flaming mass that signified your form transformation jutsu you changed to your dragon form. The sudden change in her situation made Selina fall back and try to run but you quickly pinned her down under your claw so she was facing up and into your gaze. \u201cLunch time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d she said as you started and you stopped halfway with her head almost entering your jaws. You pulled back and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Selina?\u201d you asked, hoping she gave you a reason not to eat her. As much as you had to admit the idea made your stomach growl with excitement you didn\u2019t like eating humans, even large ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d she cried at her sudden predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a reason not to. I need to finish this mission and you are the only thing in the way of that. Not to mention I warned you, did you think I was joking?\u201d you responded <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019ll speak for her.\u201d said a voice to which you both turned your heads to see a human, who\u2019s scent you recognized as one in the building you had knocked at. He seemed well kept if a little nervous. \u201cWould you be willing to let her go if we came to an arrangement?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends. The Hokage gave me this mission from the leader of this village. I was told that I had to solve the trouble by any means I saw fit. I do not want to kill anyone but if she won\u2019t stop or continues to cause trouble I will have to do what I must. So in short this whole thing hinges on me completing the mission. Do you have an idea that would save her life?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would\u2026\u201d Selina started but you growled at her which cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have lost your right to speak. You will remain silent until I allow you to speak.\u201d You said and she nodded he understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if you burn all the puppets and we set up a contract that sais she will protect this village as well as take orders from only you or the Hokage. That way you solved the puppet problem and she is no longer a threat.\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to save her so bad? It would\u2019ve been easier and safer for me to just eat her. You know that and you are still here defending her, why?\u201d you asked back, not really getting it and not willing to expended the energy to read his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2026 She reminds me of a daughter I lost to disease a long time ago. Their likeness is so close that people in the village actually thinks that my daughter never died, she just ran away and came back like she is. I admit and know that she isn\u2019t my daughter but I just can\u2019t help but to protect her.\u201d he said as he looked Selina in the face with tears in his eyes then back at yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026 why can\u2019t this be a simple mission?\u201d you said as you thought about it. You then materialized a contract and it floated in the air between them. \u201cThis is a contract that states that she will not harm anyone that is a part of the village unless given permission by the person or the current leader. It also binds her to do what I tell her to do. If this agreement is breached at any time it will send her location and mark her for me to deal with. To sign it you must only put a drop of blood on it.\u201d You said and released he closest arm. She was hesitant but the man did so without hesitation. He flinched a little as she brought her hand over to him but she stopped with a finger facing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked and he nodded then cut a small hole in her finger so some blood could seep out. She let it drop on the paper to which it glowed then floated over to the village leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the puppets?\u201d you asked and she looked the other way to where she kept them. You saw under massive army and with a large breath you spat flames across them. When the flames ceased there was not a single puppet left. \u201cThe contract only allows for one leader at a time. So when you die your blood will be voided and the next drop after that will bind that person to it.\u201d You said than turned to look Selina in the face. \u201cYou better be thankful. He just saved your life so don\u2019t forget it.\u201d You said then lifted your claw and backed away from them, taking a seated position. She immediately got up and recovered while checking her body for flaws and injuries. Then she hesitated under your gaze but turned to the man who saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir.\u201d She said as she respectfully bowed to him. She was lifted by his hand on her bowed cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may not be my daughter but I hope we will be able to mend your relationship with us and maybe you will eventually be that.\u201d He said and you didn\u2019t know why for now but she smiled at him. They were brought back to reality with a large gust of wind as you took off into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both take care. Maybe if I come by again it won\u2019t be to eat you. I\u2019d like that.\u201d You said than with a thankful bow from the man you sped off to go and report to Lady Tsunade. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you arrived back in the village you noticed none of the other Genin were in scent range but with them being ninja as well you just brushed it off as they may have been on missions. First you changed to human form then went to go see Lady Tsunade to file your report. When you arrived Master Jiraiya was also in the room as they talked. You gave your report and she was concerned but in the end delighted that the mission was completed with no deaths and gaining a valuable resource.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, we need you to go on another mission. Something happened when you were away but before that we need to ask you something. What do you know about black fire.\u201d she asked as Master Jiraiya also was intently observing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the panicle of fire breathing for dragons. Only very high level dragons can use it but no matter how high they are it is the one set of flames that can burn us. It is so hot that not even water can put it out right away. It also has a nasty habit of spreading because the area around it is so hot it spreads rapidly. To give you an idea of how hard it is I can only produce black flames for a maximum of 30 minutes at full breath before my energy gets low enough to be fatal. But even a teaspoon of the stuff would be enough to burn down an entire village if left on its own. How do you know about it?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rogue ninja came by and used it while he fought us.\u201d Jiraiya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA human capable of producing black flames? That must be an impossibly strong jutsu.\u201d You marveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he is quite strong but he left as it seemed to take its toll on him. Anyway the mission I wish for you to go on is an aid mission. You probably noticed the absence of most of the Genin in the village. That is because Sasuke has been taken.\u201d She said and at this information your eyes turned red. \u201cI see that you understand but your mission is not to rescue him. Reason being he might have gone willingly so we left it up to the Genin to assess what his intensions are. Your mission is to make sure the rest survive. Orochimaru has some strong followers and he rarely leaves things done halfway so he most likely has some kind of escort with Sasuke, and they won\u2019t be pushovers. I have already enlisted the help of the Hidden Sand Village and sent Kakashi as well. I just have a bad feeling so as they are part of your team I thought you would also like to help.\u201d She said but also asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo to be clear. I am to help fight the guards or kidnappers and make sure all the others aren\u2019t dead by the conclusion of the whole thing.\u201d You stated and she nodded. \u201cWhat if I meet Sasuke while I\u2019m doing that?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can convince him to come back than go ahead but do not force the issue. At this point he has probably crossed the border anyway so bringing him back will only be for execution or imprisonment.\u201d She advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand and thank you. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d You said and visibly resisted the urge to rush out of the room. You politely excused yourself and went directly to the roof. You then changed and took off into the air and raced toward the direction of where they were supposed to be. You had a feeling that you might get there too late to help with any fighting but you or they might get lucky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To your delight you weren\u2019t too late as you could smell and hear multiple battles going on. However you had to make two pit stops as you saw Choji and Neji in near death situations. You debated it and with a lot of reluctance swallowed them and started to heal them in your storage gut. You also squished the walls in on them so if and when you fought they wouldn\u2019t be disturbed. That done you headed over to the closest fight which was Kiba\u2019s with Akamaru already down. You could smell another scent that you recognized but didn\u2019t have time to judge it so you dropped down, crushing trees and such but away from Kiba and Akamaru. The attacking ninja backed off from his assault as you stood over Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d you asked without taking your gaze off of the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! you mind getting off my puppet?\u201d a voice came from the direction of the scent you had smelled earlier. It was Kankuro from the Sand Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs soon as you tell me what it is doing next to Kiba and why I shouldn\u2019t torch it.\u201d You growled which got him to back off. You were after all a very big dragon and not someone to get on one\u2019s bad side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters we are on a mission that was requested by YOUR Hokage.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case.\u201d You said then spat a fireball toward him. He dodged but the one behind him didn\u2019t as it engulfed the attacking enemy and soon only ash remained. After that you took your claw off of his puppet and looked at the bewildered enemy ninja. The ninja then tried attacking in blind rage with another fireball he too was nothing more than ash. \u201cIf you are ok here I\u2019m going to go help the others.\u201d you said as you cleared the area and walked around so you were facing the three before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means don\u2019t break a sweat.\u201d Kiba joked and you just smiled a little then took off to the next battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little further but you reached it and was having a hard time flying as the wind started to pick up. Then a gust blew a few trees down and you saw Shikamaru and a sand ninja you remembered as Temari fighting a girl with a flute. You soared just above them in circles which caught the three\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you need help?\u201d You asked down as you circled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re fine after a brief conversation with Temari. \u201cKiba and Akamaru should be fighting close by.\u201d He yelled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to yell, I can hear you just fine. I already took care of that. He sent me over here so if you don\u2019t need help I\u2019ll go over to help Gaara and Lee out, if they need it. If you go and gather the others and meet us over there I\u2019ll give you all a ride back.\u201d You said and he nodded to which you sped off and you could hear a sigh come from the enemy as you left, which you laughed a little at. It wasn\u2019t long before you saw a large wave of sand hit someone and when you flew over it the sand rumbled as it obeyed its master. You soared in circles around the now sandy field then when Gaara got up and Lee stepped near him you landed near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, did the Hokage send you to?\u201d asked Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, barely gave her my report from the last mission before she had me race over here. But it looks like you both are having some fun.\u201d You answered as Gaara looked at you in a combination of fear and awe. Lee just smiled as he knew what you considered fun. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d You said to Gaara as he composed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Naruto taught me many things that reshaped my life.\u201d He recited and his slightly monotone voice made it seem practiced but you could tell that he meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he is one amazing kid. Not surprised he helped you out somehow.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out!\u201d Lee said as a small impact hit your hide as you lay there talking. If you had been a normal animal it would have been a perfect vital shot but you had yet to meet a human made object that could penetrate your scales easily. You looked at the frozen enemy as he realized that the only thing his attack did was get him noticed by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what the hell do you think you are doing?\u201d you asked the horned, anthro looking, young man who tried to stab you with some sort of large bone from his body. You weren\u2019t mad by any means more like a little annoyed and contemplative. \u201cWho in their right mind would attack a dragon with such a weak attack? Unless that was some kind of weird love tap. In which case I would have to say that I don\u2019t play on that side of the fence.\u201d You said which made even Gaara smile a little. Attacking you was something he had found to be useless and didn\u2019t wish to do it again. You were nice only to a certain point and, like most Sand ninja, he had seen what you could do during their attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will defeat you!\u201d he said as he backed off and tried again, this time with some kind of overgrown bone that actually made an impact but not more than a light irritation on your scales. His second failure made him even more angry as he continued to attack to which you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t giving me a lot of choices here. Are you going to stop or are you going to make me kill you?\u201d you asked in a board expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll only stop when I am dead!\u201d he bellowed as he made a break for Lee and Gaara. Halfway there you lunged your tail into him and it skewered him through the middle with little effort. You didn\u2019t even have to flatten it or anything. You waited as everyone watching looked on in shock, including the enemy as he saw the foreign object that had run through his middle. He shortly slumped over then you burned what was left of his body to ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing.\u201d Gaara stated as he wondered at the ease you dealt with their troublesome foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you think so. I rather dislike when I have to kill people.\u201d You said and he looked at you as if that was not what he meant. \u201cI know what you meant and thanks for the compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you waited for the others to arrive you talked with Lee and Gaara. Lee told you what happened with Sasuke and you smelled in that direction and was about to go there yourself but you also smelled Kakashi\u2019s scent rapidly closing in on them so you left that part to him. Besides your mission was here and it would take a lot to kill Naruto. Gaara was delighted to hear that he was now you friend as well. Simply put a friend of Naruto was a friend of yours and he stated that he owed Naruto even more. Finally the others appeared almost carrying Kiba and Akamaru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max, did you pick up Choji and Neji?\u201d Shikamaru asked with a rather concerned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they were near death when I found them so I put them in my storage gut to heal. They have stabilized for now but are still far from ok.\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about your second stomach right?\u201d Kiba asked to which you nodded. He looked over at Akamaru highly concerned and with the same at you, more specifically at your jaws and stomach. \u201cDo you have room for two more?\u201d he asked with a noticeable hesitation, more so than the rest of them. Except the Sand ninja but to their credit they were picking up on your conversation very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? It is kind of awkward and neither of you look like you\u2019re going to die any time soon.\u201d You said and your hesitation was possibly more noticeable than the others. After all you had spent a lot of time convincing people that you were safe to be around. For you to eat them, even if it just to your storage gut, was a contradiction of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Temari asked as she was the most wielded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax has a second stomach that is used for storage mostly that doesn\u2019t digest anything. It has also been determined that if he uses magic or healing jutsu inside it would be 100 times more effective because the person would be surrounded by his living tissue. In theory it is a great attribute to have but he does have to eat the person to get the person into it.\u201d Shikamaru explained and the sand ninja all looked on with interest and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Akamaru in any pain and as tough as I am I know that I am in no fit condition to ride on your back.\u201d He said as he leaned heavily on Shikamaru for support. You looked at them then away and back at them again trying to find a better way but failed. Now that you observed him more he was right. A ride on your back would just further open his wounds as well as the cold air from you flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine just get in.\u201d you said as you opened your jaws wide and an audible tension of fear gripped the group at the sight but they quickly recovered. The first you felt was the small shivering form of Akamaru. You used your tongue to bring him and carefully deposit him to the throat. You gulped and with a rumble of your storage gut you found him a space away from the others that were already in there. There was a little more hesitation with the next one, probably because he was still awake and for Kiba, feeding himself  to another animal was purely against his instinct. You kept you tongue as still as possible so he didn\u2019t slip on the way in and land on your teeth. As soon as he was laying down you closed your mouth and swallowed him as well. A louder rumble came as you moved the gut\u2019s walls around to fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d Kankurou asked, clearly referring to your stomach growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI contracted the walls around them so they wouldn\u2019t be disturbed as I flew or fought. The noise is me relaxing the walls so they can enter than compressing around them once they reach a secure and separate spot from the others to heal.\u201d You said and wither he believed you or not he nodded that he understood your explanation. \u201cWell unless you all want to stand around here for the rest of the day you can get on.\u201d You said as you lowered your neck so they could jump or climb on. Again they were understandably hesitant when getting on and when your spikes formed to hold them in place but they kept it together and when they got settled you took off into the air and leveled off at a pretty impressive height. You could even see the Leaf Village from this height and they marveled at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we were strapped in.\u201d Kankurou said as he realized he would have fallen off otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing up here.\u201d Temari stated as she took it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, do you know where Naruto and Sasuke are?\u201d Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sasuke defeated Naruto and left beyond the border and is still going. Kakashi Sensei got there and is carrying Naruto to the Village as we speak.\u201d You answered and they could see that the news you gave was wearing on you. Sasuke was your friend like he was with Naruto or slightly behind his level but still friends none the less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we should get back as soon as we can.\u201d Shikamaru said and in a second wished he hadn\u2019t as you agreed and took off at near full speed toward your destination. You weren\u2019t sure what kind of reception you were going to get when you got back but you needed to rest and a place to concentrate on healing the ones inside you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou did what!\u201d Said Tsunade as you gave your report on the roof. Because you had multiple people still in your storage gut you were unable to change to human form. Shikamaru had just told her that you had most of the seriously injured in your stomach but wasn\u2019t wise enough to add the \u201cstorage\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d in front of the phrase. As it was you were extremely tired from fighting and flying while healing 3 humans and a dog to full health. You had hoped that they would be well enough to let out bu the time you got here but their injuries were more severe than that. Kiba and Akamaru were almost done but Neji and Choji were far from healed however their condition was no longer critical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others had noticed and addressed the sluggish pace and actions you had while flying and landing. You had told them as much but at this point you didn\u2019t have the strength to both heal and carry a conversation of any stature. So when her question hit it seemed like it was an actual bullet as you toppled over with fatigue. You were still conscious as you had to be to prevent any unfortunate actions like your second stomach pushing its guests into the digesting one. As well you needed to concentrate along with the healing jutsu you were using to properly heal them. To the onlooker you looked like you were in an almost unconscious daze as your eyes were barely open and most of your body except the sounds of your Storage gut and other comparatively massive organs working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see and feel what was going on around you but most of your other senses were shut down to further direct your body\u2019s focus on healing. However it was like a silent and stuttering movie in which your lack of perception would skip to the live feed then skip again to stay updated but it was a losing battle as you tried to follow what was happening. You began to see and feel things that didn\u2019t make sense like tools under your scales and multiple hands on your body, tipping it over and moving around the relatively softer scales on your underside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden you began as you close your eyes you felt immense pain and after a few rounds of pain then and the feeling of someone cutting into you it dawned on you that they were trying to cut their way to your stomach to get them out. You didn\u2019t have the strength to resist them and heal its occupants. So you concentrated all your energy on healing them. At this point Kiba and Akamaru were completely healed yet unconscious but if they tried to force Choji and Neji out at this point they would die from the shock alone. So you spent every bit of energy you had on healing them faster but as it sometimes did when you needed it the ancient knowledge in your mind came up with a solution. It wasn\u2019t much of one but it would save them so you gave it a try. The magic transferred all their remaining injuries to you so your body and its healing properties could better deal with them. It was just in time to as the invading forces to your body ripped through the first stomach than the second and its occupants spilled out. At this point the pain was too much and combined with your fatigue level and new injuries you faded out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that the injuries you had wouldn\u2019t kill you as they were much less than what your mother had done but it was who did it that hurt the most. You were helping them and saving them and they still turned on you. You didn\u2019t know what to think of that. Humans were good people and these were the best, aside from Sarah, you had ever met. So why were they causing you so much pain? You clung onto the hope that it was just a big misunderstanding and it would be sorted out when you awoke. But that hope didn\u2019t stop nightmares from coming as they did whenever you were in a similar position. They reminded you of why you hated dragons so much as a replay of your mother played over and over again until you woke up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a few times during the time you were asleep that you were able to partially wake up but it was for only a second the fell asleep again. The nightmares were beginning to wear on you, you particularly didn\u2019t like when you started seeing similarities between your mother and the humans you had grown to love. It was at this point you started to try to break the nightmares and force yourself awake. It finally worked as the disturbing images faded and you began to notice things around you. Most noticeable and comforting was a warmth against the crook of your neck and head where Sarah used to sleep. You felt a hand on your eye ridge which was making you hum involuntarily to the touch. You smelled the soothing smell that was around when Sarah was near and before becoming fully aware of yourself rationalized that she was here. You slowly fluttered your eyes open and took in the area around you. You were still on the roof of the administration building where you originally landed. You induced that they must have moved you and cleaned up because for the amount of blood you lost when they cut you open there was not even the slightest whiff of it around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d Sarah exclaimed as she hugged you from where she sat then backed off and continued to pet you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout three weeks. They said you lost a lot of blood and your injuries were extensive. Not to mention they were to afraid to feed you anything and wouldn\u2019t help me open your mouth to get some food down so you\u2019ve been on a sunlight diet.\u201d She said in a sore tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still hurts.\u201d You said after trying to push off a leg to get up but the pain didn\u2019t allow you to move without reminding you of your weakened state. You growled a little at the pain than just sighed in defeat as you lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t right.\u201d Sarah said to which you looked at her with you\u2019re the eye she was petting above. \u201cThey had not right to do this to you. When have you ever done anything even worth a tongue lashing? They cut you open with little regard for wither you would survive or not. Can\u2019t believe they did this to you.\u201d she said as she traced part of the scare that now lined from the top of your chest to near your groin where they cut you open. It must have taken hours to make a cut that long in your scales and even longer to correct it after correcting the damage they did to your organs. Your body probably helped a great deal but now seeing the aftermath of the damage you realized it was a rather serious endeavor they went on to get the others out of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve done a lot more for what he did.\u201d Came an old voice you knew to be one of the elders you had previously met. \u201cYou gave your word that you would never eat any from this village or its allies unless instructed otherwise and you did just that. Not only that but you ate multiple ninja children while they and you were on a mission.\u201d She said and you let out a little growl at the remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you decide to do the same to us you should know that we had an enhanced paper bomb sewn in next to your heart. Any one of a few people can detonate it at any time, taking your heart with it.\u201d Said the other elder as Lady Tsunade walked up enough to hear but not participate in the conversation until this point. For the first time in a very long time there was fear in your eyes that the two took as a good sign and Tsunade used to gauge your understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had hoped you had been telling the truth about healing them but they had no injuries what so ever. They didn\u2019t even have the signs of the injuries.\u201d Tsunade stated. \u201cThey said you healed them but we know you have mind powers that allow you to manipulate one\u2019s mind. You could have implanted that situation into their minds and the fact that the stomach we found them in had a direct path to your digestive system I think that is the case. I will not even bother to ask why as you would just give an answer that may sound believable but still far from the truth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous! Max would never do that!\u201d Sarah bursted out. \u201cIf he said he was healing them than he was healing them!\u201d she insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough! It is clear he has you so enchanted that you would believe that the sky was pink if he said it. You need to be cleared of this influence.\u201d Tsunade stated and within seconds of a hand movement a few Anbu came and took her away after rendering her unconscious for the struggles she was putting out. You started to force yoruu body to move wither it wanted to or not but with another move from an elder your knee exploded in pain. \u201cDo not think we only placed one bomb in your body. As much as you are dangerous you are also too valuable of a resource to let go. So those bombs will remain as insurance for your cooperation. Sarah will be removed of your influence and set free as soon as that is finished. Get some rest and heal, you are going to have a lot of work to do.\u201d She finished as she patted you on the nose to which you flinched at each drop of the hand, expecting her at this point to hit you or something to get a response. You would have previously not flinched or thought it possible for her to hurt you like that but now you didn\u2019t know what to think. You were so confused, sad, angry, and again in a lot of pain as your injuries healed, including your new one on your knee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As time passed you continually reminded what you had done. In a weird sense they were right. You had broken your word and what was worse you didn\u2019t even know if it was the right circumstance to do it in. They weren\u2019t dead when you ate them and they could\u2019ve been saved be the multiple medical personnel Tsunade sent to help. From that moment on you were shunned by most everyone as you had been reduced to little more than a pack animal used for transport. You were forbidden to fight in any situation or learn anything more that may increase your effectiveness in battle. Instead you were used as a pack animal and a quick transport system for ninja or just about anyone dependeing on what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarah was finally released her brain was altered. From what you could tell from reading it they had to cover over what they thought you did and start fresh. That was the most degrading and hurtful thing they could\u2019ve done. She looked and treated you like you were no more than an untrustworthy monster for \u201cdegrading her mind\u201d as she had been taught. You thought about making her aware and uncovering what they covered in her mind with your power but they would just redo it again and you didn\u2019t want her in any pain. But after Naruto left to go train with Master Jiriaya you were left without anyone to talk to. He was the only one energetic and \u201cfoolish\u201d enough to do it. Finally after what was the last paper bomb went off, other than the one by your heart, for snarling at the scent of an invading ninja you had enough. You had waited for this moment as you only had enough skill to destroy one in your body and the fact that all of them were linked so destroying one would have set off the rest. You wasted no time as you thought that they may try to kill you now that one was used or would try to put more in. You carefully destroyed it so it didn\u2019t go off nor was there any trace left of it in your system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax! What are you doing?\u201d asked Sarah as you had changed to human and took her to a secret place you had dug in preparation for this. It hid you completely and even extremely high level ninja would have a hard time finding it. \u201cEveryone is looking for you. You better show yourself before they detonate your last bomb. What are you doing out of dragon form anyway?\u201d she asked as you were not allowed to do that as you would be able to evade people easier as small as your human form was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay here anymore. I can\u2019t stand what they did to you. If they want me gone so badly that is what I\u2019ll be, gone. But not before I undo what they did to you.\u201d you said as you lay a hand on her head as her other limps were restrained by a paralysis jutsu you had picked up from just watching the others. They had thought they were keeping you from getting stronger because you didn\u2019t practice but you had stored them in your mind and were able to use them just fine. She was about to scream but you quickly broke the cover they made over her memories and helped her ease into them as they flooded back to her. Her face stayed in a horror state. Originally it was there because she thought you were going to kill her but now it was there because of what she and the others were doing to you. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d she asked as she collapsed as you took the Paralysis jutsu off her. \u201cMax?\u201d she asked as if she were asking a tuff question. Indeed it was as she reached out you flinched like you had been doing for months at people\u2019s touch. She saw this and started to cry, like you she never wanted anything bad to happen to you. You both were very close and hated those who hurt the other. The fact that she was one of those people that hurt you was not easy for her to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I can\u2019t stay here anymore. I brought you down here against your will so you could go back if you wanted. Or you could come with me but either way you wouldn\u2019t be branded as a rouge ninja.\u201d You said and she looked up at you as you dropped down to her level awaiting her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forgive me?\u201d she asked and as you nodded she threw her arms around you. \u201cThen they can go to hell for all I care. What right did they have to do this? Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She said and backed off so you could transform to which she got on you and strapped in. You shot some fire at a fuse that started to bury the tunnel you made behind you as you ran. You made it long so you could come out near the edge of the village but far enough away so the wall patrol couldn\u2019t see you. So you came out of the tunnel and leapt into the night sky and allowing your natural features to blend with the darkness as you flew away from the village. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She said finally as she lay on your neck and back, still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for. You acted that way because they put it in your head it was right. You have always done what was right no matter what. I have always been proud of you and will continue to count myself luck y that you are with me. You even completed the academy in two years. That has to be a record. I would never do anything to harm you and I hate to see you hurt. So no more crying because of me ok?\u201d you said and she nodded into your neck then cleared some tears away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d she asked as you flew. It was a good question. You didn\u2019t want to be somewhere near any ninja or they would just come for the two of you. But if you picked something to remote it would cut off essential living like food or water. So you had to pick wisely where to go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You landed on a small island called Tear Island. It was far off the coast and very far from any of the great 5 nations. There were ninja here but very few that interacted with the villages and there was just as many sword\u2019s man, knights, and pretty much any other type of fighter that had washed up. The island got its name from the occasional person that washed up after being shipwrecked. Together with the fact that there was constant storms and whirlpools around the island they were stuck there. Since that was the main and usually only way to get to the island you and Sarah were welcomed warmly, of course you had remained in human form since you landed and it helped that no one saw you flying. They supplied you with some basic tools, area to build a house, shack, or whatever you could with the materials around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was awesome as you were able to build a small house, less impressive than any of the others but more sturdy. But the house was only what it looked like on the outside. Inside was normal except a sealed door that only you and Sarah could open. It teleported you deep below the ground into an area big enough to house and maintain 5 hidden villages for 10 years. Complete with a water vein and a teleportation set that brought in animals that were thoroughly screened for any sign of alteration like being a ninja dog or having a bomb in it. You didn\u2019t want your and Sarah\u2019s secret place to become discovered. It was a serine place with a complicated system to bring in sun light, display the stars, and just about anything you or Sarah could think up. It was a place only for the two of you and neither of you had any intension of sharing it with others around no matter how nice they seemed, after what happen with the Leaf Village. It was also an optimal place to train and you both were becoming vastly more powerful, Sarah more than you since training with a human did improve your skills but not as much as a human training with a dragon on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that you also built a blacksmith shop and Sarah built herself a tailoring shop. Originally it was to make weapons and armor that you both wore out while training but as people began to see it and notice the high quality of some of the things you both made they began shopping. And just like that you both were interactive and completely natural part of the village. However neither of you ever showed anyone anything that might point to the conclusion that either of you were ninja and definitely not a dragon rider couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your sword. Try o be more careful with it but you can always bring it back if you break it again.\u201d You said as you handed a katana back to its owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExceptional work for such a low price. You sure you don\u2019t want more?\u201d he asked as he examined the blade than sheathed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, besides Mike the amount of times I see you I\u2019d be robbing you blind if I charged what the others do. You really do go through a lot of blades.\u201d You answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Max, I think you see me more often than my mother.\u201d He said and you both laughed at the truth of his statement. \u201cBut seriously man, if you ever need anything just remember that I got your back.\u201d He said with a hand raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mike I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d You said as you shook his hand and he left for home. There were a lot of people that you and Sarah sold to like that. You had been bullied a few times and she harassed, as either of you wouldn\u2019t fight back in any impressive fashion. However you had grown to supply some of the most honorable and notable people in Tear village and Island that the culprit never got to far before someone came to your aid. In a way you two were more protected than the town elders and leaders. \u201cHello, welcome to my shop.\u201d You said as the door opened and in walked a man with orange hair and cloak that was Black with red cloud shapes on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour\u2026 business partner referred me over after she repaired my robe. I need some Kunai.\u201d He said directly and if his posture didn\u2019t scream ninja than the way he held himself did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, I have some in stock. How many do you need?\u201d you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c500\u201d he said simply to which you wrote it down on a slip of paper. Than did some math and came out with a number for a price and gave it to him for approval. \u201cIs this a bargain shop? Such a low price means that either it is just as low of quality or that you got them with questionable means.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI make them myself and I can give you a sample free of charge so you can determine wither they are quality is an issue.\u201d You said as you went over to a box where you had them neatly packed in so they didn\u2019t rub or scratch each other. You pulled one out carefully and handed it to him. He grabbed it and handled it around, checking all the things that makes a good blade. \u201cIs it acceptable?\u201d you asked when he placed it on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now why are they so cheap?\u201d he asked and you laughed a little. \u201cDid I say something that was funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, I just get that question a lot. They are cheap because I don\u2019t really need a lot of money. You see I do this and make weapons for fun and they just so happen to be a market for the stuff. So if I have what you are looking for than you are just financing my talent so I can continue. Even if you didn\u2019t buy any I would still continue making them so you are just freeing me of some of the extras I have around. However I have learned the hard way that just giving them away can be hazardous so I do require a fee but just enough so kids can\u2019t come in and buy them like candy.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, then do you have what I need?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happens that I have 700 Kunai in stock so I will be able to help you in such a large quantity. Do you need help with transportation?\u201d you asked but you were answered by a few other men and women with equally orange hair coming in. The first one counted out the money and placed it on the counter. \u201cVery well then, those four boxes have 250 kunai each just like the one you previously sampled. Please come again if you need more, although the odds on me having such an abundance in the near future is somewhat slim.\u201d You said to which he nodded and followed the others with the boxes out the door. For a moment you wondered what his name was but you noticed he filled it out on the sales order you made. \u2018Pain\u2019 was his name. You then wondered if it was an alias or a self appointed name. Either way you filed them with the rest and started on making more kunai. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax! Max!\u201d came a yell from Sarah\u2019s store which got you and the people in it to run over and rush into her store. There was two people you were actually hoping not to see again. Master Jiraiya and Naruto. Well to be honest out of all the leaf ninja they were in the top five you wouldn\u2019t mind but pretty much everyone in that world you felt a high distain for. Naruto was confronting her and Master Jiraiya turned to address the crowd of people coming into the store. Luckily the door was closer to the counter and they the two were at an angle so Sarah jumped the counter in a very believable way for an immature fighter to do. She hung onto you as the crowd of people came in at your back at her scream and calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what you two are up to but these two are off limits. They do a lot of good in this town for vermin like you to rough them up.\u201d Mike said with a chorus of agreements amongst the others. Among them were a few that were Jounin level or higher in their perspective arts so the crowd was not to be taken lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRough them up? They are the ones you should be worried about!\u201d Naruto exclaimed as he pointed towards the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think we would take your word over theirs? We all have known them for a little over a year now and they have done no wrong to anyone. They make us quality stuff for less than fractions of what they are worth, they help the children with their homework, and are overall more protected than the elders as we all owe them more than we can repay in a lifetime. They even help deliver babies and help newcomers when they come. All you have done is barge in, insult them, and by the looks of things threatened Sarah.\u201d Another man said who was a respectable master of martial arts. And it was obvious now to Jiraiya that most of the people in the group would be hard to defeat and were far from being brainwashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 I think we all need to relax. We were just a little surprised to see them and overreacted. However we would like to talk with them privately, just talking nothing more.\u201d Master Jiraiya said as he waved Naruto\u2019s rising temper down along with the others as they recognized he was at least an honest man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d you said as they looked at you for an answer. \u201cWe do know these two and if nothing else they can be trusted to keep their word. But such a conversation is best suited for a more private setting. Mike, if you wouldn\u2019t mind showing them to our house. I am afraid we are going to have to close early today.\u201d You said and some moaned at the news but they heeded your request so the two were escorted by more than just Mike to the house than backed away after you and Sarah made your way following the early close of the shops. They all gave you your privacy but it was clear from a look that they would be nearby in their respective elements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Sarah asked before you were in earshot of the two but after closing the door to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just hear what they have to say and hope we don\u2019t have to run again. I don\u2019t really want to kill them.\u201d you said and she nodded as she didn\u2019t either. Underneath all the subterfuge they were really kind people, kinder than most people you knew. You both made your way to the small seating area where they were waiting. It looked like Jiraiya had to make Naruto sit down to prevent an outburst. You and Sarah sat in chairs facing them before you spoke. \u201cNow what have you two come here for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just passing through when we heard rumors of a couple that made the finest arms and armor around for cheaper than you would find at a cheap secondhand store.\u201d Master Jiraiya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut the crap. You can\u2019t just pass through Tear Island. You either wash up shipwrecked or it takes quite a bit of effort to get here.\u201d Sarah stated as she was highly defensive in her obvious accusation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you were practicing the Giant Rasengan on the whirlpools.\u201d You stated and they both were stunned silent at your knowledge of it. \u201cWe\u2019re in solitude not dead. We get all kinds of people here and not all by accident. Judging on the fact that you already knew the Rasengan the only other reason to come here where whirlpools are ever present is to practice a larger version of it. However I doubt you both came to our stores to replenish supplies. You probably heard our names somewhere in the village and came to see the only lead you had on where we might be.\u201d You ended calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes a lot more sense than just passing through.\u201d Sarah agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since we established why we are hear why don\u2019t we continue by asking why you are here?\u201d Master Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t if obvious? We came here to get away from all of you.\u201d you stated as if they should\u2019ve known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you turned yourselves into rouge ninja to escape your punishment for what you did?\u201d Naruto stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he did? We didn\u2019t do it to escape what HE did. We escaped because of what YOU did.\u201d Sarah yelled at him. You were thankful that you built the house to be sound proof or the whole village would\u2019ve heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe ate 4 of us! how are you ok with that?\u201d Naruto shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was healing them you idiot! If he really did implant the whole thing than where the hell is Sasuke? Or did he implant that to? Didn\u2019t you have to fight for and against him? Wasn\u2019t there injuries from fighting Orochimaru\u2019s best servants? He saved their lives and you all repay him by cutting him open, rewriting my mind, and enslaving him for a year. How are you ok with that?!\u201d she shouted back in which the point about Sasuke hit him harder than the rest. Even Jiraiya was looking different at you as if just being hit in the gut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d asked Naruto before Jiraiya could stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to be kidding. You all had a paper bomb go off every time he opened his mouth without permission and rewrote my memory. How the hell were we suppose to do that? Even if we could everyone already thought he was a lying, bloodthirsty, betrayer!\u201d Sarah continued to yell until you put your hand on hers that was gripping the chair so hard it was cracking. Jiriaya did something similar to get Naruto back under control as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could talk with Tsunade, maybe get you cleared to come back. Your absence left the village in a tuff spot as they were depending on you for future missions and jobs they had to cancel.\u201d Jiraiya offered with a little guilt on the end for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to understand.\u201d You said calmly. \u201cWe left to get away from everyone. We don\u2019t want to go back. And while I do feel for the hardship they have from time to time I don\u2019t feel bad for freeing myself and Sarah of their influence and demands. I don\u2019t know if you can imagine being treated like a pack animal but I have no desire to go back to that, or the people who forced me into it. I have absolutely no trust for anyone in the village at the moment and feel no pull to help them get out of whatever they got themselves into.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be that casual about all the lives in the village?\u201d Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask you the same question. Why didn\u2019t you help when Orochimaru attacked the village? If you had helped the third in his battle he might have lived.\u201d You stated and got a rather serious look to grow across his face. \u201cMy point is that we all have our reasons and we don\u2019t need to explain them but they are reasons none the less. The Leaf Village was doing fine before I crashed into this realm and it will be fine after I am gone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are ok with being rouge ninja?\u201d Naruto asked as the idea didn\u2019t make sense to him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are under the assumption that we are.\u201d You said and they both looked quizzically at you. \u201cShortly after I was turned into a pack animal by you people I was stripped of my ninja status. It went so far as to say that I was property of the village and not a resident so being considered a ninja at all is a step up from that. As for Sarah, I technically kidnapped her before I freed her of your mind tampering. So she is still a Leaf Ninja by record but if what you are saying is true than she is no longer bound to the leaf but by no fault of her own. In both cases we had no part in making ourselves rouge ninja. That was done by the same people you want us to go back to. Yet another reason we don\u2019t wish to return.\u201d You explained and waited for them to make another statement that was false or misguided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the end this is the hard truth.\u201d Sarah said and they both looked at her as she spoke. Even if they didn\u2019t see her as a friend or such anymore she was still unnaturally smart so people tended to listen when she was talking reasonably. \u201cThe Leaf betrayed US.\u201d she said and let that set in before she continued. \u201cMax is more passive about it than I am. Personally I wouldn\u2019t mind if I never hear about the Leaf Village again. All it is to me is a bunch of people that hurt and made me hurt the one person I swore I would never harm. Do you have any idea how long it took to get Max to stop flinching after we got here. Every hand raise he looked away, every hand sign was a possible paper bomb inside him. It took weeks to be able to touch him without his heart racing in fear. Even now he sometimes shuns away from my touch. You and your village did that and I will never forget it.\u201d She said with a deathly serious voice that was almost visible. She was again shaking with anger and you just squeezed her hand to which she calmed down but kept the serious face she had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must hate us.\u201d Naruto said as he broke the silence, finally understanding your position and as a first, before Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it before, I only truly hate dragons. But I far from trust any of you. Now that you have found us we might have to move again. I could see the leaf or another country sending ninja for us eventually when we are discovered. At best it out reveal that we are more than a tailor and blacksmith and at worst it would end up taking the lives of the people around us that we have grown to care for.\u201d You responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d Master Jiraiya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could take your word for it but as I have said we don\u2019t trust any of you anymore. However I don\u2019t call the shots on if we leave or not.\u201d You said to which they almost asked in, \u2018silence who does?\u2019 and you simply looked over to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on us being here if you come back.\u201d She said bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that is expected.\u201d Master Jiraiya said then he did something and was followed by Naruto that you never thought you would see from the two usual jokers. They got down on their knees then bowed with their heads to the floor. \u201cWe know that this won\u2019t change anything that has happened but\u2026, we are truly sorry.\u201d He said and Naruto spoke similar words if a little less skillfully as Master Jiraiya did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right it doesn\u2019t change what happened. I still don\u2019t trust you and it is pretty safe to say that Sarah hates your guts.\u201d You said with a pause as it sunk in. \u201cBut at least it is a start. Maybe we can try taking you at your word and stay for a little while. I don\u2019t think Sarah nor I want to leave. I guess if ninja start attacking and searching for us we will know if there is any stock in your words.\u201d you said and Sarah quietly agreed but went to the bedroom and slammed the door. She didn\u2019t want to leave but every sane part of her said she should.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were slightly saddened when one evening you smelled something that you didn\u2019t want to smell. It was hard to mistake the scent of Lady Tsunade and Kakashi along with some of the other jounin and others that you used to know rather well. This meant that either Jiraiya and Naruto told them or they had some kind of network that happened to coincide with the estimated traveling time it they went there and back. Sarah wanted to bolt right away but you made a deal with her. If they approached either of you during the day at work she was to meet you in your secret room and they would leave from there. However if they came by after hours than she would at least have to hear them out. And to her dismay while you two were waiting they came knocking. You had left the door open so when they knocked the door swung open as a result. You had moved the door to your secret room to the wall that you and Sarah were sitting directly in front of. All you would have to do would be to touch the wall to get in if it came down to it. The door was hidden well so it appeared that you both were cornered. This would flush out their intensions with minimal damage. They came in and closed the door behind them. The house was small enough that their number forced them into the room where you both were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wish I could say that I was surprised or glad to see you all.\u201d Sarah said with a clear irritation in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you had more respect for your Hokage than that.\u201d Neji stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, my Hokage? That implies that I trust her to that extent and accept her as such. You all lost that when you implanted false memories and made me harm Max as if he was a vile beast. Not to mention you branded both of us rouge ninja which forfeits any claim you might have had.\u201d She stated but was interrupted by a crack as the arm of the chair you were on was cracking as you gripped it in a visual state for fear. Over half the people in the room had more than once detonated the paper bombs that were your torment for so long. And when they didn\u2019t want to waist one they would discipline you in other fashions. Either way you were working hard not to run or assume the position that you were required to do back then when they were near. This state seemed to anger Sarah even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no need to be scared. We didn\u2019t come to harm you.\u201d Tsunade stated as she and the others took seats you had prepared ahead of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt took me months to get him to stop flinching around me. You think a few words are enough to erase the mental torment you inflicted?\u201d Sarah said back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe came here to resolve this mess, not cause more damage.\u201d Shikimaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks more like you are here to get the big bad dragon back under your thumb. Well he\u2019s not going back and he sure isn\u2019t going to let you put more bombs in his body to control him with.\u201d Sarah shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what he thinks or just what you think?\u201d Kiba asked more you than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah is the one person I trust 100%. If she says something than I believe it. She is also far smarter than I am so I tend to do what she says.\u201d You said in a hesitant tone as the last time you spoke that way around them your spleen exploded and your hand moved to the spot as if readying to receive the pain but when it didn\u2019t come you returned your had to its firm grip on the chair. Tsunade however remembered Sarah saying something similar about you right before she ordered her to be cleansed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is more passive about the whole thing. Maybe he has too much hate for dragons that he doesn\u2019t have enough to cover people like you. But he thinks that it might work out in the end. I think it is absolutely idiotic but that is Max for you. If he was anything like me he would have charred you the moment you stepped through the door.\u201d She said and the last part finally made them flinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he really cared at all he wouldn\u2019t have just left.\u201d Sakura stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! Do you think he enjoyed being your little slave? Did you think he would\u2019ve reveled the thought of you putting more bombs in his body under threat of killing him? You treat him like garbage and make me do the same while you judge him for any move he makes as an act of treason. He is not your property and he will never be. You all put him through hell and made me help and after he decided to leave in place of that or burning his place of torture to the ground you say he didn\u2019t care. You all make me sick.\u201d She lectured as a return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have all done things we regret. This and was definitely something we wish we could take back. Haven\u2019t you done something you wish you hadn\u2019t?\u201d Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have pondered that many times.\u201d You started and they looked at you and noticed your pained face before you continued. \u201cI think back and wonder what would\u2019ve happened if I didn\u2019t do anything on that last mission. After all the medical core was on its way. They might have been able to tend to the wounded just fine. The sand ninja were there and didn\u2019t really need my help. Everyone was alive enough to survive so why did I do what I did? I don\u2019t know what is worse, knowing that what I did was bad or that I could\u2019ve prevented it if I had thought more clearly. Perhaps I could\u2019ve followed Sasuke to Orochimaru or stopped him all together from leaving the border. There are a lot of if(s) and just as many possible answers. I don\u2019t have the wisdom to know what would\u2019ve worked.\u201d You said and looked even more pained at the end of your little ponder. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo Max, you did the right thing by putting the lives of others first.\u201d Kakashi said after staying silent through the first part of the conversation. \u201cAfter everything I taught you about team work what is right and wrong we\u2026 We should be ashamed of ourselves, I know that I am. I even have you questioning the selfless decision you made. You must have also known that we would react in a similar fashion but trusted that we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d he said as if looking back on an old war mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou even told us that it would be awkward and we told you to do it. To top it off you healed us perfectly while they were trying to get us out. We didn\u2019t even acknowledge it and punished you for it.\u201d Kiba added with a wine from Akamaru that got you to again flinch at the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask how you saved me?\u201d Choji asked with all heads turned to him. \u201cI mean the pill I took effected my whole system so it wasn\u2019t some hole through the chest or limited to one area. I know I have just as much to apologize for than the rest but I would like to know everything before.\u201d At this point Sarah was about to rebuke him but you shook your head at her and she let you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I got back I had stabilized everyone\u2019s condition but at that point the sudden exposure to the harsh environment outside of me would\u2019ve killed the ones I was healing. So when I was cut open I realized that if I didn\u2019t find a way to heal everyone completely they would die. So as my body often does, it supplied me with a solution using the genetic memory I possess. It gave me a magic that allowed me to take on all the problems that still needed to be healed and transferred them to my body. That way the healing power of my cells would be better equipped to handle and deal with it. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see if it worked as I passed out from the pain quickly after my stomach was cut open.\u201d You explained and even more guilt was passed on to them in more than a few areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo even then you were trying to save them. I am ashamed I had any part in it.\u201d Tsunade said \u201cI was going to offer you both the clearing of your rouge ninja status and give you the forest of death as your home as compensation for our crimes against you. But if I were in your position I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with us.\u201d She admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe accept.\u201d Sarah said with would\u2019ve made the whole room drop to the ground if they weren\u2019t already sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Tsunade asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure why myself but Max seems to understand.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Third was a great man wasn\u2019t he?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, we all miss him.\u201d Kakashi said as he was the only one to recover from both Sarah\u2019s answer and your mention of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe took me aside when he to determine one thing before I was accepted into the village the first time. I didn\u2019t even know about it at the time. But I came to understand as he met with me over and over again to see how I was doing and adapting to the village. He spoke of the \u2018Will of Fire\u2019. It was then I realized that I couldn\u2019t just sit by while those of the Leaf suffered. I couldn\u2019t help but to keep them from harm. It was why I endured the pain and didn\u2019t take vengeance on the Village afterwards. Even if the Village had lost faith in me the \u2018Will of Fire\u2019 that the Third spoke of prevented me from turning on it. We simply can\u2019t bring ourselves to abandon it. However things couldn\u2019t stay the way they were so that is why we went so far away. So that the problems of the Leaf wouldn\u2019t reach our ears and compel us to intervene. I left when I was considered property so I was no longer a ninja by record. I kidnapped Sarah before I freed her mind so she wasn\u2019t considered a rouge ninja by choice. But now that you have come and expressed a need for us we can\u2019t ignore it, even if we want to.\u201d You explained and they listened to a speech that the Third may have given himself at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to say. We weren\u2019t expecting you to come back or so willingly trust us again.\u201d Sakura said in a clear shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you are still misunderstanding us.\u201d Sarah said and they all looked at her confused. \u201cWe will come back as we can\u2019t seem to help ourselves. However we far from trust any of you at this point. You have to earn that back which won\u2019t be easy. The village itself will bring back many bad memories for us, more so for Max, not to mention the inevitable person that will shun him even after we legally accepted back\u201d she said and they nodded in both same and understanding. \u201cI suppose you all will need a ride back? Boats don\u2019t tend to work around here.\u201d She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are willing Max?\u201d Tsunade asked with her head bowed at the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome.\u201d Was the only word you said in response as you stood and touched the wall to get into your secret place. You turned to a dragon and waited for them to come through. As they came through they looked around at the serine atmosphere of the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d asked Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax and I made it so he could stretch his dragon side as well as train. The village we just left doesn\u2019t know we were ninja much more dragon and rider. But down here we can practice, train, spar, relax, hunt, and anything else we would need. Usually only the two of us know of this place but it would work well for disappearing from the village. We set it up so that if we were to leave their minds would be altered just enough to prevent any fallback. This is our paradise in a manner of speaking. So get on him already so we can get you all out of it.\u201d She snapped the last part and motioned over to you as you had laid down for them to get on. They took one last look around before they did so. Each one felt a definite ping of guilt as your body flinched and quivered at their slightest touch like an abused dog waiting for their master to hit them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to strap in?\u201d asked Tsunade as Sarah jumped on your neck while you raised it and started walking. She was halfway up but facing them as if making sure they didn\u2019t hurt you. They were all tucked securely in with your spikes but she was just sitting on you with ease, not even shaking for balance as you moved and walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am his rider. We have trained not only as ninja but also as a dragon rider couple. I can ride from anywhere, and I do mean anywhere. Unlike you I don\u2019t need a safety belt to ride Max.\u201d she said as you made it to a wall than pressed it with your snout and you were all instantly teleported to a high mountain near the Land of Fire. Sarah moved to the top of your head as she looked out over the land. \u201cSo we\u2019re back. Let\u2019s get going before we second guess ourselves.\u201d She said to which you leapt off the mountain and soared high toward the village. The others were amazed that Sarah could stand on your head as if you were standing still while they were hardly hanging on even with safety spikes and hand grips provided. You whimpered a little when you got close to the village but Sarah sat down and stroked your head soothingly. Then with a sigh you dove down to once again enter the village you both had run so far from.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was unbelievably hard to adjust for you. Even after both you and Sarah were awarded the level of Jounin as you two were vastly stronger than Tsunade herself. People treated you pretty much the same except those who knew better. For this reason you more or less stayed in your new home of the Forest of Death. Sarah on the other hand was more aggressive and people were more used to her as an ally. She got right back where she left off and was making remarkable progress fitting in and accepting their apologies. However her temper flared when anyone badmouthed you. However you both still thoroughly enjoyed riding with each other. It was also understood that missions were carried out by one of you would be carried out by both. She was the only one fit to be your rider after all and you both were increasingly more effective together than apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max!\u201d said a voice as you looked over from your rest. You saw Kakashi, Sakura, and Naruto. The voice belonged to Naruto as he was usually the first to speak. \u201cSo you came back.\u201d He said a little nervous at what was said the last time you two met. He also glanced down at the noticeable scare that decorated your underside. It was a constant reminder to people and you of what happened. Most of the more serious scares from your mother were hidden under your wings but these were hard to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, I was told you were gone from the village for two years total. It\u2019s quieter around without you here.\u201d You said and Sakura laughed at it. You had stopped flinching for the most part at people\u2019s gestures and touch but every once in a while you let one slip and it hit whoever was around with regret. You didn\u2019t like seeing people like that so you tried your best to overcome it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, we have a mission if you are up for it?\u201d Kakashi asked. You were about to ask where Sarah was but that question answered itself as she came running over from the tree line. \u201cGaara has been taken by a group known as the Akatsuki. We think they are after the one tailed beast inside him. We need to head to the Sand Village right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you\u2019re coming.\u201d You said to Sarah and she gave a \u2018no duh\u2019 face. \u201cWell if we are all set I did get a nap after breakfast so I\u2019m ready to.\u201d You said as you lowered your head and neck for them to get on. Sarah jumped to your head and the others took spots on your back. It wasn\u2019t long before you were up in the air and leaving toward the sand village. \u201cHey did Temari just stop by?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she should be on her way back. If you see her we should give her a ride back, Gaara is her brother you know?\u201d Sakura said to which you dove down which caught Temari\u2019s attention as you landed in front of her. It didn\u2019t take long for the others to address the situation and with Gaara\u2019s safety in her mind she was less frightened at approaching and taking you up on your offer to fly her there with you. With a gust you took off and as it was her first flight on you she was a bit queasy until you leveled off high above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey do you mind if we go a little faster?\u201d Sarah asked the others and more specifically Temari. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaster? Are you saying he can go faster than this?\u201d Temari asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, this is less than a quarter of his speed. But most people barf when he reaches half speed so he tones it down for your sake.\u201d Sarah said as she walked over to them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it gets us there quicker than please.\u201d Temari pleaded to which you could almost see the smirk on Sarah\u2019s face even with your head facing the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard her Max.\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should talk about this first\u2026\u201d Naruto said but was cut off of what he was going to say by you suddenly increasing in speed. But after about three hours of the intense speed that left them all out of breath you slowed and circled above a village at an angle so they could see down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny input on where we should land?\u201d You asked back to the frozen Temari until she was snapped back to what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn front of the gate would be best. Guests have to go through security before entering.\u201d She advised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d You agreed and dove down to the front gate like she said. The sudden appearance of a dragon caused an alarm and you had to hope they didn\u2019t attack. You weren\u2019t really looking forward to taking hits from whatever they decided to throw at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grunted and gasped as large spiked spears or poles were launched and sometimes implanted themselves into you. It wasn\u2019t until you were in earshot of humans that Temari got their attention and they stopped. When you finally landed and came to a stop you let them off and proceeded to pull the protruding weapons out. Each one let out a significant amount of blood before the hole was sealed as your body healed. Sarah helped with some of them that you couldn\u2019t reach until they were all out and you had recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry sir, please forgive us.\u201d said a guard as they bowed to you after you turned to human so you could go with everyone else into the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, happens all the time.\u201d You said and continued with no further thought However Sarah ended with a glare as if to add a death threat if they did it again. It wasn\u2019t long while chasing a running Temari to find Kankuro as the news reached her she had rushed to him. However you had little time in the room to dwell as a rather old lady tried to run Kakashi through as she mistook him for someone named The White Fang, a ninja that apparently looked just like Kakashi give or take. The people in the room didn\u2019t take your presence much better as you all entered. After getting him conscious with some fast and precise medical implementation Sakura called you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is HE doing here?\u201d he spat as you still had a rather bad reputation among those that heard about you before you returned to the village. You expression sank a little but otherwise looked to Sakura to see what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long story but for now he is saving your life.\u201d Sakura stated then turned to you. \u201cI got most of it out. If you could\u2026 you know\u2026 do that thing? Your body would be able to handle it since it was a poison meant for strictly humans. I have enough to make an antidote later but he needs it out of his system before it spreads again.\u201d She asked and you nodded, taking a position near his head. You placed a hand on his forehead and despite his protests you started. A light game from his body as it glowed then looked as if the light was easing its way through his veins and into your hand. When it was done there wasn\u2019t even a scratch from his battle and he was able to sit straight up as a bit of blood came from the wounds he once had. You walked over and sat down while clapping your hand to one of the bigger wounds and put another hand to your head as your body dealt with the injuries and poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he just do? I feel better than before I fought.\u201d Kankuro said as he flexed his limbs to be sure and looked over at you while you nursed the pain with the aid and soothing of Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax has an unusual ability. He can take in the illness or injuries of someone to his own body, leaving the other person completely healed. You may notice all your scratches and wounds are also gone. Even if you had a headache he would absorb that as well. His body can heal itself very effectively but the pain and wounds don\u2019t tickle as they feel the same or worse than when you had them.\u201d Kakashi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat manner of jutsu is that child?\u201d the old lady from before asked. You heard someone call her \u2018Granny Chiyo\u2019 and she seemed to be like a less idolized version of the elders in the Leaf Village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a jutsu.\u201d You answered as you looked up at her a scratch across your chest healed and it was hard not to notice. \u201cIf anything it is magic but the term doesn\u2019t quite fit either. I am not exactly sure what it is but it is useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have beautiful eyes. Almost reminds me of Uchiha eyes but more standard. That shade of red suits you well.\u201d she complimented. You looked at Sarah as if to ask if you were slipping as sometimes you missed something during your transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re ok.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank thank you Ms. Chiyo.\u201d You said to her with a smile. After that she seemed to notice the reaction of the people in the room toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what has their underpants in a bunch but you seem ok in my book.\u201d She smiled back and laughed an old lady laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need some air.\u201d You said after Kakashi sent out the ninja hounds in search or Gaara. You had said you could just as easily track him but they said that was what they were for so you were benched for the moment. But all the glares were getting to you so with a sigh of relief when they allowed you to sleep on the roof. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to sleep in a bed?\u201d you asked as you stretched your full dragon body out then curled up for the night. Once you were situated and the guards stopped panicking she took her spot in the crook of your head and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly, you are my bed. I never sleep better than when I\u2019m with you. You\u2019re so nice and warm and safe. Sleep well Max.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, something tells me we\u2019re going to have a busy day tomorrow.\u201d You returned to which she hummed and cuddled into your neck then fell asleep with you following shortly after.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kankuro and Temari were angry that they were ordered to remain and it was the one time they showed that they were glad you were going. However Granny Chiyo joined the group and was surprised at the sight of you. It took transforming to human and back to convince her that you were the Max she was talking to before. Then with that settled you took off and flew toward where the dogs had tracked the one Kankuro fought. You could also smell Gaara, however because of Granny Chiyo you couldn\u2019t fly that fast. It was a premature stop when Kakashi asked that you set down for a break. You had been flying for a day straight so you agreed then went out to hunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max, how\u2019d your hunt go? Bring back anything tasty?\u201d Sarah asked while the others ate. Some didn\u2019t even notice you until she said something. You were a Dark Hunter and very few could follow your movements but being that it was light out it was a lot easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad a bear and a few wolves. But you always like deer don\u2019t you?\u201d you asked after you deposited the deer on the ground for her to prepare if she wanted. She hugged your head and gave you a little peck on the snout before going to clean and prepare the meat for cooking. You used to do it for her but as she got older she insisted that you didn\u2019t do everything for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to believe a creature such as yourself is so gentle.\u201d Granny Chiyo observed and it was a good thing Sarah didn\u2019t hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think.\u201d You said, not sure if it was a compliment or a criticism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe talked about Gaara and Naruto\u2019s story and why they are so different from the stereotype that marked them. What makes something, that legend says is quite dangerous, so kind and gentle.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not always that way.\u201d Sarah said as she came back with some meat and placed it on the fire to cook. She nodded back to the carcass and you covered yourself while taking in the rest she didn\u2019t touch then after cleaning yourself off so blood wasn\u2019t dripping from your mouth you turned back to the group. \u201cHe can get quite ferocious, especially if he sees another dragon. Back home he was dragon\u2019s worst nightmare, along with some human groups that liked slaying dragons.\u201d Sarah said and the others listened as if she was telling them a deep secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you kill your own Kind?\u201d Granny Chiyo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I hate dragons.\u201d You said with a growl then stopped as she was getting worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe question was why?\u201d she asked again but after she was confident it was safe to do so. You were laying so the side where your mother\u2019s teeth marks were more prominent. So all you had to do was lift your wing and the light shown off the scars while the ground covered the one the Leaf Village gave you. There was a gasp than after a few seconds you folded your wing back up. \u201cWhat could do that to you?\u201d she asked as if gathering information on a foe that could do that to a dragon your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother did that not more than a few minutes after I was born. I was then discarded like trash and hunted by any dragon that felt they could kill me. So when I was old and strong enough I fought back. I hated the way they treated me, I hate how they treat humans, I hate the arrogant stride they have without a care for anyone but themselves, I just hate them in general.\u201d You said as your eyes flared as if remembering a past event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you hate your own kind?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of them. He doesn\u2019t mind Kara.\u201d Sarah said and they all keyed up at a dragon you didn\u2019t hate. They were all under the impression you hated all other dragons. So this was news to him. \u201cShe\u2019s a dragon that was abandoned like he was, not as hard but still abandoned none the less. She was raised by humans and it took a lot for Max not to eat her. But we are both glad he didn\u2019t.\u201d she said and you both thought back to Kara and that she was waiting for them. Good thing dragons live for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou eat them too?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they were dead anyway and it would be wasteful and inconsiderate for me to go hunting with a ton of meat already provided. That and the other dragons would track the scent and attack the nearest village as retribution if I didn\u2019t take care of the corpse. It also scared the crap out of any dragons that thought they could sneak in and eat a few humans like they did elsewhere.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you eat humans as well? If you are half and half, and you do eat one side\u2026\u201d she asked concerned on the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a touchy subject.\u201d Sarah said for you as you looked away and the others looked down. \u201cHe has eaten a more than fair amount of humans and he says that to a dragon a human\u2019s taste is a delicacy, which is why so many dragons on my world eat humans. However Max only truly eats a human for digestion if he is given no other choice. He even prefers to waste the energy to burn them to ashes rather than just gulping them down. He also has a storage gut or second stomach that he can rapidly heal humans and keep them safe under his scales. Both instances require him to eat a human and he doesn\u2019t ever like doing it.\u201d Sarah explained for you. \u201cHowever he has recently been scared from doing the positive form of eating to heal people so I doubt he would do it again anytime soon.\u201d She added which got the others to sulk and Chiyou to repress some ideas she was having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Chiyo was still curious and for a time while they ate you answered them. You figured this was the first and probably last time she would see a dragon so she had to get her fill. Eventually the camp was cleaned up but right before you were about to leave a man blocked your path. The others were instantly on guard but you didn\u2019t see why. He was just a man on the council from the sand village. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh\u2026 what is going on?\u201d you asked as you were currently unaware why everyone was on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, that is Itachi Uchiha, you know as in Sasuke\u2019s brother.\u201d Said Sarah as she was the one to read up on all the people but as Sasuke had been and still was a friend of yours you had also learned as much as you could about him and this man wasn\u2019t it. The only thing that warranted caution, as far as you could see was that he had an Akatski Cloak on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? He doesn\u2019t smell or look anything like him, if those samples you gave me were accurate.\u201d You said as you leaned your head forward and sniffed him a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean if I remember right that man is a council member from the sand village. Although there is some kind of genjutsu around him, well not exactly but it he is shrouded in something that seems to be transferring control over his body to someone else.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can\u2019t look at him because Itachi has the sharingan. You think you can take him out?\u201d asked Sarah which got you to look down. You didn\u2019t like when they told you to kill someone. It was too close to the constant betrayal pattern to be comfortable by any means. Not to mention that the Sand Village thought you were still a threat, and you didn\u2019t think torching one of their council members would heal any wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get passed him. It is most likely that the man that is being used has already betrayed the Sand Village to allow this to happen to him. Either that or he needs to be freed of this torture.\u201d Kakashi stated as you looked at him as if asking if there was another way. You thought about it while the man possessed by Itachi was waiting for them to look at him and they were deflecting shuriken and Kunai as he was trying to get their attention and sight line. But in the end you didn\u2019t see any other way so you stood from your position and toward above the enemy ninja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used a form of shadow possession jutsu but a form that only paralyzed him and didn\u2019t transfer any injuries to you. You then loomed one of your claws over him and after hesitating again you ran the man through with a single stroke, effectively pinning him to the ground and lodging the claw through what used to be the majority of his torso. With that done you released the jutsu and your now bloody claw from the dead body. Granny Chiyo was noticeably freaked out on how easily you dispatched a very strong opponent. But you walked a little way to a small stream to clean what little blood you had gotten on yourself from the splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that they aren\u2019t going to lock you up every time you take out an enemy.\u201d Sarah said as she walked up beside you with the others investigating the corpse of the fallen ninja. You were still down as you were when she asked you to do it. Just like you were whenever you had to do something like that on every mission since you got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I just\u2026 I don\u2019t like it. Even if they don\u2019t think of me as the \u2018big bad dragon\u2019 anymore. It just seems that I am recognized as one. I know my appearance doesn\u2019t help the matter but\u2026 Is it so bad that I don\u2019t like killing them?\u201d you asked as you got done cleaning your claws and blood spatter from nearby scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come one I think you look cool.\u201d Sarah said as she gave you a pat on the leg, as that was all she could reach at the moment. You genuinely smiled at her joke as it was always a joke between you two. You looked \u2018cool\u2019 and she looked \u2018hot\u2019, as evidence to all the guys checking her out. Not to mention she was the only one that wasn\u2019t afraid from you smiling normally, which usually showed your teeth. It was a tell she was happy to see but most everyone else was afraid of the deadly assets to your arsenal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright sulking moment over, party pooper.\u201d You said as you brought your head down and nudged her a little. She just playfully hit you back than got on, which usually meant either leaping to the top or climbing up. When she would climb up it usually caused a panic of people that didn\u2019t know better. She was after all using deadly parts of your face for hand and foot holds, meaning your teeth, lips, nose, eye lids, and horns. Things that most people wouldn\u2019t touch with a 100 foot pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little more debating they all climbed up on you then you took off, as gently as you could for Granny Chiyo\u2019s sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok Max?\u201d asked Naruto to which most of the others other than Chiyo and Sarah were also thinking on that as you had been a little down when you killed the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Sarah helped and I feel fine.\u201d You said back to them as you flew, Sarah petting your head as she sat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy were you feeling bad? You did well and dispatched a powerful opponent with ease.\u201d Asked Granny Chiyo as she was confused why an action that usually spawned pride was apparently caught with such distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax said it before but he doesn\u2019t like killing people. Doesn\u2019t matter if they are like that or not. We might have something to do with his emotions on that part.\u201d Kakashi stated so you or Sarah didn\u2019t have to answer a question that brought up some unpleasant memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that we have had some trust issues with him in the past that was to our fault and none of his. We can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to go any further but it was hard to get over and still leaves a scare there for both sides to remember.\u201d Sakura stated and as Chiyo must have a few instances in her past in similar positions she let it drop there. For now she just expressed that she understood and you all just enjoyed the ride in your own ways. That was until\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another shockwave went through the surrounding land as you put your whole strength into a blow to break the 5 seal barrier around where Garra was. The shockwave was strong enough to cause miniature earthquakes and title waves but the barrier and those inside remained unaffected. You were tempted to try burning your way in but apparently that would only be a disastrous choice as it would destroy the seals needed to lift the barrier in the first place. You snarled at the once again unaffected barrier as some of those with you quivered at both this and the force you were unleashing to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we are going to have to do it the old fashion way.\u201d Kakashi sensei stated which the others agreed and you snuffed and relented to his knowledge of this. \u201cGuy, you and your team take care of the other tags while we deal with this one and get back to us as soon as you can.\u201d He instructed and with a few more words to each other and small talk they were off. Shortly after the radios were activated and they destroyed the barrier by peeling all the seal tags off at once. \u201cOk Sakura, why don\u2019t you give it a try this time. Max I don\u2019t think you can fit in there so you guard the entrance.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d you responded and crouched as if ready to pounce on the slightest movement. Sarah stayed on you as she usually did, being your rider and all. With the last \u2018boom\u2019 of the day the boulder covering the entrance collapsed and they all rushed in with you and Sarah guarding the hole but glaring inside. Naruto of course started making demands and the other two, although unnerved by you, argued than one of them made some kind of bird out of detonation clay and after grabbing Garra took off towards you. You caught his movement and would have just incinerated him but with Garra\u2019s body with him you didn\u2019t dare to do so. You made a grab for only him but with him being a comparatively smaller target than the whole bird he was on you missed and he flew out. You now saw how such an opponent could defeat Garra, he wasn\u2019t half bad. You snarled then turned to give chase as Naruto and Kakashi leapt on your back and you took off. They used their chakra to hold on which hurt a little as they were not as skillful as Sarah was but your current attention was on the flying clay bird with Garra inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get closer?\u201d asked Naruto to which you just growled as you concentrated on doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is trying, but a bird is naturally more agile in the air. If he speeds up and that guy moves just a little bit to the side we could be miles away and him moving in the opposite direction. That and if he just attacks him he will blow up that bird and kill Garra along with him. He needs to be careful.\u201d Sarah stated as you made another snap for the rider of the clay bird and only got a clay spider blown up in your face. You snarled at this but was otherwise unaffected. Finally after a lot of cat and mouse you missed again but managed to damage but no destroy the bird\u2019s wing. As it tumbled to the ground you followed and tried taking the man out while he hit but the man was able to dodge and disappear and despite your urge to chase him you stayed with the bird and Garra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGarra!\u201d Naruto said as he tried to get Garra to wake but you could now smell as he was out of the clay bird that he was dead although it looked like his body wasn\u2019t detraining as quickly as if his spirit was still holding on but not inside his body. It was a weird feeling but that didn\u2019t stop Naruto to suddenly start to get more powerful and actively look for the enemy. You watched as a type of cloak enveloped his body and after a little tussle Kakashi put something on him that instantly brought him back. After that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t doing so well as Kakashi had taken both of his arms as you flew after him with his knew Sharingan. They were facing him down but you growled and took a step forward toward the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has been interesting to say the least but I still have my masterpiece.\u201d Deidara said as he chewed some of his bird up and swallowed. You began to see before Neji that he was going to explode and what little time you all had to get out. Even you had to admit that for the level of chakra he was putting out this would be an impressive explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet behind me.\u201d You growled to which they were already looking at you from your previous growl so they did as you said. You snarled at the man as he was almost ready to blow but as he did so you readying your breath as well as a good amount of chakra to enhance your already insane attack. It was so intense that even before you let it go you were drooling actual drops of fire from your snarling form. As he exploded you let go the immense power you were holding back toward Diedara and his explosion. Your flames easily overtook his and pushed them back, although you had your claws dug into the ground to brace yourself from being driven back from the sheer force you were unleashing. Like a stationary and insanely powerful rocket. When you were done and breathing heavy from the exertion there was a three mile trench of incinerated space. You had to make it that powerful or the extra flames would have started a forest fire, but if there was nothing to burn than it eliminated the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Max did you have to wreck half the country side?\u201d Sarah teased as the others stood in utter shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny lighter\u2026 and\u2026 the\u2026 extra fire\u2026 would start a forest\u2026 fire.\u201d you explained between breaths as you walked a little so you weren\u2019t standing over anyone then laid down to relax and panting until you gained control of your fatigue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura can you\u2026?\u201d Naruto asked as they all then turned to Garra and his limp body. Naruto carried him to a field and there she examined him in every way she could to be sure. But you already knew, he was dead. You could smell it and you didn\u2019t hear a heartbeat, not to mention a couple dozen other tells that concluded the same thing. Finally she looked uup and gave him an answer with a shake of her head. He began to cry than turned to you. \u201cMax you can do something can\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he was still alive I could. Sadly I have no power to help after death sets in.\u201d you said solemnly and after a crying speech of how unfair it was and what not Granny Chiyo came forward and started a jutsu that you had never seen before. You didn\u2019t know what to make of it. However soon it seemed she didn\u2019t have enough Chakra to finish and even when Naruto placed his hands over hers she was still having some difficulty so you inched forward as your body was a little sore and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extended a single claw over to them and even though they were insanely scared, seeing what it did to Itachi or at least who he was possessing, but they stayed and continued. You rested the claw on their hands and over Garra\u2019s body and also transferred your chakra to help her out. It was clear to you that this was not a healing ninjutsu and from the look of her she wouldn\u2019t survive it. So you helped as much as you could and soon the glow that was formerly just around her and naruto\u2019s hands was now including Garra\u2019s entire body. Granny Chiyo then said a few words to Naruto and also Sakura then she looked over to you and for the first time without a scared thought in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up on us humans. I know we don\u2019t look like much and we have hurt you deeply. Yet you are so kind and gentle to us. If you remember anything I say remember this. Don\u2019t ever regret the good you have done and don\u2019t let others make you think that it is bad. You are strong and you will carry the burden of many as you already do. Don\u2019t let us humans destroy our bond with you. Without living we are just a worthless sack of meat like any other.\u201d she said to you and you nodded  then retracted your claw as she fell asleep and soon after breathed her last while Naruto was bringing Garra back. Shortly after his attempts the area was surrounded by sand ninja and while they were hesitant around you they came forward and surrounded Garra, so many of them that Sarah had to leap onto your head get out of their way. You almost made a circle around the whole group as you all waited for him to wake. Finally after a long wait his eyes were open and he was reacting to the people around him. He was so out of it he didn\u2019t even notice you until he turned around and almost fell over. You just held still, with your head on the ground, as Sarah waved from your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you do anything for her?\u201d Garra asked which got you to move again. You weren\u2019t expecting him to address you as he was probably still under the impression you were a danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t bring her back. But I can send her off with style.\u201d You said than stood up an looked up to the sky. You had been working on using your massively superior abilities to make visually appealing things like images and fireworks in the sky. So with a breath in you blew a constant stream of fire into the air than started to add other aspects to it as time progressed. You added ice and crystal to change light spectrum, and used snow and shadow to make the shade and tint until what looked like an angelic version of Granny Chiyo was seen but was so big that the sand village could probably see it. You had her smile like you had seen her do and with a final gust you made a fixed location so she was looked straight at the sand village as if both she was proud of it and at peace. It was like a huge memorial and as you finally finished and left her there you looked down and relaxed to catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, how, when did you learn to do that?\u201d Sarah asked and was a question shared by the others as they either looked at you or at the Chiyo in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been thinking that I should develop something that isn\u2019t purely for combat but so I can add something besides fear and death to this world. This is what I have come up with so far. It should stay for a month or so before the flames and other elements are carried away by the breeze and natural elements around.\u201d You explained but as hard as you worked to suppress the feeling that accompanied their usual vision of what you are, you let out a sigh and laid your head on the ground. Instead of Sarah saying anything she just laid on your head, between your eyes and gently pet you as she looked up at your creation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThank you for what you did, for Lady Chiyo.\u201d Garra said after you all were resting and in the village. You all were going to leave right away but you convinced them that if Kakashi was able to fly you could get them back within a few hours at top speed. So they were helping him rest up for the journey and you were in need of serious recharging before such a trip. You had used more energy in one day than you had in a long time. You were right to assume that the image you made for Chiyo could be seen from here and it could. It was like she was saying her goodbye to her beloved village. The paradox of what she was known for and what she did along with this was enough to make many cry when they looked at her face, starring back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t save her.\u201d you said as you looked away. You were more or less required to remain in dragon form, not that you minded but the concept of them still not accepting you hung on you a little. Although they did bring you food and water. But it fell to Sarah to bring it within eating range as most thought they would join the food they gave you. Of course they didn\u2019t say it but it was in their eyes and actions, not to mention you could hear almost all of them if you tried. \u201cBut it looks like you are doing good for yourself.\u201d You said in a more cheer tone of voice. It was good that Garra was usually not very outgoing as far as emotions were concerned or he would\u2019ve fled from the outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, I have people that I care for and people that care for me. Naruto has shown me this\u2026 and you too.\u201d He added and you looked at him as if you didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou told me that I should prove worthy of your friendship and trust. For the longest time I didn\u2019t know what you meant. Then something else hit me while you were imprisoned in you village. I know you could\u2019ve fought them and won but you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t want anything after you returned either. You said you had a high value on human life and now I know what you meant and how far you would go for it. If you, not even fully human had such a high value on it than why didn\u2019t I? That was the point where it set in for me.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, you\u2019re going to make him cry.\u201d Said a voice you both snapped to as Sarah came over to you. She gave you a pet on your snout before walking over and leaning against you as she looked over at Garra. \u201cHe may look all cool and sometimes scary but inside he is a big softy.\u201d She said as she gave your leg a pat as she leaned on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a know it all Hottie.\u201d You said back and a moment of comical relief came as you both stuck out your tongues at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Max. I asked you before if you were my friend and now I understand how infantile my understanding of such things was at the time. Would you consider me a friend now?\u201d he asked as he was now showing a rare form of emotional twinge. Perhaps it was because he could finally sleep but he seemed more rested to you. You looked at Sarah and she nodded for you to check him out. With that you moved your head closer and took in his scent. Despite his usual demeanor he was slightly unnerved by your jaws so close to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou smell much better now. I would be glad to call you \u2018friend\u2019.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I smell bad before?\u201d he asked as if there was a bathing requirement for being your friend. This made Sarah laugh and you just move back so she could answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax is a dragon and like most dragons they can tell by the very scent of someone wither they are friend, foe, ally, food, evil, or pretty much anything else in between, age and skill pending. You probably smelled really untrustworthy before and now I would guess you smell on the far side of the friend line or he would\u2019ve asked me my opinion before deciding.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. If you don\u2019t mind me asking. Who smells the best?\u201d he asked as if wondering who you were closest to and to target trustworthy people out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, no contest.\u201d You answered. \u201cShe has never really feared me and always has done what she thought of as right. Not to mention she is the closest thing to family that I have. Ever since we first met her scent just calms me down, even if I am in blood rage with another dragon or something. A simple whiff of her scent or the sound of her voice is all it takes to bring me back.\u201d You answered which made Sarah blush a little, ok a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop embarrassing me.\u201d She said as she whacked you and you gave her face a lick and you both laughed which was followed by a smile from Garra. This was turning out to be a good day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride back was hardly pleasant as Guy Sensei would continually barf from traveling in such a fashion. You were in the middle of soaking in the lake, taking a much needed bath for your dragon form, when Sarah came by looking for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, come on break\u2019s over.\u201d Sarah said as she addressed you through the layer of water and down to your massive form underneath. You rose from your soaking spot and lightly broke the water as she jumped to the shore to prevent getting wet. You shook a little to get the water off but not enough to get water on her. Directly after you were done Sarah landed on your head and you looked up to her. \u201cLady Tsunade wants us to see us, both of us. Something about a request or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but it better be good. That was the first bath I\u2019ve had in a month while in dragon form, I was rather enjoying myself.\u201d You answered back and she just teasingly traced her finger on the top of your head to check for dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve never had a problem smelling bad, even after eating a beer your breath smells rather nice.\u201d Sarah stated more as a compliment but knew well that it doubled as teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful little hottie, I haven\u2019t eaten all day and you smell good.\u201d You teased back. Most people were scorned heavily for even suggesting it but between you and her it was accepted. However even with you two getting close again, the teasing never got further than the entrance to your throat. You were still to scared to swallow anyone alive that you didn\u2019t want to digest. A few times Sarah tried sneaking her way into your stomach to get you over it but it never worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then I would need a shower. Fine you win Grumpy.\u201d She relented as she didn\u2019t want to appear in front of Lady Tsunade with your drool soaking her. You carefully walked through the village with most people getting out of your way. The ones that didn\u2019t you were able to avoid well enough as you made your way to a balcony that they had build on the side of Lady Tsunade\u2019s office. She did this so you didn\u2019t have to revert to human form every time she needed you for something. It was just under a normal sitting head height for you and was large enough to hold a few dozen people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, thank you for coming.\u201d Tsunade stated as she looked slightly up to you. The way it was set up they didn\u2019t need to strain their necks to look you in the face but, as your head was taller than they were, they did have to glance up to make eye contact depending on how close they were to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Tsunade, good to see you again. What did you need me for?\u201d you asked then your large red eyes snapped to a few entering the platform as well. They were each older than she was and all three were ones you weren\u2019t greatly fond of. The elders were always biased against you no matter what you did and Donzo seemed to be trying to extort you at every turn. You had to suppress a growl at their presence. \u201cSo it something like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much, Donzo would like to have a word. But that is as far as my participation goes with this. If they weren\u2019t part of the village I would suggest eating them.\u201d Tsunade answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsunade! It is clear that\u2026\u201d the old woman elder started. You had never even bothered learning their names but cut her off by rapidly approaching them and taking a good whiff of them, letting your teeth show a little to further dictate that you weren\u2019t too fond of them. After smelling you backed off and let out a little comical growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t do that, they smell horrible.\u201d You stated back to her and both Sarah and Tsunade slimed/silently giggled at it. The elders didn\u2019t attempt to say anything in rebutle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what they say about those that insult their elders? They call them ignorant fools.\u201d Donzo stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what they say about insulting a 500 foot tall dragon? They call them arrogant idiots.\u201d Sarah replied back as she moved and sat on the tip of your snout with her legs draping over the front, so she was closer to the others and could more easily observe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew you liked her scent more than any other so she knew that putting her bare legs in front of your nose was a sure way to please you and keep you calm, depending on what she was trying to do. As she rarely wore shoes to better connect with you in riding, she used Chakra as shoes in other instances, but in instances like this you could lick the bottom of her feet. The feeling was good for her, as it apparently felt like a warm, wet, and velvety massage. It obviously gave you a good taste of what was hanging just over your nose and enticing your senses in that fashion. And other than a few select people that were close to you and Sarah, almost everyone else reacted in a way that indicated that you were going off the deep end. Usually the feeling would make you feel lonely and sad. However you only did so when you were trying to get on someone\u2019s nerves and get a reaction from them that some of the others nearby could laugh at. This was no exception as they looked at your little lick of affection to her feet as a horrendous act and got the elders to shake noticeably and Donzo to sweat. Tsunade had to turn in a fake attempt to scold you, when what she was really doing was grinning from ear to ear at the both of you then turned and you acted like she had just snapped you back in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax, we have come to insist that you remain in the village and not go out on any more missions.\u201d Donzo stated. This was a constant debate between you and them. Basically you had a treaty of sorts when you came back and they put you to the level of Jounin. In the treaty you could contest any assignment anyone put you on and you had the freedom to leave if you wanted. You still had to act in a way the shown on the Leaf Village in a good way; Not attacking Allies, Watching your step, not burning down anything expensive, and other stuff like that. Otherwise you could walk or fly pretty much anywhere you wanted. People around had almost gotten use to you from a distance as they saw you soar above them or walk in the forest. Most didn\u2019t go anywhere near you but they did accept that you were around and you weren\u2019t hunting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this again. My answer is the same as before. I am not budging on our little treaty I have with the Leaf. I really don\u2019t care how many times you \u2018insist\u2019 that I follow your orders. You are not getting your way in this. I am never going back to what it was before, so stop asking.\u201d You answered. All three of them looked like someone just put a crab in their pants as they huffed and mumbled to each other as they left. You may have gotten a little too close and scared them out of the area but no one still there minded that in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you were here every time they came to see me.\u201d Tsunade sighed then turned to you and exchanged light smiles between the three of you. \u201cI actually was thinking about something that you two could do as a part of the Leaf Village rather than a tacked on force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, did you finally figure out what we could do\u2026 officially I mean?\u201d Sarah asked as she jumped down from your snout and you back up a little to give them some room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is a huge asset to have even you, Sarah as what we have all called the two of you, Dragon Ninja. Ever since you shared your eyes with her Max she has become a very coveted part of our village, even more so than the other visual eye based jutsu that we have had and still have in the village. You recall when Donzo required you to pass it along to him as well.\u201d Tsunade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, I do believe he left with a burning robe that time.\u201d You replied as they remembered the instance and, again, smiled at the memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have a similar request but one that gives you more control. I have been thinking for a while about what kind of team you should be a part of. While you were originally on Team Kakashi it was more of a last minute thing since you were the odd person out in the selection. I have felt that you should be afforded your own team under your sole command and part of the Leaf Village Military system.\u201d Lady Tsunade stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess sense we\u2019re both Jounin it makes sense. What did you have in mind?\u201d Sarah asked as she thought about what was being presented as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you both accept, I will legitimately form a separate training core under your guidance and leadership. The sole premise of this faction will be to train more Dragon Ninja. The selection will have to be finalized by you, but once they are, you will have complete control over them. You can take them out of the village or even eat them if you wish. Not that I think you would but that is the level of freedom you will be given in this. If I have a mission for your faction I will come to its leader and they will hand it out when an agreement is reached.\u201d Tsunade explained in a tone and way that stimulated the aura of trust, regret, and anticipation. She was giving you a huge responsibility and gift at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, in a sense, you want me to head up and start a Dragon Ninja Training Faction? Wait, you said \u2018its leader\u2019, as if you were expecting us to leave.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me yourself. That you may leave one day and that was why you didn\u2019t want to do anything big. If this\u2026 Faction, works as I am hoping then the ones you train will take over when you are done and gone for whatever reason.\u201d Tsunade quickly explained so that it didn\u2019t seem like she was trying to get rid of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so this will start something like the Uchiha clan and such. Basically a separate faction that will live on in the village.\u201d Sarah interpreted to which Tsunade nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd sense the Dragon\u2019s Eye is hereditary it will be passed down among that faction and, eventually, clan.\u201d You added and she nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that I am asking a lot. Effectively this would take you out of most activities and keep you in the village just like Donzo said. Even if you can leave whenever you want you will still have responsibilities here as the leader and starter of this\u2026 Well I guess if you approve\u2026 this clan.\u201d Tsunade revealed the darker side of the idea. If said the wrong way, it could look like she was trying exactly what Donzo did but in a different manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Max?\u201d Asked Sarah as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re the brains, you first.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think that it has two possible outcomes. You can start this Dragon Ninja Clan and be its founder. But that would cause obvious hostility for a while among the Village and from those that don\u2019t wish to be part of it at the start\u2026 and those that do. You will have to deal with people possibly stealing your gift like the other Clans in the Village and eventually they would be just like those Clans and possibly end up like the Uchiha Clan.\u201d Sarah revealed, paused, then went on to the next option. \u201cOr, you could train a small unit that is always with us. The Dragon\u2019s Eye will be limited to only them and you don\u2019t have to worry about the long term effects. But that will possibly cause resentment among the village and ostracize the those we train so that the diluted Dragon\u2019s Eye can\u2019t be passed down. So in a sense you have either Hostility or Restentment.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI don\u2019t really loath the idea of bringing the hostility that I have known on others. However a single force would be useless to the Leaf Village in that sense. So I think I will pick making a Clan, as strange as that sounds. Maybe that way if Kara ever comes here she can help with it, or if other dragons come they will not be as helpless as most would be.\u201d You answered after thinking on it for a very long moment. \u201cI assume you know what needs to be done in order to make this work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you will need a large sum of willing families that are all worthy and able to learn the new styles. Personally I would say they should all be from the same bloodline already. We have a few Family lines that have no real specialty and would jump at the chance to rival the Noble Clans of the leaf. Let me gather the heads of those families for you and explain so they know what is going on. Do you mind waiting at one of the practice fields so they can bring their families if they wish?\u201d Tsunaded answered and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, we\u2019ll head there now.\u201d You stated to which Sarah got the message and jumped onto your snout. \u201cYou know, there is a chance that I won\u2019t pick any of the families that you bring right?\u201d You asked, not wanting to seem like you were promising to pick one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that. Just as long as you understand that while most of each family MAY be acceptable, there is always a few bad apples in a bunch.\u201d She replied back to which you nodded then set off toward the training field you used the most. It was the same one you were just recently taking a bath in. On top of that it was right next to the Forest of Death, your official home and present from the Leaf when you came back. You still let them use it but you had the official run of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you that they would want it. Your eyes are just too awesome to ignore.\u201d Sarah said as she activated the jutsu that was used to unseal the eyes once given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the other optical powers in the Leaf with one main difference. When someone uses the jutsu to reveal and utilize the power it doesn\u2019t use up that much chakra at all. What uses up chakra is when the eyes and abilities the afford to excessive amounts. Like trying to look 4 miles away at a pin inside someone\u2019s pocket. Or using the enhancement that it gave to the style type that the person was good at, specifically fire or shadow. There was other things that Sarah and you were just learning and experimenting with. The strangest thing, that took a considerable amount of energy was dragon parts she seemed to be able to access. It must\u2019ve been part of the Dragon DNA that was now in her but, if she really pushed her limits, she could sprout wings or a tail that resembled yours. She was getting better at it and when both were out all her abilities almost improved by 10 times, but she was still only able to do it for a maximum of 15 minutes before she needed medical attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you cool with a whole Clan of people having the same ability I gave you. You know, I was originally only going to give it to you. It was supposed to be a special gift to you.\u201d You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know you love me Max, you don\u2019t have to prove it to me. This just means other people will adore you like I do. Think of it as my gift to you if it makes you feel better.\u201d Sarah replied back as she turned and hugged the top of your snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would nuzzle into the top of it in instances like this. You thought it was something to do with being a small part dragon now. She just loved being close to you and you had a feeling that was the main reason she wanted to be swallowed by you so bad at times. She completely bypassed any of the boys and men that pursued her and went straight for you, as if they were woefully inadequate. She didn\u2019t want a romantic relationship or anything. It was more like a human asking a dragon out. The dragons at home might do it only to trick them into their stomachs but otherwise the female dragon would rather go hang out with another dragon than anything close to that kind of relationship. Since Sarah was already designated as your family long ago she just adored you like a really, really, really close sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt definitely helps.\u201d You said as you made it to the field and was able to lay down in the sun, basking in it. Another thing that she gained with your DNA was the affinity for basking. She didn\u2019t get as much energy from it as you did, maybe 1/1000th of it, but the little bit made it significantly better than any normal human would find it. \u201cYou know you are going to have to teach them too right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, didn\u2019t think about that part. I suppose activating your eyes aren\u2019t the same as when I do it, or your other parts for that matter. Heck if it was that hard for you all this time, I can\u2019t imagine what transforming actually takes out of you.\u201d she returned as she traced small invisible shapes on the top of your snout as she talked. She didn\u2019t mind the slight movement as you talked but you talked with just moving he bottom most of the time. Heck, talking with her in your mouth was the harder of the two. Compared to that talking without moving the top of your head was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get use to it after a while, but yeah it stings a lot to transform all the way.\u201d You admitted and snaked your tongue up, wrapping it around her legs but she bat it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still have to meet all those people. I would prefer to do it without being drenched in dragon drool.\u201d She said to which you retracted your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine you win, grumpy.\u201d You returned, repeating the word she used on you earlier and she just giggled cutely and giving your snout a playful whack then pat. She was close in physical strength to Tsunade, do in no small part to your DNA once again. She was strong before but now she was getting ridiculous. What she didn\u2019t know what that you gave her more than she thought you did. You would only give maybe half of it to the Clan, if you found one that you could accept.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two of you were interrupted by an expected disturbance as hundreds of people crowded into the area, separated by family. Some were married into the family lines and had other traits but most of them you could tell were family. Sarah sat up and in a similar position as before, with her legs draping down over your snout and in front of your nose. She gazed over the large group from her vantage point. Most didn\u2019t get to close and were behind a lead family. It wasn\u2019t until the green coat of Lady Tsunade came forward with Kakashi hobbling along. He was well enough for now to oversee this and was hoping that he was at a point that you could heal him. You didn\u2019t even wait for him to ask as you shot a \u2018healing needle\u2019 at him. He knew what it was so he didn\u2019t dodge. Most others gasped at, what they thought, was a sudden aggressive action. Only after the green light faded and they saw him not limping anymore did they realize what you did. Tsunade just smiled and waved over for the heads to follow her to you. They did so reluctantly but also had an underlining anticipation in their step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for that Max.\u201d Kakashi said as he stretched and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Kakashi Sensei.\u201d You replied back with a slight bow that didn\u2019t seem to effect Sarah at all. However she did see how having a full conversation in her current position would be a problem so she got down and joined the group but on your side. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting you to bring all their families, very impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I thought you could get going before Donzo tries to put his foot in the way, again.\u201d Tsunade stated and you nodded then looked directly at the 2 men that stood near them. \u201cThese are the two heads for their families that decided to participate. They are both have their perks, but I\u2019ll let them explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, and you\u2019re right. I\u2019d hate to know what he\u2019d do if he could get his hands on the Dragon\u2019s Eye. Probably peek at every old dog in the village\u201d You said and comically shook your head to get the image out of your head that got Tsunade to cover her mouth to stop her laughter. Not a lot of people were willing or even thought about insulting him, even when he wasn\u2019t there. You then turned more directly to look directly at the other two she referred to. One was an old man but despite his age had blaze orange hair and his physic was impressive, two traits that looked to be common in the family he brought with him. The other was an equally old man with a more sleek figure and black hair, darker than Sarah\u2019s or any other you\u2019d seen in other families, almost shadow of black color. Both had an impressive amount of Chakra potential. However, for the moment, they were both quivering under your gaze. \u201cOk, no need to introduce names. If I choose one of you then it will change anyway. Just tell me what separates you and why I should consider you to be part dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, part dragon?\u201d Kakashi asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what I\u2019m offering. The reason why Dragon\u2019s Eye works is that I share my DNA with another person. This turns them into part Dragon and not just any, Dark Hunter Dragon DNA is more potent. Even if I am only changing a very small part of them to that it is what makes dragon attacks and sight available. It also is impossible to steal as the power doesn\u2019t reside in the eyes like other powers in the Ninja world. It resides in only the DNA, living DNA, and once separated from the person has no effect on anything. If you were to take some blood or any body part from them to test it would only read as a normal human. It is an exclusive power that can\u2019t be diluted but it does have a downside.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe down side being???\u201d Lady Tsunade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in a way Dragon DNA is very selfish. It doesn\u2019t allow any other powers to reside. So if someone had another abnormal power like a tailed beast, Sharingan, Byakugan, or any other Kekkei Genkai that hinders the growth or the rooting of it. It destroys or removes everything in its path, effectively wiping it away and leaving only Dragon\u2019s Eye. You simply CAN\u2019T have Dragon\u2019s Eye and another Optical or like trait.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there how can we use things like Gentle fist without Byakugan?\u201d asked the black haired one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon\u2019s Eye can easily see the Chakra networks of people if you look for them. Trust me when I say that Dragon\u2019s Eye is superior than all those other ones\u2026 well I guess I am bias and never had the other ones. But there are very few things that can effect a dragon like Max and all that comes with the Dragon\u2019s Eye. Genjutsu is useless against it, I can see a mouse at 5 miles away and hear it squeak if I concentrate. My strength, speed, and other physical abilities are multiplied by 10 when in the Dragon\u2019s Eye final Form and this is all just the beginning of what it can do. Yeah it is a chakra hog at first but the benefit is way worth it.\u201d Sarah stated for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell us the rest of it?\u201d asked Kakashi, now that his curiosity was peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest we don\u2019t know much more than that. Everything else is hard to explain. Kind of like seeing with your Sharingan, people just don\u2019t understand unless they have it. Since Sarah is the first I gave it to, she is still mastering it and finding all the neat tricks she can do. Unlike me, she needs to use Chakra to use the abilities that a Natural Dragon like me can just use with almost no penalty.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, being a dragon must be exhilarating.\u201d Tsunade stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Sure I am big and powerful and all my senses are fine tuned but that makes looking at things difficult.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tsunade asked, the others just taking in everything that was going on and the possible power increase they were going to have to convince you to give to them, as well with being under your rule afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with such high senses when I look at a sunset I don\u2019t see the beautiful scenery, I see the grass seeping in the warmth, the birds getting ready, the change in tones, the noticing of residual heat leaving inanimate objects, all the petty details that ruin such a moment. When I look at Sarah aesthetically I don\u2019t see what others see when then compliment her. I see everything about her, down to her cells, blood speed, and heart rate. The same goes for my other senses. So sometimes I just want a lack of detail to just enjoy things the way you humans can do all the time.\u201d You explained. \u201cIt is also why I like tasting things. As awkward as it seems, the detail in taste as a dragon is a soothing aspect, well as long as I don\u2019t have to taste something horrible. Otherwise I have a detailed description why the thing tasted so bad\u2026 way more information than I needed.\u201d You said in an attempt to joke, it was actually successful for once as they got use to the mass forms of unusual information.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, rather than asking a bunch of meaningless questions I think we can just take your word for it. Let\u2019s get this going before our good luck runs out.\u201d Tsunade suggested and they all agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Asked the fiery red haired old man to the other to which the Black haired man nodded a single nod. To this the man walked forward to begin. \u201cMax, I will skip most of the pleasantries and get right down to what you need to know. We are a family that specializes in fire jutsu and it effects us outwardly, to our very hair and bodies. From what you said, your DNA will slingshot our natural abilities to almost god like proportions. We are a strong people that like to face our enemies head on in battle.\u201d He said then bowed to you in a fashion you usually didn\u2019t get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think about becoming part dragon?\u201d asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be an honor to share the same traits as such a powerful being as yourself Max.\u201d he responded without looking up. His answer was truthful but a little too power hungry, almost arrogant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what of you?\u201d you asked to the other man to which the two old men changed spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn honor Max. My family has been in a long line of shadow style users. We prize ourselves for being able to get to our enemies before they even knew we were there. Like my distinguished friend here, our style bleeds into our appearance. We prefer skill over power. While we are no slouch in other aspects, including Fire as well, Shadow is our main form of skill. Mostly as Ninja we are chosen for assassination missions and a fair amount of us are in the Anbu division.\u201d The black haired old man stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think about becoming part dragon?\u201d Asked Sarah again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we are deemed worthy then it will be a welcomed gift that will never be misused.\u201d He stated. This answer was seeped in word play. Unlike the other, he wasn\u2019t as forward in what he said but he seemed also genuine if a little naive in thinking that the power would NEVER be misused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair to both sides, your attributes help but being able to do fire or shadow style jutsu have nothing to do with it.\u201d You stated and they looked confused. \u201cSarah is a lighting style user and\u2026 well you want to show off a little?\u201d you asked. She nodded then turned to the lake, breathed in then let out a massive flame from her mouth that dwarfed most Fire style jutsu most of them could do. She burped up a little smoke and giggled before turning back to their shocked faces. \u201cA dragon\u2019s flame is separate from their chakra flow. Sure chakra can be used to enhance the flame and direct it to enhance and understand fire style jutsu but it is separate, same goes for Shadow style. A Dark Hunter is naturally good at both sides so you will gain at least that. What I am looking for is underneath all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are you going to choose?\u201d asked Lady Tsunade as she seemed to think it was a hard choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, the one that is \u2018worthy\u2019 as you all put it will give off a certain scent. As a dragon I trust my instincts. Most of the time they don\u2019t make sense right away but they are the most accurate determining factor that I know of.\u201d You said then moved your head over and sniffed both of them in deep gusts that almost made them fall into your snout at times. They were shaking with having your deadly fangs and teeth so close to them, very similar to the others that had gotten use to it. Sarah even had a problem when she first saw them. It didn\u2019t bother you, at the moment. After a considerable amount of time going from one to the other you backed up to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell???\u201d Sarah asked as she was now just as anxious to hear you decision as the other were at this point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHmm\u2026 How interesting.\u201d You said as you looked at them from your laying position. \u201cTo be honest, from just your introductions and profiles I would prefer your side.\u201d you said as you looked over to the red haired man. \u201cYou\u2019re right, your flame mastery along with the power of a dragon would make you almost godlike in that respect. That idea makes me interested more than anything. However from both of your scents, my instincts are telling me that I should pick you.\u201d You stated as you looked at the black haired old man. \u201cI would be a very pathetic dragon if I didn\u2019t follow that suggestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that is your decision?\u201d asked the red haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am afraid so. I wish I didn\u2019t have to choose at all but your side smells strange. It is not something you can prepare either. Aesthetically you smell very impressive but there is something underneath all that, a distinctive hint of something that gets my blood to boil, and not in a good way. I don\u2019t really know what it is but I would be taking a risk with everyone\u2019s life, including yours, if I didn\u2019t listen to my own senses.\u201d You answered and his head went down. \u201cBut I feel really bad to just let you go without anything. Especially since you all came out here to meet me, that really means a lot to me. So I give you this.\u201d you stated then materialized a set of scrolls in front of him, along with the table the lay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecret fire style jutsu that I have created, including my fire clone jutsu. There is a high possibility that you and your family will not be able to do them. But if there is any human outside the Dragon Ninja that can do them it would be your family. Hopefully it will help, if not then I wish you the best.\u201d You stated with a noticeable bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you for your generosity and gifts.\u201d He said then took the scrolls and had his family follow him out of the area until only the black haired man and his family remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that went better than I thought.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding, I was expecting a few more \u2018but why\u2019 begging sessions.\u201d Sarah stated, on the same wave length as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does this work?\u201d asked Kakashi, bringing both of your attention back to the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the passing of the Dragon\u2019s Eye is rather simple, painful but simple.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPainful?\u201d asked the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am forcibly injecting a new DNA type into your bodies, of course it is going to be painful. But after about an hour the pain will be gone. The problem is afterward. If this is going to be some kind of Clan now, where are we all staying? I assume somewhere inside the village walls but where?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all have our own dwellings.\u201d The old man stated with some pride. But you looked at him and he relented. \u201cMost of them being in the old or ruined house districts. We haven\u2019t needed much more than that and haven\u2019t been able to finance anything more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil now.\u201d You stated and he looked up to you with both longing and questioning eyes. \u201cI am starting the Dragon Nina Clan from your family. You don\u2019t really think that I would just sit by while you all starved and lived in poverty did you? The only question is where? Lady Tsunade, you don\u2019t happen to have any space that I could take over do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is large area that needs to be demolished and redone. No one lives there anymore and has been cleared, but we haven\u2019t been able to find the time or money to destroy a part of the village and rebuild it. You could use that area, ironically the area you first had for your dwelling, you know it?\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, so I can do with it as I wish? Well in terms of demolition and reconstruction.\u201d You asked to be clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I will be eager to see your addition.\u201d She said, eager and happy to have the spot be redone with no cost to her or the village. The starting of a new Clan usually took a lot of backing and financing. However if you were able to bypass all of that legally it would only improve things. Plus, who would attack the manor or a dragon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, you\u2019ll all get new homes and not downgrades either.\u201d You stated and a round of hushed cheers came from the group. It was a more private conversation but it was hard to cover up your words from them, do in no small part to your size. \u201cI can start as soon as your family is ready. I\u2019ll need some time to recharge after that but it should be around the same amount of time for each of you to adjust as well. I recommend that you make sure everyone is sitting or laying down and securing infants. The sudden pain could cause them to be dropped and what not.\u201d You explained and he nodded then went off to do likewise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we need to leave?\u201d Asked Kakashi as he wasn\u2019t sure how the process worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually it would be better if you stayed. I will not be in the position to help when I do this. So if there is a problem, like a mother falling on a child or something it would be helpful if someone was there. They will all be in a considerable amount of pain for about 15 minutes and the cool off for about an hour. Nothing fatal but still very painful. The process will only turn those I designate so you have no worries of collateral damage or effects.\u201d You answered to which he nodded then went off to the far end, Sarah did likewise as she stood at a far end opposite of Kakashi while Tsunade stayed on this end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are ready Master Max.\u201d stated the old man with a bow as the people were all sitting or laying down in secure fashions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, just Max.\u201d you replied to which he nodded and you likewise but nodding him to join them as you got up and walked over to them until you were standing over the large group but far enough away that you could plop down when finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed then, after taking in a noticeably large breath you made contact with all the family members. You found a few Donzo spies that thought they could fool you and excluded them. With all the correct people targeted you let out a roar that also spewed a thick black fog into the crowd. They instinctually held their breath but it wouldn\u2019t help. The fog seeped into every entry into the body including sweat pores but only in the ones you designated. I also appeared alive as it found and seeped into each of them. The screams and cries started as the fog cleared out and into them without a trace. As expected you collapsed. It was a lot of work to disperse your own DNA to over 50 people, not to mention in a fashion that was safe and changing them to part dragon. It would\u2019ve been easier if you didn\u2019t have to exclude people and just shoot but that wasn\u2019t the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lay there at a sideways angle so you could see what was going on. You were limp but still your eyes worked, bringing in images for you to watch and audio. You could see that your suggestion for Kakashi, Sarah, and Tsunade was correct as they had to come to the aid of many among them. You had just changed the Leaf Village and their lives drastically and you hoped it would be for the best.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It turned out that it was a good thing that you almost scared them to death with the roar. It opened their bodies\u2019 senses up and allowed a flawless entry and conversion of their cells to the change. Within an hour they were all up and moving, making sure each other were ok then coming over their Hokage, Kakashi, and Sarah as they were over by your head. Sarah was concerned about you when she first came over, almost ordering Lady Tsunade to help you as you couldn\u2019t move. You didn\u2019t need it but she did so anyway. In a short amount of time you were talking but still needed more recharging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still can\u2019t move?\u201d asked the old man as they approached, slightly off that they had to feel such pain but, if it did what it was suppose to, it would be more than worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know the pain you all felt?\u201d you asked with your head unable to lift so you were just talking with your lips and limited movement. He nodded as did the rest of them. \u201cWell not only did I have to ready all that change and implement it but, sense they were my cells and DNA, I felt all that pain as you all did and on top of each other. It will be a little longer until I can move at all. It took more out of me than I thought it would, maybe a few hours. Perhaps in that time Sarah can start telling you the basics.\u201d You revealed then shut your eyes and gently fell asleep to the sound of Sarah explaining things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you had come to accept and fear, your dreams weren\u2019t pleasant as you relived your worst memories over and over again. Most of the time it left you restless and Sarah had to watch it when she slept in a dangerous area like your mouth or around your claws and tail. It was not uncommon for you to wake up to very large trenches in the ground because of it. However with all these people around you were glad that you didn\u2019t have the strength to do so. You woke with Tsunade gone but Sarah still explaining the jutsu while Kakashi stood by you. With your eyes so big and noticeable it was hard not to figure out you were awake when you came to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re awake, how do you feel? From the sound and look of it you didn\u2019t sleep that well.\u201d Kakashi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually it was more sleep than I usually get. I\u2019ve never slept well like most people or even other dragons.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that another dragon thing?\u201d Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that is just the way it is with me. It might be a byproduct of the genetic memory. Either way, when I dream I relive every mistake and grief filled event in my life, over and over again. When Sarah is near it tends to blur the image a little with her scent but otherwise it can get rather depressing.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot easy being you is it.\u201d Kakashi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrass is always greener I suppose. People wish they want to be like me and I wish I can be more like them.\u201d you returned as Sarah and the old man came forward. \u201cI never got your first name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPha, my name is Pha\u2026 is there a short version of Dragon Ninja we can use for our new last name?\u201d he asked half way between his introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for brain power then you\u2019re looking at the wrong person.\u201d You said then you all looked over at Sarah. You were starting to straighten and stretch but was still listening as she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara\u2026 I think that will be a perfect name. The only other dragon we both like.\u201d Sarah stated and you smiled perhaps too much then nodded your agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, we are the Kara Clan.\u201d The man said to which there was a cheer amongst the crowd. You noticed some of the younger ones that had figured out the Dragon\u2019s Eye were leaving it on while chasing each other. You stood all the way up and gave yourself a very large stretch and yawn with your wings out as far as they went. This got most of their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that I\u2019m all rested up and it is near the end of the day I guess I should start on our new house. It might take about a day so why don\u2019t you all meet me there tomorrow, with your immediate needs to live then you can move the rest at your leisure.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, we will arrive tomorrow then.\u201d Pha agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on big boy, we got a lot of work to do.\u201d Sarah said as she leapt on your snout and gave you a pat. The move was slightly comical as you did as she said, heading to the place to begin the process or building your new home\u2026 and theirs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life was pretty much hell for you after that point. What had originally started as insurance turned to be and outlet as the paper bombs sometimes went off with no apparent reason. Most of the time they went off when you didn\u2019t do something right, made any move that was preserved as threatening, or even talked in general. Their rational, after they voided your ninja and residence status which made you no more than their property, was that they didn\u2019t want you spreading your \u201clies\u201d and turning people to your side. They knew of your ability to absorb the sun so you weren\u2019t given any food either. Technically speaking you didn\u2019t need it but your body was at that point always hungry and weak, which might have been the intended purpose. There were some people that were more civil, mainly just Naruto, but even he set off a few paper bombs for varying reasons. You slowly collected intel on a portal jutsu as you moved around as a pack animal and sometimes carried jutsu scrolls to which you read them through the bindings without them noticing. Finally you found one but there was a problem with it. It was a portal jutsu but it sent you to a random realm instead of back. However the odds of you finding anything better before you died of starvation or neglect was slim. You held on to one last hope for this realm as you created pathways to safely destroy the remaining paper bombs in your system. The hope was Sarah, if she was ok and believed in you that was good enough to keep you here. Finally they let her out of wherever they had been keeping her but your reunion was not as you hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe gone you oversized rat!\u201d Sarah stated as you waited for the delivery of medical supplies that you were suppose to carry. You were stuck frozen for two reasons; first you had never expected her to say something like that, second if you moved from this spot a paper bomb would go off. When you didn\u2019t move she made a hand sign that you knew all too well to which a paper bomb exploded and took out a section of your left wing. You winced in pain but had learned that was all you were allowed to do in response as any cry or yelp would be considered a hostile act. \u201cFilthy beast, do as I say!\u201d she recited as if she was one of them and didn\u2019t know you at all. She then caused another to explode near you neck not even before the other one was healed. You didn\u2019t even wince at this one from the shock you were in. Your one hope for this realm was being shattered. It took the Anko, who was the one loading you up, to stop her as the blood would wreck the medical supplies you had to carry. None of them even had the slightest amount of concern for you and after letting a tear escape they simply laughed that the bloodthirsty animal was feeling sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw for you. You waited a few more weeks just to be sure Sarah was serious and in the end even read her mind but she was. They had completely overwrote her mind with new data that you had neither the time nor the energy to fix. After another day of slave labor and paper bombs going off you decided to leave through the portal. You didn\u2019t know where it would take you but it was better than here. With that decided you snuck to the practice field after destroying the remaining paper bombs then set up a barrier that served so people could see but not hinder what you were doing. The Barrier itself was noticeable as was the beginning of the portal jutsu you were starting. You of course had to go to human size to make the hand signs but you started, while blocking out the voices of those around you as white noise. Even moving your hands with a dizzying speed it was taking you a few hours to complete despite most of the influential people you knew and had contact with now shouting for you to pay attention. They had long sense realized that the paper bombs they place weren\u2019t working and had gone to a combination of guilt trips and name calling. Finally it was done and you wavered with fatigue at the amount of effort and concentration it took to create it. Maybe in time you would be able to direct it but you had only one chance to do it this time and with it completed you had time while you recovered to address the shouting mob of ninja around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Tsunade asked, not really expecting you to answer but thought it might be some kind of massive bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a portal to another realm.\u201d You said between breaths as they slowed. \u201cHaving me carry those scrolls was a mistake if you didn\u2019t want me to read them. Paper is not much of a deterrent to get through so I read every document and scroll I could. I finally found this one in a variation of places. Apparently it is hidden because it is one of the most forbidden jutsus there is but the original purpose was to send away rampaging summoning beasts. However it backfired one time and swallowed half the village because of one faulty hand sign. As you can see I have performed it correctly and it waits for me to step through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of your lies. You will come with us now or else.\u201d Tsunade stated as she prepared to detonate the paper bomb by your heart. You had already destroyed it but she might have thought that it being on a separate circuit than the rest it might have still survived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you deaf? I am leaving this hell I have come to. You are all my own personal demons and I will escape one way or another. If this fails than feel free to kill me. Anything is better than the life I have here.\u201d You said weakly as you started toward the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! What about your friends and your comrades? Are you willing to just leave all that behind?\u201d came the unmistakable voice of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat friends? What Comrades? You all made it abundantly clear that I am no more than property to you. Property to be used and abused at your convenience and discarded with the trash. All any of you care about is losing a tool or resource. You even destroyed the one hope I had left of this place. With her gone I don\u2019t have any reason to stay. If I really am that much of a threat than the best thing to do is to leave and never come back.\u201d You stated to him and he looked in horror at the accusation, wither the look was by realization or loss you didn\u2019t know but either way it wasn\u2019t going to dissuade you. You tripped and fell as you moved forward again, slowly getting up and moving toward your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane, you could die if you go through there.\u201d Said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you give a dam.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you really given up on us just like that?\u201d Kakashi asked. He was always the more sensible one that you didn\u2019t actually mind helping even like this. However he had done his fair share of discipline and corrective action. But as long as you did what he said he was rather pleasant to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot on anyone in specific. But yes I have given up. I am tired of being told my existence is a curse. I am tired of feeling pain from those I used to trust and seeing their joyful face at the site of it. I am tired of being starved and neglected. I\u2019m tired of life in general. What kind of people does that to anyone? Even enemies and prisoners of war have better treatment than that. I held out hope that one person was the same, that I could talk to freely and feel\u2026 content around. But you even took that away. Tell me what there is when hope, dreams, and life is absent. I don\u2019t expect any of you to believe a word I have said. But I do have one question for you. It might be white noise but I think it is a good question that should\u2019ve been asked a long time ago.\u201d You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tsunade asked in an irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis whole thing was based on me eating Kiba, Akamaru, Neji, and Choji. It was said that I implanted the memories into everyone to make it acceptable and believable. My question is: Where is Sasuke?\u201d you asked and most changed faces at the mention of him but didn\u2019t get it yet. \u201cSasuke left for Orochimaru at the aid of his best subordinates and only Sasuke made it there alive. Orochimaru doesn\u2019t allow weaklings to work at such high stations around him. So if they had any skill at all it would make sense there would have been a fight and Genin level ninja would be lucky to not be injured at all. So if I implanted this whole thing than there is only two explanations that make any sense. Either I ate Sasuke as well and you never found him, effectively tricking the village. Or the whole thing happened as I said it did and I really was just trying to save them. Either way I am sure by the look on your faces that you think I probably did the first option. But there is one way to be sure. If you ever get proof that Sasuke is alive and relatively well than it will prove me innocent and you wrong. But I have lost all trust and hope that you would change after that point. I\u2019ll leave you with that thought and disappear forever. I hope I don\u2019t see you again.\u201d You said as you walked into the portal and it closed around you. You might have stayed if you felt them changing but they were currently more inclined to believe you as a monster than anything else. But as you were incredibly weak after the whole thing you were left dreaming about that along with your usual nightmares as the portal took you to your next destination. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you came to you could smell salt and wood. Your heard creaking and splashing and the final clue was that you were being rocked on whatever flat surface you were on. Without even opening your eyes you realized you were on a boat and immediately scanned with your senses for humans. They were all around as they manned the boat but the boat, or ship now that you had a better feel for its size wasn\u2019t moving. It was just rocking in a stationary area. So you induced by the noise you could hear from beyond the wood hull that they were docked. After a careful analysis you opened your eyes and to that the doctor who was looking after you approached. Still suffering from the effects of so many people abusing you, you bolted up as you saw him and got on the other side of the bed. There wasn\u2019t much to shield yourself and the door was behind him so your choices were somewhat limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on there, you shouldn\u2019t be moving yet.\u201d He said as the perceptive man noticed he was scaring you so he backed up and sat in the chair he was previously sitting in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to hurt you. See, sitting down and not moving toward you.\u201d he said as he gestured with his hands but you also flinched at that as you were expecting a paper bomb to go off. \u201cYou must have gone through a lot. Looks like you have more battle scars than a war veteran but severely malnourished. We found you floating in the sea and almost drowning. How about we start out simple with a name? Mine is Doctor Mitchel.\u201d he asked, hoping that giving a little background would help break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax... You\u2019re not going to try and kill me are you?\u201d You asked as you tried to gauge his intensions. It was a good question for you as hunger had left you without enough energy to even change a small amount of your body to a dragon. Not eating for months definitely has its drawbacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I kill you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you if you were going to TRY.\u201d You clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would make a joke about such a claim but from the scares you have I think you might be able to do so, even in your weaken state. To answer your question, no I\u2019m not going to try to kill you. Although if you don\u2019t eat something it is likely that I won\u2019t have to. Why don\u2019t you wait for a bit and I\u2019ll get you some food. But if you leave while I\u2019m gone you won\u2019t have any.\u201d He said as he saw you eyeing the door as he opened it. Reluctantly you stayed where you were and within a few minutes you could smell a healthy meat centered tray of food. The door open again and the steaming tray was place on a table by the bed you were hiding behind. \u201cI\u2019m not going to feed you like that. You have to sit up proper.\u201d He reasoned and with noticeable hesitation you got in the bed and put your back against the headboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sense of achieving something the doctor came and handed you the tray, noticing that you were preparing to bolt at every move he made but was restraining yourself. You took the tray and you were going to just dig in but you thought that you had waited months for food. The least you could do is not make the person that gave it to you disgusted by you conduct. So you politely but quickly feasted on the meal. It was not nearly enough to satisfy your dragon side but it filled you shrunken belly just fine. Then something happened that made the doctor gasp and run. Your body started healing itself. It wasn\u2019t badly injured but the previously malnourished body was beefing up unnaturally fast and within seconds you were back to normal. As you placed the tray off to the side you looked at your scared body. There wasn\u2019t that many but you had been impacted by so many paper bombs that the transformation couldn\u2019t hid all the effects. Mostly on your chest and back but there were some small ones on your legs and arms but not very noticeable. You did retain the scare that they used to open you up in the first place as it ran jaggedly down your torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to stay but you heard multiple footsteps and cries from the doctor at the \u201cfreak\u201d in his office. That was all you needed to wipe his mind of what you looked like, left a thank you note, and broke through the wall. You jumped out of the ship and used an illusion jutsu to disappear into the city that laid before you. It was a good thing you were an excellent swimmer because you had to stay under the water for close to a day before things called down. Your Dragon lungs were at their limit when you finally surfaced. You noticed the ship leaving, and with it all the people that might be able to identify you. With that done you headed into the city or village to find out what you could. It all looked so weird but that was a good thing. The more different it was to the Leaf Village the better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your freedom didn\u2019t last long as some son of the Marine Captain that ran the town started making trouble\u2026 again. He was usually idiotic and used his father\u2019s name to get whatever he wanted. You had been in the town for a few weeks and while avoiding him you learned a lot, along with getting to your old self again. You learned about loud noisy things called guns and cannons. The guns were fast, not as fast as you but still way faster than arrows, however they did little more than tickle as the round or at times pointed nature just caused them to bound or slide off. The cannons were a problem as they had more weight to them but they were actually slower than the bullets so if you could hold onto something you could take a full on canon shot with little to no damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read and observed as much as you could so you were well versed with what was happening. However one day that idiot came around and while you were playing with some kids, so their parents could work, he started pushing his weight around. The parents happen to be in the area and you bridged the gap between them as you took most of the beatings that he was going to give to them. However when he rose his hand at one of the kids you caught the sword with your bare hands and snapped it like a tooth pick. This scared him so much that he didn\u2019t do anything but run with his Marine escort. However your antics, cheered as they were, landed you in a cell. It wasn\u2019t all bad as you got daily meals and the small window allowed sunlight in every morning. Unlike your previous discipline this was fairly pleasant until one day you heard noise as fighting broke out. When it was all done you were let go as the former Captain was arrested therefore the charges against you were dropped. You were in the middle of basking on the dock when a strange kid and a man with swords came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked the kid in the straw hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust soaking in the sun, you?\u201d You asked as you looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just leaving. Hey they said you were a strong guy.\u201d He said in a more of a question format.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 well kind of. I got in trouble for breaking that fruity idiot\u2019s sword when he was swing it at a little kid.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about that?\u201d the man with green hair and the swords asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe stopped the blade mid swing with the palm of his hand then used only the grip of two fingers to do it.\u201d Said a Marine that you recognized as one of them that had observed it. That fact got you to sigh and the others to look at you as if to ask if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have been itching for me to get out of here ever since. The kids love me but the parents and Marines think I\u2019m dangerous.\u201d You explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with us?\u201d asked the boy with the straw hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you asked as if deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonkey D. Luffy but you can just call me Luffy. This is the first member of my pirate crew Zoro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Max and are you offering me a ride or asking me to join your crew?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for now you can ride. You have to be strong to join my crew.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d You said as you got up and stood a few inches taller than Zoro. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can do on the way. I assume you want to get out of here.\u201d You stated to which you all got on the small boat and let the sail take wind. You were pretty far out to sea before Luffy remembered to ask you about it. Zoro seemed content with his nap but had a little hesitation about the little sword incident they said you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I\u2019m going to be King of the Pirates I\u2019m going to need an extra strong crew.\u201d Luffy finished after talking about it. Zoro laughed at his apparent childlike behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess the thing I will use most often is that I am\u2026 or was previously a fully trained ninja. I have a load of varied jutsu that would be of use to you.\u201d you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJutsu?\u201d Luffy recited Zoro caught the ninja part but didn\u2019t quite understand the jutsu word either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are things that make a ninja\u2019s job easier; making clones to right for you, shooting fire, cloaking, fighting with a large assortment of weapons, and a lot more. Pretty much for every situation there is a jutsu for it.\u201d You explained in words that Luffy could understand. You and Zoro learned within minutes that large words only confused Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are good with a sword?\u201d Zoro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t my favorite but a ninja needs to be informed of different fighting styles so he or she can better prepare and counter effectively. The more I know the better I am so I do know a great deal. Although I prefer hand to hand combat.\u201d You explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you show us something cool?\u201d Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess show and tell is part of it. Ok first is chakra control. I can use it to walk on certain things unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before.\u201d You state and before he could ask what you meant you started walking straight up the mast then stood on it sideways above them. Then you leaped off and landed on top of the water. \u201cNow every Jutsu uses energy like throwing a punch. The harder the justu the more energy I have to use and the faster I get tired.\u201d You said as you walked back and sat in the boat with them, although Luffy was on his feet with excitement at this point. However despite your impressive display Zoro seemed to know you were hiding something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more isn\u2019t there?\u201d he asked to which Luffy was laughing with excitement at any tricks you would be able to do. He was like a little kid which you thought might make it easier, if you decided to tell them. You had tried both routes of this and you had learned discretion is good but if you were going to get to know anyone they had to know you as well, all of you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But with Zoro\u2019s curiosity spiked and Luffy\u2019s excitement you weren\u2019t going to get out of this one, unless you were willing to fly away but that would just as much tell them than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, first though understand that pretty much everyone I have told this to has all feared me for it. So no matter what you hear of see I will not harm you.\u201d You stated and they both nodded in different fashions. \u201cI guess the easiest way to say this is that I am not from this world. I came here after traveling to another world where I learned most of the jutsu I was telling you about. My home realm or world kicked me out because I am\u2026 a half breed. I am half human and half\u2026\u201d you stopped as you got a flash back of a paper bomb going off as you tried to explain this in the Leaf village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf what, half what?\u201d Asked Luffy asked excited to see what else you could do. Zoro seemed a little concerned as he started to pick up bits and pieces of what you were saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am half human and half\u2026 dragon. I don\u2019t lose any power by going between the two and I can transform partway, although changing all the way is extremely painful.\u201d You said and their jaws dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood one\u2026\u201d Zoro said as he tried to play it off as a joke or bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d You said as you let your eyes glow and sprouted wings and a tail out of your back. This made him almost push off into the water and Luffy\u2019s eyes almost bugged out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is sooo Cool\u2026\u201d Luffy said as Zoro placed a hand on the sheath of his sword as he seemed to be highly on guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I said? I will not harm you. But if you want to see me as a full dragon now is the time. I doubt it will be too good of an idea to show everyone but this little trick can be passed off as a devil fruit power. However the fact that I can swim would negate it. Do you want to see it or should I wait?\u201d you asked as your tail flexed and your wings stretched from being dormant for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can get cooler?\u201d Luffy asked like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but it hurts a lot to do it. Usually I use one of those jutsu to do it fast but it still hurts.\u201d You said which made him calm down a little. As excited as he was he didn\u2019t want you to get hurt because of his curiosity. \u201cBut as my captain you can ask me and I will transform for you. Just not too many times, stuff like wings and a tail are easy and don\u2019t hurt but going all the way does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are ok with it.\u201d He answered in a rare tone for him since he was pretty much going nonstop since you set out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well Luffy, Zoro you might want to sit down.\u201d You said in a tone that indicated it would be a shock. He did so but still left a hand on his sword. You flipped out of the boat and onto the water\u2019s surface. You walked a little way than did a few hand signs. With a fiery explosion your massive dragon body was now standing on the water. You waved your wings as they stretched as did the rest of your body. You walked around the boat as if stalking it than brought your head, which was close to the boat\u2019s size or bigger, to them. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d you asked the stunned pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, you\u2019re as big as a sea king.\u201d Said Zoro, to dazed to pull the sword out that he had put his hand on. By the time he had his thoughts together he realized his swords wouldn\u2019t do that much against you like this so he left them as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you are soo cool. You\u2019re a dragon and you want to be on my crew. I\u2019m going to have the best crew ever!\u201d he said as he jumped around but in the midst of his excitement jumped off the boat but you easily caught him with your teeth on the back of his shirt. You deposited him back on the boat to which Zoro almost crapped his pants as your head and jaws were mere feet from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see this size is too big to do anything useful in towns or stuff like that so\u2026\u201d you said than with another explosion of fire you reverted to human again. You flapped your wings as you came down to the boat and landed softly on it. Your dragon parts retracted so they could ask questions in a more secure and normal fashion. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You explained many things about yourselves as you traveled You all had a lot of time so You got to hear how and why Luffy became a pirate as well as  Zoro\u2019s motivation to become the world\u2019s greatest swordsman. After you told you whole story in terms Luffy could understand they seemed to be more accepting of you. Zoro admitted that having someone that could take down sea kings as a crewmate would be useful, not to mention you could spare with him so he could get better. However a little while into your journey you all ran into the same problem of food. You could eat fish if you wanted but cooking them for the others was useless as you had admittedly little knowledge on how. Most of the times you tried you reduced the potential meal to ash with even the smallest flame. So when a bird appear above Luffy tried to get it and got stuck, being carried off. You had all agreed that you were not to go dragon unless Luffy said so and he wasn\u2019t so you and Zoro were rowing to catch him. Eventually a few people that had been drifting out at sea climbed on in your boat and made you both stop to accommodate their threats. The was good and bad to the situation; the bad was that Luffy was now very far away. The good was that you and Zoro didn\u2019t have to row anymore because of the very willing pirates that just tried to kill you. Soon you were at a village just as a huge explosion took out part of the town. You parted ways with your pirate rowers then you and Zoro found Luffy. You got there in time to see a girl putting out a fuse of a cannon pointed at Luffy in a cage. Zoro sped forward to defend the girl as she was about to be attacked while you leaned against the cage. After Zoro was introduced the clown captain named Buggy looked over at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201dhe said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, get me out of here.\u201d Luffy said which answered the clown\u2019s question along with addressing the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you had grabbed a knife or something when you got captured you could\u2019ve got yourself out.\u201d You said back to him. He laughed at the thought as you put a foot on the bottom of the cage and flicked the top open as if it was a box of made of paper. The bars snapped and the lip flew off and with a well placed claw the ropes that tied him were cut as well. Then Luffy started to inhale in preparation so you, Zorro, and the girl named Nami looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBIG NOSE!!!\u201d Luffy yelled. At this two others came to join him; a man with a giant lion looking animal and some weird unicycle rider with swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look, one for each of us. They are so generous aren\u2019t they.\u201d You said in a mock sense of excitement. However Luffy was genuinely excited. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say Luffy has the guy with the clown fetish, do you want the sword on wheels and I\u2019ll take the little kitten?\u201d you asked Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sounds fair.\u201d Zoro answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill them!\u201d Buggy said as he pointed at the thee of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Luffy, you want to see another jutsu?\u201d you asked and his eyes bugged out with excitement. With that you took center stage and with a quick set of hand signs you summoned a large fireball and sent it toward the group of charging pirates. They instantly turned to run but it was too late at that point. The only ones that were left after was the lion pair, the unicycle guy, and Buggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d Luffy said with excitement and you just nervously scratched your head at the compliment as Zoro laughed and Nami\u2019s jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey fur ball. It looks like you and I are up.\u201d You said which got the pair\u2019s attention and with approval and orders to kill you from buggy they charged. IT didn\u2019t take long as the lion was rather weak for its size. He swung once and you sent a punch to his head. You honestly expected him to dodge it but he didn\u2019t, which sent the lion off the roof with his master. \u201cOops, if I knew he was so weak I wouldn\u2019t have hit him so hard.\u201d You said in an almost apologetic tone. Your expression quickly changed when you heard Luffy laughing his face off. You didn\u2019t know what it was about this guy but he just had an aura around him that made you feel fun, happy, and most of all accepted. You walked back to your spot beside them and Zoro stepped up to take on his opponent. The cycling swordsman was fun to watch but pathetic when it came to skill, especially compared to Zoro. Finally Buggy faced Luffy and was fighting with him while you and Zoro watched. Nami had left and you smelled her scent on the pirates ship than moving slower and dragging a sack of something that sounded like gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa now I got you.\u201d Buggy said as he rolled behind you and threatened your throat with a knife to which both Zoro and Luffy just laughed. \u201cWhat the hell is so funny?!\u201d Buggy yelled. He then responded to a poke on his shoulder and looked as your tail was flattened and was inches away from his face. With the other hand he tried cutting it but you just sliced the knives in half then he backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your opponent.\u201d Luffy demanded to which Buggy gratefully put some distance between you and continued to fight. At some point Nami came into the battle and gained some respect for Luffy, by the end Buggy was an unfortunate winner of Luffy\u2019s \u201cGum Gum Bazooka\u201d You were all victorious but because Luffy had knocked out the mayor so that he wouldn\u2019t interfere and get himself killed the town chased your four out of town rather quickly and off you sailed on your little boat with another belonging to Nami next to it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nami\u2019s reaction to you was what was expected. Even after Zoro warned her on procedures that would make the news easier to see/hear she still fell overboard as when she saw you dragon form. She than remembered your tail in the fight with Buggy. Both Luffy and Zoro were both laughing at her for her reaction and after retelling your story on the way to an island she, like Zoro, accepted you. However for those two it felt an awful lot like the Leaf Village level of trust all over again. The only one you really were surprised of was Luffy. He truly didn\u2019t have a single ounce of fear or judgment in him towards you. He would even protect you, for the most part emotionally, from things that popped up. After landing you all met Usopp and eventually the children that were his \u201ccrew\u201d. Luffy, being always honest, introduced you all and as each of them had a title of sorts he said straight out that you were a dragon. At first you had thought it was a bad idea but such a statement is rarely considered true. As time progressed in the village you all met Kaya and her butler who you now knew as Captain Kuro. After a lot of hit and miss with the situation, as everything that Usopp said was considered a lie and Kuro had more respect in the village than any of you. So you ended up facing down the group of pirates with the rest of them, when they finally got there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Luffy, you want help with these guys?\u201d you asked as you, Zoro, and Luffy looked down the slope toward the pirate crew that was trying to get to the village to kill the girl Usopp was trying to protect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I got it.\u201d He said with a fist pumping action as he stretched his joints a little. You nodded and leapt onto the cliff overseeing the area. Draping your feet over it you just watched as the fight started. You laughed when Luffy was hypnotized to be stronger with the rest of the crew. You also offered your help to Zoro but he refused as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to sit here?\u201d Usopp asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. My captain gave me an order so until he recedes it I\u2019m just going to chill here for a while.\u201d You said as you watched Zoro go at it. \u201cBesides they are the two we don\u2019t have to worry about. They would be more hurt if I helped them than if they barely survived. Their honor and pride would take a large hit that they wouldn\u2019t recover from. They would be alive but they would no longer live like we know them.\u201d you answered and both he and Nomi excepted that you were just going to watch so they tried helping in their own ways. When Captain Kuro finally arrived and Nami intervened to wake Luffy and give Zoro back his swords Kuro gave the crew 5 minutes to kill all of you. Obviously that was impossible but you watched anyway. That was until the kids came into play and after being knocked back they were huddled around Kaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d Luffy finally called to which you leapt off the cliff and landed beside him to take his orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally have something for me to do?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep Kaya and the kids safe with any others that join them while I fight this guy.\u201d He instructed to which you nodded and started walking to your destination. You walked right by Kuro without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Kuro asked in a challenging tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be deaf as much as you are weak. I am doing what my captain tells me to do. The only reason I haven\u2019t kicked your ass is because he wants to. Go play with your toys little man.\u201d You said then kept walking. Kuro was so angry that he turned and fully intended to attack you but Luffy was there and they started fighting. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there is no way Luffy will lose to a guy like that. You are safe.\u201d You said with a smile to the cowering group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d Nami said but not even halfway into her warning you thrust you elbow back and implanted it into the Hypnotist\u2019s face, effectively knocking him out, as well as breaking all his teeth. \u201cRight, never mind.\u201d She said as she lugged her treasure next to you with the others that joined you to watch Luffy fight Kuro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry you didn\u2019t get much action.\u201d Zoro said as he leaned Usopp next to you as well as took a seat against a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok, watching you guys have fun is good enough. I\u2019ll just stick to healing.\u201d You said as you touched Nami near her wound and a light enveloped it than transferred it to your body. Kaya and the kids were amazed but Nami and Zoro had already seen it so they just accepted it. You did the same to Usopp and Zoro as you took on their wounds after which your body rapidly healed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing, but did it hurt?\u201d Kaya asked as she was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little depending on the severity of the wound. But wouldn\u2019t you do the same if you could. Y body can handle the wounds a lot better than theirs can so I did so. We all have our talents that we can use for good, and that just happens to be one of mine.\u201d You stated and you all continued to watch Luffy while he fought and eventually won. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another crew member and another surprise, but this time the boat wasn\u2019t small enough for Usopp to fall off. You still had to leave your new ship (Compliments of Kaya) as you were many times larger than it was. You were getting both physically and emotionally tired of repeating your story so Nami was kind enough to do it. After that whole mess was over with and Usopp stopped running from you, half scared and half just wanting to get some attention, he was able to assist on making the crew\u2019s pirate mark. You had to admit that Usopp was a talented artist and complimented him for it as he used your snout to stand on in order to paint one on the sail. You all ran into a few distractions but after Yosoku and Johny jumped on they proved the need to find a cook for the crew, a fact most of you already knew. So they pointed Nami in the direction of the sea restaurant Baratie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo to the untimely showing of a Maine ship and Luffy\u2019s misdirection of a cannon ball he found himself in dept the owner for wrecking part of the restaurant. You again offered to help but Luffy insisted it was his dept to pay so you joined the rest of the crew and waited. You all marveled at not only how good the food was but the atmosphere of the place. It was a good thing both you and Nami had enough money to pay for the food the crew ate. Luffy was also almost obsessed with getting the cook named Sanji to join his crew. However after Sanji served a meal to a Ghin from Don Krieg\u2019s pirate fleet none of you were surprised when Don himself came to Baratie. Krieg and his crew were suffering from starvation and Sanji served him something but was awarded a hard punch for his efforts. The other cooks tried to blow him away but that only made him angry. However before he could do anything substantial the owner provided meals to which Krieg took to his men after stating that he would be taking the ship and his logbook of the Grand Line. Before you had much of a chance to talk about it the men sent out a cry, first of joy and determination as they started the attack but was shortly turned to cries of fear and disbelief as a man known as Hawk Eye Mihawk sliced the overly large ship up with little effort and made his presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the greatest swordsman?\u201d you asked after Zoro\u2019s dual with him. Your presence that he didn\u2019t even see until this point caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am and you are?\u201d he said as he observed your every move with those eyes of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Max and I have a favor to ask. If you are truly the best and your weapon is the best sword in the world.\u201d You said and he looked at you for you to continue to which you stretched out your tail and put the end between the two of you. This caught many eyes including his. \u201cWill you try your best to cut the end off? I wish to know if your sword can penetrate my scales.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnder one condition, that you show me how you are able to grow a tail afterwards.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, just be careful. I have yet to find a material that can do more than scratch my scales in a direct hit. If your sword isn\u2019t capable I don\u2019t wish it to be damaged by my request.\u201d you warned and he smiled than with a grace you had not seen since you had seen Kakashi fight in earnest he sliced at your tail and at the last instant before damage was incurred to the stressing blade he diverted it. He put his sword away and you twirled your tail as you both examined it. The action had left a cut but not anything noticeable. You surmised that as you grew older that your scales also hardened but. You still had softer ones and the flesh under them were definitely weaker than the scales covering it but it was good thing to know that nothing would be able to penetrate them in a straight one attack. \u201cThank you Mr. Mihawk. With your permission captain I would like to make good on my promise and show him?\u201d You asked Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to do it around other people.\u201d Luffy said, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only one I really care about as far as acceptance is you Luffy. So if they want to fear me as a pirate under you than that is ok with me, as long as you are ok with it. It still hurts like hell but he did do me a favor so\u2026\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just don\u2019t mess with that guy. He\u2019s mine.\u201d Luffy said as he pointed to Krieg. You nodded and after growing some wings you took off into the air and when you reached a minimum safe distance to transform you did so. Out of the massive fireball from your jutsu you fly out of it and circled the area a few times. You roared loudly once for good measure and for the fact that Luffy thought it was cool. You had gotten to roar whenever you transformed for him. On the flip side it got you to release some effort from the pain of transforming. With that done you landed on the water than walked over to Luffy and Mihawk. \u201cYou scared everyone silly.\u201d Luffy stated between laughs and the excitement at seeing you at full dragon form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d You said as you looked over the crowd of people and ended with you gazing upon Mihawk. \u201cWell this is where my tail comes from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a\u2026\u201d Hawk eye stated as he looked at you more in awe than in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dragon! He has to be like the most awesome guy I found for my crew.\u201d Luffy said with a large smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is a true honor to meet you. I value Zoro\u2019s opinion in skill very highly therefore I consider it a privilege.\u201d You said to Mihawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie!\u201d Krieg exclaimed as he had just about enough of being ignored. You just placed your tail between Mihawk and Luffy from the spray of bullets coming. They bounced harmlessly off your tail without a care  in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just never learns does he?\u201d Hawk eye stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid is as stupid does.\u201d You said to which he smiled than left. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and the others go find Nami.\u201d He said after a rather large explosion was given to the Krieg pirates as a parting gift from the now absent Hawk Eye Mihawk. Luffy was hanging on to a railing where he had just made a deal that would free him of all duties that regarded paying the restaurant for the damage he had brought on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just make sure to secure a cook or we\u2019ll be screwed if we try to enter the grand line without one. Unless you are ok with eating raw fish from now on.\u201d You asked rhetorically but he answered it anyway with a shake then a smile of confirmation that he would get it done. You returned to human size and walked on the water\u2019s surface to the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mocking me?!\u201d Krieg roared as he fired a volley at you but with deathly quickness you caught every bullet until he stopped firing. Then you displayed your catch by slowly dropping the bullets into the ocean afterwards jumping in the boat and sailing with and away from a very astounded group of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever tell you how scary you are?\u201d Usopp asked as you used a wind style jutsu to speed up the boat you were on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, multiple times.\u201d You said in a board tone as you sat against the side of the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe stuff you do is far from normal and when you do stuff like that it just makes it more obvious.\u201d He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuffy likes it.\u201d You defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he isn\u2019t normal either.\u201d He said putting his nose up in defiance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you should be glad they are both on your side.\u201d Zoro said through coughing up blood from his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right I still have to heal you.\u201d you said but he waved you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is the same to you, I\u2019m going to keep these. They will remind me of my goal and being slashed by him is nothing less than an honor.\u201d He said to which you nodded and sat back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see her?\u201d Johny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. So she just headed off with our ship and gamed you no other explanation as to why?\u201d you asked as you had that feeling of betrayal again. The worst part about it was that you could see her doing it and wasn\u2019t surprised. It was like one of those things that you hope never happens but expect to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she seemed as happy as she is when she looks at treasure.\u201d They reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that ship is ours. How could she do that?\u201d Usopp asked in disbelief. As a present from Kaya, the ship meant a lot to him in general. You didn\u2019t answer as you looked out over the sea. Usopp was about to repeat himself but Zoro stopped him so he could take a look at you. This was obviously hard for you to deal with and you were visibly distressed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows? But Luffy said she would be the only one he would accept as the ship\u2019s navigator. The most we can do is hope she has a good reason for it. Luffy is a pretty good judge of character so I doubt he would\u2019ve allowed her aboard lightly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d You said in tone that expressed the emotional wear this had on you.

Usopp and the others tied up Zoro after you said that you were willing to either wait for Luffy or for someone to try to kill you before acting. However both of them abandoned ship shortly after a few fish men from Arlong\u2019s crew came to investigate them rying to sail to shore away from Arlong Park, leaving Zoro tied up and you leaning against the side of the boat. You were still in a rather pathetic mood and not really caring if they took you hostage or not. After all they didn\u2019t ask you anything or try to kill you yet so you were ok with them tying you up along with Zoro and taking you to see Arlong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe fishmen are the lords of all creatures and to defy us is to defy nature.\u201d Arlong said as he got done explaining why fishmen were superior to humans. You and Zoro looked at each other and after a little nonverbal communication that centered around the \u2018is he for real?\u2019 category you both started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that you so called fishmen are the \u2018lords of all creatures\u2019? What a joke, that title has yet to be given and it will most certainly go to someone less pathetically weak than you.\u201d you called out in a clear challenge. Your eyes started to glow and he looked on intently at this new site but the fact that you, as an apparent human, defied him made him understandably angry. You were going to continue but a scent hit you that got you to calm down and look behind Arlong as someone you weren\u2019t expecting showed. Nami was walking forward to join the fray. She then explained to the both of you and Arlong that she was merely using you and the others to further her goals. And before you could recover from the verbal onslaught of what confirmed her status a fishman picked you up and threw you into the water with a force that sent you straight for the bottom and got you stuck in the rock below. You heard laughter as you lay at the bottom with little to no drive to get out. You could, at this point, stay under water for weeks. You almost lost hope for her until Zoro joined you in the water but was retrieved by Nami. You didn\u2019t know why and you thought that just maybe she was counting on you to stay down so that is what you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were partially disgusted by all the fishmen that were swimming around and more than once was tempted to eat some but you would have to transform for that and Luffy didn\u2019t authorize you to do that. So you waited. Buried under some rock you also saw Usopp a few days later fall into the water but after his acting was up he swam away. It wasn\u2019t until Luffy called out your name that you started to move. Heat started to build around you as you began to radiate flames despite the water around you. You had just about enough of these fishmen and would not shy away from killing every last one of them if Luffy asked you to. The sudden increase of power and heat formed a cyclone down to where you were. You allowed the water to come underneath you to lift you to the surface to which you stood on the water with a light layer of flames covering your body and your dragon eyes showing despite your control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you can\u2019t kill him so easily.\u201d Luffy said than stuck out his tongue at Arlong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t scare us. We know how to deal with you.\u201d said an octopus looking fishman. He then proceeded to use his mouth like a horn to call a sea king that had a slight appearance of a cow. The creature went straight for you as you were the closest and still on the water. However you simply punched his lower jaw into his upper one and when it his trap was shut you grabbed him by the nose and tossed him with little effort toward the ocean and far out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope that wasn\u2019t your trump card.\u201d You said, obviously not impressed by the sea king they sent at you. \u201cYou fishmen seem to think you are superior to all others. Well I think you\u2019re forgetting about a species that would sooner think a fly was more of a threat than the likes of you, you ignorant pieces of meat.\u201d You said which got Arlong to stand from where Luffy sent him flying. \u201cLuffy, I know you want this guy but do you mind? I think he needs a proper lesson on where the top of the food chain really is.\u201d You asked and he simply gulped than after thinking on it nodded and joined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go all out if you want.\u201d He said with a smile but you didn\u2019t return one. You were very angry at this point. You had heard everything that went on, including their insulting of you as you were presumed dead where you used to be. None of them had actually seen you angry or even how you were when you saw another dragon. You had told them that you could get a little crazy if another dragon appeared but they were half glad there wasn\u2019t any, to their knowledge, and by your loyalty to Luffy which prevented you from adding them to the list of possible outlets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou insolent human. One beating wasn\u2019t enough for you. You actually think you are higher than us. However, out of curiosity, what species did I leave out?\u201d he asked as he laughed in an annoying laugh that you had come to highly despise. With a hand sign you exploded and your full dragon form was shown towering above him. You snarled at them as your tail and wings flexed, you also roared at him as if answering his question. You snatched up a few fishmen that had been in the middle of attacking you when you transformed with your jaws, some of them skewered on your teeth and blood running down and into the water. As if in an afterthought you swallowed them down and looked to the rest of the fishmen that fell back in horror of what was facing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t realize it at this point but you were probably using this as an outlet of all the pain that people like him had caused you and others. All the long time of being tortured by the leaf, other dragons, humans, and a long list of things that fueled you at this point. Your teeth were bared at Arlong while your claws flexed and the parts that were on the wall and floor of Arlong Park decimated what was under them. Then you started to drool, but not traditional hunger drool or even saliva for that matter. The drool was like drops of lava but when they hit the ground or sea they burned whatever they touched until it was ash or evaporated. With a breath between snarls you opened your mouth and blew out a massive flow of fire that was more like a beam, destroying and incinerating everything in its path, destroying not only the Park but a few miles after that point. It left nothing after the flame stopped, not even mountains and lakes but you stopped before it reached any human consequences of note. However this left nothing for the fishmen to run into as if the park would\u2019ve saved them from power like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 Will\u2026 Die\u2026!\u201d Arlong stated in a blood rage that previously everyone was afraid of. However in wake of the very large, powerful, and angry dragon in front of them they reluctantly followed him to attempt retribution. They had to jump into the air to get to your head but one had to wander what idiot would want to get near your jaws after you just ate half his crew and destroyed miles of country side with your flame breath. You didn\u2019t really care at this point and with another snap you grabbed the rest of them up and gulped them down, making sure they were dead before they hit your throat by your massive teeth. You\u2019re courtesy for prey was still there despite your current anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way on land and after sniffing around to make sure none escaped you calmed down and laid down so your stomach could work on digesting its meal. Your head took the place of the building at the entrance of Arlong park, minus the overall size. Your head wasn\u2019t that big and some would say that it was not proportional to your mammoth body but on the other hand it could easily fit a small boat or a third of the Going Merry in your jaws if you so desired. Combined with almost human sized razor sharp teeth, horns, and those glowing red eyes. You were pretty much the definition of why Dark Hunters were feared on your home realm and sometimes ones that random Dark Hunters visited. However your morals and kindness to humans set you apart from most. You closed your eyes for a moment while you rested your head on the soft earth after your destruction to clam yourself further. That was until a hand was felt on your snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not still angry are you?\u201d came Luffy\u2019s voice to which you opened your eyes and looked at him then the crowd, who flinched at your gaze, than back to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine for now. Just need a little time to gather my thoughts.\u201d You said in your usual kind voice that you used around them. Your former one was not very nice for those in the crowd that hadn\u2019t heard you before. Luffy smiled at this and with his laughter both your spirits got better as well as the others. Finally they rejoiced at the end of Arlong and his reign.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The villages\u2019 flame of joy was quickly put out by some Marine colonel, the same one that apparently took the money Nami was going to use to buy the village back from Arlong. He was a crooked as a Parine could get with an unhealthy love for money. Luffy and Nami soon remedied that and before too long they had him undoing the mess he and Arlong did, which included returning the money he stole from her. After that point you were asked to stay where you were as the village wasn\u2019t ready to see a full blown Dragon at your size. Even though you told them you could return to human they seemed more interested in keeping the large dragon, that just ate Arlong and his entire crew, as far away from people they didn\u2019t want to end up in the same place. So you went to the ship in human form to wait. It wasn\u2019t that bad and to be honest you had expected such treatment when you transformed so you laid near the back of the ship but on a small platform that allowed you to look over the sea as the boat rocked back and forth in the water. It was relatively quite in contrast to the noisy and partying village. So when Nami was walking on the ship\u2019s deck or on the dock for that matter you easily heard her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo here you are.\u201d Nami said as she tried to strike up a neutral conversation with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d you asked as you continued to look over the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I\u2019m sorry for taking the ship from you guys.\u201d She said as she thought that was the reason you were more distant, even more so than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my ship so it didn\u2019t really bother me when you took it in particular. Even if it was, a ship is easily replaced, perhaps not the memories attached to it but the ship is a material object that I have no emotional connection to.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why\u2026?\u201d she started to which you looked at her and she stopped immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you stole or even that you stole from us. It was how you did it that bothered me. You didn\u2019t trust us enough to help with your problems and after we made it quite clear that we were pretty close you ripped that away. The worst part is that I wasn\u2019t surprised. I was wishing that my suspicion of you was ill-founded. That my past was just playing tricks on my mind. You seemed too nice of a person to do something like that without reason. Even as we came here I was holding out that maybe it was a weird way of asking for help. But when we got here you didn\u2019t want us here, at all. Do you know what it feels like to not be wanted?\u201d you ended as she started understanding what was bothering you. You looked at her for a few moments than went back to observing the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I didn\u2019t know how much pain it caused you. I thought that distancing myself would help my village and keep you all safe from Arlong. I should\u2019ve trusted in you all more. I\u2019m truly sorry for how I made you feel.\u201d She offered and waited nervously for your response. You had unintentionally made it abundantly clear that you were not under Luffy because he was stronger than you so she didn\u2019t want to anger you like she had seen you against Arlong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing that you had us at least in your thoughts helps. It might take me a while to get over it but I won\u2019t hold it against you. We all have faults, some bigger than others, but that is what makes us who we are. I wouldn\u2019t have anyone but you as our navigator. Not that it is up to me but Luffy has a remarkably good judge of character.\u201d You answered her and she smiled at you for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also wanted to thank you for everything. I don\u2019t know if you know it or not but that park was my jail cell for a good portion of my life. When you blew it away it felt like that boundary was gone and I was free. I never thought destruction would or could ever look so beautiful as it did at that moment. It also helps that I won\u2019t have to worry about Arlong coming after me or the village after we leave.\u201d She said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe credit goes to Luffy. I wouldn\u2019t have lifted a finger if he didn\u2019t say so. He could\u2019ve taken Arlong out no problem so it was a favor on my part as well. However for my part I guess I\u2019ll accept your thanks.\u201d You responded as she looked up into your eyes. She let out another smile that it seemed you were over her little lapse of judgment and didn\u2019t require anything from her for your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll see you later, I still have some things to do before I go.\u201d She said and after a wave she headed off. It felt better to know that she at least cared enough to come and talk with you. You had enough emotional baggage without adding her to the list.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Luffy were pleasantly surprised when Nami\u2019s paper brought two new wanted posters. The first was for Luffy and his bounty was an impressive 30 million berries. But it was dwarfed by yours. Even though Luffy got the credit for defeating Arlong as the captain. The fact that you were actually a dragon and how much power you displayed brought your bounty to a whopping 150 million berry bounty. Your name on the poster was Dark Hunter Max. The name must have been from when Luffy bragged to the Marine Colonel that was there with Arlong. However they only had a picture of you in the dark with your eyes showing and wings out, again it must have been taken when you transformed back to human after or during the Arlong incident. Luckily for you it didn\u2019t really show you that well unless you were to let your dragon eyes go, any of your other dragon parts. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t posted that you were literally a dragon. You all landed on a place called Log town as a final stop before heading for the Grand Line. Luffy was excited as it was the island that Gold Roger was both born and executed. So naturally he was star struck and raced off without thinking to explore. After that point you all went your separate ways and as you had nothing better to do you watched over Luffy from the shadows like your Ninja training dictated. It wasn\u2019t long until Luffy was on the platform but not in the way he expected. Buggy the clown was able to pin him in the execution stocks. Good thing for you that you had been using a combination of fire clones and transformation jutsus to mingle among the crowd. After Buggy saw and address Zoro and Sanji he asked where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here Buggy.\u201d You said as you stood on a roof near but also a comfortable distance from Luffy, for Buggy that is. \u201cStill have a thing for clowns I see.\u201d You said which got him to turn to you and address your claim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be so smart after I flashily dice you up along with your captain.\u201d He said and looked back to Luffy who was still trying to get out of the bind he found himself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs \u201cFlashily\u201d the only description you know? It doesn\u2019t get any more interesting the hundredth time you say it. That and do you really think we are just going to let you execute our Captian?\u201d you asked to which he just brought the sword down that he was poising to chop Luffy\u2019s head off. Luffy went from a smile to laughter as you made a hand sign in order to use the substitution jutsu with one of your fire clones and to transform it into a copy of Luffy. The resulting explosion of him cutting the clone\u2019s head off sent him into the adjacent building as well as destroyed the execution platform. For a moment Zoro and Sanji were horrified but was interrupted Luffy\u2019s unmistakable laugh from beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow what a bang.\u201d Luffy said with a laugh before you both jumped down to the ground next to Snaji and Zoro. As part of your public figure you let your eyes glow. \u201cWhat cool trick was that?\u201d Luffy asked and the other two keyed in to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a fire clone of myself to look just like you. When it was clear you couldn\u2019t get out by yourself I used the substitution jutsu that exchanged the clone that looked like you with the real you. When the clone was destroyed it exploded as Fire Clones usually do when they are forcibly destroyed.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have any more do you?\u201d Zoro asked as the other Pirates surrounded your group. You smiled and with a whistle the hidden clones took on your appearance, holding a good number of the pirates hostage. However it only took one idiot to panic from the Marine force that was coing in to cause one to explode, and of course it made a chain reaction for the rest of them and effectively clearing the area around you to escape. Sanji than explained to Luffy in terms he could understand that you all needed to get out of there. So you all began to fun with you in the back so you could deflect some stray bullets that Marines and some surviving Pirates shot at you with your tail. One by one the group split up to take on separate opponents until Captain Smoker came around for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is as far as you go.\u201d Captain smoker said as he stood in your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you handle this guy, my punches don\u2019t work on this guy?\u201d Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you want to see another jutsu?\u201d you asked rhetorically to which his eyes almost bugged out in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m no pushover, even for Dark Hunter Max.\u201d Smoker said then used his devil fruit power to reach for you with his smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never faced a ninja before have you?\u201d You said and as his smoke reached and squeezed you the shadow clone you used disappeared in a puff of white smoke to add to his. \u201cEarth Style, head hunter jutsu.\u201d Your voice said as you grabbed him by the ankles and pulled him up to his neck in the ground. With him in this position his smoke lost its direction and you pooped out of a hole in the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo cool!\u201d Luffy said as it took you such a short amount of time to deal with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026 get me out of here!\u201d Smoker hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would but you would just attack us again, even after I beat you fair and square. You are free to try and chase us after you get out but make no mistake, this is not the only trick I know to defeat you with. And I did defeat you this time, wither your pride likes it or not.\u201d You said and with the last part using your tail to cut the ground then barely touch his neck as if to emphasize your point. With that done you and Luffy met up with the others that weren\u2019t already on the ship. Luffy used his long arms and grabbed ahold of the boat and with his arms recoiling brought all of you on it. They all ripped on him for it but Luffy just Laughed and you all soon followed as the Going Merry left Log Town behind, setting a course to outrun the pursuing Marines and get to the Grand Line.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou know how I feel about dragons.\u201d You growled which got the little girl you all rescued to jump but the others were more or less used to it. \u201cI\u2019m more likely to eat it rather than carry it. Besides a dragon that can\u2019t fly or take care of itself is almost useless, even as food because most of the meat turns to fat and is way less tasty.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Grandpa Ryuuji is a good and he\u2019s so kind.\u201d Apis insisted. You had stayed on the boat this whole time because you smelled a dragon and didn\u2019t want to have a dragon battle over a city. Not to mention ripping the thing apart at this point would be tragic to the poor little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still hate dragons.\u201d You said as you crossed your arms in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you ate a whole sea king. You can\u2019t possibly hungry enough to eat a full sized dragon.\u201d Nami stated. She was right, when you all entered the calm belt and was about to be eaten by sea kings you transformed and ripped the thing apart, eating most of it and letting the additional blood and leftovers warn away any others to not come near. It worked and despite giving everyone nightmares they were thankful that the thing was in your stomach rather than them being in its stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, he\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Luffy said as he looked at you with a smile like he did when he was excited about something. You knew that he would never let this down until you came with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess if Luffy thinks he\u2019s ok than I do to. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to like it though.\u201d You said as you got up and they took you to the dragon in question. Zoro and Usopp stayed with the ship and began getting it out of the approaching Marine\u2019s sight and sailing it to Nami\u2019s instruction. Finally you got all the way to where the dragon was and saw it just laying there. You had to stiffen a growl as you looked at the creature. \u201cYou know you look pathetic just lying there you know?\u201d you said to him with an added gruff to your voice as you continually tried to resist growling as you spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you get him out of here?\u201d Apis asked to which you looked at Luffy and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be easier if he had the strength to fly on his own but I guess he wouldn\u2019t need help if he could.\u201d You said as you approached the large green mass. With surprisingly little effort you lifted the dragon off the ground with the help of your tail and wings to balance him on your back than walked out of the cave so you could do so as a dragon. \u201cJust to be clear to you gramps.\u201d You started as you placed him on the ground. And stepped toward the side of the mountain as Marines were making their way up. \u201cIf you harm them I will slaughter you.\u201d you said as you jumped off and flew up to a decent range so the explosion wouldn\u2019t affect the fragile dragon on the ground. Once in dragon form you landed and glanced at a man that was facing the other down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you have two dragons. I am afraid they both belong to me.\u201d The man said as he looked at you and the green one that you were heading for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell I do.\u201d You said to the man\u2019s amusement. \u201cOk, everyone get on if you want off this rock.\u201d You said to the others to which they all jumped on your back and you secured them with your spikes. This would be their first flight with you so Luffy was having a blast and almost bursting with anticipation. You then grabbed the green dragon, who was shaking now as you did so, and readied to take off. He was actually smaller than Kara was last you saw her so you were able to hold him in one set of claws while the other three were relatively free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mock me!\u201d the strange little man yelled as he did something and sent winds that were near but not as advanced as Temari\u2019s wind scythe jutsu. The wind currents ruffled your wings but otherwise posed no threat to you. Granted you felt it but you had been on the receiving end of much more powerful wind style jutsus to be impressed by this fool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he just attack you?\u201d Zoro asked loud enough for the Erik guy to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t feel like it. He just blew at me really hard. Do you think he wants me to return the favor?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, if you blow at him he\u2019ll be flying off the mountain and then you would have to catch him.\u201d Nami said as she joined in on the fun. You were all obviously making fun of him and she wasn\u2019t going to miss out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking Nami. That would be a pain.\u201d You said and with that and a shocked Erik later you flapped your wings out then took to the sky. The resulting shockwave from an uncontrolled takeoff pushing him and the Marines back a considerable amount. You didn\u2019t have to go that high as you just needed to get near the ship to drop the others off. Once you landed next to the ship and snapped the mast off a pursuing one you let the others off and draped the old green dragon on your back, locking him in place and comfortably secure. Apis wanted to stay with \u2018Grandpa Ryuuji\u2019 so you let her ride on your back as you walked on top of the water and beside the relatively small and slow ship. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. We are trying to find lost island but the only one that know where it used to be is on your back, and he is senile.\u201d Nami answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so in short I have to carry this guy around until he remembers where this \u2018lost island\u2019 is?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Luffy said with a smile. Ignorance is bliss it would seem as he was just in awe of you both. No matter how many times he sees you like this his eyes always bug out at the site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa Ryuuji said he is sorry that he can\u2019t move that much and that you have to carry him.\u201d Apis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I can hear him to.\u201d You told her and she looked at you confused. \u201cWe\u2019re both dragons remember. That is why most dragons can read minds. It would scare to many people away if all we did all the time was snarl and growl to speak. That is about all most younger dragons or ones that haven\u2019t learned to speak would do. No matter how hard they would try it takes a lot of training for a dragon to speak in human tongues and some just end up using their mind instead. Sure it drains them more than speaking but they don\u2019t have to train for it.\u201d You informed than snaked your head around more and looked at the old dragon on our back as you walked. \u201cI don\u2019t mind carrying you, I just hate dragons. I don\u2019t know what your intensions are when you regain your strength so I don\u2019t know if you can be trusted. I\u2019ve seen many dragons where I come from gain a human\u2019s trust like you have with little Apis than when they get well from whatever is holding them back they have them as a convenient snack. Well that won\u2019t be happening on my watch.\u201d You warned and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa Ryuuji would never do that!\u201d Apis exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps if you really understood how delicious humans are to a dragon you would change your mind. However I myself am living proof that not every dragon acts on that urge so you may be right. But I\u2019m not going to risk any human\u2019s safety on that slim chance.\u201d You said than turned to concentrate on walking. Apis was going to argue but she had seen the scars of on you as did the dragon while you were carrying him so they left it at that while the others on the ship thought on what you just said. They obviously hadn\u2019t known how tempting they were as food. For now at least they had something else on their mind to help pull away from that, finding Lost Island.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even more so when he got off your back and helped protect Apis himself from cannon fire and Wind Boy. Luffy had ordered you to hold back and come aboard the Merry while Ryuuji was with Apis but now that he was down and the fat Marine commander Nelson was even more instant on getting the dragon to harvest the bones for his precious dragonite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. I\u2019ve had enough of that fat tub of lard anyway. If he wants a dragon so bad than let\u2019s see what happens when he gets one.\u201d You said than leapt onto the ocean and transformed in close proximity to a few of the other ships so they exploded along with you, leaving the marines swimming and clinging to the wreckage. Your wings waved away the smoke than you picked up Apis from her lone boat on the sea with your snout on her back and placed her on the Merry. You easily deflected the cannon fire from the other ships and answered by breathing fire at them, rendering their fleet to smoking and flaming masses as the crews abandoned the ships in question. You didn\u2019t  even need to fly as you walked heavily on the ocean\u2019s surface to the flag ship where Nelson was just to be hit in the side of the head by wind boy\u2019s power from another boat he had acquired after his encounter with Ryuuji, probably trying to get him or you for himself. The portion of his attack that made contact with your eye stung a little but quickly healed, the rest bouncing harmlessly off your scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d He said but with a growl the crew that had rowed him on the condition they didn\u2019t have to continue swimming shook. They jumped out and away from him as you turned and snarled at the tiny man in his little row boat, his unmanned and stationary row boat with your full attention. He tried again but it just bounced off your face as you got closer and as he tried to row away you quickly snapped him and his boat up in your jaws and swallowed the whole thing in one large gulp, probably crushing the boat around him as he passed down your throat and into your stomach for digestion. You then walked over to the ship of the ecstatic Nelson as he ordered his men to unload the cannons on you. But as long as they hit your body and scales there was no real damage and any that did come was quickly healed before anyone but you noticed. They kept firing until you were right in front of them and any more would\u2019ve caused damage to them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t run, someone help me!\u201d Nelson cried as the others started to abandon ship in little life boats before you destroyed theirs as well or at the whole thing. By the time your head and snout was within touching distance or Nelson everyone was off and rowing away as you barred your teeth and snarled at the fat little man sprawled out on the deck. \u201cNice dragon, ah\u2026 duh\u2026 ah\u2026 you can have some of my men if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d He offered which only got you more angry and as the men themselves heard it lost any loyalty to him in wake of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Max you arrogant tub of lard. I hesitate to eat you just for the fact you would give me indigestion with all that fat on you. So I was going to burn you to a crisp along with your ship. But I think a just punishment would be letting you quarrel with that wind boy as my stomach works on the two of you, very slowly.\u201d You said and followed up with bringing your tongue out to bring him in but for some reason he tasted so bad you retracted it in disgust. \u201cDamn you taste horrible.\u201d You said as you backed your head away and shook it to get the taste out. Just as he was about to say something you snapped forward and used only your teeth to grab him and toss him up. You hoped you could line him up with your throat so you didn\u2019t have to taste him at all. The fat man screamed and waddled in the air as he fell but it was all in vain as you snapped your mouth closed around him and swallowed, only having him touch your throat and thankfully none of your tongue again. The only solace for eating him was that now the two were fighting and making pleasant wiggling in your stomach. You wondered if they had figured out that it only brought acids quicker but you didn\u2019t really care at the moment as you went over to the life boats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat us.\u201d the man that you had observed to be the second in command begged as the others shook at your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, I have no intension of eating you. Well unless you are like those other two and try to kill little girls and the innocent for fun.\u201d You said and they shook their heads in verification. \u201cGood, I left you all with one ship so you can all return on more than just lifeboats. However if you decide to continue to pursue us before refitting and letting these nice people have their rest my captain may order me to destroy this one as well. I trust you understand, yes?\u201d you asked and they all nodded, as if they would argue with a giant dragon like you that just ate two pains in their sides as well as destroyed most of their fleet. You rose and left them to their work as you walked back to the Merry as Ryuuji already sank after calling the others and you settled in for a very annoying and ruff day. You could already sense the other dragons that were coming and you couldn\u2019t resize until you were done digesting the two you had eaten, or at the very least enough to fit in a human sized stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a rather unique time to start off on the Grand Line with a island whale, hazardous weather, and other conditions to get used to. The ship finally stopped at an island known as Whiskey Peak and despite all of your cautious behavior you were all welcomed and there was a party to celebrate your group\u2019s arrival but as you soon found out it was a scam by a company known as Baroque Works. You, Zoro, and you could sense Nami were the only ones not affected by their attempt at knocking you all out. You and Zoro had some fun with them as they attempted to kill both of you. 100 of them versus two of you, wasn\u2019t exactly fair on their end but they asked for it. But eventually Luffy got up and was mad at you and Zoro for beating them up, luckily Nami was there before anything got out of hand and you all found out about princess Vivi to which you all got around to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis Crocodile guy sounds interesting.\u201d You said as you all talked about what you were going to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can\u2019t wait to beat him up.\u201d Luffy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, so you get the boss. Ok than I get some of his subordinates.\u201d You said as you dealt out opponents with Luffy to the surprise of Vivi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, then who do I get?\u201d Zoro asked as you all continued to argue on who got who. \u201cFine we\u2019ll figure it out when we get there.\u201d He said as you all got onto the boat after Igaram\u2019s blew up and you started to leave. Shortly after you were all introduced to Miss All Sunday. She disarmed everyone but you were hiding and got behind her without her knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one touches that hat.\u201d You said as you grabbed it with some magic and lowered it down to Luffy while holding a kunai to her throat from behind. \u201cThat trick of yours is interesting but it won\u2019t work on me. You simply don\u2019t have enough strength to make me do anything with such weak muscles and lack of leverage. However\u2026\u201d you said as you retracted the kunai from her throat and started to walk to the side so her frozen form could see  you. \u201c\u2026 I highly doubt you were  the one to take out Igaram, call it a hunch.\u201d You concluded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may wish you killed me when you had the chance.\u201d She warned as you joined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only kill when Luffy says so. At least for when I am part of his crew. Besides\u2026\u201d You said then another Kunai was held to her throat. \u201c\u2026 I can kill you whenever I want.\u201d You and your clone said together then the clone was gone and she hurried off the ship before another could threaten her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know she didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d Vivi asked in a rather angry voice as the others listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for one, I got a good look at her power just now and that snot guy is a better candidate than she is. The second is that he was acting as a decoy for you so if she was after you she wouldn\u2019t waste her time warning you. She would\u2019ve ignited the gunpowder on the ship while she was on board and baled before we knew the difference, or used her power to kill you when she had the chance. She clearly stated that she had no orders here so it is more likely that someone else was to blame for his boat going boom.\u201d You reasoned and saw Luffy was already confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she\u2019s a good guy.\u201d He said as he was previously going back and forth between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly, for now all I can say is that she didn\u2019t kill Igaram and warned us about Little Garden.\u201d You responded to which Vivi nodded in acceptance as she went to deal with her sorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was her power?\u201d asked Zoro as he was wondering how he was disarmed so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen she did her little trick hands sprouted out of places to knock away your weapons and do what she did. If I had to guess I would say that she can project those hands on any surface, including your body. However they are only as strong as her own arms so she targeted pressure points and such to maximize her effect. If you are ready for it you can overpower her arms and hands, provided you have the necessary strength to do so.\u201d You explained more to the others as Luffy was again lost and was concentrating solely on Crocodile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t see any hands.\u201d Usopp stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mist shrouded but of course it didn\u2019t disrupt my eyes.\u201d You said as you flashed them at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Vivi said as she saw your glowing red eyes at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go again.\u201d You sighed as you would have to explain yourself to yet another person.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk. Luffy is it ok if I transform and get something to eat?\u201d you asked as you all anchored and was introduced to a land that everything was pretty much giant sized. That got him happy to go exploring and your mouth to water since you didn\u2019t really have a substantial mean since you ate that Sea King. Sanji was good but you needed a lot of food to satisfy your belly. Not that you needed to as the sun was usually enough but it would be like eating salad, the same salad, every day and only \u00bc of what you could eat. Especially if you were craving a burger or steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d He said as he was already excited about exploring the new and exciting place. You were going to ask Sanji if he wanted you to bring you back anything for his stores but he and Zoro had already made somewhat of a competition out of it so you got off the ship and went to dragon form before sneaking into the jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still way taller than the trees when you stood up but when creeping you could hide, even in the day time, pretty well. You stalked a few large animals and took down one of them with a long neck. The others around were going to charge you but you let out a roar and they ran, leaving you to enjoy your meal. When you dug in it was better than dragons as they were usually the only thing that had this level of firmness in the meat and other organs. Usually the stuff you ate was so week that you hardly noticed when you chewed it and judged on the burst of flavor and your enhanced perception and senses to tell you when you had bitten all the way through. But with dragons, and other with stronger hides, your teeth and mouth could feel when they sank in. The feeling of this meal and the flavor was even more so than the dragons that you had feasted on years ago. You thoroughly enjoyed your meal until you had chewed and swallowed every last bit, even the bones as you had the habit from your home realm too much into your being to stop now. You took your time to take in the feeling of a full belly for once and attempted to take a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d yelled a voice that could only belong to Nami. You woke from your slumber and looked up at the sky to see how late it had gotten. You had slept for a few hours and perhaps they had reset the logpost already and Luffy had finished exploring. You had thought that it would take longer for Luffy to satisfy his curiosity so you reluctantly got up and went over to where you smelled and heard the group, although you smelled a few more in the area as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you guys said I could go an eat and explore.\u201d You said as you found them in a clearing with some weird wax contraption that was spinning and spreading some kind of hardening wax over people and by the look of it would solidify them into statues if left unchecked. \u201cWhat the hell did you guys get yourselves into this time?\u201d you asked then looked around to see 4 people you didn\u2019t really recognize. Sure you were briefly introduced to shot guy and the overweight skinny chick but there was also a guy with the number 3 made into his hair cut and a girl with a paint set. They were all looking at you at this point. Then you saw that one of the figures that was being covered by wax was a giant and the other by him was one that was deeply unconscious. Those that didn\u2019t know you like this were all wondering what the hell you were and why you were talking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, just get us out of here.\u201d Said Zoro and this was when you noticed the scent of his blood was in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did one of these weaklings cut you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m not cut.\u201d Zoro stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, and the blood I smell in the air is what, an extra pouch you keep around for drama effect?\u201d you asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe tried to cut off his feet so he could fight.\u201d Nami said as if that was more pressing than their current situation, which Princess Vivi was almost flabbergasted in shock from. Not to mention she hadn\u2019t really gotten used to you being a dragon yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now I got to heal that to.\u201d You said as you walked forward and reached out a claw to touch the three under the bowl. You transferred their injuries to you as well as the wax covering which you easily broke and did the same to the two giants. The giant\u2019s injuries took more of a toll on you than anything but not much of one. That and Zoro\u2019s leg chopping kept you from moving for a few seconds while they healed but they all got away from the twirling thing. \u201cAnd what is this thing?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou disrupted my art!\u201d said the 3 guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the weird guy? And can I trash this thing? It is ruining to mood around here not to mention getting really annoying?\u201d You asked Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine, you can take that thing down.\u201d He responded as he got ready for another round with the 3 man. With that you poked it a few times to see how strong it was and it fell over but that only spread more wax all over the place but you saw that the fire on the top seemed to get rid of it. So you breathed a layer of fire over it until it was gone than laid down on the now open grassy area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you fire one?\u201d said a giant with a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is max, I\u2019m a\u2026 well that is a little hard to explain. But for now I\u2019m a dragon.\u201d You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re what made that loud roar before aren\u2019t you?\u201d the other giant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that was me. I had just caught my lunch and wasn\u2019t going to give it up to some of the others here so I scared them away. I thou\u2026\u201d you stated but was interrupted by an explosion against the side of your head that that made you and the others that had moved to sit between you and then giants, look at the group of others. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very polite.\u201d You said after moving your snout inches away from the snot guy and sniffed, taking in his scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should eat them.\u201d Nami said as they all had just about enough of them. Although she knew how you felt about doing that to humans in general. However this was more like one of those joke/threat things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I just ate one of those huge long necked things. I\u2019ll be full for a while, but I guess there is always room for some taste humans.\u201d You said in a tone only the crew knew as the tone you used when playing along with them. It wasn\u2019t the first time they had scared the crap out of someone like that. \u201cBut maybe barbeque, that one smells like he just wiped himself down with mucus. What do you think, got any preference on how you\u2019re prepared?\u201d you asked as you shifted your focus to the panicking group of humans as Luffy continued to fight and the others couldn\u2019t decide what was more interesting; your threatening with their squirming or Luffy kicking the 3 man\u2019s ass, sometimes literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on already, he doesn\u2019t have all day if you want to make it as a proper desert.\u201d Zoro put in as he wasn\u2019t going to miss getting his dig in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After they were far enough away you all started laughing and watched the rest of the 3 man\u2019s fight with Luffy. It was interesting but in the end Luffy was far too powerful for him and was defeated and likewise ran away from a threat to feed him to you, you even gave the guy a long lick to make him squeal like a girl as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I\u2019m already to full to even transform back to human form. I can\u2019t eat all that too.\u201d You said as Luffy was wondering why you wouldn\u2019t eat the leftovers of Sanji and Zoro\u2019s little hunting competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Luffy said as, against his wish, you all left the rest of the meat behind. Although you cooked some of it for him to eat instead of the rice cracker he had. He was the only person you knew that rivaled you in hunger, well not really but as close as a human could get. It wasn\u2019t long until you were at the sea and a large fish thing came out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep going straight.\u201d The giants said as you could sense the energy coming from them. Energy that would easily take down the giant (even by your standards) fish but not save their prized weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let me take this one. You all got to fight and I need to burn off some of this food.\u201d You said to which the lowered their weapons and you moved in front of the ship as they brought it to a stop. \u201cAlthough it is a shame that I don\u2019t get to eat it. You both don\u2019t mind fish for a while do you?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, we will have a grand feast.\u201d One of the giants said and the other joined them in their peculiar laughing styles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long as it didn\u2019t have anything to help it in a fight other than size. You gave it a warning snarl anyway but it paid it no heed as it opened its huge mouth to swallow you and the ship, although it would just barely be able to take you in, maybe not all the way but definitely in two gulps. That is if you didn\u2019t retaliate with a severe flame breath that pierced right through the fish and left a gigantic hole in the thing. The attack left a shockwave and the fire could be seen probably for miles. With that done you went over to the sinking carcass and grabbed it with your jaws, lifted it up just barely, and threw it so some of it was on the shore for them to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d Luffy said as he looked at the size of your conquered foe as the others, even the giants, did in shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you really are something.\u201d Said one of the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, see you later.\u201d You responded then joined the others as they were already sailing away from the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you turn now?\u201d asked Luffy referring to your ability to turn human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. I have to digest some more of my meal first. If I don\u2019t than it will make me explode in my smaller human stomach.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did you eat anyway?\u201d Zoro asked as if judging the time until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of those long necked things. Haven\u2019t had that much to eat since that sea king all that time ago.\u201d You said which caused their jaws to drop. They knew you were capable of it but it was still surprising to hear it none the less. Vivi was still on the emotional stated that she thought you might think one of them would be a good desert.

You had learned to make them and with all your combined knowledge and Nami\u2019s guidance you were able to make them. But Nami was currently sick at the moment with something that for some reason your body wouldn\u2019t take in. There was only two ways to save her. The first was you eating her and hope your storage stomach would generate enough healing power to save her. For many reasons none of you wanted to explore that option. The only other way was to find a doctor. You had flew around and as it was quite cold you were keeping your dragon parts out while human to help maintain your heat. Your dragon body was superior in climate control so the more draconic you were the more comfortable it made you, at least in the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll be taking it.\u201d A man named Wapol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you, lard ass.\u201d You said with the men that were pointing guns at you quivered as you were halfway intimidating looking with your wings flexing, your tail waving, and your eyes glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the ruler and you will\u2026\u201d Wapol started but you had no intension of letting him finish in any polite manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuffy, we still have a little bit to go so if they attack can I?\u201d you asked as you still needed permission to engage, although you were all talking about allowing you more free reign as far as fighting was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they look weak so go ahead.\u201d He said back to you and you all could see that it was driving Wapol crazy to be taken so lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot him!\u201d came the order as he was so mad that they were quivering. You each handled them differently. On your end you caught the bullets and cut the weapons apart with your tail until all they had left was their bare hands. You only attack actual people when they were foolish enough to do it to you as you walked over to the even angrier man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on big mouth time to go flying.\u201d And with that you grabbed his upper jaw as he tried to open up and take a bite out of you. With this hold you took a preparation step then threw him into the distance. After that the men that you all were previously fighting retreated and after threatening the crew went to find their lost leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Sanji asked and you just shrugged, which was slightly comical as you looked so threatening but was acting so gentle and casual. That display just proved yet again that you were far above them. Sure they would have been able to do what you did, but not so easily, well not most of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe sure was annoying though.\u201d Said Usopp as the danger was gone and he was prime to look \u2018cool\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich way now?\u201d Vivi asked as they were all pulled back to the current task to get a doctor for Nami. The question was directed at you as you pointed and kept pointing in the direction until they were on course again. After that brought your wings around you and sheltered from the cold and settled in to continue your nap. Only to be woken by\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not long after a segmented napping session as they would often wake you to make sure they were going the right way, you were all looking around the shore as you pulled into the snow covered area. Luffy was excited and had to be constantly reminded that they were there to find a doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. We haven\u2019t even said hello and they already hate us.\u201d Sanji said as Luffy and the rest of the crew were told to leave because \u2018your kind aren\u2019t welcome here\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know how I feel\u201d you said as it had been brought up more than once that it was natural for people to fear and despise you, until they get to know you that is. At this point the only people on the ship that was nervous around you was Vivi\u2019s Duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe it would help if you didn\u2019t have your wings and tail out.\u201d Usopp suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding. It\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d You returned but any further argument was ceased as a gunshot was heard and the bullet hit the deck near Sanji. Soon after and before you could do anything about it another fired and grazed Vivi, who was holding Sanji back from retaliating. Strange thing was that she continued to do so afterward and calmed both sides. She really was an amazing woman in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, can you carry her since you are so warm?\u201d Luffy asked as the group finally agreed to escort you all to the village while Zoro stayed behind to watch the ship. And what he said was true. While you yourself were freezing your overall body heat was just like your dragon form, just not very insulating on your behalf. In fact it was the main reason why you couldn\u2019t where traditional clothes for too long. The clothes would eventually burst into flames so you just settled for the clothes you could make via your scales and transformation jutsus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d You said as you picked her up and wrapped your wings around her and you, which kept her warm and you along with her. Your tail shrunk into your back until only a small one remained. The people had already seen it so suddenly having them disappear may be more than they could handle. It wasn\u2019t long before information was gathered and Luffy was off is Sanji and Nami to deliver her to the doctor. You offered to fly her up there but it was decided that your dragon form would be too much. But Luffy authorized your to stay back and protect the town if necessary, but only in human form while he didn\u2019t limit your dragon parts from coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax do something.\u201d Vivi said as soldiers came in under Wapol\u2019s command to seized the towns while he went after the three already up the mountain. You were going to do something anyway but now there was an avalanche heading toward the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, ok, everyone stand back.\u201d You said as you started making hand signs then slammed your hands into the ground. This made a large fire dome envelope over the town, burning so hot on the outside that the avalanche evaporated as soon as it hit the wall of flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked one of the town\u2019s people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire barrier, just a little something that I invented a little while ago. Let\u2019s see old lard ass or his boys get passed that.\u201d You said as you called Wapol by the nickname you had given him. A few were frightened by your disrespect for such a dangerous man but the others just laughed at this and went on there business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is that one of those jutsus?\u201d asked Vivi asked as she was constantly trying to look past your other side as much as she could to deal with you personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. While fire is easier to do because of my\u2026 other side, this is a barrier jutsu just like a shield but using an element rather than a piece of wood or metal. The tricky part is making it one way so it doesn\u2019t burn stuff on the inside.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is amazing.\u201d She said as the wall of snow hit the thing wall but burst into the air, making a loud crash and sizzle that started the events for the for that part. However with the town sealed away they were all spared any unnecessary losses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo you\u2019re the new guy.\u201d You asked as you all set sail from Drum Kingdom towards Alabasta. Chopper was both strange and interesting. On one hand his reindeer scent made you hungry but it was evident that he was half human, not only by confession but by his reasoning and other abilities. Although he acted a lot like you and was afraid of rejection more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Chopper.\u201d He said back to you as you looked at him while the others talked and observed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Max. It is good to finally have someone else like me around here.\u201d You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d he asked as he looked at your tail and wings. You were still in a cold climate so you still had them out to warm yourself and what not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe means he is half human to, just like you. Can you guess what his other half is?\u201d Zoro said as it got a shocked look from chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 don\u2019t know. Is it something bad?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends, if you were a normal reindeer or an enemy than yes.\u201d You said cryptically as you all were getting a little bit of fun from his emotions on the matter. At one end he was happy and the other scared, along with a few others in between. He would react with dances or shivering depending on what emotion he was projecting in an almost sequential pattern. It was quite comical and entertaining to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would it be bad if I was a normal reindeer?\u201d he asked as he had clearly always thought the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame problem with them, I would eat you for a snack.\u201d You said in a casual voice which made the statement that much more unbelievable but sent Chopper running in circles as there was nowhere to run on the ship to get away. The rest started laughing and he finally stopped and was ushered back to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just show him and get it over with?\u201d Nami more commanded than suggested. You looked over at Luffy to which he nodded with a smile and you got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, no matter what I am you are still part of this crew so you\u2019re safe.\u201d You said and he just nodded like a bobble head doll. You then jumped to a safe distance on the water which caught his attention right away. But then you exploded and transformed which caused Chopper to go comically running around the ship again. You stayed at a distance until he calmed down and was able to take you in. After a few moments of them explaining you and your past with him you were ushered forward and you brought your head close to the ship so your eye on that side was visible. \u201cAs the ship\u2019s doctor you should know about all your potential patients as well as you are a part of this crew now so you should know me for what I am. Like I said before, it is good to finally have someone like me around here, someone that is half human that is\u201d You said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to eat me or anything.\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2026 well as the others said I have a second stomach to heal people so I can\u2019t say never and I technically have to eat you to get you there. But as far as thinking you as food. You can count on it, I will never eat you in that way.\u201d You explained and a part of your past hit him and you as he said that. It was obvious, even with their limited sightline of you that you didn\u2019t like the subject spoken like that. When joke threatening with others; fine, but not when it came to serious debates about people close to you. In fact you had been one of the biggest voices to keep Nami out of your second stomach when she was sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ok. So can you breath fire and stuff too?\u201d Chopper asked as he tried to change subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m a dragon, fire breathing comes with the package.\u201d You said and blew a little off to the side and his eyes began to sparkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d he started but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as Luffy says it\u2019s ok than you can.\u201d You answered as most of the crew liked to go flying eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s go!\u201d said Luffy and was the first to jump on. Chopper\u2019s jaw dropped as he didn\u2019t even ask and you already said yes. Soon they were all on, after dropping anchor, and only awaited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not sure if I\u2019m comfortable with\u2026\u201d he started but Luffy gave you a few pats on the spike holding him on. You looked at him and he gave you a signal and they all watched as the rest of the crew knew it well. You had to do this to Nami, Usopp, and Vivi as well. With a quick snap you sent your tongue out and grabbed the fidgeting Chopper and brought him in your mouth. After that you shot it out and placed him on an open spot on your back and secured him with a spike. Before he could say anything you took off and went high into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe got you good.\u201d Luffy said between all of them laughing at the freaked out Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was it?\u201d asked Nami as she put a hand on him and he began to calm down a little but still was obviously shaken. \u201cI mean the take off. You know you would never had gotten on if he hadn\u2019t done that and his claws are too big to catch you. In fact his tongue is actually quite comfy if you get past the whole in his mouth thing and the drool. So do you like it up here?\u201d she asked more directed this time in her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he did that to you to?\u201d Chopper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first time is always the hardest and yes he did that to me, Vivi, and Usopp. You should\u2019ve seen him but we all love it up here and the next part to.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO!\u201d yelled Luffy before Chopper could asked what the \u2018next part\u2019 was. You suddenly sped up and began giving them a ride that made roller coasters a joke and at speeds that they didn\u2019t even dream of going. It took some doing before you knew what was enjoyable and what was bad about such rides. But with Luffy\u2019s help you figured it out and you finally heard a comforting sound to you from the new comer of the group; laughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since you couldn\u2019t go into town without causing a scene, mainly because the word had spread with the suspicion of what you are. Not only that but there was a better picture of you and a picture of you as a dragon on the new wanted poster. Because of that little fact your bounty went up to 250 million berries. An amount that got Luffy both jealous and proud at the same time. He often would run around broadcasting random facts and teasing both you and the crew as they each had a different response to the news. So you were assigned to ship guard duty both at sea and when docked. Although sometimes you had to catch Luffy from flying in wherever he was when he came aboard. Such was the case this time as he finally found you after you all started to sail away without him in order to protect both the ship and others as you tended to destroy impeding or threatening forces. Shortly after someone jumped aboard and almost landed on the deck but as he was someone you hadn\u2019t seen before you rushed forward and grabbed him by the throat and over the sea so he didn\u2019t make it on the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Max, he\u2019s my big brother.\u201d Luffy said as you growled at the choking pirate. This snapped you out of your aggression and quickly set him on the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother\u2026?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Ace and he is Luffy\u2019s big brother.\u201d Zoro explained to which you nodded and bent down to his slumped form as he clutched his sore and bruised throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies.\u201d You said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a welcome you have there.\u201d Ace said as he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Luffy charged me with the safety of this ship a little while ago. It has been a while since an enemy got on board on my watch or damaged the Going Merry.\u201d You answered then your attention was snapped to enemy ships closing in and not just one or two either. \u201cWell, duty calls.\u201d You said than jumped off the ship and onto the water\u2019s surface and started a series of hand signs, \u201cWater style, multi water dragon jutsu.\u201d You said as multiple water dragons emerged from the ocean around the attacking ships and within seconds tore them apart, sinking back into the ocean after their assault as you jumped back onto the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so cool!\u201d Luffy said as you wiped off your hands of the residual water. You smiled at the compliment and went to go sit down near the edge but still in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Dark Hunter Max.\u201d Ace said as the others started talking about what had happened that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you my crew was awesome.\u201d said Luffy like you would expect from brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I hear you are good with fire.\u201d he more asked than said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComes with being a dragon, and I hear that is your devil fruit power\u201d you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you for keeping my little brother safe, I know he can be a handful most of the time.\u201d Ace said as the others talked amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he is Luffy, but I can honestly say that it has never been a chore. I picked him as my captain for a reason and he is very\u2026 special in that regard.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that reason?\u201d he asked, probably in an attempt to duplicate it and have you join Whitebeard and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as you can imagine I cause quite a ruckus and panic wherever I go. Without going into my past it is safe to say that most people have two attitudes when dealing with me. Usually it is kill me or something like that, and or use me. But I am not treated like an actual person, even by the other crew here they have their reservations and handle me with care. Like a powder Cage ready to blow at the slightest false move. Luffy is either to stupid or just that kind and accepting that those thoughts have never entered his mind.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then why aren\u2019t you a Captain? I can imagine there are a lot of people that would join a crew that has someone like you as its leader.\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit the thought does cross my mind every once in a while. But believe it or not I am quite young and have no desire to rule anyone. If I had one wish it would be to have friends that accept me for who I am, rather than accept me or fear me biting off their heads. Luffy is the only one that I have found that fits the definition perfectly so I would proudly serve him and protect that connection and the people close to him. Unlike some, if Luffy tells me to do something I know it is a pure desire of his and pure in its motives. I don\u2019t have to worry about killing innocents or other immoral practices that others order their crew from time to time.\u201d You Explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both talked for a while longer about things that ranged between Luffy to food choices. Although you were understandable hesitant to share curtain things and he understood. Finally after a bit of sailing the ship docked at a port and Luffy\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cVery well Luffy, but only because you asked. It gets boring on the ship all by myself.\u201d You answered and he apologized for that but promised that you would be able to do something \u2018more funner\u2019 later. So there you were on an otherwise empty ship as you soaked up the sun. Most people complained about the sun as it was in this country and you had to say that if you ever ran out of drinking water you might as well. However, other than that, you thought the sunlight was extremely refreshing. You used a jutsu so that only members of the crew would know where the ship was but otherwise it was completely invisible, so much so that you Ace asked where it was the moment he got off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your boring detail you protected the ship only once as there was a sand storm that would\u2019ve caused some damage but with you knowing all of Gaara\u2019s moves you easily deflected it with a \u2018Sand Tsunami\u2019. Otherwise the most strenuous thing you did was clean the mast and sails. Even though you took your time it took all of a few hours to get the Going Merry so cleaned and such that it was as if it was on display. Either way you were just taking a nap in your spot and a few days later when desperate cries came and broke your concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax! Whatever your name is where are you?\u201d you looked up to see some kind of seabird/man anthro thing carrying Luffy and he was pretty banged up, more so than you had ever seen him before. You were about to grab him and slice that birds head off. But the way he was carrying him didn\u2019t suggest it was what an enemy would do. You answered by taking the genjutsu down and he almost flew smack into the mast. He circled once then landed on the deck where you soon joined him as he placed the unconscious Luffy down. \u201cHe said to bring him here than passed out. I hope you are worth it. We don\u2019t have any time to lose.\u201d Said the bird man then took off. You wanted to asked him something but he was fast and you were to destracted to get the question off before he was too far away to hear it. Ever since you set foot in this country a scent would hit you every once in a while. It was just a whiff on the wind and to most animals would be unnoticeable but you could never forget the scent of leaf village ninja. Through your slow and mostly boring time alone on the ship you had smelled it more than once. But it was shrouded and never more than a wisp on the wind and only when the wind was blowing perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately transferred the wounds Luffy had to you and luckily they weren\u2019t as bad as they looked. Before he even got up your body was dealing with the last cut, as it disappeared to Luffy\u2019s opening eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, so that bird guy got me back\u2026 and you healed me up.\u201d He said as he flexed and stretched his body as if almost dying didn\u2019t even register to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that guy dropped you off and headed toward where you guys said the palace was. I assume you want to get there but what\u2019s the news?\u201d You asked and Luffy explained the basic idea of what he knew, which wasn\u2019t much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you fly me there then help out with the war thing?\u201d Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can but what about the ship? I can\u2019t hide it from that distance.\u201d You asked as it was you appointed task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Luffy said with a smile and you couldn\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know how to beat that guy.\u201d He said as he looked at his fist than at you confused face. \u201cI fought Crocodile but he has a devil fruit power to turn into sand. Every punch I threw he just turned into sand and I couldn\u2019t get a hit.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSand heh, well than you either need an extremely hot flame or water.\u201d You said and you could see he wasn\u2019t following you so you led him off the ship and onto the sand with a bucket of water. You then built a quick sand castle that had the same basic problem he said. \u201cOk so he is basically like this right?\u201d you asked and he wacked the castle only to have it reform and like he had seen then he nodded to you. \u201cOk, since Ace would be the only one with enough fire to do the first option I\u2019ll just skip to water.\u201d You said than poured the water over the castle. The castle couldn\u2019t reform than you gave him the signal to try again and he did. This time sand flew everywhere as he destroyed the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s what you meant. So all I need is water.\u201d He said then ran onto the ship. What he came back with actually surprised you. You usually didn\u2019t expect intellectual decisions from him but he had a barrel of water strapped to his back along with a hose to lace his body with water if needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, awesome idea Luffy.\u201d You complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you give me a ride to the palace?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d You said as you were more than willing to leave the ship and finally get some action. Although you could still smell that scent every once in a while of Leaf Village Ninja. You hoped that either your nose was wrong or that they weren\u2019t in the direction you were headed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax, catch her. I\u2019ll go kick his ass.\u201d Said Luffy as you neared the square where the fighting had escalated to an all out war. The two sides clashed and as an attempt to quell her free spirit, Crocodile had pushed Vivi off the ledge while dealing with the ruling body of the country. You had passed the bird man on the way there as you were much faster than he was and he would never get there in time or you would\u2019ve let him catch her. She still really didn\u2019t like you that much, especially as a dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, go get him.\u201d You said as he was on your tail at the moment. You both thought that it would be easier if you could send him over there rather than him jumping. So with a flick he let go and was flung at an insanely high speed toward Crocodile as you went and caught Vivi on your head. It was the only spot, besides your tongue, that was soft enough to cause no injury. \u201cYou know you really should grow some wings if you plan on jumping like that.\u201d You joked up at her as she was still slightly in shock from your presence. Your speed was at a level that very few of the fighting men in the square saw you fly through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 and Luffy\u2026 are here?\u201d she stuttered as she was not expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what friends do you know. So how do you want to handle this? Luffy told me to Catch you and to help you so what do you need?\u201d you asked as she was still on your head and even though you slowed down was still holding on to the smaller spikes that were displayed on your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrocodile says there is a bomb in down there and it is in that tower somewhere. We also need to get them to stop fighting but my voice won\u2019t reach over all this racket.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you need is for them to listen to you. I think I can help a little.\u201d You said than dove down to where the center was and roared as you flew over the square once, letting a few fireballs hit in places that didn\u2019t hit anyone but scatter the dust that was impeding sight. This effectively got everyone to back up and panic enough to give you room to land in the center. After a rather rough landing where the ground shook violently you flexed your wings which vacated the remainder of the flying dust and sand out of the way then roared again, causing absolute silence in its wake. No one dared approach you or say so much as a word as you snarled at both sides then put your head to a height that Vivi could be seen by all and stable enough for her to stand on. \u201cYou\u2019re up princess Vivi.\u201d You said to which she stood and noticed the stage you were giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave somewhat of an emotional speech in which she addressed many things which brought the perspective leaders to the center and you let her down so she could speak with them. Search parties went out to find the bomb and it was found at the top of the clock tower. They were trying to find ways to destroy it and even though you offered to destroy it for them, most didn\u2019t trust you and Vivi was still one of them. So you, as requested laid down at the far end as more of an insurance on the fragile peace that was occurring. Some might have been willing to cross their perspective leaders on starting the fight again but with you there supporting Princess Vivi they were not willing to cross a dragon of your size. Unfortunately the bomb was made with the anticipation that you would get involved so it was bigger than anything they could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Max?\u201d Vivi asked as she approached you. Even though she didn\u2019t really take a shine to you, even now, she was the only one present with the others still fighting their opponents that would come anywhere near you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d you responded as you opened your previously closed eyes to her. They, light normal, were too intense for most to handle so you were so close to be taking a nap. Although your emotion on her still not accepting you was easily betrayed in your expression. There was also the scent of the Leaf Village Ninja that was very strong in the area but you still couldn\u2019t locate them as of yet. The scent its self was getting you to have a rather saddened mood but with her still acting like you were an enemy was also draining on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel a little guilty for putting you over here then needing your help. But none of us can even lift the bomb and it will be going off rather soon. We need to get it out of here or everyone inside this city will die. Can you help us with that?\u201d she asked. You looked at her for a prolonged amount of time than up at the bomb in question. They had moved things away from it so you could grab it mid flight but you could tell that it was a nasty little thing and if it blew while you held it than it would be no better than that paper bomb going off near your heart. You definitely would be dead and Luffy and the others didn\u2019t stand a chance if it went off in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your point. I will help as much as I can. After all, Luffy did order me to help you and I obey his orders.\u201d You said as you made it clear that was one of the only reasons you were doing it. She felt a little ping as it seemed to be that you were moving away from trying to persuade her that you were ok, or even to the point that she was like the other non crew that you meet. You didn\u2019t really care what everyone else thought of you as long as Luffy and the others were ok with it. She had never really treated you like part of the crew even though you had made it a point to treat her like one. With no further explanation you rose and took off toward the tower and the bomb. The move caused a little bit of panic from those guarding the device but you again didn\u2019t really care at the moment. You had way to many things on your mind to be concerned about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached it and grabbed it gently but flew away as fast as you could and as high as you could in what time was left. When you reached a height and distance you thought it was ok to let it blow you tossed it into the air in an attempt to use your fire breath to destroy it and further deter the blast away from the city. But before you could let out the flame in question the bomb blew. The only question was; were you far enough away at this point to be ok or did it do some damage?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blast was by no means a small or weak one. If it had been in you than it would\u2019ve disintegrated you, scales and all. So the fact that you so close only provided a stage in which the destruction could wreck havoc on your body. The first thing to go was the thinner and comparatively weaker membrane between the bones on your wings. Followed by severe burns and what small amount of shrapnel that flung into your, at this point, tender flesh. Luckily enough you had closed you eyes so they were ok but, again, you were highly burned everywhere. If you had known before hand you would\u2019ve put a layer of spikes over your body but you were only able to do so to cushion your fall. You had remarkably little amount of say on where the explosion was forcing you to land but you did do your best to direct yourself to a deserted part of the palace with no living stuff in the area of impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact from your fall put a crater in the once beautiful garden and left you sprawled out as the last thing you could do was retract your spikes and try to get up. The last sight you saw was someone flying up through the air as if someone had forced them up from underneath the bedrock of the city floor. You were to out of it to see who but judging on the possibilities and the people capable of such a feet you guessed it was the crocodile guy and the person to give him his temporary flight status would have to be Luffy. As the initial pain of the fall left you were greeted by new internal injuries as your ribs had punctured more than a few organs. The only luck you had in this ordeal, other than still being alive, was that the sun was shining on you despite the rain that now dotted the earth below. It allowed your body to start healing itself as you went off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dStay away from my patient!\u201d said a voice that you knew to be Chopper\u2019s. It was the first distinguishable sound you had heard sense you had fallen asleep and fluttered in and out of consciousness. The scent on the air was so strong with the leaf ninja that your body was always on alert. You meant what you had said before. You would rather die than go back to the whole paper bomb slave thing and leaving your body open to people when their scent was around was not comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let me help. I\u2019m a friend of Max\u2019s and he\u2019s hurt.\u201d Said a voice you also recognized but not to a name. Your body was still too weak to do anything but sit there and listen. The only clue you had was that the voice brought dread to the surface of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I have his wings just right for them to grow back and I won\u2019t let you touch them. The rest is my job, I\u2019m his friend and I never heard of you before. That is unless you are one of those mean ninja people, then you\u2019re definitely not touching him.\u201d He defended. Like the others you had told Chopper your past and he had almost went on a morality speech for a week on how wrong it was for a doctor to sew bombs inside you at all, and even worse to use them to make you a slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems you have everything under control so I\u2019ll just leave you to it then.\u201d Siad the voice with a slight whimper to it. You heard a sniffle as the sound of footsteps entered whatever building was in front of you. You were obviously big enough for it to be a few buildings and while you didn\u2019t underestimate them you guessed that they didn\u2019t move your massive body from where it was when it landed. You felt a prick near a still tender portion of your leg and after that you went back to sleep. Chopper must have given you a sleeping cocktail of some kind so you didn\u2019t move around and disturb his work. You resigned to it, even though your sleep was plagued with nightmares but none that you hadn\u2019t seen before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yet again you wake but this time you are able to move and stretch as you woke. Most of it was out of habit; first checking the area so no one got hurt, then doing your stretching, lastly settling down and taking in the area around more directly. As you came to the settling down part you saw that the guards nearby weren\u2019t really keen on seeing you yawn or move for that matter so they ran into what you assumed to be the palace. You took this moment to look at you wounds and what still needed to be healed. Your new scales were coming in nicely and the old ones with the burns were being discarded. Your wings were still a little tender but back to their normal shape and overall look, no holes or extra chips to note. It wasn\u2019t long after you started to stand that Chopper rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t be moving so much just yet. You need to let your injuries heal more before risking to use them, more particularly your wings.\u201d He instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo complaint from me, feels like my body is telling me the same thing.\u201d You said after a wince to your attempt at standing. Your immediate danger was passed but your body promptly let you know that it was far from healed yet. Unfortunately one of your bodies tells was also your stomach as it complained of its empty status with a loud rumble. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that means I need to eat something.\u201d You said as you looked around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go get you some food.\u201d Chopper said and for once was in full doctor mode and didn\u2019t even register that you could just as easily swallow him down, as the reposted guards seemed to be aware of. Chopper ran off to get his patient some food and you were left by yourself plus the two terrified guards. It was at this point that you started to try and locate the source of these ninja that were so close that you could almost taste them. Your combination of heightened dragon senses made it so you could virtually look through walls and such. Finally you found them but they were far enough away and through enough walls that you couldn\u2019t get more than a general idea on what their condition was. There was a few of them and they were in a dungeon of sorts. \u201cSorry it took so long, I forgot that you need more food than most and like the raw stuff.\u201d Said a voice that interrupted you concentration. You looked down at the now nervous Chopper as he stood beside a fish twice his size as well as a few camels and a cow. They were chained to a pole in front of you and it was a good thing because most, except the fish looked like they were trying to get away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Chopper, but you don\u2019t have to stay and watch me eat. You two either.\u201d You said and included the guards in the deduction and they eagerly left you to your meal. After they left you dug in quite literally into your meal. Although you were also courteous as to not get blood everywhere so you waited to do the chewing and savoring until they were inside your jaws and sealed. This also kept the other meals from panicking and trying to run. You saved the immobile fish for last and was grateful as was your now filled stomach. Granted your stomach was smaller than your body portrayed because of your constant lack of filling it but it still felt good as you cleaned what was left of your meal from your jaws and the ground. You didn\u2019t need to give the image of you talking with a set of bloody jaws. They left you for a while then came back and after standing at their post and Chopper doing some last checkups you were left to get some rest. But you had slept for what apparently was a week and was not really that tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis allowed you to think on a few things. One of which was why the ninja were here and how they planned to get back. You had just developed a jutsu from the original that allow you to direct where the portal went in a reverse or forward sense. However you had yet to test it and to be honest you really didn\u2019t want to go back to their realm nor did you want to leave this one. But they were obviously here for a reason and you didn\u2019t know what it was, not to mention they probably didn\u2019t have a way home if they just got here and it had been a few years so you could only imagine what they wanted with you and those images weren\u2019t that good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you just going to sit there and brood?\u201d asked Zoro as he must have seen your thinking face and for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d you asked as you weren\u2019t sure to what he was referring. There was a few things that were weighing on your mind from your old \u2018friends\u2019 to Vivi\u2019s lack of trust which resulted in you being injured in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot and I am well aware of our guests in the dungeon. I suspect with that nose of yours you can smell them as well. They asked for you and at first your name was good enough to get them in the door. But as they revealed themselves and their relation to you we had them arrested. Some even tried to persuade us that you were dangerous as their main selling point and that we didn\u2019t know what we were dealing with. We all remember what you said they did to you so we left them in there until you were ready to deal with them.\u201d He explained which gave you some depth in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to do with them. It is insanely difficult to perform the portal jutsu and I never thought they would even care I was gone minus losing a military asset to the village. However despite their treatment of me they aren\u2019t bad people so they shouldn\u2019t be jailed and at this point I really only care what you, Luffy, and the rest of the crew think of me. Between the wanted posters and rumor they couldn\u2019t really do any harm if they spread around that I am whatever they say I am. Not to mention that the dragon secret is already out so it isn\u2019t like they are going to persuade you guys with information.\u201d You thought out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet, if I had to guess they could probably do some nasty damage on a physical level if they were left on their own. From observing jutsu from you I doubt to many would be able to stand against them.\u201d Sanji said as he and the others from the crew joined the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax you\u2019re ok!\u201d said Luffy yelled and jumped on your head, stretching his arms around your snout in a hug. You waited to move until he got off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, Chopper\u2019s medical skills made me as good as new. Just need a little more rest and I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d You said and got a round of bashful words from Chopper as he tried and failed with hiding the emotions he got with such a compliment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course you options were limited as such a large dragon so you went to human but left some of your dragon parts visible like your wings, tail, eyes, and claws. You retracted them when necessary but for the most part you were allowed to walk around in this rare form of relaxation, but only in the palace as the Marines were looking for you and the crew. For now you were in a type of meeting/throne room with the others and the king as you talked about your guests before they were to be brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are they good guys or bad guys?\u201d asked Luffy as he seemed to only understand that part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like I said; their overall presence is good but I have yet to figure out why they are here. It is hard for me to believe that they came all the way here for me and even harder is if they came to apologize. They may be just trying to retrieve me as a military asset and if that is the case the solution is simple, we just leave. They may be ninja but they have no idea how the sea works inside the Grand Line. We have a log post and the best navigator in the world but they are new so we could easily get away.\u201d You said and Nami blushed a little at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, didn\u2019t you say that it was hard to do that Portal Jutsu? What are the chances that they can get back?\u201d Zoro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. It is insanely difficult and takes a long time to perform the portal jutsu and if even one hand sign is off by a fraction than it could backfire and swallow everything in a one mile radius into an unknown realm. The odds that they have developed a way to get back are slim to none. I have just recently perfected a sort of reverse in the portal opening so I could get them home, but it would mean I have to leave as well.\u201d You said with a little bit of sorrow. It was obvious that you liked it here despite wanting to return home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Why do you have to leave to?\u201d Luffy asked as he understood that part but, like the others, he didn\u2019t understand why such an action would require you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I make the portal it will expand and pull everything into it until I enter it. My body is like the key and will open and close the portal. So I would need to walk through it in order to close it. Unfortunately I getting back here isn\u2019t as simple as getting back there.\u201d You explained and saw their confused faces again as you said that part. \u201cThink of the Portal system like a sting tied to your ship while going through the Grand Line. The island in back of you would be easy to find while the island in front would be a guessing game at best. I know it isn\u2019t exactly the same but that is the closest thing I can bring up that might explain it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he helps those ninja to get home he can never return. But if he doesn\u2019t than they are stranded here.\u201d Sanji explained so Luffy understood it. Your wings and tail flexed and cycled as you thought about this more deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, from what your fellow crew have told me about them and what they did to you it would be well within your right to leave them here. I can help you as a returned favor for saving my Vivi.\u201d The king offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the offer but it would do little good. The way it is, they are ninja and probably could easily escape from any binds you could hold them in. They aren\u2019t at my level but they are by no means lightweights. I don\u2019t want to cause your kingdom any further trouble. Plus if they are highly influential people in the other realm it would be like taking you or Luffy from this one. For all my blabbering on the wrong they did to me it would be hypocritical to do the same to them. I think that if they are people I know well and they are here for a good reason then perhaps I should take them home. If they are here for bad reasons at all then I will help you confine them so they are unable to get out in a timely manner.\u201d You advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to be leaving?\u201d Luffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see, I don\u2019t want to but if you or some of the other crew were in their position and unable to be King of the Pirates, wouldn\u2019t you like to return. So I have to at least be ready if that is the case.\u201d You answered and with the little reference to the King of the Pirates in there he understood. As the rest came around the King ordered them brought in. The door opened and in walked\u2026  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were slightly shocked at who came through and also saddened at the sight as well. There was only one person in the group that you didn\u2019t really know that well and that was a white skinned kid with a plastered smile on his face. But with the other three there and the looks they gave you it looked like you were going to have to leave this realm. They had been stripped of all ninja tools as well as had their hands bound. Kakashi had his headband and mask still on but the rest were limited to their normal clothes, minus any weapons or armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that the issue with the civil war is done and Max has fully recovered we can now address this issue. Before you speak know that is boy has done a lot for my country and the people of this world in general for me to simply allow you diminish his name in anyway. Despite him being one of the most heavily wanted pirates in this world he is a good person and we are not here to debate that.\u201d The king started in a formal manner and you felt good that someone was sticking up for you like that. But your fully showing dragon eyes were locked on the ninja and you noticed that they had already freed themselves of their bindings but kept their positions like good ninja would. You could also see that each of them were a great deal stronger now than before and Naruto had more control or he would\u2019ve bursted into the King\u2019s talk halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe understand, we are not here to cause trouble.\u201d Said Kakashi with a slight bow of respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to take Max away or what?\u201d Luffy Blurted out as the possibility was weighing heavily on his mind. While you weren\u2019t the captain you were a large part of his crew, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No we don\u2019t want to take him by force or anything. Although we thought he would be hiding out somewhere so we were going to invite him back. But now that he appears to have friends here we can\u2019t simply tell him to come with us.\u201d Sakura responded as she defended their morality more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet you force my hand.\u201d You said as you rubbed your head as if nursing a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t forcing you to do anything.\u201d Naruto contradicted as he didn\u2019t understand what you were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. It took me the entire time from when I got here to now, minus the time it took to do other activities, to develop the portal jutsu so I can gain at least a little control over it. I can now go forward as well as back. They way you have mastered it is probably the default one and it can only go forward. So I need to open a portal if you intend on returning which means I need to come with to close the portal. Unfortunately that means I can\u2019t return to this realm after I send you all home.\u201d You explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that bad in our realm?\u201d asked the new person to which you looked at him than at Kakashi as if asking for his name than back at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Sai. To put a long story short he is taking Sasuke\u2019s spot on the team.\u201d Kakashi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then Sai then my answer is yes. Here I have a close group of people who accept me and trust in me like family. I don\u2019t care that other people are afraid of me or labeling me a some vicious man eater here because they are ok with it and I just chill with them most of the time. Back on your realm I am on the opposite side of that spectrum. I am feared, distrusted, shunned, and well over a dozen other descriptions that I would rather not be affiliated with. Despite any effort on my part I will still be considered like that. Odds are that after I return I would just open another portal and return to my home realm. After all it would be easier to return to this realm from there rather from your realm. In the end I have more pull to stay as far away from you all for me to even consider it. On top of all that, I\u2019m not even considered a person in the Leaf Village, just a weapon or piece of property to do with as you please. You tell me if the realm is really \u2018that bad\u2019.\u201d You said then calmed down and took a breath from the little bit of urgency you used throughout the small speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, couldn\u2019t you teach the portal jutsu thing to them and they do it?\u201d asked Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it is a jutsu I developed around my specific style of chakra. It would take years to research a way to let them use it and even then they would require an insane amount of Chakra to pull it off, and that is if they don\u2019t miss even a single hand sign. The way it is now I haven\u2019t tested it yet so it is a little iffy.\u201d You answered in a more calmed tone than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Luffy said then ran out of the room. \u201cUsopp!\u201d he yelled and the long nosed pirate went in after him. You heard some noise and the beginning of a mess only Luffy could make than after a rather long and uncomfortable silence he called the others in there as well, except you. Then they all came out and luffy was holding a black, rolled up, piece of cloth. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d he said with a huge smile like he did when he was giving something special to someone. He unrolled it so all could see it. On one side was the mark of the Strawhat Pirates, and by default your mark. On the other side was a small but detailed picture of each of them, mostly accurate except Usopp made himself in a more confident pose than he was known for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor me?\u201d you asked as if unsure what they were implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it looks like you\u2019re going to be leaving so Luffy had Usopp paint this so you can always remember us.\u201d Nami said with a similar smile to which you laughed and they looked at you as if you were making fun of their gift. Kakashi and the others stood silent as they were glad that the hostility was not on them for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like great minds think alike.\u201d You said as you patted a chest that you had brought in with you and had previously told them that you would explain it later. They walked over and gave you the flag to which you graciously excepted it then opened the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst up is for Luffy. I know your problem with swimming is a hassle to deal with so these are for you.\u201d you said and gave him some new sandals. \u201cThey allow you to walk on water like I do.\u201d You said which got his eyes to sparkle as he did when you showed him a new trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext is for you Zoro. I know that sword is special to you so I got you two others that I made personally.\u201d You said and gave them to him. He opened them and looked at with a curious look as he checked out that the blades were different colors; one completely black and the other blood red. \u201cThe Black one was made with my dragon scales and bones so it is not only the strongest material around it also has most of my abilities in it, I wanted it to surpass Mihawk\u2019s blade but in its own way. The second is made from by spikes and tinted with my blood. It is fashioned as the sharpest sword in the world and can easily cut through another sword without losing any durability. I call the black on dragon scales and that one Dragon\u2019s Blood, you can name them differently later if you wish.\u201d You explained and he looked in awed silence as you continued on to the next person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNami, I notice that you love your maps but two things bother you. One is that you lack the fighting prowess of the others and that they are always losing or breaking your stuff. So I give you this.\u201d you said as you gave her a pen. She looked at it then clicked it once to see a pen tip come out but them pushed it further in and a edged pole came out but the blade that she now held wasn\u2019t cutting her. She pressed the edge of it like a pen and it went back to the pen it was originally. \u201cI made that pen with a few enchantments. The first is that it will always appear in your hand when you need it no matter where it is or where you are. The second is that it will never run out of ink or break unless you plan on cutting it with Zoro\u2019s new swords but even they will need a few strikes to get through. Next is the blade will never cut you and because of the other enchantments your grip is never compromised. Looks like you already figured out how it turns into a bladed pole and because it will never cut you but it will cute everyone else they can\u2019t use it against you unless they want to risk cutting of their own hands.\u201d You said and she gazed at the thing, dropping it a few times and having it appear in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsopp. I give you these two things. A bottomless bag and a new slingshot. The bag is pretty easy to figure out and the slingshot is so hard to pull back that Luffy would barely be able to get it an inch, so it is pretty strong. However I made it so you can do it effortlessly. It also auto loads anything that you have previously programmed into it. I\u2019ll let you figure that partout as well.\u201d you said and he took them like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSanji I give you this multi tool. Like Nami\u2019s it will always appear in your hand when you need it and it is hard to break. However this one will change to what you need as long as it is within reason as well as self clean in a fraction of a second. So you can literally go from slicing a fish up to gutting a pig to digging a hole and back to scooping a soup with it and it will clean and change to suit what you need. \u201c you said as you gave him his gift and he tried and successfully changed it a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLastly, Chopper. This is for you.\u201d you said and gave him something that looked like a pan. \u201cIt is a multi display tool that, like theirs, will come to you whenever you need and is really hard to break. You can access any recipe you store in it or look into a patient to see what\u2019s the matter. I\u2019ll let you play with it so you can see all the cool little features you can explore.\u201d You said and his eyes sparkled at this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will take me just under an hour but I have to concentrate on it so I\u2019ll be putting up a barrier just to be safe.\u201d You requested and with the King\u2019s order some of the guards went to do as you inquired. You left the others to look at their gifts while sticking your on your back so you didn\u2019t forget it. Then you formed a barrier and started to make the portal. Good thing you used Jutsu on a normal basis or this would\u2019ve been really difficult. You lose all sense on what was going on around you as you completed your task but when the final hand sign was done a black hole opened. You took a few breaths and eased your muscles before putting a barrier that only allow the ninja and you to cross, you didn\u2019t need one of them to fall in accidently and get stranded with no way back, and with that done you deactivated the barrier around the area to address the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the portal you spoke of.\u201d Zoro said as he looked at the shimmering black hole as it flexed and waited to be filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this will take us back to their realm. I would ask if you guys wanted to come with but you would stranded there and away from any hope of your individual dreams.\u201d You replied then after another round of goodbyes followed the others through the portal and waved once more before it closed, leaving them with a smile. However inside you were not very happy about leaving. And you really didn\u2019t like the sight you saw when you came out of the portal. You had a good number of ninja around you and all ready to fight, weapons pointed at you. It wasn\u2019t the whole village by any means but a large section of the military force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this but the Hokage wanted to see you as soon as you got back. They weren\u2019t sure exactly how good of mood you would be in when you returned so they prepared for the worst.\u201d Kakashi said as he and the rest of the team were the only ones not pointing some kind of weapon at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind of guessed this anyway. I guess I should go see her if I\u2019m passing through.\u201d You said and followed him through the village. The encirclement that was there accompanied you on your way and maintained a presence even inside the building as you went to Tsunade\u2019s office. They all had those eyes that they used to use on you before you left. Although since you weren\u2019t planning on staying long you didn\u2019t really care at this point. They opened the door for you and followed you in where the two elders were standing with Donzo and Lady Tsunade behind her desk. You walked to a more central position in which most guests stood then stopped, waiting for them to continue. It was clear through your still showing dragon parts, the movement of your tail, the flexing of your wings and the glaring of your glowing eyes that as much as they were on edge you were also ready to defend yourself if necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you decided to come back.\u201d Said Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because I had little choice in the matter. For whatever reason you sent them after me and risked the portal jutsu they were stuck unless I opened a portal back as it is different than the one you all learned. Yet again I am ripped from a life of acceptance and plunged into\u2026 this one.\u201d You said with the last designation as if you were spitting something foul from your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, this is where you belong. We have many tasks that have piled up in your absence. You will be\u2026\u201d started one of the elders as she was clearly trying to regain control over it but you nipped that in the butt right away as you didn\u2019t even let her finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Leaving for home as soon as possible. I have no intention on staying and doing anything you have for me to do. Do not mistake my complacency in retaliation as submission. I am being civil for two main reasons. The first is that I owe that much for this realm teaching the way of the ninja to me. Regardless on how I feel about the rest of you the skills and jutsu come in handy. The second is that there are still a few people here I respect even if I don\u2019t trust them. They have earned it and to top that point off it is in my nature to reward such respect with action.\u201d You declared with a slight growl on your tongue but it disappeared when you gave Kakashi, Sakura, and Naruto a nod as you designated the people you respected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a Leaf Village Ninja, which means that you receive orders from the Leaf Village. Or have you forgotten that is what a ninja does?\u201d asked Donzo in a way that felt like he was trying to gain control over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I remember alright. And I do believe it was you that resigned my status as a ninja and named me a mere possession of the Leaf Village. I am neither at this point and I will not be controlled by you, ever.\u201d You said with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you wait just a minute \u2026\u201d said the other elder before you made a quick hand motion that paralyzed the three that were trying to lay claim to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence! I will hear no more of this. I came as a favor to Kakashi fully aware that you would try to secure my cooperation but even I thought you would go about it in a more linguistic manner. Now that I have answered your question on wither I will serve you or not I will ask my question. Where is Sarah?\u201d you asked which got a fearful face on those that could still move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is an easy enough question but I will explain it further. I am going back home to my realm and although she is also been part of this world I feel obligated to seek her out and offer her a chance to return home as well. I am also curious to see if she has worked over your mind tampering yet. So I will ask again. WHERE IS SARAH?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Tsunade started but then collected her thoughts. For whatever reason she was stuttering and you hoped it wasn\u2019t bad news on the Sarah topic. \u201cWhen you left we had a lot of catching up to do. Initially it was only the loss of an asset, as you have said. However a while after that we began receiving intel on Orochimaru as well as his activities. Sasuke\u2019s name kept popping up and originally we had thought you ate him and were blinded by arrogance in that fact. We were reluctant to believe that we were at fault but part of us searched anyway in case it was some kind of new threat. That is when Naruto and more than a few others ran into him and saw for themselves that he was still alive. Of course Naruto and Sakura always believed he was ok but that one instance hit the rest of us pretty hard, Sarah most of all. She began having flashbacks of the memories we covered. Eventually we cleaned the cover off so she could see her past clearly.\u201d Lady Tsunade said than stopped as she looked down at her desk and looking passed it as if remembering her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must understand.\u201d Kakashi started and you looked over to him as he explained while Tsunade gathered he next thoughts. \u201cSarah was very skilled and well beyond most of us at that point. She had reached the level of Jounin shortly after you left and didn\u2019t slow in her progression. She, like you, was someone we counted on as almost a trump card. But when she learned what we did to you and what she did she grew angry and didn\u2019t take it too well. Some say it was a miracle that we didn\u2019t lose anyone during the ordeal as she was on a raged path, but I say that even in her state she was still aware enough to avoid casualties.\u201d Kakashi finished as he saw Tsunade was ready to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to make me ask a third time?\u201d you asked as you were getting tired of their sidestepping in this issue. You had let go of the elders but still kept a grip on their ability to speak. They seemed to get the hint and just stood there instead of making a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter she went on her rampage she barricaded herself in the forest of death and kills almost anyone that we send in after her. He last message to us was that she would stay in your former home and not let anyone touch it. Beyond that, well you know full well that place is dangerous. We don\u2019t know her current location or if she is even alive. But as of 6 months ago and one dead Anbu later we suspect she still is in there.\u201d She answered to which you looked out the window in the direction of the forest of death. Your eyes followed a few heat signatures but even for you, at this distance it was too far to judge them more than just life signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I won\u2019t have to convince her that much to get her to leave then.\u201d You said as you thought about it and what you should do. \u201cI had half expected that I was going to have to refurbish her memory by myself and that she would be more partial to this realm as she had lived in it for such a long time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still planning on leaving?\u201d Asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I have no reason to stay. Originally I stayed because I thought I had no choice. As I grew in the village I grew some respect for certain people and even grew to care for them. I even thought that it was ok to just live instead of holding back all the time. To put my hope and trust solely in this realm and just stay here. But that is far from what the reality was and I learned that the hard way. The moment I let down my guard completely I was reminded why I had it up in the first place. As I said before; this place was and still is my own personal hell, why wouldn\u2019t I want to leave?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said you respected us.\u201d Said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRespect because I know some of you are actually not half bad and underneath it all you are decent people to a point. But I am far from believing that you people will ever change. If you want to put a picture on it that think of it this way. If Orochimaru kills Sasuke in front of you just for the fun of it and to see the look on your faces. If you are able to completely forgive him regardless if you think he is going to change than it will be near what you are asking me to do for you people. At least on my home realm people treat me the same no matter what. It is much better than getting stabbed in the back. Now I have lingered here on this subject long enough. After I give Sarah the option of returning with me I will make my decision on wither I am leaving or not.\u201d You said then, as they figured they didn\u2019t have any other options, they let you go but as before they sent a large escort with you as you walked to the Forest of Death. To you that just solidified their relation to you as you made your way to the one person you might still like in this realm. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprisingly you entered into the Forest of Death without incident, probably because you had half the village escorting you and no one would go in the Forest of Death. You entered and immediately saw some traps and easily avoided them. Some you saw people in them and you noticed that the ones that were more successful were the ones that combined ninja tactics with what you taught her way back when you taught her how to hunt. You were following her scent as you could see her at this point but now that you purposefully set off one of her alarms you walked around the forest, waiting for her to show herself. With two Kunai thrown at you and lodged in a tree you stopped for her to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis trick again. Preying on my weakness for him won\u2019t work a second time.\u201d Said a feminine voice you knew to be Sarah\u2019s. It had been a while but you still recognized her voice and tracked her scent without moving, once you walked to a little more open area but still covered with trees so you and her could move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they tried that as well. Not surprising I guess as they do seem to use trust more as a weapon than an asset.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, you even sound like him to. But that just means you are a more skilled ninja than the last one.\u201d She said as she moved her position to prevent normal people in your position from detecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I solve this little debate you are having right now.\u201d You said then transformed with an explosion that made her loose her footing and fall but smack onto your snout. She tested the what she landed on before looking at it. She knew the feel of your scales very well, even if it had been a long time. You brought your head down as you laid down then with a flip of your snout you threw her just enough so she could land on her feet in front of you. Like you her body was now trained to catch its self when in a like position. She slowly turned around as if in partial shock until she was standing, quivering at the sight of you. Not a fearful quiver, or perhaps it was but not like normal people. She was not afraid of you as a dragon but as a person. She probably had a great deal of guilt from all the things she helped do to you. Even you flickering her off your snout was a huge difference. You used to just let her lay there as long as she wanted. For you to remove yourself from her touch was a hurtful experience for her. \u201cHello Sarah.\u201d You finally said which seemed to push her over the edge and she just fell over. You were sure you had something to do with it but she also looked really exhausted as if she hadn\u2019t gotten a good night sleep in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou transformed into a human again then took her to a cave and after starting a fire and getting something to eat you sealed the entrance with a boulder and just watched her. You had thought that perhaps the long time and bad memories would\u2019ve dulled her effect on you. However her scent still had the same calming and pleasant effect that in once had. After about a day she started to squirm and move around. It wasn\u2019t until she got her bearings did she realize she might be in danger. To be fair if she was with anyone else she would be so you didn\u2019t take offense to it as she looked around then her eyes fell on you as you stared back at her. You didn\u2019t bother hiding your draconic features and there was no point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax? Is it really you? I mean this isn\u2019t a dream or a trick or something?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan anyone else turn into a Dark Hunter King and back to human? I\u2019d hate to have another like me out there. I got an image to maintain you know.\u201d You answered and she dropped the Kunai she had armed herself with at your confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you left\u2026 you said this place was hell for you. Why would you come back here?\u201d she asked as she didn\u2019t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my choice to return. I bet they didn\u2019t even tell you they were going to go and get me for some reason of another. Anyway they arrived in the realm I was in but couldn\u2019t get back so I had to use the research I had done into the Portal Jutsu to bring them back. Although I can never go back to that realm. A pity, that realm was full of amazing people and a lot of good friends.\u201d You explained and she just took a seat against the opposing wall from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with me after all that. You said it yourself, we are your own personal demons.\u201d She said as she looked down into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is only one person in this whole realm that I want anything to do with and I\u2019m looking at her.\u201d you responded and head bolted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? After what I did to you? How many times did I bring you down? How many times did I set one of those bombs off just for the fun of it? Why would you want anything to do with me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters you only did that stuff after the messed with your mind. I\u2019ve always admired your ability to act on what you felt was right. That has not changed. Second, you\u2019re family aren\u2019t you?\u201d you said and after that point she flung herself from her position straight at you, hugged you around the waist and buried her head in your chest, her legs curled away from the fire and into your lap. \u201cThat and Kara will kick my ass if I go back without you.\u201d you joked after you let her cry and snug up so you were holding her more properly. She chuckled for a moment and hit your chest as a return for your joke. But then it stopped and she looked up at you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was going to wait until you had some breakfast but I guess there is no point in hiding it. Your smart ass would just figure it out anyway. I was able to return to this realm because I found out how to go in a reverse order in the portal jutsu. So in short\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can go home!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m going so if you want out of this place than this is your shot. I\u2019ll understand if you wish to stay, well not really but I\u2019ll support your decision. They are probably going to try everything short of releasing the nine tails to stop us from going.\u201d You said and she turned her head into you again then hugged you tighter and you could feel her fists turn into tight balls and could even smell a little blood from her squeezing them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them rot in this hell of theirs. I don\u2019t give a dam.\u201d She said and you were going to get started but she just held you. \u201cJust a little longer. I just want to hold you here for a while, if that\u2019s ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake as much time as you need. I\u2019m not going anywhere without you.\u201d you responded as you held her back and stroked her a little. Not that much but enough for her to feel your warm skin on hers. So you stayed like as you pondered how you were going to do this and if they would try to stop you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah placed enough traps to stall them for a time. Then you set up a barrier that surrounded the two of you in case they arrived before you were done forming the reverse portal to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to tell you just how dangerous this jutsu is. I wasn\u2019t exaggerating when I said it could wipe out everyone for miles. I need my full attention so I will be solely concentrated on forming it. I need you to act as a buffer so I am not interrupted. The barrier should hold them like before but if not I can\u2019t stop or make the slightest mistake.\u201d You said to Sarah and she nodded as she accepted the assignment you gave her. This would be the first thing you trusted her with since you taking her back and she wasn\u2019t going to mess it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began your work and as such you were completely engrossed in the work for a little less than you did before. You had gotten better at performing the jutsu and it showed. After you stopped and bent over to catch your breath Sarah came forward and almost touched the portal as she tried to come around and make sure you were ok. You quickly grabbed her and took a few steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as she was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Portal is touchy. It needs time to stabilize. All it takes is a touch for you to go through it. As it is now you would\u2019ve been sucked away to an unknown realm with no way for me to know which one you went to.\u201d You said and she looked at the portal then back at you and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d said a voice now that you allowed the soothing sound of the jungle to come through the barrier but not weaken its field to any degree. You both looked over at a group of people that had gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have they been here?\u201d you asked her as you both gazed over at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been banging on the barrier a little after half the time you were doing your thing. So selfish, it looks as if they want you to stay.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dare talk to us about being selfish? You are leaving just when we need Max the most.\u201d Tsunade accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you need me?\u201d you asked and she was about to answer but it looks like she was biting her tongue as she had very little control of what you did at this point. \u201cI am guessing it has something to do with a great power that you need my power to fight against to give you a better chance. Maybe you misunderstand yet again. I am not a weapon or a tool or whatever you think I am. You make the same mistakes over and over again and in all the time I\u2019ve been gone among people\u2026 well not like you, none of you have changed. There is only one person in this entire realm other than Sarah that I find to have a slight glimmer of light in this dark and hellish place. Sad thing is, most try to snuff it out or at the very least try to cover it. Even him you treat as a weapon. However, unlike him I don\u2019t have to suffer it. I have two other realms that are as in \u2018need\u2019 of me as you are. One I can\u2019t go to because of your medaling and the only other is my home, where I actually belong.\u201d You answered back to which some of them glared at you and others looked either at Naruto or down as what you said hit them a little harder than what they were ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is right.\u201d Sarah said as she separated from you and went over to stand in front of Naruto. \u201cYou are the only light in this place. The only one that I might actually miss about this place. But don\u2019t keep all that light hidden inside. Share it with the rest of them. You\u2019re going to make one hell of a Hokage.\u201d She finished then went back and waited by the now stabile portal. You now walked over to Naruto as he stood shocked as he was once again the last one to realize something cryptic you said. To this Kakashi and Sakura moved up to join him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, you respect us but you believe in him.\u201d Kakashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t stand you or thought you were evil I would\u2019ve left you in the other realm and helped them bind you there. I have always known that despite your actions toward me you three are\u2026 well my team and as far as I\u2019m concerned the three most respectable ninja I have encountered.\u201d You said than pulled a single Shuriken out of a pocket and held it up to Naruto on your side of the barrier. As you suspected, only the three in front of you knew you well enough to know it wasn\u2019t an attack. \u201cDo you remember this Naruto?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that\u2026 the shuriken I threw when you trained me?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is. Do you want to know why I kept it?\u201d you asked and he seemed to not understand himself. It didn\u2019t look different than any other shuriken he had thrown over the years. \u201cBecause what I said back then still applies today. I know you can do it.\u201d You said then pushed it through the barrier and dropped it in his hand. \u201cNow you need to see it. When I look at you I don\u2019t see a nine tailed fox, or a weapon, or a stupid little brat. I see Naruto and the only and brightest light in this realm. Even the smallest or largest of shadows can be illuminated by the light. So shine brightly.\u201d You said as a last comment as he stood shocked with the shuriken in his hand while you bowed to the three then walked over to Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d Kakashi said and you two turned your heads to see him. \u201cI know that your world is not an easy one so\u2026 good luck.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026 Kakashi Sensei.\u201d You said than you and Sarah went through the portal, not sure what you were stepping into but as the portal closed behind you there was no going back, and neither of you wanted to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The structures were well known as they had been in your mind as a goal to return to. However they were burning and in ruin. As if the people had just lived through a war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn I hate that smell.\u201d You said as you both continued to walk in order to find someone that could explain what you two were seeing. It was morning and by the time you got to the top of the hill that overlooked the city you were both catching your breath. The entire city was destroyed and it was obvious through many signs that no human was to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t even smell like you and I agree. There is only one thing that could do this. Correction there is only one thing that WOULD do this.\u201d She said and you rumbled a growl as an affirmative but it was trumped by a crash of weight and the rush of knights as they surrounded you. \u201cThey must have used the underground sewers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you turn around. Do you want to tell me why I shouldn\u2019t have my very hungry friend to hold her urge to feast?\u201d Asked a very recognizable voice, of Sir Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am afraid she would not find me that easy to catch.\u201d You said as you slowly turned with Sarah and looked up at Kara as she growled at you. \u201cKara, you\u2019re all grown up but your scent is still the same.\u201d You addressed her to which she just snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnowing her name is not a sign that we know you. Many are aware of her as one of the only dragons capable of defeating a Dark Hunter. We have dealt with more than our fair share of slayers and my instinct sais that you are one.\u201d He stated which caused all the knights and soldiers to further point their weapons at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was named after a very successful dragon slayer and I have killed more dragons than anyone alive probably ever will. I am trying to jog your memory but it seems only a practical approach will suffice.\u201d You said and Sarah just smiled as you grew wings, a tail, and let your eyes go. Your eyes themselves were always a dead giveaway but even if they weren\u2019t there was only one able to do what you did and you were well known. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d You asked to a stunned crowd of people and even Kara\u2019s snarling and growling came to an end to make a completely silent space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this can\u2019t be good. Sir Nick is never speechless unless he is either really shocked or really angry.\u201d Sarah said to you but loud enough to snap them out of the haze they were in. \u201cMax, I am not really feeling that we came at the best time.\u201d She finished as the eyes that now looked at you ranged from overjoyed to betrayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you really are the real Max than you\u2019re late.\u201d Said a boy that came from behind Kara\u2019s neck to which she lowered for him to jump off and stand with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell seeing as we weren\u2019t expected to come back at all I thought we made good time. Although judging on the sight of this city I\u2019m guessing that you all had a hard time.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, please go back down. I need a word with our returning half breed.\u201d Nick commanded and with some reluctance they all did so except Kara and the strange boy that she was with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Nick, Kara; what happened here?\u201d Sarah asked and Kara just turned her head away from your glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDark hunters happened. They had been tracking our little half breed here but were too afraid to do anything after the mountain of bodies they had lost in their attempts. After Max joined us the word spread quickly that a Dark Hunter was at our disposal. However when the word spread that he was the half breed and that we had sent him through the portal instead of killing him. There was hell to pay. An emissary of the Dark Hunters came and demanded Lord Hizer\u2019s head in exchange for his actions to help him. We naturally refused and even after Kara barely defended us against a few smaller Dark Hunters they decided that our fair city was to be made example of. So last night they came in force and wiped out the entire city and before we could stop him Lord Hizer attempted to quell the slaughter by surrendering himself to them. Their leader and your mother gutted him and continued anyway.\u201d He concluded as you left Sarah\u2019s side and started walking in circles, leaning on the rubble than continuing until the last statement was pointed at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever in my wildest dreams did I think that coming back here would be so painful. It was my goal and my reward for enduring what happened in the realms I went to.\u201d You said as you stopped at the ruins of a wall, playing with the fire that still burned on the top before putting it out. \u201cBut I find that it is not better than the hell I left.\u201d You said and with a twitch of a finger the low wall exploded into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you need to calm down.\u201d Sarah said as she approached but you turned to them again and she was stopped by your eyes. She had seen you in a bloodlust before, more specifically when a dragon was near or the worse one was when one was attacking her. But she nor did the others ever see you eyes so dark and yet so bright. As if your eyes were the window to hell and you were about to send someone there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this time Sarah. I\u2019ve lived with this ghost long enough and it ends now. I will be the last Dark hunter to ever plague this world. If they wanted me than I was fine with it. But nowhere is safe if they are willing to go this far just to please\u2026her.\u201d You stated as an aura of flames seemed to lace around you as if it was the physical manifestation of your mental state. It was all hazing over for you at this point and you didn\u2019t think it was going to stop, worse, you didn\u2019t want it to stop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo Max, no\u201d said Sarah as she grabbed on to you and pressed her face into yours. \u201cNot like this.\u201d She said calmly but with purpose. She knew she was the only one to reach you like this and she did so well. In such close proximity, her scent soothed you and brought you back from any bloodlust. \u201cDo it if you must but only when you have control or it won\u2019t be you.\u201d she said and you just nodded to which she backed away. \u201cPlus, you should help them with their living situation.\u201d She advised and you saw what she meant. The sewer wasn\u2019t any way to live if you could do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded again than went to look over the town. You had learned a few types of jutsu that helped in building such as stone and wood styles, along with a few others. You made a few hand signs, ok more than a few, then when you had accounted for everything you could remember about the place you truck the ground as the final motion. This caused the ground to rumble and in seconds wood and stone began shooting up from the ground and remade the city like it was never attacked, minus the people. You were still receiving some very unappealing looks so you decided that it was probably better if you took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, let\u2019s give them some space. Looks like they need it more than us right now.\u201d You said as you held out your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Max, nothing like what we dreamed.\u201d She said as she took your hand and with a sudden motion you picked her up and took into the air. \u201cWhat if they come back?\u201d she asked as you flew. It didn\u2019t take you long to reach a high cliff that overlooked the city that now had no name. It was a spot you made when you thought Lord Hizer would kick you out. It was a place that only dragons could get to as it took wings to do so. You had hollowed out a cave like your other one and a platform where you and a few other dragons could watch over the city. The concept was to eventually train young dragons, perhaps Kara\u2019s kids, here so they could see what they were protecting. But now it just served as a perfect lookout spot for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen they will die. You may have stopped me from wiping them out Sarah but don\u2019t stop me from that.\u201d You said as you looked at the city with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as it is you that is doing it. You know you lose all sense of self when you get like that. If you want to do it than do it but promise me you will remain in control.\u201d She almost commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine I promise that any Dark Hunter I kill will be on a clear head.\u201d You relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeyond that I\u2019d say you better not waste the meat. Living up here will be no picnic and it will be tuff to secure food.\u201d She said and in her own way she was supporting your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are ninja. I doubt we will have that much trouble. But yeah, it has been a while since I\u2019ve had dragon meat. For now I think it is high time I let the neighborhood know who\u2019s back.\u201d You said and she got some distance while you burst into dragon form again. She then came back and stood just in front of you so she could see over the edge as if on top of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure they can hear it. If you\u2019re going to do something then at least do it all the way.\u201d She almost commanded then used a combination of a barrier jutsu, healing jutsu, and her fingers to plug her ears so you could do your thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you took a deep breath then let out the loudest and most ferocious roar you could, drawing from the pent up anger of seeing what your kind did to the city you once called home. You wanted to make sure SHE heard it and you had no doubt, by the time you were done, that she did. With that little exertion out of your system you laid down so Sarah could lean against you as she looked out on things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know something Max. I have no idea what your mother is like. But they have no idea what they are walking into.\u201d She said as you were thinking the same thing. After all a dragon that has all the abilities as a ninja, including jutsu, was something this realm had never seen before. They were shaking in their skin when you were just a normal scared kid. Now that you were highly trained and skilled in battle, both as a ninja and as a dragon. She was right, they had no idea what they were walking or more accurately flying into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll clear it up for them when they come.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and don\u2019t worry about them coming after me. If they are stupid enough to try than I\u2019ll keep them entertained until you decide to show up. Might even take things into my own hands.\u201d She said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you for a second but what are you talking about?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never told you this before but no matter how close we got I was always afraid. Not of you but of dragons in general, has to do with that whole dragon sacrifice thing. Well got sick and tired of being afraid of a dragons inside so I took your example and made a few tricks that makes me a real pain to swallow. Stuff like reversing stomach lining so a dragon\u2019s acid eats through their own stomach, or this little thing.\u201d She said and held up a small knife that she pulled from who knows where. She hit a switch of sorts and it opened up from both ends and you immediately saw its function. With the force it had along with the thin and sharp blades that protruded it would even puncture your neck and you didn\u2019t think it would feel any better anywhere on the inside of anyone. Potentially she could use it in a dragons throat to cut off its head or in its mouth to send on end into the dragon\u2019s brain. Or even hollow out a dragons insides from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I pity the pore soul that thinks you\u2019re and easy meal.\u201d You said with a smile and a little lick to which she blushed for some reason but it might have been because of your compliment and your lack of reaction that she was previously afraid of you all that time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A year goes by and there was still just you and Sarah. After your declaration to the surrounding area there was only one Dark Hunter that came to check out the suddenly rebuilt city. However he didn\u2019t get within a mile of the city before you grabbed him and meal for you and Sarah for the following month. It was like that for most of the time. You and Sarah practiced riding together as well as individual skills for fighting both humans and dragons. She even came with you and was able to take down a few dragons before you ate them. You also helped her with devising ways to slay dragons that she hadn\u2019t thought of yet. However, even if she ended up in your mouth during training, you promptly spat her back out. You had a now permanent bias against eating or even pretending to eat anyone that was on your side and especially friends and family. This saddened Sarah as your storage sack was an excellent healing source when she was injured but it was not used at all. No matter what she did she couldn\u2019t get you over that instant emotional drain when the topic was brought up in conversation. She even tried to force herself down your throat. But since your body hadn\u2019t used the storage sack in so long she went into the digestion one. The experience wasn\u2019t pleasant for either of you and she promised she wouldn\u2019t do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, can I come in?\u201d asked Kara. It had taken her a year but she had finally came up to speak with you. You had seen her flying with that boy very often but this was the first time she came by. You answered by joining Sarah in the cave while she cooked her meal. You heard her land behind you and after a little hesitation and a slight argument with the boy she carried she followed you into the cave. More accurately you were already laying down against the far wall and watching Sarah cook as you both waited for them to present themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you finally came up to see us.\u201d Sarah said as you just stayed still and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve just as easily came down.\u201d The young boy accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently you\u2019ve never been shot at by those nice installments you have on the walls around the city. They aren\u2019t fun and a pain in the ass to take out, sometimes literally.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think we would attack you?\u201d Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we didn\u2019t exactly get the warmest welcome when we got back. We weren\u2019t sure what your stance was after that little incident but even if you were ok with having us around the others obviously wouldn\u2019t share your feelings on the matter. As Jake said, it isn\u2019t fun getting shot at.\u201d Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you living up here?\u201d asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell just leaving doesn\u2019t mean the city won\u2019t get attacked. I wasn\u2019t here to defend it the last time but from here I can see pretty far and tell if something is coming.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to stay up here?\u201d asked Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot a better idea?\u201d Sarah answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can stay at the castle like before.\u201d Kara said but it was unintentionally aimed more at Sarah than you, which Sarah caught on to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just suggested that I leave Max. He\u2019s the only family I got left. Why do you hate him so much. All he could think about when were out there was getting back here and your face was one he wanted to see. He worked so hard to get back and endured so much pain to do so in a, honorable way. So he could tell his stories and we all be proud of him. Do you have any idea what it felt like to have all his hopes and dreams smashed from the very people he worked so hard to see again?\u201d Sarah almost yelled at her. Most people would think twice to address a dragon in such a manner but not Sarah. She had her ninja training, her dragon slaying techniques, and you at her back. She had long shed her fear of dragons and almost dared any to make the mistake of attacking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dare talk to Kara like that?\u201d The boy said as he instantly defended her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWord of warning boy.\u201d you started to which stopped him in his tracks. \u201cSarah is highly trained to the point where she would have a fair chance at taking me down if it came down to it. That and she has a temper. I wouldn\u2019t provoke her if I were you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Some kind of pirate flag? Pirates are so lame compared to dragon riders. It is probably why they are all dead. It looks silly and doesn\u2019t even match on both sides.\u201d The boy said as he went on to yet another hot topic. The insult to the flag didn\u2019t fall on deaf ears and you let him know with an ominous and very low growl that shook the ground but was more of a vibration than a sound. However loud enough to cause Kara to snap out of her trance since Sarah\u2019s yelling at her. She realized that her, apparent rider, was quickly hitting all your buttons and even she on her and your best days would stray far away from even one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, is this your rider? If so what is his name?\u201d asked Sarah as she looked almost concerned at the boy. It wasn\u2019t often you growled at someone that was clearly precious to a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy na...\u201d the boy started but was interrupted by Kara nudging him and shushing his argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Darian and yes he is my rider. He is the sole survivor of a village destroyed by dragons. He even tried to kill me with a sword that is still too big for him. He\u2019s a good rider.\u201d She introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you would do well to teach him some manners. As you know, Max is patient but he does have his moments. Your little friend here has insulted a lot of people very close to him in a very short amount of time. I\u2019ve seen him attack for less and I think you have as well, much less. I think the only thing keeping him there is that he is YOUR rider.\u201d She advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, but it is hard to teach manners to someone who has no fear. That was one of the reasons I took him as a rider in the first place. He has a strong moral center and an even stronger heart. But he is so lacking in fear that he does tend to overextend himself.\u201d Kara said as if talking to a child and he winced a little as he knew without looking that she was glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fear, really? Care to test that theory?\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you are the one going too far. Are you really going to use a genjutsu like that on a little kid?\u201d You asked as you knew what she was thinking. She had a genjutsu that she made to scare off dragons. It brought out their innermost fear and had them live it in a sort of imaginary sleep. They were still awake but interaction like a vision or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would prove if he had fear or not.\u201d She retorted as if justifying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would put him in a bed for a week.\u201d You countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, no fear image genjutsu on little Darian. Doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t give him a sound lashing if he pushes any further.\u201d She warned the little kid that was half surprised and half offended. However there was definitely a fear deep in his heart that he didn\u2019t want to admit. He was like Sarah was at his age and if her confession was correct he was scared of dragons just like she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was at that point that a scent hit you. Wither they were far enough away or not there was another perk about your location. Most of the wind brought scents from all areas so you could easily tell when someone was coming or a dragon was in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmells like dinner to me.\u201d You said as you sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, I need to cook mine anyway.\u201d Sarah said to which you got up and started walking towards the door. Kara still wasn\u2019t sure about you so she quickly got out of your way with Darian, far out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for you to find the little dragon as you leapt off the cliff and followed the scent. As you got closer you were amazed at how small the thing was. It was obviously an infant fire dragon with its red scales and another female. It usually made sense that they send females as they were usually bigger and they might\u2019ve figured that you had a soft spot for them as you let Kara live. To you it didn\u2019t matter if they were male, female, white, black, red, large, or small. If a dragon came around your protected area they ended up in your stomach. What was strange about this little one was that she seemed to be looking for you. Usually dragons that came by were hunting for humans so they were looking down. This one was looking around in the air and if anything going higher. However something was nagging at you about this one. It was no bigger than a year old or in lamest terms about the size of a human, that and it was apparently searching for you, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about just diving down on her and swallowing her in one gulp, as she was small enough, but your conscience got in the way. You Still wanted to give it a scare so you dove down and used the clouds for cover and as soon as you were close enough but not visible you started to growl at different directions. This caused the little one to swing around looking for you and whimpering. Like most dragons at this point, she probably knew what happened to dragons around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mr. Dark Hunter sir? Is that you, I have a message from a human village I stay at. I\u2026\u201d She started in a remarkably composed voice except a few whimpers, despite her fear of her current situation. But that was all she got out before she flew through a cloud that you were passing through and her sight coming out of it was being half trapped in your jaws. You had caught her but with her wings out and sudden move she was able to almost escape. He neck, front left leg, and left wing were outside your teeth while the rest of her were on the inside. \u201cPlease! They need your help!\u201d she said as your jaws were beginning to close. That was the final steak in your decision. She was definitely worried about her current state of being between your tightening teeth but she chose to put the safety of the human village over her desire to beg for her own life. You thought about it for a moment then with a flick you brought her completely inside your mouth, if for no other reason so she wasn\u2019t so awkwardly placed. Didn\u2019t stop you from tasting her though. You licked her around a little and she was whimpering as if she had failed and was about to die. She suddenly went silent when she heard Sarah\u2019s voice when you returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou brought one back? Must\u2019ve been good or you would\u2019ve just swallowed. Let\u2019s see the thing then.\u201d Sarah said as she eyed your jaws and from the second you walked in she knew something was in them, if not the crying from inside then the slightly level state you were keeping your head. You then spat the young dragon out in the corner rather roughly and went back to your spot behind Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn conscience of mine got in the way. She said something about a human village. Didn\u2019t beg for her life once, just for me to help them. Stupid little rat didn\u2019t even tell me where the village was and made me skip dinner.\u201d You explained and almost pouted the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always had a soft spot for humans.\u201d Kara said in an attempt to start a pleasant conversation with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well, what can I say? When someone hates dragons as much as I do the other side looks that much better.\u201d You said back and she seemed to smile that you were talking to here as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk little dragon, tell me the reason why Max missed his dinner.\u201d Sarah said to the recovering dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 my village is in trouble.\u201d She said with the first part rather slow but as she got back on why she was there in the first place she was more animated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re village? Explain.\u201d Sarah said as those words were usually used by dragons when they had possession of a village but enslaving it and being worshiped, and obviously touchy subject for all those in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents were killed by dragon slayers and a farmer found my egg. He raised me since I hatched and that was about 3 years ago. He kept me secret from the rest of the town but when another dragon came and demanded sacrifices he went to the elders and after a little convincing he said that I would be able to contact help. This area is well known to almost everyone for its lack of dragon problems so I went this way to find the half breed that is rumored to be slaying them.\u201d She said but when she said \u2018half breed\u2019 a few growls hit the air and your snout came forward, driving the little red dragon back into wall. You were stopped by Sarah\u2019s hand as was Kara stopped by Darian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like you have their attention. But I would advise you little dragon not to use that phrase when referring to my friend here. Now what is your name?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDibela\u2026\u201d she whimpered and immediately understood Sarah\u2019s warning and advise. She quickly thought back and found that they had started growling when she had referred to him as a half breed. It must have been a soft spot, one that she shouldn\u2019t revisit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Dibela.\u201d Started Kara. \u201cThat is about as friendly Max is going to get with you for the moment. Lucky for you he hates dragons attacking humans more than his usual hatred for dragons. It also probably wouldn\u2019t be wise to keep him waiting. You want to come with?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course, where you go I go.\u201d Darian said as if she should know that by now. She just lowered her neck and he climbed on. Sarah simply jumped on your head and looked down at the rest of them from her perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell little Debela, Max hasn\u2019t eaten in over a week so I would get going if I were you.\u201d Sarah said and as if to add to her words your stomach growled with the smell of this new dragon so close. If you didn\u2019t have the self control you would\u2019ve been drooling. The little red dragon scampered out and took off as soon as she hit the air. You and Kara took off shortly after and followed behind her, very closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d asked Darian after a little while of seeing Sarah still standing on your head and without losing her balance even once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth Max and I have picked up a bunch of new tricks from the realms we went to. This along with training together all the time has made us a pretty good team.\u201d Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet I\u2019ll be able to do that eventually.\u201d Darian boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, but what about this?\u201d Sarah asked as she walked around your head and stood upside down on the underside or your snout. She stood there, again without losing balance or even the slightest strain, then came up to her original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fair.\u201d Was his only comment to which you and Sarah laughed, followed shortly by Kara and eventually Darian.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou got to be kidding me.\u201d Sarah said as the group started towards a very familiar town. It had grown since your last visit but it was unmistakable in that it was Cobalt, her home town and place she didn\u2019t really give a damn about. \u201cMax, if you want to eat this one and leave I\u2019ll have no objections.\u201d This comment almost got Dibela to fall out of the sky but for the sake of what she was trying to do she kept going and hoped the human she barely knew was just kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what is this place?\u201d Darian asked. During the short ride over he had suddenly gained a deep respect and most definitely a crush on Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is her home town little one.\u201d Kara responded as she also recognized the place and remembered Sarah\u2019s stories about it. \u201cI told you about how she was sacrificed and how her family was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, I am rather hungry at the moment and that glutton would do nicely. Sarah, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d You called up and she knew what you were talking about. When you ate\u2026 fresh meat it could get a little messy and this one was rather large so the blood spray would be all over by the time you were done. For now the dragon in question was just laying in the much large sacrificial square and it looked like they were getting ready to feed the thing, and not just with one girl. The space was big enough, just barely for; him, you, and Sarah so landing wouldn\u2019t be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kara, think I can catch a ride while Max does his thing?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Sarah said and with a leap she was able to jump over and land near her neck and swing around until she was standing next to the seated Darian, still not effected by riding in this manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you do it.\u201d Kara said as she began to feel the subtle connection between Sarah\u2019s feet and her neck. It was a pleasant sensation but recognizable. \u201cI got her, you go have a great meal. I\u2019m sure Sarah won\u2019t mind if you make a little mess.\u201d Kara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, bloodstained walls would fit perfectly to that village.\u201d Sarah said a little spiteful but also in complete agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, stay with them and don\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d You commanded the Dibela to which she nodded furiously after hearing what you were all talking about then watched as you dove to your prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call this a feast. You have saggy, oldy, and baldy. I want some that actually looks as good as they taste. Like\u2026 that one.\u201d The dragon on the ground said as he pointed to what must\u2019ve been the leader\u2019s daughter and was and eye catcher, for a human; about 14, black hair with blonde highlights, and a lean athletic figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my daughter!\u201d the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you could always take her place.\u201d the dragon suggested. With a reluctance he motioned for her to be brought forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Daddy, you said you loved me and would never feed me to one of them.\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry dear, but my life comes before yours in this village. You be good and do what he asks and it won\u2019t be that bad.\u201d He responded with a surprisingly small amount of concern for his own daughter. It was such a disgusting attitude you almost contemplated not helping them at all. At the rate the dragon was eating the whole town would be eaten in the next month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be eaten. Someone help me.\u201d She yelled before she screamed as the dragons claw was slowly approaching her. The dragon was having so much fun with it that he failed to realize the shadow you were making before you landed in the square, crushing the sacrificial platform and making indents in the ground. Your head was over the girl and you were snarling in the face of the other dragon. He was to shocked to move at the moment, though he was a large dragon for his breed he was still not even 1/5th your size on top of that you were a Dark Hunter. The girl was also too shocked to even look up at your arrival. You knew that despite her position that she wouldn\u2019t recover from being soaked in this dragon\u2019s blood while watching you devour it. So you wrapped your tail around her and placed her on top of a building but behind a small wall like structure on the ceiling so she was at least a little protected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon finally snapped out of it and moved to escape. But you were too hungry and too angry at this point to allow him to do that. So as soon as his neck was fully exposed you snapped and sunk your teeth in, meanwhile pinning his body with some of your claws and lopping off his tail with yours. The dragon screeched and roared in pain until the blood loss caught up with him and he slowly faded. You had bit his neck in a way that the blood was not only gushing into your mouth but also spraying the entire area like one of the spray guns you saw in the other realms, and by the time the tail and neck stopped the whole square and any people still inside were covered with it. You then began to work and within 10 minutes you had devoured the whole thing. The blood soaked into the ground so it was ok for the others to land and they did so as you finished cleaning yourself of the mess and laid there content with a full stomach. You almost forgot in your current bliss but you reached up and retrieve the girl with your tail and allowed her to run off after you let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d asked Kara as she looked at the blood soaked houses. Dibela also landed but was halfway between mortified and amazed at the sight, as was the rest of the town\u2019s people that were coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, he sure was tasty for such an idiot.\u201d You responded as you licked what remained of your meal on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d Sarah said as she never really understood why you liked the taste so much. She didn\u2019t even like it and she had a pretty broad food preference, bugs and paste included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure made a mess.\u201d Said Darian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like my paint job?\u201d you asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it brings out the town\u2019s pleasantness.\u201d Sarah said in a half joking and half serious tone. The others couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh, except the gathering town\u2019s people and the now absent Dibela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What is your purpose here?\u201d the man that had been cleaned off but still his clothes were now a bloodstained red. He also clearly had a high opinion of himself and with his little attitude to his own daughter he was not your favorite person among the crowd by any means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah?\u201d came a voice from one of the guards. The heads of those around went to him as he took off his helmet and exposed a scared but otherwise halfway attractive looking face. But as you felt Sarah\u2019s heartbeat increase you had a pretty good idea who it was. \u201cIs that you sister?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no family here.\u201d She simply said but if there was one thing, other than her scent, that hadn\u2019t changed it was her voice. It was almost musical yet direct, one of many reasons why she could stop you with a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is definitely you sis. Wow, you look\u2026 great.\u201d He said as he eyed her up in a way that you didn\u2019t like in the least bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You let a small growl rumble through the ground before Sarah was able to express her distaste for his gesture. While it was true that Sarah could turn many heads in a crowd, dragon and human alike, and normally you didn\u2019t care and she thought it was hilarious when they saw her leave with you. But this was different since this man was her brother and had both done and was probably planning to do less than honorable things TO her. But growl was all you did as it would probably be a mercy to eat or kill him, compared to what Sarah would do to him if he tried anything. But the growl was enough for those around to flinch back and look at her and you as she pet the back of your head from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep your eyes to yourself before something bad happens to you.\u201d Sarah warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think you can talk to your older brother like that?\u201d said yet another male voice from a older looking man that stepped next to her brother. From his scent you guessed he was her father but unlike her scent his was almost repulsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer your question Mayor Tate, a little Fire Dragon by the name of Dibela risked her life just to beg that we take care of your previous dragon problem.\u201d Sarah said as she ignored the man and her brother. This was obviously not what they were used to from her, or what the used to know as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that little demon actually made it huh? Got to admit, if I thought it would actually work I wouldn\u2019t have fed that farmer that was raising her to the dragon first.\u201d The Mayor said as if he was talking about the weather. \u201cMaybe I can take over and train that thing into what a dragon should be.\u201d He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, are you going to do something or can we leave? I\u2019m about this close to gutting more than a few of these humans.\u201d Kara growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m done. We should probably go get Dibela though, since she is in the same boat most of us are in now.\u201d Sarah relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d You said as something darted from the crowd and toward you until the little red dragon was out of breath and heaving where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t find him. My father, I can\u2019t find him.\u201d She said as if asking for your help again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it looks like they didn\u2019t have any faith in you so they sacrificed him to the dragon Max just ate.\u201d Sarah said rather unceremoniously. The little dragon stood in shock for a moment. Then looked at you and you could tell what she was going to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was no human remains in its stomach when I sliced it opened. I checked just in case and there was nothing.\u201d You answered then quickly intercepted her before she could lunge at the Mayor for what he did. Her rage didn\u2019t even manifest by the time you had her on her back and looking up at you with her usual scared face. \u201cIf you kill him now you are no better than he is. Do you want your father to be remembered by his dragon daughter that killed the Mayor of a town or one that sent his daughter to save it?\u201d You asked to which she looked at the man than back at you and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the last time Max or I will be helping this village.\u201d Sarah said as she leapt onto you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do you think you are going young lady?\u201d asked the old man that was her blood father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame place I\u2019m going if you\u2019ll take me?\u201d asked the girl that was being sacrificed as well as the Mayor\u2019s daughter. She was standing closer than most even dared to you. You looked at Sarah then Kara as she was helping Darian mount and while you were strapping the exhausted dragon to your back with spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they were about to sacrifice her anyway. If she wants to come then the least we can do is take her to Dragon\u2019s Keep (new name of the city you rebuilt). That and your new\u2026 friend might want a rider.\u201d Kara suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you better tell them at the palace about it anyway so we don\u2019t get in trouble for kidnapping someone. That and I\u2019m not exactly high on their guest list. What\u2019s your name little girl?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandy.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you want out of this place I\u2019m your ride. Darian, make sure she\u2019s strapped in will you?\u201d asked Kara to which Brandy almost jumped on her without hesitation as her father was coming forward to get her but backed at the movement of the two large dragons as you and Kara readied yourselves to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, you will come down here now!\u201d yelled her father as her brother was equally mad but had an image to keep so he was letting his father do the shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the strange old man that used to beat me as a child. I don\u2019t have to suffer your presence any longer you drunken old bully. If you think you can make me than come get me and see where that gets you.\u201d Sarah said to the enraged old man but you and Kara wisely chose to leave before the situation got anymore heated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That and the city is way too crowded\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I understand. But at least if it gets better than you should visit when we aren\u2019t up by you.\u201d she insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d You relented before you both split ways and shortly after you arrived at your cave. \u201cAlright, off you go.\u201d You said as you unlatched the dibela from your back and gave her a little heave that sent her in the air and onto the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d Dibela asked as you and Sarah went inside to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you aren\u2019t doing stuff that would make Max eat you than we don\u2019t really care.\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would make him eat me?\u201d she asked more to you than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating innocent humans or any at all before I can trust you, attacking cities, stealing farm animals, insulting Sarah, or trying to kill anyone I like or tell you to leave alone are some of the big ones.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re scaring her Max.\u201d Sarah said as you chuckled at the fearful dragon. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go sleep and digest some of that dragon you ate while I formally welcome her and teach her the ropes.\u201d She suggested to which you nuzzled her a little then did as she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rather sleepy and a good rest would do your digestion good. Unlike years ago, you didn\u2019t have to worry that your new dragon guest would harm Sarah. So you got comfortable then drifted off to sleep. It wasn\u2019t until the next day when there was someone prodding you awake. The touch was very familiar as Sarah was the only one that could wake you without worrying about any negative drawbacks. You quickly looked around and saw her at her as she was perched on your head and the others, along with including Dibela and the new human girl sitting around the fire as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello in there?\u201d Sarah said as she knocked on the top of your head, a sight that the others were somewhat in awe of. Darian didn\u2019t even think about treating Kara like that and the others were to afraid of you in general to even approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m up.\u201d You said in response then gave a long yawn and stretched a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now since we have a bunch of people and not a lot of extra room at the fire you better switch to human.\u201d she said than leapt off you and took her seat next to an open spot beside her for you. You were still a little tired so you just did as she said and with an explosion you were human and took your seat beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you learn to do that?\u201d asked Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got sick of constantly going through it the long way so in the other realm I developed a\u2026 technique to make it instantaneous. It still hurts like nothing else but at least it is quicker and way less tiring.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are the half\u2026\u201d Darian started but was nudged by Kara in an attempt to stop his progress into the verbal minefield. \u201cSorry, it was a little hard to believe that such a large dragon could become a human. You must be weaker and that while like this, so why do you even bother doing it?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Max doesn\u2019t lose any of his strength when he is human. We have both trained a lot to be strong with each other when he is in either form. However he does have two separate yet similar ways of fighting for each one.\u201d Sarah answered, proud of you in that sense as well as her proximity to your skill level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can grow some dragon parts if it makes you feel better.\u201d You said sarcastically as you flashed your eyes at him before returning them to human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for show and tell\u201d Kara said as she broke up the little fun you were having. \u201cLord Nick has been made aware of young Brandy here as well as Dibela but doesn\u2019t want them at Dragon\u2019s Keep until they are a little more experienced and trustworthy by our standards. Which means they have to go somewhere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you bring them here because you think I\u2019ll look after them?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease will you let us stay?\u201d asked the girl you now knew as Brandy while Dibela looked distracted that the dragon she was so afraid of was now a human smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou misunderstand. If I didn\u2019t want you around you would be dead, or at least Dibela would. Anyway you can stay here if you have Sarah\u2019s trust and in time mine may follow. However we have no food stores here nor do I plan on babysitting the two of you. What food and training you need is up to you to obtain. Since this place was built for dragons to get to Dibela would have to look after you if you stayed and so that is up to her. This is a dragon hideout, not a human one.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Sarah is here.\u201d Darian interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not implying that I can\u2019t take care of myself are you?\u201d Sarah flared. \u201cMax hasn\u2019t brought me any food for a few months and I am fully capable of defending myself against anything that comes around, as well as finding my own food all with coming and going without his help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough, Sarah can be a very scary person if she chooses to be.\u201d You approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you are any different.\u201d She said, obviously in one of her moods. You both stuck your tongues out at each other in a comical exchange of childish behavior that contrasted the seriousness that was around.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you don't have a dragon or ninja training aiding you, impossible.\" You answered simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my opinion?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" Brandy answered while the others listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this is the place for you. I can tell that you don't really like dragons. Who could blame you, I was in the same position you were in, but worse, a while back. I know, just like you do, how that village works you over. But I enjoy being a dragon rider, and hanging around them. That isn't a feeling you can just pick up. I think you were just wanting to get away from THAT place. If I were you, I would go to Dragon's Reach and try to plug in there. The dragons may not be welcome there, minus Kara, but you are free to live there. A smart and kept girl like you, will get far there. That, and we could use some kind faces in the city to help us when we need it.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that is best?\" Brandy asked, more so the whole room than just Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk?\" Dibella asked, not sure if she earned the right yet. Even with you in human form, her life was hanging by a trust thred as thin as a cotton one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" You relented, obviously not liking her that much, yet. But then again, it took you months to get use to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandy, if you don't like us dragons, than you shouldn't be in a dragon tower. And, to be honest, I can't see myself giving my freedom over to you as my rider. Your scent makes me angry. Although I know it wasn't your fault, you still smell like your father, the one that gave my father to that dragon. I wouldn't be able to trust myself around you, and I do believe you share the feeling about us dragons, almost being eaten by one of us.\" Dibella responded nervously. She obviously didn't want to say how much she wanted to rip this girl apart for what her father did to hers, or not in so many words, especially with you looking for a reason to eat her. She seemed confused by you. One moment you are threatening to eat her, then next you are giving her a morality lesson about not acting on anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... You're right. I was afraid to say it with 3 of you in the room. I HATE you dragons. Not to say that I am not grateful for you all saving me. But... you're right, this place isn't for me. I can do more good in Dragon's Reach. But, if I ever get over my hatred, could I be one, a dragon rider that is?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you find a dragon that wants to bond with you instead of eat you.\" You said bluntly, to which Sarah gave you a whack. \"Sorry, that was a little blunt. What I mean is, you don't just ask and we give you a dragon to have, like a pet. We aren't animals that you can just order around. You need to find one, and they need to find you. As you can imagine, that is hard. That is why there are rarely a weakly connected Dragon Rider unit. They are bonded by more than just loyalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, can someone besides Dibella take me back?... no offense.\" Brandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. We hate each other, and strangely are ok with that, both of us.\" Dibella answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you. I'm the only one that can fly near the city anyway.\" Kara offered as she got up. You all were glad that was done, and Brandy was eager to get away from all the dragons. Kara was beautiful enough for her to like her a little more. Seeing you tear another dragon apart, and hating Dibella also inclined her choice in transportation. You didn't mind, as you didn't want to change back so soon after going to human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you, we need to train.\" Sarah said to Darian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't need to train.\" He whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Max, eat him.\" She said, not expecting for you to actually do it, as she knew you wouldn't. But that wasn't the goal With Kara gone, he was vulnerable and he knew it. Sure he was fearless, but not stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, you can't!\" He said, backing up towards the entrance. Dibella was watching this as well. She was wondering if this was a rare instance in your set of rules that it was ok to eat humans. She was raised by humans, so morally she knew better but, like you, knew all to well how good they tasted. Unlike you however, she didn't have the mental scaring to prevent you from eating any one besides enemies, sometimes not even them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? You mean you can't force your way out of a dragon? Dibella, come over here please.\" Sarah asked and requested. You didn't know how well they were getting along, but you knew what they were up to, so you were ready to object. \"Max, unless you are going to take her place, which I won't ask cause I know you have a problem with that, than you are going to have to trust us on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust YOU Sarah. It's the little rodent that I don't trust at the moment.\" You responded in a tone that she knew as an agreeable one. You looked over to Dibella as she came over to Sarah and Darian. She was nervously glancing at you and Sarah. She didn't know what she was going to be asked to do, but it was enough for you to give her a death threat, more serious than any you'd given her before. \"You so much as scratch her, and I'll tear your throat out and feed it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wont, and I expect you to play nice when she proves she can handle this.\" Sarah teased. Even if she could be scary and smart, she knew that this one area that you were VERY serious on. She dredded what you would do if she was harmed by someone she didn't want killed, especially a dragon, like in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Darian asked, thinking that she was going to have Dibella eat him. Dibella was small, barely capable of swallowing an adult human. But her type of dragon allowed for her to expand slightly, like a snake, kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you off the hook if you can get out of a stomach, or even a dragon's jaws... without weapons. Otherwise, you will do what I say, when I say it. I will not have some weakling be in charge of Kara. Fearless or not, you will not be a burden if I have anything to say about it.\" Sarah said with a no nonsense tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can do that. Dragons are stronger than humans, even I know that. Take away our limited amount of protection, our weapons, and we are easier than sheep to pick off.\" Darian stated proudly, but also nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I called Dibella over here.\" Sarah said than faced the young dragon, very nervous dragon. \"Eat me, only swallowing please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" she asked, not belieiving what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you to eat me. I want to prove that I can forcably get out of a dragon's stomach. Max has a permant scar from something very bad to do something like this. I won't kill you, and you can't use your teeth. But I want you to try to keep me down, and I'll try to escape.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... no, what if you can't get out?\" She argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, then I'll get her out.\" You huffed, which didn't do the situation any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, I'm trying to teach here. Can't you be at least a little supportive?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asking me to stand by while I watch another dragon eat you, that is pusing it Sarah. So I think I'm entitled to as many threats and morbid jokes as I want until you are safe again.\" You answered, subconsciencely growing parts to flex and relieve your stress. This didn't go unnoticed by the already nervous Dibella.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I-I'll do it.\" Dibella stated, stuttering at first but more confident at the end. It appeared the part she latched onto was getting you to trust her, at least more than you were at the moment. It would take a lot more than this to have you do that, but she was now committed to that goal. Maybe it was the way she saw Kara and her interaction with both humans and you, or it could've been her primal mating instinct, wanting the biggest and strongest and all that, or maybe a bit of both, or neither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Let me get some of these off.\" Sarah responded then started to pile up her hidden weapons on a small table beside the fire. At first that wasn't anything to gawk at. But as she continued pulling weapons out of... suggestive places, the room became more in awe, except you, you'd seen all of it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world could you have so many on you?\" Dibella asked for her and Darian. Although Darian was more enamored by WHERE she pulled some of them out of rather than WHAT they were and how many. He was still a teenaged boy after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl has her secrets.\" She replied simply. There was one thing that puzzled you over human interaction, and that was the ways of a woman. Apparently, so said Sarah, that was the way it was suppose to be. In this instance however, you wondered how she was able to effectively hide and carry all those tools and weapons. She had all her ninja tools, beauty supplies, armor, dragon rider weapons, and chemical stuff like adrenaline and poison. You had a feeling, no matter how good your relationship with her would get, you would never understand women in general. Then again, perhaps you weren't meant to. So now she stood almost naked, except a few pieces around her more private sections, just enough to not be too open, but enough to make Darian's jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this?\" Dibella asked, even in her drive to prove herself, she was insanely nervous. If for no other reason, than to not harm or offend the one person keeping you at bay from making her into a snack or trophy. But there was a certain bond as well. She was actually beginning to like this human. You could see why, Sarah was... special in that regard. Everyone liked her, wither it be her looks, smarts, ability, or scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said I was. Now let's get this overwith. I would prefer to get this conversation done before Kara gets back.\" Sarah repied back, moving toward and in front of Dibella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, as you wish, crazy human.\" She sighed and tried to joke. Sarah merely smiled reassuringly as she saw her eye dart toward you then to her again. She could do little more to assure her at this point but smile. She knew it also made you happy when she smiled or laughed. Your tail whipped around nervously as you watched, unblinking, just in case Sarah was in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn of her jaws she slowly brought then down over Sarah's head and shoulders. That is when her head hit the back of her thoat. She had to close her jaws around her a bit to properly swallow. She kept her scaly lips up so her teeth were easily visible, both to you and her... as well as Sarah's non bloody status. But the sight of Sarah in the jaws and among the teeth of a dragon got you even more on edge, while Darian stared at the sight, not believing what he was witnessing. With Sarah relatively safe, Dibella started to swallow. Each gulp you could see Sarah decend down the neck of this small dragon. It was making a noticable bulge. You had to dig your fingers into your seat to keep from running over and slicing that throat open. But gulp by gulp she went down. You could tell that, despite her best efforts, Dibella was enjoying her taste quite a bit. As the bulge moved and settiled in her stomach, Dibella yawned on last time to get the soreness out of her jaws. It was obvious that she usually didn't swallow things that big, or swallow them at all for that matter. Most dragons liked the taste of blood, fresh blood from a meal most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok in there?\" Dibella asked nervously as she nudged her bulging midsection with her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little cramped, but fine. Bring Darian over so I can speak with him please.\" Sarah answered and instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants to talk to you.\" Dibella relayed and beckoned him toward her slightly squirming gut. He was hesitant but in too much shock to resist. To her instruction, he put his ear to the exposed section that Sarah was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" Darian asked, signalling that he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now I am going to get out of here. I expect you to keep your end of the bargain when I do. You agree that this is a good test of my skill right?\" She more commanded than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Ma'am.\" he choked out. He was getting to realize just how scary Sarah could get. To feed herself to a dragon, friendly or not, just to prove a point. That was just crazy. And if she could actually get out, force her way out, which was impossible to him, she would be like that ultimate human bad ass. He backed away to watch, but made sure he still kept an ear out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well normally, if I had my tools I would use a specially made knife or spear to cut my way out, thus killing the offending dragon. But in this case, with no weapons, I will have to do things the old fashioned way. Dibella, this is going to hurt a bit, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I'll work to keep you down, like you asked. Please, if you can actually do this, don't do any lasting damage.\" Dibella answered. She was just as freaked out about this human as Darian. But unlike him, she actually was the brunt of this experiment, and as they just learned, it was going to hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the movement in  her stomach started to get rapid and Dibella sprawled out on the ground in pain. She snarled and roared, unintentionally laying flat on her stomach to help solve the pain problem, hopefully crushing what was causing it. The feeling started to travel up her throat. She swallowed, gulped, and did everything she could to keep her resident inside. She even, at one point, started strangling herself just above the ascending lump. But it did her little good. Eventually they saw two hands protrude from her scaly lips and force her jaws open. Sarah hit two points to both dislocate Dibella's jaw and keep it in place. But she kept her limbs against them, just in case. She wasn't even looking, as her head was still down Dibella's throat, as she did this. But as soon as this was all done, she began to pull herself out. Dibella, in a last effort to keep her inside, tried to force her jaws close with her whole body wieght behind her claws. But it did little good. You got nervous when Sarah's upper half was out and it looked like Dibella was trying to still seal her jaws. That would've bit Sarah in half, no room for you to save her then. But Sarah managed to use a few typed of jutsu on her feet to propel her out and onto the floor, landing on her feet in a ready posture. You were glad she didn't ask you to help her with that. Using that style of jutsu, like that, would be very painful... and effective, as evidence to her status of being outside Dibella now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is how you do it.\" Sarah stated as she wiped off some of the drool and fluids off her. \"Oh, sorry Dibella. Bring your jaws down here. I'll undo that trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDibella did as she was told and with a quick succession of jabs, put her back to normal. Her claws immediately went to massaging her sore jaws, glad it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't ever ask me to eat you again.\" Dibella almost begged past her sore throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan on it. Sorry for the trouble, and thanks for the help.\" Sarah responded, gingerly stroking the young dragon's head. They looked over at you grinning from ear to ear. \"What's so funny over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just that the amount of dragons that find you a pain to eat seems to be growing. I do believe you are the only human in existance that makes dragons afraid to partake in you as a meal. That, and I can't say I am sorry Dibella found that out ever so clearly.\" You answered. \"You are one scary human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment.\" Sarah stated as she allowed Dibella to go back to her spot to rest and started to wipe the remaining dragon juices off her, then put her gear back into their places. \"Did I taste good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Dibella gasped, hoping she wasn't going to have to do that again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max says that I taste really good, but obviously isn't willing to taste me anymore, well not for desire anyway. I was wondering, with his whole eating dragons taste, if it was accurate to you as well.\" Sarah clearified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the way down... uh... yes, very... tasty, delicious. On the way up...\" Dibella stuttered, not wanting to offend either you or the now very scary human. \"... I hope you don't mind me never tasting you again. That was horrible. No more, if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan on making you do that again.\" Sarah reassured then looked over at a still shocked Darian. \"As for you, we got training to do. Any objections this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ma'am!\" Darian answered. You chuckled at this and she smiled, not needing to ask why you were, this time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You let her do what?!\" Kara exclaimed in an obviously angered voice. She couldn't believe what you told her about what happened while she was gone. Dibella now had yet another scay person to be afraid of. She laid, curled up in fear, in the farthest corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darian, I swear... if you sit down one more time, I'll kick your ass!\" Sarah blared at Darian, after he sat to rest after trying to climb the wall without hands. To this threat, Darian got up and continued his strict training session under Sarah's teaching. You had reverted to Dragon form again. You still didn't trust Dibella, although, the whole ordeal did lighten the load of her presence a bit. You could at least trust in her fear of what Sarah COULD do if she tried anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, like I volunteered her for it.\" You growled in a tense sarcastic tone. \"If I didn't have a bias against eating people, She'd be having a very long time out in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she suggested Dibella eat Darian too?\" she asked, anger running toward her view of their new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She threatened that I would. Yeah, like that would happen. Although, I got to say, the next time he rips on that flag...\" You answered, still brooding with your head on the ground. You didn't trust yourself to move at this point. You might lash out at Dibella out of reflex, and whacking a wall out of anger would only make part of the room  collapse. What you really needed was a dragon you could hunt and kill. You weren't that hungry, but you could use the outlet. Sadly, they were never around when you needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you're in a pleasant mood.\" She said, changing subjects, convinced that Dibella wasn't a threat, for the moment at least. She glanced over at the quivering little dragon in the corner. Yes, that was the safest place for her to be right now. Away from you and her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, meat.\" You grumbled, now she knew you were pissed. You only called her 'meat' when you were angry enough to not trust yourself. She now recognized your posture. The way you were laying down in a straight line, with your body taking up a good portion of the room, wasn't meant to be comfortable. It was meant to relieve anger and stress. When she first started to train with you she knew this was a sign to stay as far away as she could. The one time she didn't... let's just say that it was a good thing Sarah was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think I'll go train the runt.\" She informed to which you just grunted, which resulted in a waft of smoke from your nostrils. Yes, when a dragon was brooding, it was obvious. \"Come on little girl. Trust me, you don't want to be anywhere near him right now... And I wouldn't eat Sarah again. He might kill you the way it is now, when she isn't looking.\" Kara called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDibella got up wearily, but hurried out with Kara as they heard you growl at the thought of Sarah being eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he so touchy about eating humans?\" Dibella asked as they flew and Kara taught her a few easy things that could be learned without that much thought. This wasn't really training, just passing the time while you brooded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is a long story. But it would've been better if you ate a different human. He is really pissed that you ate Sarah. So am I, but I understand not to disobey her. But unless he suggested it, I would shy away from even thinking about eating her. She is the one person that he cares for more than anything. When it comes to her safety, you better hope he doesn't think you a threat.\" Kara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but why her of all people. There must be thousands of humans that could be just like her, right?\" Dibella asked, still not getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance. She was the first person to love him like family, ever. Even with her insane abilities and danger to us, he still feels the need to protect her. I remeber this one time, a dragon came to the castle, when we lived there. He was so arrogant and this was before he was more stable. The dragon threatened everyone in the room. Max didn't even wake from his sleep. He usually slept or pretended to, so he looked like a big statue. But the moment he threatned Sarah... didn't even take him 3 seconds to rip the offending dragon's head off the pull the poor thing appart, piece by piece, eating it as he went. It took 2 weeks to clean up the blood from that incident. That and, he says, she calms him. Which is hard to do. I've seen him in bloodrage and she just puts a hand on his snout, his snarling snout mind you, and he just calms right down immediately. No, she's definitely special to him.\" Kara answered and recalled. She knew 2 things for sure about Max. First; that he HATED dragons. Second; that he LOVED Sarah and NEVER mess with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever been... you know?\" Dibella asked, obviously referring to being on your bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hates dragons, so yeah, a very long time ago. He actually swallowed me a few times while training. Partially digested me as well, until Sarah made him spit me out. He said he was just teaching me human worth and what it was like to be eaten, but I know he enjoyed it perhaps too much. He also can get a bit rough in training. Had to heal a few things on account for that. I'll say this, be glad I'm going to be training you. His way is, learn quick or die, especially for dragons... in which case he does the killing, and eating.\" Kara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you will be training me, like to be as good as you?\" Dibella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you think so highly of me, Dibella, but I'm not even near Max's level. I can take out a Dark Hunter, if I'm VERY lucky and the scale is tipped in my favor. I hope you know that it won't be easy, even to reach that level.\" Kara responded, for the first time, concerned for Dibella's life alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, understand. Please teach me. I want to be as good as you, maybe good enough to impress him.\" she said, the last part a bit quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be at this a while then. He doesn't impress easily, especially if he still wants to eat you. So let's get started.\" Kara said, then they started. It was weak, but this was the start of something great. Slowly, your little cave was becoming a standard for dragons that wished to live like you, or close to it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were awoken by a whiff before a noise and voice of Darian. You caught a whiff of a dragon through the cross breeze that brought most scents to your cave. You were about to get up, to which Sarah noticed as your dragon form was not hard to see move, when Darian came in with Kara, her slightly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, Sarah, come quick!!!\u201d Darian exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dragon war.\u201d Kara said, shortening the explanation that Darian was ready to give. Despite her harsh treatment and training methods, he still thought her good looking enough to lengthen any amount of interaction with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the scent I smell?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. They sent a human slave to Dragon\u2019s Reach to say that a Dragon clan was going to challenge the dragons that claim this Territory. They should be arriving today sometime.\u201d Kara answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us much time\u2026\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the warning and challenge came a month ago, but I was busy training Dibella and they thought they could handle it. When they learned from the slave that the dragon clan numbers in the hundreds\u2026 they made efforts to get my attention,\u201d Kara revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich meant sneaking up on me while I was resting ant they were doing some flight training\u2026\u201d Darian said with an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means you need more training.\u201d Sarah stated, and Darian sighed, knowing that meant more hard work for him in the very near future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose that means it\u2019s time for me to get down there. I can already smell them coming. I eat well tonight.\u201d You said, the last bit with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you can take on an entire clan by yourself!?!\u201d Dibella gasped. She knew you were strong, but didn\u2019t know how much so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt should be easy.\u201d You replied, growling at her menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut it out, big boy.\u201d Sarah commanded, whacking your growling snout. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get over the whole, her eating me, thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but not today.\u201d You responded, then moved toward the entrance. \u201cKara, it would be nice if you could let Dragon\u2019s Reach know that I am coming. I don\u2019t need to fight with them trying to kill me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, come on Little One.\u201d Kara responded and let Darian climb on her back before taking off. Dibella following close behind, not trusting you with her safety, but obviously trusting that you could and would slaughter the incoming dragon force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they are pretty fast, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Sarah asked as she leapt on your head and you looked down to see the sky above Dragon\u2019s Reach full of enemy dragons. With your enhanced vision, the cross breezes, and sound perception you could tell what was happening as Kara, Darian, and Dibella made it to what looked like the area that the leader was and Lord Nick now resided. It was the calm before the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure are. Let\u2019s see how stupid they are\u2026?\u201d You suggested, then let her link into your mind so she could hear the negotiations with the leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the beautiful Dragoness and her sidekick. I\u2019ve heard tell that you are the only one fore leagues that can take down a Dark hunter Queen?\u201d Said the leader as Kara landed and her group joined Lord Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can. But I will not be fighting you, if you still choose that course of action.\u201d Kara responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposing Dragons were not like Dark Hunters, Dibella\u2019s type, or Kara\u2019s type of dragon. They were a little more stocky and muscle bound. Not meant for in air battle, but more so in attacking ground targets. They had harder back scaled than Kara did and more developed legs and claws but lower grade flames and teeth. Then again, dragon teeth were dragon teeth. No matter how relatively small or big they were, to a human, they were still bigger than what was comfortable. Their size was about Kara\u2019s size, but a greenish color. Apparently, they liked forested areas as they blended in with the trees very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are not fighting, then have you surrendered?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly. Max just said he would like to do all the fighting, if it came down to that. I think he is waiting in his cave until he you decide that you are fighting. He has ordered us to not get involved, if possible.\u201d Kara, responded, the last part to Lord Nick. He nodded and whispered to a General of is, then looked back to the dragons. Knowing well that Dragons hardly liked Humans interfering in their conversations. So he remained quiet, for now.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, I think you are bluffing. No one could observe us from that far away. Knowing this Dark Hunter King\u2019s Reputation, he would\u2019ve already started attacking and feasting if he knew we were here. We were victim to your bluff before, but not this time. I bet he isn\u2019t even around, at least at the moment. Even if he was, we number in the hundreds, and he is only one. We will defeat him well enough, when he gets here.\u201d The leader stated rather matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea what you are dealing with.\u201d Dibella responded, not sure to be more scared of you or the hundreds of dragons that were ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I think I do, little one.\u201d He snarled happily. \u201cYou will all die, for not surrendering. And we will take over this territory for our growing population.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you heard enough, so did Sarah. She was ready and waiting for you to take off. She plugged her ears as you let out a roar that sent shockwaves toward the hundreds of dragons below. They all seemed to quiver and shake with the rest of the terrain as they looked and darted around for the roar\u2019s source, the leader quickly but nervously taking off into the air. You took off and they saw you shortly after as you made quick work of closing the distance between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d You asked to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kidding? I\u2019ve been waiting for a good battle like this for a while.\u201d Sarah responded with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. You and her had talked about utilizing ninja skills to fight an uphill battle, but had so far not been able to try it. This was a perfect opportunity. The offending dragons all made a course change and started coming at the two of you. Hundreds of Dragons filled the sky, but you didn\u2019t want to spring your trump card until they were too close to turn away. Even before that though, they were quivering as you got closer. Like many types of dragons, your size as a Dark Hunter King easily eclipsed theirs. None of them wanted to be the first you ran into. With a few thousand feet between sides, you sprung your trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMulti-SHADOW CLONE JUTSU!!!\u201d You and Sarah said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, the sky was filled with smoke on your side of the coming battlefield. And out of the smoke, to the other side\u2019s horror, was an even 100 pairs of you and Sarah. The other side of dragons, still outnumbering you 8 to 1, halted. Their battle plan before was very straight forward, apparently. Overwhelm you with excessive numbers. Which, before your trip to the realms, would\u2019ve worked. But now, things had changed. However, with that halt, they lost any and all the momentum they had. With no time to correct the massive force of Dragons, you and your clones met their side and started tearing the offending dragons apart in a wide variety of ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky rained with blood as the dragons above feasted on their foes. You could only imagine what it looked like from below. It was probably a mix or Morbid fascination, uncontrollable fear, and great thankfulness. As for you, it was quite a fun experience. You swallowed the first one whole. At the speed you were flying and the torpedo like posture they had hesitated in, it was too hard to resist. After that you basically got a bite every time your teeth came together. There was a little fire in the fight, but in the end there was little need for the energy drain. After about an hour of fighting, eating, and chasing down fleeing dragons you were done and ended the jutsu with Sarah. You circled Dragon\u2019s Reach a little bit, making sure everyone was ok. Seeing that no harm was done to the village, you gave out another roar that shook most of the city, then bolted back to your cave. In the background you could barely hear some cheering going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you land?\u201d Sarah asked, after you landed and started cleaning your blood soaked body off. A few struggles from the digesting Dragon making you smile a little. It wasn\u2019t that you were insanely morbid or mean. You just hated dragons, and this one was getting what it deserved for threatening over 800,000 humans that lived in Dragon\u2019s Reach at this point. \u201cYou know they would have let you, and they probably would\u2019ve welcomed you in a very high manner for this right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2026 I just don\u2019t know. I normally wouldn\u2019t care if they wanted to do that. I just, I guess have gotten used to the solitary life up here. I am just as happy digesting my meal and hanging out with you and a few others than being bombarded with loud noises from crowds. Not to mention that me arriving blood soaked and all that would\u2019ve not been my best return trip\u2026\u201d You answered sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. But you are going to have to visit them at some point.\u201d Sarah said and went to go wash off herself. Like you, she was soaked in dragon\u2019s blood. Unlike you however, she couldn\u2019t just lick it off\u2026 nor did she want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underlining reason though, for you not wanting to deal with a village, much less a whole city of people, you both knew, was because of Naruto\u2019s realm. You still had a very fresh memory of a whole world and multiple villages, including the one you were trapped in, that feared and hated you. Normally Sarah would just talk/push you through it. But she knew that she was partly the reason for it. It was still a touchy subject, and she had even less desire to bring it up than to lick the dragon blood off of herself. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lynia, have you been waiting ? \", you asked, she shoke her head, \" I\u00b4ve just arrived as well ! \", she answered happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll arroound you people where appearing seeamingly out of nowhere, you figured it was how you entered this world, there where people inside the game that weren\u00b4t clad in the beginer\u00b4s clothes, Sarah or now Lydia, said they where NPC\u00b4s, programs created by the game to give a enviorment in the game, they where easely identified by not having a cursor or a health bar, you felt annoyed as you looked at your own health bar, pulling the menu you saw your status, \" If this represented my real strenght as in the real world, all these parameter\u00b4s would be giving error message, for being overpowered, ! \", you commented and Lydia at your side smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginers town was huge, shops with all sort of equipment lined the streeets, weapons, and armor or all shapes and sizes, the beginers equipment came with a thousand of the game\u00b4s currency, and a short blade, looking at it you felt it was unapropriate to your figting style, after all as a human you fought using your feet and fists, \" We kinda need help here, i mean we literaly know notting of how this game operates ! \", you voiced, Lydia looked arround and blurted suddently, \" Quickly Drake, lets go ! \", and broke in a dash, you quickly followed althought in this body it felt like you where a slowpoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey wait up ! \", she called  for a boy that was running with balck hair that purpose, he stoped and looked behind at who was calling, and behind you another person with red hair as following, \" Is there something you need ? \", he asked with a confussed face, it was Lydia that asked, \" Your a beta player right ? \", she asked cheerfully, he nodded, \" Oy would you teach me ropes ? please, \" The dude with red jair asked, you looked at him annoyed, \" Ok, i\u00b4ll teach you three the basis, name\u00b4s Kirito ! \", he answered politely at the same time he announced his name, \" Drake ! \", Lydia \", \" I\u00b4m Klein ! \", you each presented yourselfs one at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How did you knew he was a beta ? \", you asked Lydia Later, she smiled and answered, \" This his not the first MMO that i play, all the beta\u00b4s are always running arround when the game starts for real, ! \", she answered, you smiled, Lydia add learned a lot more from this new realm than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito whent arround town with you two and Klein, explaining that diferent usage of weapons would lead to difent skill learning, when you asked if there where skills that allowed the usage of your fists in combat, he answered yes, but to unlock then you add to complete a quest in the second level of the game, there was no magic on it making the skills learned on game extremely important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia put weapon throw and one-handed dagger in her skill slot, and for some reason that you didn\u00b4t understoud, cooking, you whent with the one-handed straight sword for now, and put Detection, to avoid ambushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the party headed outside to the field, only outside could you see the size of the city as it really was, now that you where outside you decided to test your dragon eyes, without Kirito and Klein notecing of course, but you where surprised as the scenary was replace with code lines everywhere, dissapointed you returned your eyes to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Arrgh ! \", where the painfull sounds of Klein when he was hit once again by some sort of blue boar, Lydia was trying to contain his laughter, on the other hand you where looking at him with disdain of his poor stance, and his health bar was already yellow, \" What are you complaining about, you don\u00b4t feel any pain in the game ! \", said Kirito as Klein grabbed the area in wich the pig hit him on wich was the groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a rock from the ground he got in possition and the rock was covered with a red glow, he add explained that this was the skill activation setup, then flinged it at the boar\u00b4s rear, at the same time he explained how to activate the skill wich was pretty vague, but enough to Klein to get in position and with a red glow from his curved sword he dashed at the boar in a awkward way, the cut didn\u00b4t spilled blood as you expected, instead red poligons appeared in the air arround the cut and then it broke and dissapeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh yeah !! \", he shouted as he add defeated a boss, \" Good work, but let me tell you, that boar was as weak as the slimes in other rpg\u00b4s ! \", he revealed wich got Kelin to say something stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well, what about you two, care to try ? \", he asked, \" I\u00b4ll go first ! \", said Lydia as she looked arround and imitating Kirito she picked a stone and flinged it at a boar, it responded by charging at her, she charged as well, Klein and Kirito watched astountned as Lydia dodged to the side and without activating a skill, cut the left side of him and then jumped for a stab in the back of the head, she then sheated her dagger and rejoined the group as the boar dissapeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Did you have to show off ? \", you asked with a smile, she answered by sticking out her tongue, \" Woah, your girlfriend his incredible ! \", said Klein with jealous eyes towards you, \" When did i said she was my girlfriend ?, Lydia his my sister in real life ! \", you corrected him, \" Oh !, sister he ! \", he said with a smile, \" Let me warn you thought, she will stab you, if your not carefull ! \" you warned at the same time Lydia flashed her weapon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, if one wants to get out, he as to use the logout bottom, unless someone from the outside removes the Nervegear ! \", he explained, and with that Klein tried to remove it while inside the game, but it was pointless, \" We live alone !, what about ...! \", you where going to ask but at that time a bell rung from the city, followed by a blue light that enveloped the party, and you where back at the first place that you started along with the rest of the players that bought the game that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that a huge figure appeared from a warning message in the sky, it was a figure that was notting more than clothes, he started explaining what hapenned, and what was going on, \"<i>Well so much for the peacefull realm ! </i> \" , you thought sarcastically, as he made his speach, the mirror in the inventory was the only thing that you where gratefull for since it allowed to completly correct your face and Lydia as well, looking at Kirirto and Klein, they didn\u00b4t looked like they did a second ago, and they weren\u00b4t the only ones, you even saw something as disgusting as male players that where crossdressing as female and vice-versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he dissapeared and the people arround you started to panick that Lydia snaped, \" What a load of horse dung ! \", this cought Kirito and Klein by surprise since they problably expected you to panick as the rest, \" Well, talk about a twist, we came here to have some fun and now if our hp bar reachs zero even, the Nervegear his gonna fry our heads ?! \", you blurted annoyed at all this mess, right now you couldn\u00b4t move your body in the real world no matter what, meaning you where traped as the rest of the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You two are pretty calm considering the situation ! \", said Klein with sweat running down his brown, \" In times like these, what\u00b4s the point of panicking ?, \" you retorted, \" Anyway, we got to plan this out !, Lydia ? \", you said then asked as you saw her running to a girl with chestnut hair caught in braids by the side, and pulled her by the hand, she didn\u00b4t resisted, you understoud what she was doing without even asking, and with that the five of you sneaked to a alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you know her ? \", asked Kirito when you where already in the alley, \" No, it\u00b4s just that she reminded me of myself when i was younger, or more precisely her eyes ! \", Lydia answered with downcast eyes .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to the girl and asked, \" What\u00b4s your name ? \", she looked arround at the party, you took notice to her eyes that where also chestnut, they looked hollow at first but a light shined in then, proof that she was the kind that didn\u00b4t give up easely, \" A...asuna, my name his Asuna \", she asnwered in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a round of presentations after wich Kirito produced a virtual map and presented his plan, \" We are going to the next village, as things stand, if we stay in the city, the experience and col will be harvested in a short time, so the best course of acton if we want to head to the second floor, his to head here ! \", he said, you were inpressed at his deductions and calm demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is it possible ? \", was the question from Asuna as she stared at Kirito, \" I\u00b4m certain that reaching the ext village his possible for me at my current level even if i were to bring two other, Klein his still a rookie along with you, but even if it his their first time playing, Drake and Lydia can take care of themself\u00b4s, so it his possible ! \", he assured with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I asked if it his possible to clear this game !? \", she said now a little irritated, this time he didn\u00b4t answer, \" If you are determined you can do anything, even topple a god ! \", you answered for him with all the confidence in the world, the rest of the party was stunned and speecheless at your scale, excepet Lydia that smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" A god ? \", asked Kirito bewildred, \" If you think about it, that Kayaba his acting like he his a god, so it his a good analogy ! \", said Lydia, there was a silence after that, it broke when Klein gave a laught, \" Man you two are something else, ok i decided, sorry Kirito, but i have friends that are in here with me, so i\u00b4ll be satying here ! \", he announced with a new spark in his eyes, \" I see ! \", was Kirito\u00b4s answer, \" Don\u00b4t worry, i\u00b4ll catch up with you eventually, i hope whe meet in the real world ! \", he said and returned to the plaza were the rest of the player\u00b4s where still scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the four of you made a party of four and hit the road, Kirito and yourself where in front and took out most of the monster\u00b4s that attaked, Lydia with Asuna in the back managed to take down a few themself\u00b4s, when the night fell, you were still only halfway throught, if Asuna wern\u00b4t with you three, stoping wouldn\u00b4t be necessary, but she was tired and with your current status, carrying her on the back was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now that we are stuck in this world, the coocking skill really comes in handy ! \", you said as Lydia took out some boar meat that was droped from the blue boar\u00b4s that you slew, \" Indead, but at my current level of skill, i can\u00b4t do much more than this ! \", she said, as she pulled a small pot and with water from a nearby river and some salt put it to boil as a stew, the process was oversimplified by the game system, one touch even with her dagger would cut the meat in small cubs wich she put on the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I do have to admit, i never put cooking in my skill slot, since it his a skill that as no point in battle ! \", he explained, and while he said that, you saw Asuna next to Lydia setting a skill in her slot, you smilled at guessing wich was, \" But you know, even if we eat in this world, we are just fooling our brain, in the real world, our bodies still need to be nourished ! \", you pointed out, \" Indead, but Kayaba said that our bodies would be transfered into hospitals, there are problably ways to locate the players that are traped inside the game ! \", continued Kirito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still not convinced, what if they never found your bodies and you would die of hunger, \" Now that i think about it ! \", started Lydia, \" I add to give my adress when i bought the game ! \", she said, there was a releaved sight from you, \"<i>Good thing the security system back home his completly normal, it would be bad if i add installed a deadly one ! </i> \", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How long will it take to reach the village ? \", asked Asuna, getting in the conversation for the first time, Kirito pulled the map and after a few seconds he said, \" We should be able to get there by midday tomorow, if we keep the same pace as today ! \", he answered, \" Ok, it\u00b4s ready ! \", called Lydia as she took the pot out of the campfire and placed it on top of a flat stone, the smell was great, it was hard to believe that it was actually notting but codelines mixed togheter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh, not bad, normaly to make something like this you need some points at the coocking skill, otherwise, there his a big chance that it will fail ! \" pointed Kirito, when he said that Lydia pulled her window and made a frown, you gave a smirk, as you thought that she was problably lucky that the food didn\u00b4t go bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone ate in silence, when it was over you drawed your sword saying that you would keep watch, Kirito and Asuna gave their thank\u00b4s, but Lydia gave you a look of understanding, but said notting.</span></div></div>",

\", asked Lydia to you, making sure that Kirito and Asuna didn\u00b4t listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes as you thought of an answer, \" Because when not threatned by anything, all creatures became complacent, they live thinking that no harm can come to them, and when it does happen, they whant to blame someone or something ! \", you explained, \" Kayaba his not here for them to blame, so they have to blame someone else, \", you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That sounds awfull ! \", she said with a downcast face, \" I know, but either that or doing what that guy did ! \", you answered also in a bad mood, Lydia frowed at this, you add learned from some newcomers that a few hours after what happened in the plaza, a person threw himself out of the floating castle, effectively commiting suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well lets just forget about that, for know we should focus in clearing the first floor ! \", you voiced out with determination, currently the four of you where in the field grinding, in the spawn of the week you all managed to reach level 6, wich according to Kirito was very good considering that the experience gained was devided fourways as a party, Asuna switched from the one-handed straight sword to a rapier, looking at the weapon it looked like it was weak, frail, and would break at first contact, but being on a virtual world meant that things where diferent than what they should be, surprisingly sturdy and fast it easely and quickly delivered precision strikes at a monster\u00b4s weak points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank\u00b4s to Kirito\u00b4s knowledge in the Beta, the party managed to get some good equipment, or at least good considering the low status on the first level, at first you where going for the martial art skill in the second level but changed your mind when you found out of a extra skill that could be aquired in the first level( Scythe-wield), you add to do the quest alone to recieve it, your health bar came dangerously close to the red area, but in the end managed to clear it, so now you where swinging a weapon that was as intimidating as it was deadly, and for some strange reason it suited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Another one down ! \", you claimed as you sliced another monster in half, a look arround and you saw Kirito delivering a horizontal slash on another monster, then switching with Asuna that trusted her rapier, while Lydia finished another with a iron nail, \" Ok, that\u00b4s enough for today, our items won\u00b4t last much more ! \", called Kirito after that, you took a look arround making sure that no other monster\u00b4s were going to attack and, put your weapon on the back, despite the huge size, the scythe was remarkebly easy to carry arround, the others sheathed their respective weapons as they aproached Kirito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Anything good ? \", asked Lydia in a good humor, Asuna said nothing, althought a smile drew in her face at you next words, \" Got a D class ingredient, dinner should be good today ! \", you annouced at wich everyone smiled, one of the few pleasures of being stuck on SAO was the food, the other was something that you discovered when you where fidling with the menu and discovered the \u00b4Ethics code off`, confussed you asked Kirito, he explained that the ethics code was in order to prevent people from having adult relationships inside the game whithout consent from both sides, wich self-explained the use for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So Drake, how\u00b4s the Scythe ? \", asked Kirito curious about it, \" Well, it\u00b4s attack power despite being a novice Iron Scythe, his very high, pretty easy to handle, i can see why the quest to obtain the Scythe-wield extra skil his so damn hard ! \", you resumed while Kirito took notes to later give to a little girl called Argo the Rat, you add no idea why would someone pick such a name, problably because of the whiskers, the thing was, she sold and bought information for the right price, so information on a weapon or skill and how to obtain them was good money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" A quest that starts by using a monster drop that drops at 0.1 %, no wonder i never heard of anything during the Beta ! \", said Kirito bewildred, \" 0.1 !?, you mean only a one in a thousand chance to drop ! \", you said, he noded and closed the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keept discussing on such topics, before this all happened you would never have found much interest in all this, but now despite it being all virtual, it was as real as it would get since you would die for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAproaching town, Asuna and Lydia put on a robe that covered their faces, the reason was, not to draw attention to the two of them, they where booth female player\u00b4s, and their appearences where by human standards, very beautifull, so they bought a pair of cheap and ugly robes to avoid the jealousy of the male player\u00b4s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut quickly removed them once inside the rented room, Kirito\u00b4s knowledge about MMO\u00b4s shined yeat again, the rented room was spacious enough for four people, and add all the commodities, it was somewhat more pricy than the inn, but on the contrary of the rented house, the Inn add no shower, or kitchen, or even a fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girl\u00b4s whent ahead to take a shower, you decided to bring up a certain topic, \" Kirito, in your opinion, how long will it take to conquer this game ? \", you started, he stoud silent for a minute before answering with a heavy heart, \" A optimistic scenario would be 3 years, \" he started gloomly, \" I can\u00b4t even imagine how many people will die until then ! \".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whent quiet for a while as you runned over what Kirito told you, \" The beasts arround here won\u00b4t be able to keep us leveling up for much longer, should we take that quest that you mentioned ? \", you asked, he clossed his eyes and noded before opening them again, \" I guess so, it gaves a lot of XP, but even with the four of us, it might take a few days, we should stock up ! \", he pointed and started doing a inventory of necessary items.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The portal closed and you looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Max. This isn't home.\" Sarah stated, more to ask what went wrong then the statement it sounded like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed that. There is only one thing that could mess with the portal system like this.\" You replied as you thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if someone wants me, or all that are traveling through bad enough then it reroutes to that realm. Honestly, I was going to research it to see if I could get back to another realm if our home didn't work out. But I've never been to this one. So I am not sure why it spit us out here.\" you responded as you looked around some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well wouldn't the people that wanted us to come be somewhere around here?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be... I guess. Never been summoned like this before. So you tell me, smarty.\" You replied, joking about the last bit. She smiled at your willingness to joke with her so soon. Then she started thinking. Whatever she though of was usually right, in the intelligence aspect at least. Instinct you were a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the way home is probably sealed until we take care of this realm one way or another. So, we should find the person that requested us. Since neither of us have been here, we were probably summoned by someone wanting an aspect that we both share. We should look around to find the person.\" Sarah decided with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sounds like a plan,\" you agreed and you both started looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you find?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Found him!\" Sarah yelled as you both had split up to cover more ground. You marveled at her ability to overshadow your Draconic abilities in such a way. You walked over to her standing over a very short man and a few beaten up men, that looked like body guards. You walked up to her, looking at her sideways. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to beat up his bodyguards?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, they attacked me when I asked what they were doing. Not my fault.\" She defended. She was still walking on egg shells with you. Not that you were on edge, but she thought you should be, in regards to her. She still wasn't over her part in harming you. But that was for later. The little man stood near and was... smiling? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look awfully joyful for someone who's bodyguards just got beat up in an alley,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why shouldn't I be. Is it right to assume that you two are a package deal, you being just as good as she is?\" He asked, actually jumping with excitement. You found this strange to say the least, but agreed with Sarah's assumption that this man was the one that summoned you two here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually he is many times stronger than I am.\" Sarah revealed, which got his eyes to sparkle and he just leapt up and hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a good day!\" He cheered. You were getting annoyed. You reached and picked him off you by his collar, holding him up as his bodyguards started coming around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look buddy. You are the reason we can't leave. I suggest you explain why you were looking for us, and quickly.\" you almost growled at him, but your demeanor didn't seam to do anything but escalate this man's excitement. You sighed and put him down, seeing the nervous look the recovering men were giving the two of you. \"How about starting with your name. I am Max, and this is Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Wonderful. You can call me 'Mr. Tokugawa'. I am most pleased to meet two fighters in my own backyard.\" he revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is why you wanted us here. We are more than adept with multiple marital arts. You are wanting fighters. Makes sense. But, you should know. We are trained to kill, not to spar or fight in a match of some kind.\" Sarah said while eyeing the bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will work perfectly!\" Mr. Tokugawa exclaimed as he jumped up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, are you going to tell us what you want us to do or what?\" You asked in an annoyed tone. If Sarah couldn't have guessed before she could guess now. You were rather home sick and sore about being ripped from the other realm you were in before the Leaf ninja came for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. But not here. Some place more private, yes!\" He replied and ushered the two of you to follow him. He was almost skipping as he made his way to a limo. The bodyguards were surrounding your group. He obviously was a hotshot of some kind. As you saw the street signs you wondered where you were. But whatever, you were there to fight, apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy was like a little chatter box as he talked with someone over something called a \"cell phone\". It was an amazing piece of technology. Allowing the user to speak to someone leagues away in real time. But you held in your curiousness. After all, hopefully, you two wouldn't be there for very long. He kept on saying things about how Sarah beat up his guys. Apparently one of them was suppose to be fighting in some kind of tournament of his. He was looking for the best fighters in the world. Seeing as you and Sarah weren't from his world, this tournament must be extremely important to him. Although Sarah was blushing about being recommended so highly, even by a stranger. She sat close to you, but was still uncomfortable in too formal of a gesture. Understandable, you supposed. She had just spent a good amount of time drowning herself in guilt. It would take a little bit to get her mind off of things. Eventually you all got to a huge building and were escorted inside with him. You all entered a room, deep underground and saw an arena of sorts with a sand pit in the middle. You guessed that this was where he wanted you two to fight, but who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I need you for. What a stroke of luck to find you both. Unfortunately, women aren't allowed to fight in this place. A rule I wish I didn't make. But I never thought I would meet someone of your skill.\" Mr. Tokugawa stated then looked at you, her, then you again. \"You sure he is better than you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed he is. Ok, since we want to get out of here as quickly as we can, and we have to help you before we can do that. We will be blunt about what and who we are.\" Sarah informed to which he sat in a special area and gesture to two seats for  you two to sit. He looked at both of you with apt attention. \"We are ninja, well trained. We can do jutsu. Things like summoning fire and other elements, as well as clones of our selves. The are all techniques but would seem unfair. Max on the other hand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not human.\" you said bluntly, now getting what she was trying to do. If this guy could just backslide on his desire to have you two there. Then you two could go. But no luck. He seemed even more excited now... if that was even possible. \"I am not getting out of this am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you are depending on me to get you out.\" He said, secure in his belief that you would be amazing in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is ok if I transform to fight, if I have to?\" You asked, trying to gauge just what he was going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. The more excitement and new skill you could bring to the arena the better. Except weapons.\" He answered. With one last ditch of effort to get him to recall you sprung some of your dragon parts out. But that was a mistake. \"Ah, yes! That will be magnificent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.... I give up. You'll have my skill in  your tournament. As long as you take care of us while we are here. We were summoned here for you after all. We didn't exactly bring our beds. Oh, you should probably not match me up with anyone you don't want me to beat right away. Save that for a final match or something. I haven't met anyone I couldn't beat yet. Seeing as not many survive when picking a fight with a dragon.\" You tacked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, happy day. It sounds like you are asking me to fight the King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The who? Your King fights in these things too?\" You asked in an obvious confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't know of the King, Yujiro Hanma?\" He asked in awe. \"Someone as apparently powerful as you should've heard of him at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of him. We are not from this realm. But if he is a normal human, can't imagine he is that hard to beat. Then again, Sarah is pretty tough and she is normal as well. So whatever. I can fight him if you want. If you don't mind me beating him. I am not planning to lose against anyone you put me against.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from this realm? Oh, I don't care where you came from. This is too exciting!\" He said and talked about things he could put on the roster for you, as well as accommodations for the both of you. Finally you both were in a room of your own, fed, rested, and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this?\" she asked as she looked around at the strange things in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I can. I guess this culture is into a plush way of living. Everything is so soft here.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this is the future, or something like that.\" She responded comically, holding up another sweat food she had taken a liking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still can't wait to get home. As soon as we are done here, hopefully we can get there.\" You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are homesick aren't you?\" She asked, sitting next to you, placing a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed a few things in my time in other realms. You being one, Kara being another, and dragon meat being the last. All of them at once will be a very welcomed experience.\" you answered with a look into her eyes to emphasize she was one of the things you were glad for. She needed to get over this guilt she had. But that would take a while, you'd imagine. For now, you had a tournament to win. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Originally you were put with the other fighters and Sarah was in the stands, trying not to beat up half the people that were around. But you quickly found the locker room, if you could call it that, to annoying. There was always someone wanting to pick a fight. Really? They couldn't wait till the arena? So you went out and sat with Sarah, waiting for your name to be called. She was happy about that. She needed time to spend with you. As both of you watched the fights it gave some interesting improvements to moves and fighting styles you both already knew. Most though were only good against human sized opponents. There were a few that weren't, but mainly they were humans fighting humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit into the event you saw Yujiro Hanma. His son was impressive enough, and he looked a head better than other people as far as fighting ability was concerned. But that wasn't saying much. You coming from the other realms, where people had abilities that made guns and missiles useless, this guy didn't compare to that. Still, for a human, he was pretty good. His mind and morality was another story. He seemed to think he owned the place. You guessed that is why they called him \"the King\". Finally, they brought out an alternate provided by him. You didn't even bother remembering his name. You, hopefully, wouldn't be here long enough for it to matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, please report to the ring.\" The announcer called, as it was probably reported to him that you weren't in the back with the rest of the fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my call.\" you said and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max...\" Sarah called before you went to leap down to the ring. You stopped and turned to look down at her. \"Have fun alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best.\" you replied with a smile, one she was more than glad to see and returned. With that you leapt down and landed in the arena. Other people were surprised by this. Even more so though was that you still looked like a upper High School kid. Dragon blood kept you from ageing too much. You barely had to brace for your landing, so you just stood there with your arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my opponent? This isn't a place for children.\" Said the man across from you with an almost genuine smile. You couldn't tell if this guy was nice or psychotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should go.\" you said, still not really taking a serious stance. Not like he could do much against you. People kept stalling it so you looked to Mr. Tokugawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, our friend here is a rare find. He is older than he looks and more than capable. Start the match already!\" He said, never seeing you in action yet, he could barely control himself. Yujiro was next to him, having a bored look as he sat back in his seat. Probably expecting you to get your butt kicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mr. Tokygawa's order, the match started. The man seemed indifferent, despite his claim earlier. He took a posture that reminded you of a swan, kind of. His limbs were longer than normal people, but just. he seemed to float up and come above you. You didn't move as he approached and he started with a barrage of kicks that you didn't even bother dodging. You just let them bounce off your face with no effect on you other than irritation. He was slightly confused when he came down for a landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I was brought here for this level of fighting?\" you growled lightly. His kicks weren't even registering. The most they did was move your hair and get swet on you, foot stink of humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to know what to do so he tried it again. This time you got out of your posture. \"That trick is a little old at this point, don't you think?\" You said calmly as you caught one of his ankles and whiplashed him on the ground hard enough to cause an indent in the ground. You had no intension of killing him, but you didn't want to suffer this guy's boredom any longer. He was alive, but a good number of his bones were broken from the impact. \"Pest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at the referee, as shocked as anyone else. He flinched at your gaze, but you just nodded to the broken guy now out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Match Over!\" He called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can clearly say that was not expected. This child has easily beaten the King's chosen fighter, and did it with a single throw.\" The announcer called. You turned and started walking toward the locker room. You and Sarah knew that you couldn't sit in the stands after your first match. Otherwise you'd get no peace and it would defeat the point of sitting up there in the first place. So you strode back, but was stopped by a thud from behind you. You turned your head and saw the big man, Yujiro Hanma, standing there, glaring at you with great joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" You asked, slightly angering him by not even turning to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a find you are. You may be worth taking this one's place under me...?\" He offered. He was asking you if you wanted to be trained by him. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not interested.\" you answered then turned to walk away but something whacked the back of your head that made you stop, again. You turned all the way to face a much closer man. He stood much taller than you. From a normal human standpoint he would be very fear worthy. But you didn't bat an eye. \"What now? You are getting too clingy for my taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you are superior than I am?\" he asked, asking if you thought you could give him a good fight, you thought. This guy was hard to read, or at least part of him. He was more instinctual that he let on, but not enough to realize you were out of his league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you want to fight. Sorry, this is Mr. Tokugawa's tournament. So HE is in charge. Get him to set up a match, and I'll kick your ass without having to be convinced by your lame attempts. And you can finally stop annoying me.\" You answered with a calm face, then looked past him to Mr. Tokugawa. \"How about it? You want to enter him in your tournament as my next opponent? I know you got your system, but he can be a warm up if you want to get past that little rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!!!\" he said with excitement. You didn't know what he liked more, your apparent power, or for it to be put against this guy's. The crowd seemed to like it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, wise ass. Happy now. Now, if you excuse me, I would like to take a nap.\" you stated but he kept his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will destroy this whole tournament. Impress me, then I will wait.\" he stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and brought a finger to his chest, which is where your head met in a height to his posture. He watched you as you got closer then, you flicked him. He definitely wasn't expecting to go flying through the wall and down the tunnel on the other side of the ring. You shook your head with annoyance, turned, and continued to walk to the locker room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah met you back in a private room, where you could get the nap that you were hoping for. She remembered that you couldn't really sleep peacefully. So when you asked if you could sleep near her, she almost burst with joy. That meant that her presence still tamed you, and helped you sleep without having those nightmares that sometimes caused you to rearrange the very ground you laid on. As a 500 foot tall dragon, that was easy. But either way, she sat next to you as you slept. You didn't mind the noise of the screen, letting her watch the other fights. But soon enough it was your turn again, so you both walked over to the tunnel you were suppose to come out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As stated before, Max will fight with the King, Yujiro Hanma, before his match against Doppo Orochi. One has to wonder, how much of a chance he has. However, his previous show of power has definitely tipped normal logic out the window.\" The announcer called out and cheers rang out as you both stepped out of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a preliminary match. I plan to take a little longer against the other guy. I like him a little be better. This guy though... \" you answered, then finished with a growl. You stopped as she hugged into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got you back, and you accepted, forgiving me for hurting you so much. Please don't get angry. I just want to see you happy for a while, ok?\" She almost pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I say no to you?\" you asked as you tipped her face to meet yours. She sniffed then smiled. \"Ok, for you, I will not kill him... even if he asks for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, doesn't mean you can't have fun.\" She said as she let go and gave you a small kiss on the cheek. \"Go get him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" you said with a wink. Then you jumped onto the barrier and out into the ring with noticeably little effort. He wasn't in the ring yet, but your next opponent was on the other side. You sniffed and found him sitting where he was the last time, right next to Mr. Tokugawa. His face, it was... best word for it would be lustful. He really wanted this. \"Well, are you going to come down so I can kick your ass, or are you going to make me sing a song for you first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that little outburst, he jumped clear out of his seat and hit the ground in the ring, a crazed look on his face. You couldn't tell if he was excited or angry. You looked at him, then at Mr. Tokugawa, then back and forth a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having second thoughts?\" Yujiro taunted as he got into a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" you answered then looked up at Mr. Tokugawa. \"Uh... are you sure I can transform? It might be a little much, if exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as long as you don't use weapons.\" Mr. Tokugawa answered. You nodded then looked at Yujiro, then at the referee as if to ask if he was ever going to start the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\" Came the call from the Ref.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, here goes nothing,\" you said then let your eyes go and sprouted wings and a tail. Flexing them a little then, as they started to gaze in amazement, you started to change the rest of your body until you were a towering hybrid, looking down at Yujiro. You gave a growl as a light fireball rolled off your tongue and sent flames around your snout. You then let out a deafening roar that shook the seats around. \"Ok, King, Let's play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, an opponent worthy!\" he said with excitement and got into a posture. You let him get ready then bat your wings, propelling you forward and sending a clawed fist to him. He avoided it and it hit the ground, making a crater and an audible \"THUME\" echo through the place. But you didn't miss a step as you send the same arm in a backwards strike position to where he moved to. He landed a few strikes on you, but they bounced harmlessly off your scales. He kept moving, but while moving behind a normal opponent was a good move, not with you it wasn't. YOU had a tail. With that you wrapped him up and threw him into the barrier, breaking it. He flipped up and landed in the ring again. \"This is what I've been missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you are enjoying yourself. How about we take it up a notch.\" you suggested but didn't wait for him to agree. You increased your speed and came at him. His fighting prowess was better than you though, but not enough to save him from your ninja and dragon skills. At one point you caught a foot he aimed at your face in your jaws. You used the hold to restrain him while you got a grip and threw him to the air, only to use your tail to whiplash him into the ground like you did to his little student. But this guy was much stronger than the other kid was. \"Not a wise move, putting your foot in my jaws like that. If not for Sarah's request NOT to kill you, you would be one foot short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose she is your weakness then.\" He heaved out. He was breathing heavy, while you were still calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she's my strength, and way smarter than I am. Probably the only human that could kick my butt if she wanted. She is one scary human, when she loses her temper.\" You answered, giving her a toothy smile to tell her that it was a compliment. One she took comically brooding. \"So, are you done? Or do you still want to continue this entertaining diversion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep going, till you lay broken and dead at my feet.\" He answered with a growl of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize how comical that sounds coming from a human, threatening a dragon, right? You can't even breathe fire.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and she can?\" he asked, more to prove his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you answered as if it was only natural. He stood shocked for a moment. He looked over at Sarah, who had just got done doing the last hand sign and let out a huge jet of flames to prove you were right. He attacked again, but you caught him and threw him into the ground, again. But this time you pinned him down with your foot, your sharp claws around his body, digging into the ground underneath him. He tried to get up, but wasn't having any luck. \"So, should I have a barbeque or would you like to save the flame roasted look for when you actually can challenge me? Perhaps when you can at least manage a spark of flame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blew out some flames around you so you were among the fire, but it wasn't touching him, yet. The crowd had been going back and forth between screaming to cheering wildly. But little Yujiro was not backing down. Then  you got an idea. It was a long shot, but it just might appeal to a guy like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your idea???</span></div></div>",

You had thought that getting rid of Arlong and his crew would win them over but now they were more afraid of you than they were happy Arlong was gone. They had you stay as a dragon and where you were so not to have you near the town. With your enhanced hearing you started to hear the conversations around and it didn\u2019t make you feel any better. Since most of the topics were how to get you out of there. Eventually they even convinced Luffy that you were too dangerous to keep around. However you did as you instructed and remained completely still and eyes closed until they came to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dragon.\u201d Said Luffy\u2019s voice which was a bad sign. Sure he was either to innocent or stupid to know better than fear you but if he was calling you dragon instead of Max than he was not here with good news. You opened your eyes and of course they could only see one of them. As you focused on the crowd that was there and more directly on your fellow crew members most of them flinched, again not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to leave don\u2019t you?\u201d you asked with the other side of your mouth but it was impossible to completely hide the movement and it was obvious that they no longer trusted you as their eyes went straight for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Luffy said without a care in the world. Your expressions drooped a little but then you looked to Nami who was coming forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can\u2019t have someone that could swallow the ship in one gulp around all the time. We are all really glad you took care of Arlong but it also proved that if you were to lose control even for a second, it would mean our death.\u201d She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there is only one option.\u201d You said as you raised your head then setting a barrier between them and you so your transformation didn\u2019t harm them and removed it when you were human again. \u201cI chose being a pirate because it is the only faction I can think of that I would be able to live free despite my power. If I stay in one place than it will bring danger as people try to capture, kill, or enslave me. Luffy is the only pirate I would follow so if that option is no longer available than I should use the jutsu to take me to a different realm. Is that what you want?\u201d you asked more in confirmation than any kind of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is the only way than I suppose so.\u201d Zoro stated as Luffy didn\u2019t understand what you were really saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t eat us on the way out!\u201d Usopp requested and as usual got looks for being to direct and to loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ve made adjustments to it so I\u2019ll be out of your way in about an hour.\u201d You said after a sigh of almost depression at Usopp\u2019s remark. With that done you put up a barrier so no one went through or disrupted your work then started on the hand signs. You were closed to figuring out this jutsu but that was a relative term since you didn\u2019t know how truly complex it was as of yet. It could take minutes more or years to figure it out completely. True to your word you were done in just over an hour however this time you were full of energy from both the remains of Arlong and his crew along with the sun that was bearing down on you. \u201cThis is goodbye then.\u201d You said as you looked over at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s the portal you came through to get here.\u201d Zoro stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later.\u201d Luffy said with a smile. You looked down as he said that as you knew it wasn\u2019t the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 Well yeah maybe if I get back I will.\u201d You corrected mid sentence as you didn\u2019t want to trouble the happy and innocent captain with the weight of this decision. Unlike most people you left and were leaving behind in these realms, you actually wouldn\u2019t mind seeing him again. However from the look on the others face, they caught what you were going to say and understood it. With a wave you walked through the portal and let it close behind you. Your time in that one was short but slightly enjoyable in comparison and hopefully the next one would be better or back home. One thing was for sure though. Where ever you ended up you wouldn\u2019t be telling your secret so easily to them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your trip through the portal wasn\u2019t anything like the last time. Maybe it was because you weren\u2019t starving and abused but this time you spent only a short time in an almost dark void before you were let down on your feet into a very strange surrounding. The ground under you was hard and flat but not like rock. The buildings around were made of different materials and far larger, yet more fragile. Than as you walked you had to dodge many objects that were made of metal and glass but were on wheels and sounded like some kind of motor was in them. This type of trial and error kept on for a few weeks as you learned and observed your new environment. One nice young boy showed you how to use something called a computer and once you figured out how to use it without breaking it you sped through mountains of data to learn everything possible about this realm. The biggest thing in this realm for you was that dragons were idolized by some, and especially where you were, but mostly thought of as fictional. You also learned that for a 16 year old kid that you needed to be in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you created an identity and entered one that was close. You didn\u2019t really have a home but since you were a fully trained \u201cDragon Ninja\u201d as you thought of a combination of what your specialty was, you just materialized what you needed and lived on the street. The school was simple enough and despite the bullies you were able to live peacefully as long as you didn\u2019t excel at anything to high. You even let the gangs and bullies pick on you and, with a little genjustu, appeared pretty weak and pathetic. However as you could feel the increased skill in some of the higher class fighters such as a Girl named Miu and her friend Kenichi, you assumed that they could to you, to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s no fun when you just lay there.\u201d Said a kid from the karate club. It was a real pain when you allowed kids like this beat you up. You had to cast such a high genjutsu to cover your high muscle mass, to make injuries, and to cover up the movement so they didn\u2019t break their own bones when beating on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, get away from him!\u201d a voice said as a rather short kid you knew as Kenichi said which made the kid run. Ever sense he beat the leaders of the karate club Kenichi was feared by those under that level, at least the bullies. Some were too stupid to know he was far stronger than they were, which sometimes included Kenichi himself, but most understood their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you to Akisame.\u201d Miu said and you opened your mouth to refuse but she put a finger to your lips for you to hush. \u201cNone of that, this time I insist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would do what she says.\u201d Kenichi advised as he looked worried at your injuries. \u201cYou say all the time that you don\u2019t need medical attention but these don\u2019t look good at all.\u201d he said and it was true. Kenichi in particular but a few times Miu as well would break up a fight with you being beaten on to which you often said that you were \u2018ok\u2019 of \u2018would be fine\u2019. They were obviously weren\u2019t buying it this time as they helped you to the place they referred to. Halfway there you passed out. While usually you didn\u2019t need medical attention, the amount of energy you wasted on appearing weak was quite sizable and took a toll on your body. At times you cut yourself deep enough to make it stay around long enough to look convincing and did likewise with the bruises and such. You even had a few gunshot wounds from gangs and such. So this rest was welcome but a little awkward. You hoped they didn\u2019t take a blood sample. Once ounce of your blood would be all it took for them to know that you were far from human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke once your energy was back up. If you had to guess you would say they tried to feed you while you were asleep but the real energy came from the sun that was draping over you from the window. You listened around for a while to access where everyone was and concluded that no one was in the room. Heck, no one was in the building. You sat up in the bed, letting your back brace against the frame as you took in the room. Your human clothes were set out neatly and you looked to see your \u2018wounds\u2019 were bandaged. Quietly, you put your clothes back on and made the bed before going over to a chair and sitting. You were well aware of procedures that didn\u2019t allow patients to just leave and at the very least you had a bill to pay. Just in case you sat in the chair near the window so you could make a quick exit if necessary. You didn\u2019t have a very good experience with hospitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit I thought you would be up sooner than usual patients but I didn\u2019t think you would come around this quickly.\u201d Akisame stated as he walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I need to get to school so it makes sense that I get up before it starts.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not with wounds like that.\u201d He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if I let their bullying prevail in any way I would just be legitimizing it.\u201d You stated and surprisingly he knew what you meant. Normal people got lost in what you said in such phrases but he got it right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d he asked as he was well aware that you would have to hurry to make it to school on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if I was treated here there must be a fee and I wasn\u2019t just going to run away without paying.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well since Miu was the one that brought you in and apparently against your will I will wave it this time.\u201d He said with a smile but his eyes looked as if he was looking deep within you. You could tell this man was a very capable individual so he could know something was up but was making an effort not to show it. \u201cWell if you are feeling up for it than you should hurry. I do believe your school starts class in about a half an hour.\u201d He stated to which you bowed politely and headed off. You arrived just in time and at a slower rate than you were able, since you could smell a few people from the place you just exited following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, you need to learn to defend yourself.\u201d Kenichi said as you left school for the day. You were attacked again but they had arrived before it got too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is nowhere to teach me. Let\u2019s face it, the clubs at school are a joke with any serious training and most dojos are too afraid of a lawsuit to teach anything worth learning.\u201d You said with a half baked excuse. However it did have some truth to it. You were already above everyone\u2019s level so receiving additional instruction from infants in the arts was idiotic. But the real reason for not joining any was that you didn\u2019t want the attention and possible exposure of your other side. Although most were too dumb to expect anything near the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we have a solution to our problem.\u201d Kenichi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUR problem?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he means is that he feels compelled to protect you so he ends up in more fights than he would like. If getting you some training will help limit the number of fights he is in. Than it solves his desire to not fight and yours to get stronger.\u201d Miu explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is the solution?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I used to be like you and got picked on all the time. I still do but now I have the strength to not only protect myself but also protect others.\u201d he said but put more emphasis on the \u2018protecting others\u2019 point, but not in relation to you. \u201cI usually wouldn\u2019t suggest training with the Masters but then again if you all accept it will be a good step for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume it is some kind of Dojo?\u201d you asked to which they both nodded. \u201cAnd they would be willing to let me train with them, these Masters you spoke of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we ask.\u201d Miu stated. You would normally politely decline but they both had legitimate reasons why it made sense. Also you were actually going through withdrawal from not training and exerting necessary power like you used to. Not to mention that with all the bullies picking on you, you needed an outlet before you retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let\u2019s see if they will agree to it.\u201d You agreed and the both smiled and led the way, to Ryosanpaku.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not to mention be a little more outgoing than at school.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d asked another called Master Sakaki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at school and out in the world, being singled out as a strong fighter is more of a hindrance than an asset. I noticed that people that are strong are often sought by the weak for protection and the strong for a punching bag. The higher the rep the more collateral damage. Here I see that won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you seem to be very confident.\u201d Akisame said and you were amazed that he gathered that deduction from what you said. \u201cWe will first need to see what level you are so we can build you up from there. Miu can you test him for us?\u201d he asked to which she stopped her training with Kenichi and hurried over. He motioned to her and you nodded then stood. Then after moving to the middle and bowing to one another you got in a defensive stance but at an angle so you could block with one hand or foot from both sides without losing any dodging speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo your best.\u201d She said to which you nodded to which the Elder started the match. She came forward and started to attack, slowly at first. However as you easily deflected, dodged, and avoided her attacks with noticeably little effort and not even losing your breath as she sped it up and increased her effort until she was going all out but still not being able to make contact. \u201cWhat are you doing? Fight back.\u201d She advised with remarkably no frustration at her lack of contact but rather she was giving you advice. So at one of her attacks you caught a moment when she had the back of her neck exposed for a fraction of a second. You hit a pressure point and she froze as temporary paralysis set in. This move was like a button, if you could hit it right and all the people in the room looked on as you turned to the Masters for their instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery impressive but you should release her before she falls over.\u201d Akisame stated and you obediently poked the same spot on her neck, making her active once again. \u201cIt is clear you have some skill but we still need to see how much.\u201d With that said he got up and stood beside Miu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re going to test him yourself?\u201d Mui asked after she took a seat by Kenichi, who was watching you with bugged out eyes. He was leagues away from Miu\u2019s skill and she was the same to the Masters. But you were able to beat her in one poke while not surrendering one hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d He stated, you responded by getting into a more serious stance. This time when you started fighting you immediately saw why he was at the level of master. As his intensity increased so did yours and soon you were both moving around at dizzying speeds but like before you didn\u2019t let him land a single blow but you felt better about dealing them to a man at his level. Miu was just too fragile in comparison to fight seriously. As a Jujitsu Master he used a lot of throws as well but any that he did you simply reversed and sent him flying. However you were always careful not to damage the surfaces you fought on. The fight ended when you were able to get him in and restrain him with a hold where it was impossible to move. It was hard finding a move capable since the man was obviously at an insanely high level but everyone has things to learn so you used a move you saw a Jounin do one time on accident. \u201cVery impressive.\u201d He said after you let him go and in between breaths as he remained exhausted, but only for a moment. You were slightly more winded than before but not much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to be a student of the dojo?\u201d Sakaki asked, a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, I don\u2019t think that will be possible.\u201d the Elder said and you lowered your head at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is strong enough isn\u2019t he?\u201d Miu asked as she tried to understand her grandfather\u2019s decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point. Keeping him here as a student would be disgraceful. However as a fellow Master it would be tolerable.\u201d He said as if offering it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that you would let me stay as a Master?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you accept I think that would be a wonderful idea. You have many of the same reasons for being here than the rest of us do. What style do you specialize in?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was trained as a ninja and because of some tendencies of the jutsus I utilize I was known as a \u2018Dragon Ninja\u2019.\u201d You stated this got the woman named Shigure to peak her interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well than. If you accept we would like to offer a position as \u2018Master Max the Dragon Ninja\u2019.\u201d He stated formerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be happy to stay with you.\u201d you answered with a smile. The rest of the day was filled with things like getting you settled and in a room of your own. You settled for building your own as there was a shortage of spots and your life at Ryozanpaku.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that you had a place to go you didn\u2019t have to worry about people attacking you or people you lived with. Not a lot of people could pose a threat to your fellow masters or even Kenichi for that matter. Although the day after you moved it you were confronted by the same karate club bullies and soundly defeated them. Shortly after you were approached by a bunch of people to fight you but the fights hardly lasted more than a second or two and sometime ended with only a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t teach him anything?\u201d asked Miu as you all met to decide if you would also instruct Kenichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I can teach him a few things and help with some muscle training. But as far as ninja techniques and Jutsu, those require him to already have an understanding of Charkra. So I can\u2019t train him until he can do at least a transformation jutsu.\u201d You answered. \u201cHowever I wrote some scrolls on how to learn it. Once you know chakra is there it is easy to use, but also costly. Most ninja use weapons and hand to hand until the battle progress to genjutsu and ninjutsu.\u201d You said as you placed forward the scrolls in question in front of him so he could take them if he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are kidding right? The jutsu how you describe has been a lost art or fiction for ages.\u201d Master Sakaki retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could always show you a few, like the illusion jutsu.\u201d You said as multiple versions came from different parts of the room. \u201cJutsu are very useful in many respects\u2026 It can even\u2026 be used\u2026 for entertainment.\u201d You said from different illusion bases before they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Miu asked as she seemed captivated by what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be easier to instruct but we will still run into the same problem. I suggest you study with Kenichi and I\u2019ll show you both how to climb a tree at the same time.\u201d You said to which you got multiple looks of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClimb a tree?\u201d Apachai asked. \u201cWhat so hard about climbing a tree?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there is a rule; no hands.\u201d You said and seeing them still confused you got up and headed for the nearest pine tree, a few feet away. \u201cLike this.\u201d You said as you didn\u2019t miss a step as you walked straight up the tree like you were taking a stroll as well as walking upside down on a branch than staying there. \u201cSee, no hands.\u201d You waved your hands to clarify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided you demonstrated some other jutsu in some sparring matches or to wet Kenichi\u2019s appetite in learning what you gave him. He and Miu spent nights after their homework studying the scrolls and after a month or so they were finally doing some of the lower ranked jutsu and understood what you were saying about how tiring it was. But finally they got to the point that you accepted teaching them, Miu before Kenichi but the deal was they both had to succeed or neither would be trained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how it works.\u201d Miu said as you explained how and why the walking on tree exercise both worked and why it was a necessary step in leaning chakra control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, hypothetically, if you learn this one and the technique after it you should be able to master any justu.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the next step?\u201d asked Kenichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater, you have enough on your plate with this one.\u201d You said and they both bowed and turned to their perspective trees to implement and learn what you taught.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This whole process of beating you weaklings up is really getting to be a drag.\u201d You said then half realizing that you were referring to the situation like Shikamaru did and laughed a little. The group of men and boys attacked but with, what looked like no movement, but was really a sever rotation utilizing wind charkra you knocked them all into the air and they landed hard on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what was that?\u201d asked a female voice from behind. You turned to see a girl with red hair and very defined legs. While she looked overall athletic you were drawn to her almost slitted green eyes. You turned fully and sniffed the air.

However you still liked her eyes and gazed into them as they into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a sorry attempt at negotiations. Some girl names Kisara sent them, you don\u2019t happen to know where she is do you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I would ask her to stop sending these weaklings to get their faces beaten in. If she wants to talk than she should come herself. But I have no intention of joining this Ragnarok gang thing that they kept clinging to.\u201d You stated and judging but her tone and attitude you guessed that she was Kisara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it just so happened that I am Kisara. Why are you staring at me if you don\u2019t want to join my crew?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour eyes, they are rather unique and intense. I rarely see eyes like that and when I do it is on people who don\u2019t deserve them. At first glance you look like a frail little girl but now that I see them and the way you carry yourself I can tell that you are definitely higher than these. I would even go as far as to say that you have great potential. If you trained right you really could be a scary young lady. Definitely not one I would want to fight alone in a dark alley.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m strong enough!\u201d she yelled and came at you with a high kick that you blocked with a finger but clamped around her leg and held it there. From there you lifted and brought her down so her legs and arms were pinned; her arms under her back and her legs with your weight on her to hold her and them stead and still. You looked into her eyes from this new distance and they glared at you. You slitted your eyes for her but didn\u2019t change their color or made them glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I agree. You\u2019re strong enough to deal with petty street rabble and the occasional decent fighter but you limit yourself to much. I\u2019ve seen women that could literally reduce the bedrock of a Cliffside to rubble with a single hit and others that could take down armies or fully armed men in seconds. You have that potential but it is wasted on what you think is strength and power.\u201d You said back and she listened and gazed into your eyes as you did her\u2019s. But eventually you got off her and started walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you think I could even beat that cow?\u201d she asked. You looked at her as if to explain. \u201cI think her name is Miu or something. That Kenichi kid is in love with her I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now. You\u2019re too occupied with gaining status rather than true skill. To get better you need to find a master or at least someone that is better than you to learn from. She has been training since she was in diapers so if you want to catch up you\u2019re going to need do likewise. But I stand by what I said. I see a lot of potential in you Miss. Kisara. More than some high school gang deserves to hoard. See you around.\u201d You said and disappeared from view as some other people were coming. You raced back and rested in your house before doing a little training yourself. You had multiple jutsus to perfect and that portal jutsu to work on as well. Not to mention the muscle training.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFire style, fire dragon justu.\u201d You said as you worked on a fire version of the water dragon. Usually the problem was that there wasn\u2019t enough fire to create one but with you breathing fire it solved that problem but opened up another with the whole secret thing. Breathing fire would be a sure way to say that you are very different so you had to do so in a way that allowed for the end result. In a series of complicated moves you figured it out and was well on your way to controlling it. The fire dragon soared above you as you directed it around, stabilizing its accuracy and heat that different parts of it emitted, giving it a roar for extra theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What the hell is that?\u201d asked a voice. You knew it was Kisara so you retracted the dragon until it was little more than a candle flame then disappeared. You looked over at her as she looked at you in wonder while Akisame had been escorting her and the others watching as you trained, well the ones that weren\u2019t training Kenichi at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you have a guest.\u201d Stated Akisame and you bowed to him as he did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a high level fire jutsu known as the Fire Dragon jutsu.\u201d You said and produced a mini one in your hand before snuffing it out. \u201cKisara, why are you here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you teach me to do that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly, if you could do other high level fire jutsu.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJutsu?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA ninja technique. There are multiple kinds of jutsu and whole series of jutsu in each kind.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 well I was wondering if.\u201d She stumbled then went down and bowed with her face to the ground in front of you. \u201cWill you be my master?\u201d she asked. Kenichi almost fell over when he heard this and most of everyone else was surprised but looked glad that someone was actually asking you rather than seeing you as a side show after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have only one rule for me to accept. You must do everything I say. If that means stripping naked in front of countless strangers or killing yourself and those you care for than you must do so without hesitation. I don\u2019t have time to waste on someone who will quit and whine about every little hard or confusing exercise I give them. If you can do that then my answer is yes.\u201d You stated. You knew that this was a tall order and that normally people would shy away from it. But as she was on the fence as far as morality was concerned you had to be sure that, if she learned the more deadly art you could teach her, she would listen and obey the terms and conditions of their use. To the others it showed that if she accepted that they didn\u2019t have to worry about her and if not she would just leave. She seemed to think about it for a while as she was in her face down position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell! What kind of bogus rule is that?\u201d Kenichi asked as Miu was also confused but not willing to speak out. \u201cYou train us all the time and never expect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd look where it\u2019s gotten you. A ninja has to train with chakra and train to kill if necessary. It has been a few months and still you haven\u2019t made it even a few feet up on that tree. That is because you have other things and training to do and that is your choice. She isn\u2019t asking to go through that training. She is asking for me to train her and if she wants me to teach her the ninja way than she must obey me with no question. The stuff I can teach her could kill someone easily or her if she does them wrong. So the slightest hesitation in following my order in such a situation could cause multiple deaths and countless amounts of destruction. That and if she goes rough and starts using her ninja power immorally I have full reign to kill her before she wipes out thousands of lives.\u201d You explained and he backed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t that make her your slave?\u201d asked Miu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it will.\u201d You said simply then as they were about to speak you started again. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and say that it will be easy or that I\u2019m going to expect her to sit down and eat sweets for the rest of her life. I plan on putting her through hell if she accepts. But you know all too well Kenichi that it is a sure way to learn years of training in a vastly short amount of time.\u201d You said then turned to Kisara. \u201cJust so you know. The first thing I\u2019m going to make you do is go in that house and strip naked and wait for me to check you out. Then after I am satisfied I will require you to quit Ragnarok.\u201d You said and saw her expression, even in her position, change a little. You saw that she was on the edge. She had just seen your do something when she came in the sparked her imagination and her urge to get stronger was a definite factor. But like most humans she had her pride and her tendency to be in control and not looked down on for being a woman was forcing her to battle with the other points. Her body shook a little as she fought internally for what she would do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Undress then stand in the center of the room and wait.\u201d You instructed. She got up and went over. You watched as she went and Kenichi was speechless until the door closed and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind telling me what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Akisame asked for the rest of them as they gathered around you in varying degrees of seriousness for what you just told her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time to train someone that is going to die of cancer or a heart attack. I have some magic that will heal her completely but I have to see what is wrong. Old wounds, previously broken bones that haven\u2019t healed right, cancer, weak heart, and so on are just some of the things I can take from her. If she has so much as a broken bone that hasn\u2019t healed properly, the training I am about to give her will shatter them like toothpicks. But I needed it to sound like a highly perverted demand to prevent any kind of pride based obedience issues later on. She just showed that she is willing and able to trust me regardless of what her personal stance is on the matter.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Kenichi asked. You answered by touching a new cut he got on his head and in a flash it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do a lot of things. If she commits herself to what I have in mind, then she may be near master level in a month or so. Now I think your break is over Kenichi and I got some work to do.\u201d You said and they nodded and Kenichi was grabbed by an excited Apachai and carried off for training while you went to your small house that Kisara was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath then melted into the walls and came through on the other side of them. A way of entering using chakra that you found useful when Miu wanted to get dressed away from any prying eyes. You quietly approached her as she stood in the room and looked to you. She almost covered herself but you shook your head and she put her hands to her sides as you circled to her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d she almost spat but for the sake of her future training she didn\u2019t do so that offensively. You ignored it and started looking at parts of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you touched part of her head and a glowing red line appeared where there was an old fracture in her skull, probably from another fight. She didn\u2019t  see what you were doing until you touched her arm and another fracture was outlined. You touched her right breast and a blotch was indicated. You continued this until all her\u2026 problems were noted for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you are wondering why I had you strip. I will explain myself only this once. Do you see all the red marks that are now erupting from your body?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are health concerns. Such as this one.\u201d You said as you pointed to her arm. \u201cYou broke your arm a while ago and didn\u2019t get it set. Now it is healed but not like it should\u2019ve been. If I let this go unchecked then the amount of pressure I\u2019m about to put you through would shatter that bone. And this\u2026\u201d you pointed to her breast to which she blushed and angered a little. \u201cDid you know you had breast cancer? Not very far along but you would be dead by 50 if you left it unchecked.\u201d You said and she looked at the mark with a combination of disbelief and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have cancer?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in a couple places that wouldn\u2019t show until your late 30s but it also impedes your progress in training by a small amount. This I can\u2019t allow. So\u2026 I\u2019m going to heal all your health problems. Do you have any questions? This is the last time I will accept you talking back while being my student. And once you learn a single jutsu than you will be my student and my responsibility. That means if you start slaughtering people for fun or start choosing equally heinous crimes I will kill you. So this is your last shot to quit out of this. After I heal you. I will expect you to do what I say to the letter and without any hesitation. No talking back, no whys, no complaining, and no disobedience. You do what I say when I say it. Now with no one here to hear or judge you, what do you say?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit I thought you were just going to try and take advantage of me. Telling a girl to strip naked right away is just\u2026 wrong. But not for you, my Master.\u201d She said as she looked into your eyes with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, don\u2019t move. This is going to hurt a little bit.\u201d You said and put a hand on her chest, below her neck but above her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look into your eyes as they changed to your dragon eyes. Full of concentration as you used your magic to pull all her aliments out and into your body for it to deal with them. However you also input a general knowledge of chakra and its use. Not too much but just enough to rival a genin level ninja fresh out of the academy. She winced at the pain but, true to your command, she didn\u2019t move. It was over in a few minutes and you both crumbled to the ground. Your body worked out her aliments and healed you body of them as she made sense of the new information she had and her more fluid movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is feels really good. I never knew I had this power inside me.\u201d She said as she flexed her chakra a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, put these on. You can change into your clothes after you get done training, if you get done for the day.\u201d You said with a grin as you stood and handed her some ninja training clothes. She took them and put them on as you placed her other clothes on a shelf in a neat pile then turned to her as she finished dressing. \u201cNow let\u2019s begin.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMaster?\u201d asked Kisara as she approached. She was limping a little and very sore after yet another day at hard training. She stayed with you, mostly, but you slept outside on clear nights like there was at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara?\u201d you asked back as she took a spot next to you and you both laid on the ground with your heads against the same log while looking up at the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me to quit Ragnarok and I did. But I have to tell the leadership about it. I had planned to tell them then run back here. I mean they\u2019d be crazy to attack a place with so many masters. But with the level of fatigue I have I don\u2019t think I can outrun them and fighting them would just get me broken bones that you\u2019d have to heel. So I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind helping me with it?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally a master never interferes with a student\u2019s battles. However they are also attacking me on a daily basis and I find it rather annoying. And you do make a good point. Usually, if you were like Kenichi back when he first started, I\u2019d say just tough it out. But with this group might actually kill you in your weakened state. Although you\u2019d be surprised what your training has improved so far. Normal people can\u2019t use chakra at all, so if you were at 100% I\u2019d say that you should do it yourself. But you aren\u2019t and I can\u2019t have you out for a few weeks nursing injuries when you should be training. Good thing tomorrow is Saturday. We\u2019ll go speak with them in the morning.\u201d You said and she got a cheerful look on her face. \u201cAfter your morning training.\u201d You said, which switched her expression to a pained one but still had a grateful look in her eyes that you didn\u2019t have to see to know it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning she worked hard to finish her morning as fast as she could. But with her still sore body it wasn\u2019t that fast. She was still losing badly to how well Kenichi was doing. But she never complained, to you anyway, as you would just add more reps if she did. Truth was, you were increasing her training so it appeared she wasn\u2019t making any progress. But in actuality she was much higher than Kenichi at this point. You took out a few guards, gently, and eventually made it to some kind of warehouse with a bunch of kids with their numbered gloves on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cValkyrie\u2026 well saying that you\u2019re late is an understatement. And who is this kid you brought with you?\u201d asked a boy with a number \u20181\u2019 glove on and a white suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s your show. I\u2019ll step in if you need me but at least attempt to do this on your own.\u201d You said then backed up a little to give her room. She nodded at this and stepped forward to put even more distance between her and you. In her training, she had learned a few different jutsu at the basic level and some like the substitution jutsu for fighting. But she was obviously not at 100% and they saw it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is my master. I\u2019ve come here to officially resign from Ragnarok.\u201d She said in a clear voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, and what if we defeat your master?\u201d someone with a weird set of glasses asked. She looked back at you as multiple versions of himself surrounded you. The best way to describe you at that point was unimpressed and even gave a yawn to that effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my choice and my fight. Leave my master out of it Loki, or\u2026\u201d she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr else what?\u201d he asked sarcastically as his \u2018clones\u2019 rushed you. But you used a cyclone jutsu without moving to send them up into the air and land unconscious on the ground. You never got out of your board persona as you waited. \u201cWha\u2026 what the hell?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s your funeral if you attack him.\u201d Kisara said and you just raised your arms in a \u2018sorry about that\u2019 expression that got her to giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Asked another girl that looked like a young adult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before. I need to walk my own path. He is more than adequate to be accepted as my master. I want to get stronger and he is teaching me how.\u201d She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talk about him like Odin or Hermit does about the great Sage Fist.\u201d Said a rather large, again young adult looking, guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met him. But I would guess that my master is stronger.\u201d She said and this got a boy with a hood on to chime in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dare mock the Sage Fist?\u201d the hooded boy boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you really are just a bunch of kids, hot tempers and all. But I\u2019ve had my fill. Kisara, unless you intend to challenge them I would like to get back and resume training. Although fighting them might be easier.\u201d You interrupted and that got more tempers flying but they were silenced by the white suited boy standing and walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really stronger than the Sage Fist?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, if you\u2019re talking about the man in the all white robes that pokes around from time to time then definitely. But then again, I haven\u2019t fought him so I wouldn\u2019t know for sure until then. But I am on a level a few higher than master so it would only make sense that I\u2019m near or beyond it. However there is always someone better so you never know.\u201d You said with a shrug. He responded by striking you with enough speed to be impressive, well for a kid. But you had long casted a genjutsu so when the body he hit the wall behind and Kisara saw it she knew all too well from her training with you that it wasn\u2019t you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s genjutsu.\u201d She said as she laughed at the boy\u2019s confidence at taking you down. In reality you were standing upside down on a beam above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? You \u2018master\u2019 just got pummeled by Odin and you are stuck in some kind of delusion.\u201d Loki started but stopped after Odin struck at her as well. What they didn\u2019t see was that you had revealed yourself to her and she jumped up to join you. You then were controlling genjutsu puppets while remaining hidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGenjutsu. A set of Ninja techniques that mess with an person\u2019s mind or perception.\u201d Kisara stated as her puppet got up as did yours. For extra theater you gave them broken bones and a few gushing wounds from the impact and strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the\u2026\u201d said a boy that was in a red jacket of sorts and chewing some bubble gum. He jumped down and put a punch to your puppet\u2019s face and it was then you had an idea. When he connected the head flew off the shoulders and blood spurted everywhere. Your head bounced around like a bouncy ball before coming to a stop in front of him, along with the lifeless puppet body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just thought that scaring the crap out of them would be a fun activity while showing you a basic illusion genjutsu.\u201d You responded and, for an extra effect, used the hand on the puppet body to scratch the head that was talking as if trying to think. Kisara just laughed as her agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIllusion?\u201d asked \u2018Odin\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, illusion.\u201d You said then made the images disappear, along with the blood and other things you created to freak them out. You then revealed yourself and Kisara to which they looked up as you both dropped down. \u201cNow I got a bone to pick with you, Odin is it?\u201d you said then rushed forward and lifted him up by the throat. Not tight enough to impede breathing but hard enough that he couldn\u2019t escape. You backhanded the red jacket boy, who flew into a box some of the others were sitting on. \u201cI am getting really tired of all these idiots that you send after me. As a master I won\u2019t interfere with Kenichi or Kisara if you wish to pursue them. But if you target me then I\u2019ll be back. So unless you are organizing a fight with this \u2018Sage Fist\u2019 you keep blabbering about than bug off.\u201d You said with a fake smile then tossed him back into one of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Kisara asked and you just nodded as you both headed out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, we\u2019re not done!\u201d said the boy in the red jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we are. You\u2019re all too weak for me to fight, just little kids.\u201d You said as you continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not better than me!\u201d he said as he rushed forward. But you sprouted a fire dragon from flames you created in an outburst of charkra. The boy skidded to a stop and ran to join the others as they looked at the 70 foot tall Fire Dragon justu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like repeating myself. You can challenge me when my little friend here is no longer a concern. Otherwise you\u2019ll be fried and served as breakfast.\u201d You said as your eyes glowed and they stumbled back while the dragon you controlled coiled and flew around the warehouse until retracting into you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got to teach me how to do that.\u201d Kisara said as you both started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne thing at a time. I just learned it and I don\u2019t even know if you can do fire jutsu yet. But there are plenty of amazing jutsu out there and if they don\u2019t appeal to you, then you can always make your own.\u201d You said casually as you both walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyway, thanks for coming with me. It was sure a lot of fun to see them squirm like that.\u201d She said as she thought back to their faces when your head was talking, after being separated from your shoulders. Even if it was just a Genjutsu, they didn\u2019t know that, which made their faces and expressions priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they were picking a fight with me anyway. But for future reference you should fight your own battles, it builds experience and teaches you restraint.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRestraint?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t want to say anything until it was more obvious but you\u2019re already much stronger than any of them back there. The way I have your training set up, you don\u2019t see the results until way later. So when you get into fights it would be really easy to kill someone if you\u2019re not careful. Your moral decision on the matter, no matter how mad you get, will determine why you are different from them.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so. If you hadn\u2019t held back with me when I attacked I know I\u2019d be dead. But there is something bothering me. You said that there is always someone better. Who\u2019s better than you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But you didn\u2019t know I was better than you until I revealed myself. So if there is someone better than me. Well they would probably be able to do the same and hide or avoid me if they wished. In the end it is safer to assume there is someone out there that is stronger so I train to make sure that list remains as short as possible.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She said and looked down as she walked. \u201cDo you think I could beat Miu?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think that if it came down to it you would be able to kill her but not defeat her. I\u2019ve been focusing on your chakra control lately and moves that specialize in utilizing it. A ninja are not usually sought out for a sparring match. Usually it is stuff like assassination and death matches. Therefore the move sets and tendencies are different. You wouldn\u2019t be able to safely spar with her until you master your control so you don\u2019t accidentally kill her out of reflex. That amount of hesitation in a sparring match would only make you lose as it stands now.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t want me to kill then why are you teaching me those kind of attacks?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinja need to know many different styles to prevent death themselves. By knowing those moves and how to counter them you will be less susceptible to them. Imagine that with all Kenichi\u2019s training, only a single poisoned Kunai would be needed to kill him. Since you know how to block, avoid, and throw Kunai you have a better chance than he does in the same situation. Eventually when you fight someone new you will be able to read and utilize their own style against them. The more you know the more efficient you will become in both attack and defense. For instance if plunge a sword into your gut I can do so to kill you, or I can hit a nerve just to the left of your spinal column that would paralyze you for an hour or so. First I learned the sword technique, then I learned how to use the same motion for a different purpose.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a lot of work.\u201d She sighed and you just laughed as you both walked on home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEarth style, head hunter jutsu.\u201d You said as you attempted it on Kisara. You had taken her to a secluded island so you could teach and practice more impressive jutsu while fighting on a more realistic level. It had been a month and she had just reached Jounin level and knew many jutsu but since she was in the middle of the city she was unable to use most of the higher profile ones. She had been getting good enough to avoid some of your attacks and while you weren\u2019t going full power against her she was doing quite well and actually was making it fun for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire style, fire ball jutsu.\u201d She said back and shot one at the ground where you were to which you threw a kunai with a teleportation mark on it so you could move out of the way quickly to where you threw it. This continued until you finally got her when she ran out of chakra, or enough to do any jutsu. With a  water gun jutsu you finished your sparring match as she collided with a rock then sank to the bottom of it. \u201cNot fair. You have more Chakra than I do.\u201d She whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell than it is a good thing my mission isn\u2019t to kill you, or you\u2019d be dead. But you lasted for much longer this time. It\u2019s different fighting with jutsu and defending against it, rather than the restricted style we are forced to use in the city, isn\u2019t it?\u201d you asked as you sat beside her, both of you looking over the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can\u2019t tell you how frustrating it is to not use this stuff with my old Ragnarok pals. But I guess it just means that I\u2019m just that much better for restraining and still being able to kick their ass.\u201d She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara, there is something I want to show you\u2026 or maybe I should tell you first, then show you.\u201d You said in a nervous voice. She had never seen you nervous before. Usually you knew exactly what to do and when to do it, perks of having a dragon instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell me anything Master, you know that.\u201d She said as she looked at you and you turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I should say that I lied. I lied when I said that my fire jutsu and eyes are what made me a \u2018dragon ninja\u2019 although now that I\u2019ve given you dragon eyes I think my definition has changed.\u201d You said as you brushed some of her hair away from her eyes. You had created a dou jutsu that you could insert, similar to the Sharingan but using your own eyes as the source and it could be passed on after implantation. If she activated it, her eyes would turn red and look like your dragon eyes but not glow. Potentially they gave the wearer all the vision of a dragon. On a more practical note she could use it to look through genjutsu and see leagues away and with great detail. She could tap into night vision or heat vision and catch the slightest movement in a forest. It made finding a needle in a haystack a piece of cake. She wasn\u2019t as good with them yet but then again she was the first you gave it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was the reason?\u201d she asked and hoping she wasn\u2019t asking too much as you looked away then up at the sky like you weren\u2019t going to see it again as well as longing to soar in it, free and clear with no restrictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst understand, that I have been betrayed, shunned, and cursed by anyone that knows. As my student I can order you to stay silent and obey me anyway but I would rather not have to. Even IF you accept it, others will not and can not follow your example. I also want you to know that no matter what you think after I tell you this, I am the same person and feel the same way about you. You are my precious student and I will not harm you, well nothing besides our usually life and death training. But even passed all this I think that I can trust you with the secret. Most of all I don\u2019t want my past to creep up on me and turn you before I can explain for myself.\u201d You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t judge you, or run, or anything like that. Promise.\u201d She said, taking your hand in hers then stroking it and almost playing with your digits. She liked to massage your hands for some reason and you didn\u2019t mind, actually she was rather good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk her it goes.\u201d You said then breath in deep before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m only half human. I\u2019m a half-breed and can change from completely human to completely what my other side is. I\u2019m assuming you can guess what my other half is.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying the you\u2019re a dragon, or half dragon?\u201d she asked and you nodded. She had froze and therefore stopped her hand massage to which you retracted it. \u201cIs that why you have dragon eyes and why you could give them to me?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of it. A normal dragon can\u2019t do that. But I\u2019ve been trained as a ninja while in human form and the knowledge and power of both sides carry over to the other side. I can just as easily do jutsu as a dragon and just as easy breath fire as a human. Which is why you can\u2019t learn the fire dragon jutsu. It requires a lot of fire and I breath it to make it work. I can also grow certain dragon parts in human form, which is how I can make my eyes glow. They are actually my dragon eyes.\u201d You said, growing claws then retracting them to prove your point. At this point you didn\u2019t know if you should stop there or continue. There is only so much you can say before you have to admit that you came from a different realm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, that just makes you a better Master than one could dream of. How much better could someone do to learn fire jutsu from a dragon.\u201d She complimented, trying to lighten your mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that ignorance is still bliss. Well there\u2019s more, but how about I show you my dragon form first. Then I\u2019ll change back and we can talk more.\u201d You said then stood and leaped back so she was safe from both the blast and your size. She jumped over the rock you two were sitting against to watch. You then exploded to which she covered herself, then looked in shock at the enormous dragon before her. She would\u2019ve fell off the cliff if not for the rock behind her. You flexed your wings a little as it had been so long and as a side effect it blew the excess smoke and fire away. She was shaking badly at the sight of you. But it was hard to tell why she was shaking. Part of it was defiantly fear, but the other parts were still unclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026Master?\u201d she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Kisara, I told you that I wouldn\u2019t harm you. You are my student and I am your master, even when I\u2019m like this.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026 touch you?\u201d she asked. You answered by bringing your head forward then laid on the ground. She shuffled forward then took more hesitating steps. It took near 10 minutes for her outstretched had to make contact with your snout. But once she did she began moving it and walking around your head, trailing her hand up and down as she walked and admired you. She stopped at your eyes and saw the familiar glowing red eye she had seen so many times. When she was done and looked at your colossal mass she and gave a close claw, that was taller than her, a brief tap she came in front of you and to the rock so you could talk without her being in direct line with her. \u201cWow, you\u2019re so\u2026 People all over dream of meeting or even seeing a dragon. They would die for a chance to touch one and here you are.\u201d She said in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is interesting to see how each realm reacts to me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRealm? Are you saying you\u2019re from another planet?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. You see\u2026 imagine the realms like the worlds on T.V. What if you could go there. That is what it is like. In a sense I\u2019m still from earth, just not the one you know. Every realm is different and every one has their way of looking at dragons. The first one and my home are hostile. There are hundreds of thousands of dragons and they are unofficial enemies with humans. It is actually where I get my hatred from dragons from. It is a very savage world. The next one was friendly but treated me as more of a weapon and when I ran away I was evil, or so they said. The one before this, they are afraid and respect dragons. Finally this realm almost idolizes us. But I don\u2019t think that if a government would find me that they would be too willing to harbor me.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you hate dragons but you are one, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d she asked. You resorted to your old trick and turned then exposed your side to her. She gasped at the scares but since there were more than one story you let you wing off the spots so you could tell them. \u201cWhat horrible\u2026 who did that to you?\u201d she asked. She made a few steps toward you but when you brought your head around to address her she back away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are from my mother.\u201d You said as you used your tail to point to the fang scars she gave you. \u201cYou see\u2026 on my world, Half-breeds are hunted and killed on sight, even at birth. My mother did this to me not minutes after I hatched and it wasn\u2019t out of duty, it was out of selfishness and pleasure. Most dragons have serious pride and superiority issues. In their relation to humans they also admire their taste so they tend to\u2026 well you get the point. I hate them for that. I hate how they treat others and humans, I hate that they kill their own children, I hate their demented view of pride, I hate everything about them.\u201d you said with a growl that shook the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, you hate other dragons.\u201d Kisara said, waving her hands in a motion to calm you down. \u201cAnyway, what are the other ones from?\u201d she asked, trying to change the subject but it just turned your angered eyes to deeply sad ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe realm that I was exiled to from my mine did this. At first they accepted me and it is where I learned the way of the ninja. But one day I was on a rescue and retrieval mission with a little support and my comrades were gravely injured. So I did the only thing I could, I swallowed them.\u201d You said them paused but that was all she needed to ask the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate them?\u201d she asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I swallowed them. Like I said, I can just as easily do magic and jutsu in dragon form than I can as a human. I also have a second stomach used for storage where no digestion takes place. If I combine the healing magic and jutsu I learn with my flesh literally all around them, I can multiply my effective healing powers my at least 10. So I swallowed them and started to heal them. It ended up being a very draining task to fulfill the mission, heal some that were so close to death, and transport over 10 people to safety miles away. When I got there I was very weak and couldn\u2019t explain myself and heal them so I concentrated on healing them. But then\u2026\u201d you stopped and she could see tear start to flow as you traced the long scar on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it.\u201d Kisara said but you sniffed and decided to continue anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey overreacted and cut them out of me. There I was half dead already and they didn\u2019t really trust me at all. The pain was so great that I passed out but only after I learned a new magic and transferred their wounds to me before they were cut out of my storage stomach. When I awoke they had sewn me back up but placed paper bombs inside me and took the girl that came after me from my home realm. They used the paper bombs like a leash. If I did anything they didn\u2019t like they made one explode; taking, growling, even trying to explain myself. Then they hit me with the final blow. The girl they took from me and who I considered my family, they wiped her mind so she too hated me. With that loss I left to the next realm\u2026\u201d You said and told of you adventures with Luffy then until present day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But them you felt a light pressure near one of them and shot it open to see what Kisara was doing. She was there, right in front of your eye, wiping away the tears you had shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster\u2026 you don\u2019t have to worry about that with me. I promise that even IF you were to turn evil and rip me apart. I would follow you and let you do it. I just trust you that much. I don\u2019t care if others would call me a sucker for doing it, I won\u2019t fade away from this. If you let me, I\u2019ll be near you no matter what. I don\u2019t care if you destroy the whole world or save it. You\u2019re my Master and being a big dragon won\u2019t change it. Although\u2026\u201d She said as she lifted your upper lip and looked at some of your large teeth. \u201c\u2026it is probably going to take a while to get use to these.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara\u2026 thanks.\u201d You said, not knowing what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one thing, have you ever eaten a cat?\u201d she asked as she looked at your teeth, obviously for tearing meat apart for eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there was this one time. When I was little I was trapped by a mountain lion. I was really little so it got me in its mouth and tried to chew me up. But it didn\u2019t count on my scales being so strong or my tail.\u201d You said and flattened it so she could see what you meant. \u201cI was so scared so I plunged in up and though its brain and ate for a week. Other than that there wasn\u2019t really any house cats near my area and that mountain lion was a lone cat so\u2026 I guess I have if you count that time. But other than that they are too small for me to consider them a good meal.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, cause if you did I\u2019d have to kick your ass.\u201d She stated then smiled. You had almost forgot about her love for cats. You were actually thankful that she asked that before the one about eating humans. Although she already knew you did from your story. \u201cDoes the others at the dojo know about this?\u201d she asked as she pet your eye ridge to which you purred a little. She remarkably knew it was a purr rather than a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I guess I am too scared to tell anyone. I only show my ninja side with them. I know I\u2019m going to have to leave this realm eventually. I also expect that those other ninja to come around to get me as well, someday. I\u2019m just too big of an asset to lose. I wouldn\u2019t want to harm this realm any with their interaction. As you can now see, having multiple ninja at your level and higher would not be a good thing over here. But a sure way for them to force me away from this realm is to get them to turn on me. And of course an easy way for that to happen is to tell them about me. I just couldn\u2019t bare one of those people being you.\u201d you returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I would betray you?\u201d she asked, slightly hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you were told that I was really a evil, blood thirsty dragon who is wishing for a feast and I hadn\u2019t told you anything how would you react. That is why I told you. Now you know and that won\u2019t be a problem. Even if they do come I know that you wouldn\u2019t and that is enough for me. Maybe I\u2019ll tell them eventually but not right now. Let\u2019s wait until your training is finished, then maybe I can get them to listen. But if they don\u2019t react well I would have to leave again.\u201d You answered and she felt better but concerned about you leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, make them believe you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want fake friends or ones that are only there because they think I\u2019ll eat them if they don\u2019t. I want friends like you and how Sarah used to be. But since she is gone you are all I have left. You\u2019re the closest thing to family I got. You\u2019re like a sister and I\u2019ll protect you with my life if I have to.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster\u2026 will you take me with you?\u201d she asked and when she heard only silence she continued. \u201cIf you need to go somewhere else will you take me with you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are strong enough. There\u2019s no point in taking you with me if those ninja are just going to turn you as well. But if you were to get strong enough so that it was no longer an issue than\u2026 I would love it if you came along with me.\u201d You said to which she just hugged your head. All of a sudden you flicked her away and exploded back to human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d she said as she got up and you walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t have anyone see me like that, well accept you.\u201d you said then pointed up to a plane that was passing over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got a lot of work to do anyway, if I want to get good enough to come with you when the time comes.\u201d She said and got into her stance. You smiled and did the same as you two got back to training.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through the following weeks, Kisara hit her stride and started absorbing more and more of what you taught her. She had gotten to the point where she could use Dragon\u2019s Eye without a major strain on her chakra or mind. Finally her test was upon her. Her goal was to be a master but also reach a level that she could defeat Miu without causing long term damage. The elder and the other Masters watched as they fought in a match where Kisara couldn\u2019t use any ninjutsu or Genjutsu. She was only allowed things that improved her fighting style like Dragon\u2019s Eye and fie tuned chakra control to enhance her speed, strength, and other abilities. Finally the match was over and Kisara won but with the restrictions she was under it took a lot out of her, but not as much as Miu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fair. She used that Dragon\u2019s Eye again.\u201d Kenichi stated. He might\u2019ve been a little upset since he and Miu were still on basic levels of ninja techniques. The best jutsu Miu could do was the substitution jutsu and that took a lot of chakra from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admit, the Dragon\u2019s Eye is a rather hefty advantage.\u201d The Elder agreed. \u201cBut so is what strength and skill we all learn from such diligent training. Max, did she pass your test?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Miu?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is very strong, but she seemed to be hesitating. Even though she beat me and I feel out matched with her Dragon\u2019s Eye and Chakra control, the hesitation in her moves made it possible for the fight to last as long as it did.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. She does need more experience in restraint and fluid motion under those circumstances.\u201d You said to which Kisara frowned as she heaved alongside Miu against a wall they were leaning on. \u201cHowever, I did see what I was looking for. She didn\u2019t mess up once as evidence to the lack of damage from the fight. Though her hesitation provided openings, in a real ninja battle she wouldn\u2019t be restricted from using assassination moves and death blows like her body has been trained to do. I welcome the first addition to the Dragon Ninja ranks.\u201d You said to which Kisara\u2019s frown turned to a smile but was too tired to show her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018the first addition\u2019?\u201d Akisame asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my designation of being a \u2018Dragon Ninja\u2019 originated as a description, not a classification. It was only when the elder officially recognized it did it become such. So in a sense, I am the founder of the style.\u201d You explained, the nodded in understanding. \u201cNow, if you would accept my request Elder, I would like Kisara to start training formally at the dojo.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what reason?\u201d he asked as he stroked his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has learned all I can teach her. She now needs experience and training in multiple martial arts to expand her knowledge. Most of what she know now are too deadly to be used in a match or fight, where death is not the desired outcome. She can only get so far when only sparring against me.\u201d You explained, both to the masters and to Kisara as she was also confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould she still be your student?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answered bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen as a fellow master at the dojo where you reside I accept. I guess she has been technically a member of this dojo ever since you took her in. What do you say young girl? Are you willing and able to receive our training?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be\u2026 Yes, I am.\u201d She stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara, you know you still have to do your morning workout. So don\u2019t think this will be easy.\u201d You warned. This got her to hang her head comically and cause the others to laugh, she followed suit after a short reprieve from her thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were going well around you, well minus Kenichi\u2019s Ragnarok troubles. Fortunately they were wise enough to not attack you or Kisara. However all your peace and happiness was bound to run dry eventually. It started with a scent you smelled. It was faint and you didn\u2019t really remember what it was at first. But once you caught it again it was unmistakable. You smelled a few Leaf Ninja that you knew all too well. Most of the scents were usually well hidden even from your nose, so you couldn\u2019t figure out who was there but the overall smell was hard to forget. You constantly touched your scar that that indicated the where they cut into you. The smaller ones couldn\u2019t be seen from one form to another but that one was definitely worse than the others and as such carried over. You spoke with Kisara about it to which she was constantly looking around as well as hiding her ninja skill as much as possible. But they were ninja so the eventually tracked you down and on one sad evening Miu came to get you. She escorted you to the main area where everyone would go to talk if necessary. Everyone was assembled inside and as Miu opened the door and walked in you took a breath and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this can\u2019t be a good sign.\u201d You said straight away. You saw Sakura, Sarah, Kakashi, Naruto, and Lady Tsunade. If they were there then it meant they perfected the portal jutsu enough to travel backwards and get back. They wouldn\u2019t risk the Hokage unless they could be confident of them returning. Which of course meant that they were able and willing to follow you across realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, it seems some old friend of yours have come to visit. They\u2019ve been telling us some interesting stories, most unbelievable but interesting.\u201d The Elder said as you took as seat on the end of the little box they had formed, Ninja on one side and masters on the other. You took one end while the Elder and Miu took the other side. You looked over at Kisara and she just shook her head as she knew what you were going to ask. They hadn\u2019t said anything about you being a dragon yet. The thought interested you but also made you on high alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could call them that.\u201d You responded. \u201cWhat have you told them?\u201d You asked them as a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told them where we are from and about the realms we have traveled to find you. That\u2019s all, for now\u2026\u201d Tsunade said in a half concerned but half threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, are you telling us that what they are saying is true?\u201d asked Akisame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t here to hear everything but as far as the realms are concerned\u2026 yes. That is true.\u201d You answered. The information came to a shock to all but Kisara and this didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the keen eyes in the room. \u201cThey are who I learned the basic skills of a ninja from. Since my\u2026 we separated I have refined them and made it into the \u2018Dragon Ninja\u2019 style but if you were wondering where I learned of chakra and such, these would be the people\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara\u2026 you don\u2019t seem too surprised by this.\u201d Kenichi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is my Master, it took him a long time but he told me this already. Along with the rest. It was well after he gave me the Dragon\u2019s Eye.\u201d She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon\u2019s Eye?\u201d Kakashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI created a jutsu that transfers the full power and potential of my eyes to others in the form of a Kekkei genkai. So her children will also have it\u2026 well if they are trained to a degree to utilize chakra like she has.\u201d You explained in terms he could understand but went right over the head of those who didn\u2019t know the vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have a lot of trust in her then.\u201d Sarah said then looked down. Because of this you wondered if they had reversed her mind tampering. If they hadn\u2019t then she would be angry and still vengeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. While the rest of them are dear friends I consider her family.\u201d You clarified. It wasn\u2019t a shock to the master side as they knew you two were rather close but the ninja side now felt a little more guilt for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sense fire. Max, there is more here than what you are telling us. If you want to keep your past hidden then we will respect that. However I am getting the distinct feeling that you don\u2019t want them here.\u201d The Elder stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d you said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they are your friends?\u201d Kenichi asked as he was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOLD friends. I don\u2019t think I have to tell you that an old friend sometimes means that they were friends once\u2026 a long time ago.\u201d You responded and he nodded. \u201cTruth be told I didn\u2019t want to see them again and now that they are here, odds are I\u2019m going to have to leave, one way or another.\u201d You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave?\u201d asked Sakaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither they are here to pursue a dangerous enemy or they are here to bring me back to their realm. If they are here I assume that they can cause some nasty damage if they wanted to and continue to do so, even IF we dealt with them. I highly doubt they risked the portal jutsu multiple times and risked a foreign realm just to say hi.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d The Elder said as he stroked his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApachai don\u2019t want Max to go.\u201d Apachai stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You guys don\u2019t know anything about him. You\u2019d probably want him to leave if you knew.\u201d Naruto blurted out and was promptly knocked back down by Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there goes that.\u201d You said as you rubbed your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax?...What is he talking about?\u201d Akisame asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have always done right by us.\u201d Elder stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but I know that it will be said eventually and the only way to control how it is portrayed is to say it myself. Actually, maybe it would be best for Kisara to retell the story. That way, everyone is on the same page and I don\u2019t have to cover for someone adding bits from their imagination.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? What if I mess it up?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You know all the important parts so a little detail misplaced will be of little consequence. If they have a question they can ask after you finish. But they need to know that I didn\u2019t Idolize myself when I told you. You\u2019re the one neutral person that can tell the story so go ahead.\u201d You said with a smile to which she returned one then started. They listened in awed silence as she told your story. She had heard the whole thing and, through random questioning while training, she knew more of the details than most did that were there. When it got to the part that the ninja ripped you open they immediately glanced and located the scar that proved the action. But you were not looking at them, any of them, as you held in your emotions and refrained from bursting out in anger or crying like a baby. She added a little emotion in when saying certain things but for the most part she finished with an extremely small manner of error in the events, mainly hair color and specific dialog wording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d asked the Elder in which you could only nod. \u201cBefore we start pointing fingers, do you have any proof that you are\u2026 what is it?... a half-breed?\u201d he asked. You responded by growing multiple dragon parts including eyes, wings, claws, teeth, and your tail. You flexed them around a little before retracting them from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. The guy that was training me was a real live dragon.\u201d Kenichi said in a partial daze of shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of that matters. He is still the same person, dragon of not. If he was so evil, do you think he would waste his time like he has?\u201d Kisara defended. \u201cHe\u2019s been nothing but kind and gentle, well except when he\u2019s sparring with me. He has yet to take a life since he got here and even plays the weak card when bullied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApachai no care if Max a dragon.\u201d Apachai stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, it makes no difference to us if you are a dragon. As I said, what happened in the past is none of our concern. If you want to stay than you are more than welcome. \u201c Elder stated with the others agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you five, if your plan was to turn us on him so he leaves then you have failed.\u201d Akisame said in a rather serious tone. All the masters were now on alert as they believed whatever you said was true over anything they would say to dismiss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was not our intension. Although we did come in hopes that he would return with us.\u201d Tsunade stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did Naruto bring it up?\u201d asked Kisara as she knew him well from your speech and them yelling at him before you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d He said as he was forced to add a bow with his apology by Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto has never been one to hold his tongue. I honestly expected worse. What I want to know is why you are here. Yeah you came to get me, but why?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first it was because we couldn\u2019t afford to lose you. Having a 500 foot tall, and never mind how long, not aiding in even transportation is greatly missed. But mostly the enemies around us were given pause when you were there. With you gone they became more bold. We established a separate research faction to find out this \u2018portal jutsu\u2019 you found and used.\u201d Tsunade said then looked over to Kakashi to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey made progress but not fast enough to stop the village from carrying out our normal missions and lives. Then we started getting intel on Sasuke Uchiha. We immediately tossed it out of pride but as more and more came in we couldn\u2019t ignore it. Finally when I was recovering Naruto and the others ran into him with Orochimaru. From that moment on we were haunted by the realization of what we did. You had told us as much and we are ashamed that we did so much to you.\u201d he said then paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey restored my memory not to long after that. I hated them for what they did but since they were working to find you I helped.\u201d Sarah said as she took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, nice history lesson. But you still haven\u2019t answered my question. The portal jutsu is extremely dangerous as is the trip to the other side. There is no way that you risked the jutsu multiple times for an apology.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDangerous?\u201d Asked Akisame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the original jutsu there are over 32,000 hand sign and a lot of other preparations to make. If even one hand sign is out of place or the chakra flex too much in the process it could send a space several miles in circumference to another realm or space. Imagine if they get a single hand sign wrong when traveling back they could accidentally take the whole city and transport it to the vacuum of space. I\u2019ve since refined the process but the risk is still the same. Not to mention that every realm you go to, there is a chance it is hostile or inhabitable. So in a sense they risked potentially thousands of lives to get here and will risk hundreds of thousands to get back.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 It does seem unlikely that someone would risk so much. Max is just one person so the sacrifice must\u2019ve been worth it.\u201d Elder agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why we came.\u201d Naruto burst out. \u201cWe came to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they learned where she went they also came and started to wreck havoc on the land. There are only 3 of them, for now, but at night we are outmatched even with Kara there and summoning animals.\u201d Sarah informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDark Hunters?\u201d Kisara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the type of dragon I am. In the world of dragons the Dark hunters rule at the top by a large margin. We are usually the dragons that the evil stories are based on and why dragons are feared. Sure other dragons are dangerous but Dark Hunters are the dragons other dragons fear.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you stand a chance?\u201d asked Sakaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if they sent queens, which I doubt, I would be near 3 times their size as well as other stats. Not only that but I can use jutsu in dragon form. Even before I leaned the skills of a ninja I could take them down easy enough. Even if they had mounts it should be easy enough. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to go back. If I was going to go back I would\u2019ve liked to go home. But most likely they broke the portal to my home or more Dark Hunters would\u2019ve came through. So I can\u2019t go home, not that I want to at this point but still.\u201d You said with your head down, saddened that you would have to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you can come back right?\u201d Miu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Imagine the portal system like a series of random hoops and you going through them with a rope attached. People can follow you and you can go back the way you came but\u2026 if you want to come forward it becomes random again. I assume the amount of realms out there are near infinite so the odds of me randomly picking this on again would be\u2026 slim at best. If I go back with them I probably won\u2019t be able to come back here, ever.\u201d You said with a sigh. \u201cJust when I find a realm that accepts me I have to leave. What a pain. Yet another reason I hate dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m beginning to hate them myself.\u201d Kisara said as she was understanding the silent hint you gave her. \u201cWould you still take me with you? I mean if you plan on going?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, if we knew it would\u2019ve been this hard on you\u2026\u201d Sakura started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might not have but they did.\u201d You said as you looked at Tsunade. \u201cThe portal jutsu had all kinds of warnings and things that made it impossible to be ignorant of why it was a forbidden jutsu in the first place. Besides, I said when I left that I hoped never to see you all again. Now I got to go back to hell and kill some demons for you and never come back to the only heaven I found. That\u2019s just peachy.\u201d You almost growled then looked to Kisara. \u201cKisara it is completely up to you. Odds are that if you come with me you will die. Dark Hunters play ruff and even if you survive you wouldn\u2019t be able to return here, ever. You still have other family, while royally messed up, they\u2019re still your family and plenty of friends. You have a real future here and if I ever do make it back then you\u2019d be here, maybe even with some kids and a little Dragon Ninja family to pass on the Dragon\u2019s Eye to. You deserve that happiness and I\u2019ll have you in here.\u201d You said as you touched your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I sleep on it?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I got to get some sleep anyway.\u201d You said to which she got up, glared at the other ninja, then left for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you plan on going?\u201d Kenichi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, as much as it sucks. If there is a mess made by my kind. It is only right that I clean it up. It is a real pain to be the only civil dragon of my kind. Now if you don\u2019t mind I really do need some time to rest and to myself. I\u2019ll see you all in the morning.\u201d You said as you got up and went out after your sentiments were taken and returned. As you jumped onto the roof of your little house and looked up at the stars you felt a deep longing but also a sadness. Then it switched to concern. You knew how dangerous it would be for Kisara if she came with you. But selfishly you wanted her to come. It was a good thing you left it up to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all felt better if you were the one to perform the jutsu and within an hour of dizzying hand signs you opened the desired portal. Turning to the others you saw Kisara walking up with her head down and in a contemplative posture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait on the other side. As well as start on the portal justu on their side.\u201d Tsunade said to which you nodded. Sarah hesitated but also went through. She was feeling a lot of guilt of her part in your former torture as well as sadness for you obviously not trusting her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is it. I really would prefer to stay but it appears that we all have our responsibilities.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe understand. If you ever find yourself in this realm again, you know how to find us.\u201d The Elder said and you nodded respectfully to him and the others then as a little time went on all eyes went to Kisara as she had yet to announce what she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d She said then ran to you and embraced you. \u201cI wish I could come with you. But I have responsibilities here just like you have them there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Selfishly I would love for you to come with. But I would never forgive myself if you died on my watch because of that selfishness. Don\u2019t wait for me, if I am able to return I would like to see how far you\u2019ve progressed in life. Maybe you\u2019ll have kids or grandkids by that time. And I am sure that they will be just as beautiful as you are, with a healthy obsession with cats of course.\u201d You said as you wiped some tears away from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that I won\u2019t be able to learn from you anymore.\u201d Kenichi said as he wasn\u2019t to good at the whole goodbye thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisara is more than capable of instructing others on the use of Chakra.\u201d You said as you two separated. \u201cSee ya.\u201d you finished with a wave then walked into the portal. You made sure no one followed as if closed then went to the other side. You were greeted by only Kakashi as there was another open portal ready for use. From a quick look around you recognized it as the spot you formed the portal in Luffy\u2019s realm. You also figured that everyone else had gone through already, leaving Kakashi there to guard and maintain the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d Kakashi started. \u201cI know you\u2019ll get a lot of these when you return. But I am truly sorry for what we put you through. I never thought the leaf capable of treating one of their own in such a way. The Third vouched for you and we knew what you could do and we let fear rule our actions. Not only that but you were part of our team and not just as a weapon but as a person. I know that your trust in us if near to nothing so I\u2026\u201d He ended as he didn\u2019t know what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel betrayed and still sore about it, but I understand. For now I need to take care of your dragon problem. Then I can concentrate on the village and my place in it. I can\u2019t go home and I can\u2019t go back that way.\u201d You said to the now closed portal behind you. \u201cSo I either have to stay or go ahead to another realm. I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d Kakashi nodded at this then followed you though the portal. As soon as the portal closed behind you and Kakashi you took a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in one of the training fields with a high concentration of ninja around. You smelled smoke from previous attacks and as it was midday you could see it rise while a figure of a dragon soared high in the sky. You growled at the sight as your enhanced eyes could see it as a male Dark Hunter. You then started to look around again when something hit you and forced you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d said a voice you hadn\u2019t heard in a while. Kara was no nuzzling you so hard that it was forcing you to the ground and making an indent in the grass and earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, I missed you to.\u201d You said as you gave her still nuzzling snout a pet and rub until she settled down and let you get up. \u201cWell you look good. I hear you\u2019ve been having a little trouble with some distant relatives of mine. They didn\u2019t harm you did they?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bruise here and a scare there. Nothing too big to note.\u201d She answered. Your reuniting was interrupted by a roar from above as the circling Dark Hunter came down then landed, causing the ninja in the area to scatter accept some of the higher ranked ones that were near you and Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 so this is what you\u2019ve been working on down here. All that work for just a human. We were expecting something a little more entertaining.\u201d The dragon said as he looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBold ones, aren\u2019t they?\u201d you more stated than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but they have an efficient system. If I attack or anyone attacks the other two come while we are distracted. It seems to be a game for them.\u201d Kara growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you don\u2019t mind, getting the others to stand back. It has been a while since I stretched myself out.\u201d You said to which she carefully did as you asked while you walked forward until you were facing the dragon more directly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m such a disappointment. Before I gut you, what are you three doing here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, a humorous human. I bet you squirm all the way down.\u201d He said as he reached for you. You didn\u2019t know why you bothered to speak with him. You then exploded and changed to your dragon form. The dragon shielded himself then as he looked at you he started to quiver towards the ground. The sight of your colossal form snarling at him was a sudden and terrifying prospect. All he did was the slightest move at that point but before he could blink he was on his back and under your claw. But Kara was right, the other two came out of nowhere and knocked you over before landing on either side of you as you spun around and recovered. They were queens and snarling at you as the little male got up and did likewise but far away from the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we finally found you, you filthy half-breed.\u201d Said one of the queens but you only snarled at them as you kept in a ready position for them to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive up, we have you trapped and outnumbered.\u201d Said the male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d you snarled. Your body began to glow red as chakra poured out of it then in one big puff of smoke, that covered and area miles around, you preformed the multi shadow clone jutsu. There was now over 500 of you around and in the air. \u201cI think you\u2019re dead.\u201d You stated as the queens scurried around to try and find a way out. But with so many 500 foot dragons around they couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith them distracted you rushed forward and sank your teeth into one\u2019s neck, twisting and using your momentum and body weight to snap her neck and force her lifeless body down and into the ground. The male was next as he came to her aid. He was so small that you just flattened your tail and sliced him vertically in half. Then you were left stalking the final one as you licked your lips of the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just hold on a sec\u2026\u201d she started but you didn\u2019t and attacked. Two of your clones held her down as you took her head into your jaws and impaled it, ripping the head off her neck, chewing it to a paste, then swallowing it down. With that done your clones flew up and went away so the smoke didn\u2019t deter anyone\u2019s vision as they came forward to you tossing the dragons in a pile then standing over them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had put some distance between your feasting area and where you now laid but there was still a fair amount of blood from the incident around. This along with you licking your chops made those who approached to be on edge, well except Kara who flew over to you and laid next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, haven\u2019t had fresh dragon since I left home.\u201d You answered as you cleaned the last bit of blood from your snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re the only dragon I know that eats other dragons. I guess that means you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d She stated and your look became more distracted and pain ridden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did they tell you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much. When I arrived they tended to my wounds and left to go get you. When I asked why you weren\u2019t there they avoided the question. The only answer I got was from a boy and his dog. They said they did something to you that you might not forgive them for.\u201d She answered. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot something I like repeating. Let\u2019s just say that it has been the only wound that cut as deep as my mother\u2019s\u2026 gifts she did when I was born.\u201d You said in slightly a haze but was broken out of it by the humans around finally coming within an acceptable speak range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do!?\u201d Kara growled. Which got the crowd to cringe back. \u201cNobody will tell me what everyone else around here already knows.\u201d She didn\u2019t know much. But for you to compare it to the defining moment why you hate dragons, it had to be something pretty big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you if you take me somewhere we can talk for a while. It is a long story.\u201d Sarah stated. With a nod from you Kara accepted and after letting Sarah on her back, she took off and went into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Max. I don\u2019t want to think about what would\u2019ve happened if some of our less reputable neighbors would\u2019ve done if they were to have ensured the help of\u2026\u201d Tsunade stated as she looked over at the pile of dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were my mess. It was only fitting that I clean them up.\u201d You said more dry than was necessary. As you were surrounded spikes grew from your hide as if your body was subconsciously protecting itself from enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you have some work to do. Since you left we have\u2026\u201d said Donzo to which you only snarled lightly at him. It wasn\u2019t much but judging on how easily you defeated the other dragons and ate one to boot, he stumbled back as did the others near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see nothing has changed, good to know.\u201d You said as you were already on your feet. Before the others could do any damage control you took off into the air and soared out of sight. You heard a few words to get you to come back but you didn\u2019t pay them any heed. You needed time to think anyway. You went to a mountain\u2019s top that you knew they rarely climbed and was barren enough for them to think twice before making the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling on a place you blew a hole in the side of the rising Cliffside then entered. The space was just big enough for you and Kara, if she came after Sarah tells her what happened. It had a little room so the elements didn\u2019t get at you but other than that it was just a small, dark, and barren cave. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You thought about it for a while but without someone there to help you were constantly moving towards leaving. The only thing was, Kara. If you left and she remained then they would do the same thing to her, or so you thought. In the midst of your deliberating you heard the flapping of wings then a landing. It wasn\u2019t long after that when you saw Kara\u2019s head poke in your little cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are. I was looking for you.\u201d she said and went to your side as you took your head off the ground to address her. She nuzzled you a bit then laid next to you but slightly at an angle so you could still talk. Sarah also came in and approached you. \u201cJust give her a chance.\u201d Kara whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I understand if you don\u2019t want to see me. I did things that I don\u2019t forgive myself for, so I can\u2019t expect you to. I just wanted to say that I\u2019m so sorry for it.\u201d Sarah stated but never made eye contact. She just stood there with her eyes glued to the floor, as it awaiting a swift death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you Sarah. You did nothing wrong. It was those leaf ninja that messed with your mind. I know very well that you are a good person. And while you did contribute to my pain during that time, I know that you wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing such things if your mind was right. But\u2026 I can\u2019t help see it every time I look at you. When you raise your hand my mind immediately goes to the memory of you detonating a paper bomb. My body braces for it and I can\u2019t help flinching, hoping that this time the bomb won\u2019t feel that bad. The others don\u2019t affect me this way because they have no emotional ties to me anymore. I think I am wishing they\u2019d try it again so I can justify roasting them. But you\u2026 I can\u2019t see myself ever harming you, so I feel\u2026 scared\u2026 I guess.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t hate me?\u201d she asked, lifting her eyes to meet yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d you said. At that point Kara used her long neck and snout to push Sarah into you. She fell against you and you just looked down at her. She was surprised to which you both didn\u2019t move except looking over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on. Kiss and make up already.\u201d She said. You moved your head around as Sarah backed off so she was directly in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 why?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re family. You, Kara, and Kisara are my family. I love all of you to death.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax I love you too.\u201d she said with considerably less control as she usually had as she just threw herself onto your snout so she was hugging the top of it rather tight, tears hitting your scales underneath. \u201cDo I still smell good?\u201d she asked after at least a half hour of crying and hugging. The sudden question got Kara to laugh and you to snort a little which in turn made her fly off but you caught her with your tongue then let her down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You still got that smell\u2026 I can\u2019t help but be in a good mood when you\u2019re around.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now that we got that taken care of. We need to figure out what we are going to do.\u201d Kara stated. \u201cI mean the leaf village will probably send people for us one way or another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares, they can go to hell for all I care.\u201d Sarah stated as you snuffed a silent half agreement while Sarah took a comfortable spot against your chest so she was still in the conversation but not separated from you. Something told you that she would be pretty close for the next couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was talking about perhaps leaving this realm. I doubt any of us would have any peace while we stay here, even if the Leaf just wants to make up and be friends. I kind of owe them for patching me up so I can\u2019t just torch them when they show up, as much as I want to at the moment.\u201d Kara clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, most realms would be hard for you Kara. Sarah and I could blend in but trying to hide a dragon like yourself is much harder than it may seem. Especially if the level of advancement was like the other two realms I went to. So it may be safer to be here. At least we know how to deal with problems here. On the other side I really don\u2019t like this realm.\u201d You said and growled the last part. \u201cOh I almost forgot. Sarah, a little gift for you, just so we are all seeing the same way.\u201d You said then blew a red smoke at her. She coughed and inhaled some of it. Then she bent down and grabbed her face as her eye began to burn. She screamed a little but then almost fainted back on you, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, what the hell did you do?\u201d Kara asked with a confused expression which Sarah followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured out in the other realm how to give the power of my eyes to humans. I call it Dragon\u2019s Eye. Usually it doesn\u2019t hurt and you need some intensive training to master it. But we don\u2019t have time for that so I just included the understanding with the eyes. Sarah, why don\u2019t you give it a try. I promise it will be worth it.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve warned me Max.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but it hurts less if you aren\u2019t ready. Come on, give it a try. A dragon\u2019s sight is really amazing and you can see through anything, genjutsu included.\u201d You defended. She sighed then closed her eyes as if concentrating then opened them as they went red and were exact copies of yours, minus the glowing part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! This is incredible. You dragons see like this all the time?\u201d she asked as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You weren\u2019t joking. You gave a human the power to see like a dragon.\u201d She said as she looked at her eyes more closely then backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer your question yes we do. Although we don\u2019t have to use chakra to see like you do when using Dragon\u2019s Eye. You can activate it in the middle of a genjutsu as well to see through it if you wish. Dragons are rarely fooled by humans in a challenge of sight. Now you have that same advantage.\u201d You explained a little more and the rest of the day was more or less relaxing as you all watched her enjoy this new power that you and Kara already had. Afterwards you three tried to decide wither to stay or leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also I never made a portal big enough to fit a dragon before. Usually I keep them as small as possible so that no one accidentally follows.\u201d You stated as you flexed and stretched your hands in preperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is only a matter of time before your barrier attracts some attention so go ahead. We\u2019ll make sure no one bothers you.\u201d Sarah said to which they backed away from you and let you work. With a deep breath you started on the jutsu.

So keep on your toes and as for you Kara. You might have to run or hide as soon as you get through. I just came back from a realm that thought of dragons as fiction and legend. So if we end up in another one of those then we\u2019ll have little time to figure out what to do.\u201d You informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then why don\u2019t you go first.

Smart, awkward and portentially dangerous but smart.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hide me in your mouth until it is safe?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d She asked. \u201cMax, she\u2019s kidding right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally I would agree with you. Mainly because if you have to fight when we get to the other side, then you\u2019re going to have to swallow her to do it. But there are few things that can get through a dragon\u2019s scales and if the air is toxic on the other side than she will be better protected. As dragons we can handle more than humans can. Which is why she is the smart one.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, no offense, but I would rather not be in your mouth or gut either.\u201d Sarah stated to the nervous dragon as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but you owe me for this.\u201d she said then hesitantly opened her jaws in front of her. Sarah let out a light gasp but kept her focus. She reached over Kara\u2019s row of teeth and into the slimy prison and safety of her mouth. Sarah climbed in but was only able to get mostly in due to Kara\u2019s smaller size. Her legs still stuck out of Kara\u2019s mouth to which she looked at you as if to asked \u2018what next\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m actually going to say this to a dragon with a human it its mouth. But, it looks like you\u2019re going to have to swallow her now.\u201d You said as you put your hand on you head to nurse the headache you were getting. This went against every fiber of what your mind was now wired to accept. But Sarah was a smart girl and she knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeddeh (ready)?\u201d Kara said around her mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but go ahead. But it better be your storage gut or I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d She said comically. With that Kara tilted her head back and started swallowing her. It only took a few gulps but she was eventually down and made a small bulg in Kara\u2019s stomach area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe safe?\u201d you asked Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as safe as she\u2019s gonna get. She\u2019s in my storage gut but that empties every week so she\u2019s good for a few days before it empties into my digestion stomach. Hopefully that won\u2019t be a problem. Is it bad it I compliment her on her taste?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe after she\u2019s out of you. She is probably freaked out enough as it is.\u201d You said as you gave the barely noticable blug a pat. \u201cAlright, give me a minute\u2026 on second thought we better go together. This barrier will only hold when I\u2019m here to manage it. I can smell someone coming so let\u2019s go.\u201d You said to which you two ran through the portal and your past worries faded as the portal successfully closed. Now your future worries started as you wondered where you were going to be coming out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You both dropped a few inches to a concrete floor. You spun around to get a good sense of where you were. As soon as you did you saw that Kara was about to do likewise. You put a hand on her head to stop her from moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, don't move that much yet.\" you said, after her closest eye looked at you. You said this quietly, so she just barely nodded to keep the inactive and quiet sense open. However, you could tell she was having a hard time. Not suprising, as she had never been in a modern city before. There were a lot of noise in general, not to mention sights and smells that took you a good month to get use to. It would be hard for her and you could see her cringe as a truck honked its horn somewhere outside the warehouse you all seemed to be in. You couldn't express how lucky you all were, relatively speaking. Technically you all weren't; Sarah was in Kara's stomach, Kara was adjusting to the chaotic enviornment, and you had to figure out how to hide a dragon that couldn't change to human in a modern world. The lucky part was not appearing in direct sight line to any number of things that could be a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, is it safe?\" asked a muffled voice from Kara's stomach. What she was really asking was if she could have Kara get her out yet. Even if she was inside a friend, she wasn't too into the whole swallowed alive thing, regardless of why or how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment. Kara, don't move too much, but you can let her out. I might need her help in a little bit.\" You instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do something about the noise first? I can't concentrate.\" Kara almost begged, but kept her voice as quiet as her dragon lungs would allow. Unlike humans, her voice could rumble the floor at a very low setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to get use to it eventually. But I suppose, for now...\" you said and touched her head, putting a barrier jutsu as a buffer to keep most of the noise out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" She said with a shake of her head. Then she seemed to concentrate on something else. Within a few moments you heard her body groaning and squishing. Then you saw a bulge travel from her body, up her neck, then gently out of her jaws onto the floor. She was careful to keep her teeth away, as was Sarah. It was a few minutes before Sarah was laying on the ground, covered in different juices. \"Hold still, let me clean you just a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want another taste.\" Sarah teased but did as Kara requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no tempting me.\" She teased back then gave her a tongue bath. Kara was rather talented in that regard. Sure, dragons had more control over thier longer tongues, but Kara had an extra skill level. Perhaps it was from being so close to humans for the time you were away. Either way, she continued as she used her tongue to turn Sarah over and clean the rest of her juices off her that wasn't a very thin layer of saliva. You guessed she was a little concerned about stomach acid, or more paranoid. You all know that there wasn't any in the storage gut of a dragon. But niether you or Sarah were going to rip on Kara for being careful, regardless of how unwarrented the concern may be. When she was done, she backed off a little. Luckily the bare warehouse was probably big enough to house both you and Kara. You were just unsure of everything at the moment. But for the moment it allowed Kara enough room to move... very lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww... dragon drool.\" Sarah comically whined as she wiped the saliva off. Kara seemed to blush a little, even for her blue scales, which got Sarah to smile as she used a jutsu to clean and dry off. She had won their little teasing match. They both basked in that thought for a while than looked over at you to get started. \"So, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a modern society, not unlike the other one you found me in.\" you said as you tapped the concrete with your foot than glanced around. \"If I have to guess... I would say that were are in a bare warhouse. Unfortunately, that is all the good news. As evidence to the noise, they are not going to be to use to a dragon. We need to think of something or somewhere we can hide you Kara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just fly to a high spot at night?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The modern Technology would find you in seconds. They have... observation machines that they launch into orbit, like the moon. We can't reach them but they can definitely see us. The other humans would see you and come to get you. Even I would lose if they came in ernest and we faught. So we have to find a way to hide you.\" You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where are we?\" Asked Sarah, being a little more knowledgeablt about such things than Kara was... but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure...\" you started as you thought then looked over at them. \"I will go check it out. For now, you two stay here. Sarah, try to keep from being seen. Make a genjutsu or something to hide Kara. No matter what happens... stay here, and stay hidden.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Sarah said to which you stopped turning and looked at her approaching. She didn't stop until she was hugging you. \"We just got you back, and I just got all sappy with making up with you. So you promise me that you will be coming back, VERY soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise. I will come back as soon as I can.\" You said as you held her. You also looked over to Kara and gave her a look she knew well. The look was to take care of Sarah. Even is she didn't need it, she knew that there was more damage that couldn't be seen that needed fixing. Damage that was about you and stuff you couldn't touch or heal. You stayed in Sarah's embrace for a while then looked into her eyes when she started pulling reluctantly away. You held your gaze with her and brushed a stray lock of hair from her face. \"Make sure you are here when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" she said with a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you nodded to Kara and left. It wasn't hard to find the door. You had a lot to do and think about. But first... where are you???</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself in a warehouse beside an interstate, somewhere in a state called Wisconsin. You looked at a sign that advertised the warehouse you had just left was for sale by owner, as well as the land you were on. That was perfect, what wasn't was that you had no idea where or how to purchase it. You saw a telephone number and headed off in a direction, praying to anyone that could hear, that no one would beat you to it or peak their head in the warehouse. You had confidence in both of them, but they were both out of their element here. You had to act fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was longer than you liked, but you finally got an 'emergency meeting' with the owner. He offered to show you the property but you just said that you just needed the information on the property line. His eyes almost bugged out when you preseneted him with double what he was asking and all in cash. You were as friendly possible but also put it in his mind that you wold be 'fine' and he was not to contact you or stop by the property ever again. With money clouding his happyniess, he accepted with no strings attached. You wondered how many problems you could fix with such an approach. It was about a day before you returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late.\" Sarah pouted as she released the genjutsu she had on to make both her and Kara invisible to the observer. You could tell her mood was stressed but more stable in the emotions department than when you left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, I was able to buy this building and the land. Now we don't have to worry about people poking their heads in... well at least not officially. I also found out, this world... it is very modern, and very intrusive. We need to be very careful,\" You answered. Your conversation was halted by a loud rumble from Kara, who shyly recoiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, haven't eaten in a while. There isn't a chance I could go hunting is there?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not. They would spot you and come get you very quickly. But... I did take the liberty of getting you both some food. I know it is isn't as fun as hunting, but for now it will have to do,\" you answered almost appologetically. You then went outside and walked in a full dairy cow. It was so demesticated that it didn't realize the large predator it was sharing the room with. You led it over to Kara then walked over to Sarah with a paper bag from one of the fastfood places you saw. You were amazed at how fast they could come up with such food. But it did smell less enticing to you than what Kara was eating. You gave Kara's foreleg a pat as you passed her so she knew you two were out of the way and she could start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, if you insist,\" Kara stated then snapped the cow's head and bit down, severing it and began to enjoy her meal. You understood her feeling. Even if she liked the flavor, being fed wasn't the same thing as hunting. An activity that a dragon just loved to do. You and sarah walked a bit then sat on the floor so Kara's meal wouldn't effect Sarah's appetite. She had an interesting time taking the wrapping off the food but soon figured it out and finished her meal. She was rather smart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what now. We are relatively safe but still are in a place that is very strange to us. Not to mention Kara.\" Sarah stated after she burned the garbage with a jutsu and Kara cleaned the floor of her mess as well. Currently, you all were in a triagle, thinking and, in the case of Kara, licking the remaining blood off her claws and snout. She did take pride in her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Kara asked between licking her her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mean....\" you started, paused, then continued. \"... Dragons, according to this realm, don't exist. We are just fiction to them. If even one of them tells the wrong person about any of us, we will be experimented on and locked away. While our personal skill is formidable, we are no match if they tried in ernest. Plus, there are like... a few billion humans in this time and realm. Way to many to avoid. So we have to come up with a way to get you to change to something more presentable. Or at the very least, hide you in a place no one would be able to find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Is this realm really that dangerous for us?\" she asked, still not really believing it. She was a dragon after all. What creature could cause her to fear, besides you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very dangerous.\" You confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we made a jutsu to help her either transform like you or at least be invisible.\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work, but we would have to teach her how to use Chakra as a dragon then again as a human, not to mention all the things she would need to know to act believable. It would be hard, if it is even possible. Not to mention, I am not sure it would be a seemless or painless persuit.\" You answered and thought outloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did say that me staying like I am now would be 'very dangerous'. I can deal with a little pain and education. Not like you haven't trained me before.\" Kara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough. Ok, Sarah, if you could start working with Kara in using Chakra, that would be great. She needs at least an expert level, if this is going to work.\" You agreed and started to dull out assignments. \"Kara, you need to open your mind and do everything she says. She is the smart one in the group. If anyone can figure out how to teach a dragon how to do a jutsu, it is Sarah. We need you to a very high level in a very short amount of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will you be doing?\" asked Sarah to which Kara also wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to invent a jutsu that will work. I'm not sure it is even possible, but I'll figure out something. That and I need to bring you all some food and other things.\" You answered while still half thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think it is possible? Making me into a human, or at least a human form?\" Kara asked, very concerned about loosing her dragon half more than gaining a human one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... remember who you are talking to.\" you said as you comically waved a sprouted wing at her then retracted it. \"I'll find a way, you two just make sure you are ready when I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd off to work you all went. You began recalling everything you could. You knew she couldn't be a half-breed like you. But gaining an ability to change into something else was vaguely possible. You knew it somehow. You just couldn't put your finger on it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were going nuts with trying to figure out a jutsu that would work. The closest one was an advanced form of a transformation jutsu. However, it would only last while the person had the Chakra to do so... and it burned up chakra very fast. You needed to find a permanent solution that could keep her in dragon form but not be vulnerable, like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, you said you had a way to make me human?\" Kara asked in a skeptical voice. She knew how hard you were working, and that you were not getting anywhere, as evidence to a few mental outbursts on your part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. My genetic knowledge gave me something.\" you answered with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to make a jutsu for it. Was all that training for nothing?\" asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Even if she becomes a human with SOME dragon abilities, she will still be very vulnerable in this age. She needs to be ready and have a head start on understanding a human's movements. The way it is, we'll have to teach her how to walk and all that. Dragon behavior will also be a challenge to cover. Take it from me, supressing dragon instincts and habits is not easy,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, enough with the waiting, what did you find?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make you like me... a little. It will be more restricted, but still, you will have the ability to turn human and dragon at will. However it won't be exactly the same.\" You started and paused to figure out a way to explain what only came to you as a feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will be different?\" Asked Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wont be able to grow dragon pieces like I do. At most, you will have your original eyes and be able to transfer back and forth with them, like the Dragon Eye jutsu I made. But most of your dragon things, like a tail, fire breathing, wings, and scales will be gone while in human form. Upside is that you keep your strength, speed, perception, and anything you don't need dragon organs for. Also, it wont hurt to transform, like it does for me. However, it requires you to have energy to maintain. It doesn't use any but if your energy meter goes below a certain point, than you will return to your dragon form, with you want to or not.\" You explained. With each point you could see their moods change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else we should know?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is about her human side. Until she learns something to bring clothes with her, she will not retain anything when she changes. If she has anything on when she goes to dragon form... well I think you get the point. I think I'll leave the whole girl preperation thing for you to explain.\" you added, to which she nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I have to where those human coverings?\" Kara asked in almost confusion. Like most dragons, including you in the beginning, she didn't understand why such things were needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later.\" Sarah snapped, in a tone Kara flinched at. \"Ok, time to make this happen. Max, do your thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Kara, my knowledge didn't say if this would hurt or not so... sorry if it does.\" You stated. She flexed in preperation, digging her claws into the cement below her. You breathed deep a few times before starting. \"Here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you took a final breath and, upon your exhale, breathed out some red some. Kara seemed to understand that it was the same type of change that gave Sarah the Dragon Eyes. So she let the smoke envelope her as well as allow herself to breathe it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's burning!\" she almsot snarled out but stayed where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, she started growling and snarling, not unlike when you changed. As if you understood her change had finalized, you stopped and breathed in the remaining smoke yourself to clear the area. What you saw, in a smoking heep on the floor, was a human body with... figures, light blue hair that matched her normal scales. But for the moment you both rushed over to her, you with a blanket of sorts to cover her modesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only needed a minute and a first glance to take her new form in before you covered it up with Sarah's help to get her lifted and into the blanket. She was fit, like Sarah, but thinner. You figured it made sense. Her type of dragon was thinner physically, which made them bullets in the air. Her human body followed the same 'streamlined' description that her dragon one did. Also like her dragon body, her body was flawless and completely symetrical. Her skin, body type, and face looked highly Japanese but not quite. Here blue hair seamed and looked so smooth that it reminded you of one of those anime images with the 'silky long and straight hair' that reached her low back. She opened her eyes for a moment the closed them. You saw them go from an almost too bright blue dragon eyes she normally had, to a more human tone blue human looking eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one Max, let's get her on the bed. I think she should wake up somewhere else besides a cold concrete floor.\" Sarah suggested. You nodded to which you picked up her limp and unconcious body, all wrapped up in the blanket you provided, and brought her over to the bed. It was some time of waiting, in the small human seating lobby, before you both heard her stir to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... whoa, whoa! WOW!\" You heard a very tender and young voice say then heard a smack as she fell out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jeepers...\" Said Sarah as you both turned to see her trying to get up, but only managing a partway sitting position on the floor. Her hair spralled in front of her but not enough to completely obscure the view of her naked body that had falled out of the blanket provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a little trouble there Kara?\" you asked comically, to which she swished her hair out of her face with a whip of her head to glare at you. But the look was unpracticed in this form, so it looked very comical. So comical that Sarah almost forgot the whole girl completley naked thing that she had to coach her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha ha... I suppose you think this is completely halarious.\" Kara said with a cute frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. Not easy without a tail is it.\" You asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you humans do it?\" she asked as she tried to prove herself more capable than how she just presented herself. She got on all fours than pushed herself so she was on her hands and feet, her butt sticking in the air. But when she tried to push herself to just her feet, she royally failed and flipped over completely. Her inhuman strength was to blame for that one. She tried it again, slower, but her wobbly and unpracticed leggs made her fall yet again. \"Will one of you please get over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, grumpy\" You stated as you got up but was shoved back by Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast mister. No touching the naked girl for you. Now if you don't mind... Put her in some clothes.\" She stated to which you and Kara, the two in the room that would argue with such logic, gulped. Sarah was in one of her moods again. She could really be a strict one when it came to female and male interaction. She once stuck you with a spear for looking at her while she changed. You were just asking if she needed help, but you got the message, it was the first time that you understood this obsession humans had with modesty, and clothing. You didn't waste any time and materalized a light set of clothes for her. It was only a pair of shorts, underwear, and a tube top. But it was good enough for Sarah to allow you to go help her. She knew that, with Kara's strength, she would just crush her if SHE tried to help her in this state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do human's wear these things again?\" Kara asked quietly in your ear as you helped her to her feet giving her a chance to at least partially walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I've never understood. Just accept that it is what they do and try to fit in.\" you advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Sarah can be a scary human when she wants to be.\" Kara said before you were in hearing range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" You agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wierd.\" Kara said, as you sat her down on the open chair. She gripped the arms to steady herself and balance. \"So, is that what it feels like when you change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, what did it feel like for you?\" you asked as you sat back in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my body was ripping apart and suppressing into nothing. Like someone was crushing me between two rocks and my body was forced to get smaller to stay alive.\" she summerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much the same. You shouldn't have that problem, if my genetic knowledge was right.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you feel now?\" Sarah asked Kara, excited to hear what her old friend was feeling like as a human, a fellow human at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel... wobbly, lengthy, awkward, vulnerable, and cold. Really? No scales or extra layers to help with the temperatures? I don't even have my fire lung to help with heating myself from the inside. Not to mention this sight. I much prefer this.\" She stated then changed her eyes to her dragon ones. Unlike yours, or the verson you gave to Sarah, hers glowed a slitted blue. They were little replicas of her normal dragon eyes. \"And no tail. How do human manage to transport themselves on these scrawny things you call legs with no tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We manage.\" Sarah said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is never going to work.\" Kara complained as she pouted about the situation you all fell into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got a human form, she mastered human things slowly at first. But once she hit her stride, she picked it up faster than you did. The real challenge was getting her to be a skilled ninja like both you and Sarah were. She would often get frustrated and use some of her Dragon enhanced abilities to make up for her lack of progress. But that was before. In lue of such outbursts and training, you created a bunker deep under the Wisconsin warhouse you all had. The only way in was by having you teleport them with a jutsu. On the surface, you tore down the warehouse and estabilished a super dense forest that could hide even you if need be, in your dragon form. You weren't willing to try it yet but either way, it was just a secret place to hide out at if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the reason for this latest change. You had all moved to California after the first winter. Kara liked the warm weather without her dragon body. But both you and Kara looked like teenagers. Apparently, 'kids your age' needed to be in school. So you both enrolled in school. Your cover was that Sarah was you older SIster to which your parents had died in a plane crash. A tragic story that would keep others from prying. You had arranged a measure of proof and new identities. Your 'parents' had left you three with enough money to last years and finish your education. So Sarah would stay home and maintain things while the two of you went to school. However she needed to learn just as much as you and Kara. The world was still strange to all of you. It seemed strange but had one perk, no supernatural predators to worry about. No dragons, no ninja, no sea kings. It would, hopefully, be an easy way to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Kara didn't like was being forced to live as a normal human. She still had too many instincts to control to play the gentle new girl. But with an appearnce like her's, you doubted she would have too much trouble with NOT being noticed. She already had knocked a few guy's teeth in for grabbing her butt one day. You had... convinced the police to let it go. They're minds were relatively easy to enter and alter. They had no experience defending against foriegn invaders like the three of you had. But back on point, Kara was still learning how to be a human. The only luck she had was that you would be with her all the time and that no one suspected the secret, because... no one thought anything like either of you existed. So there the two of you were. Two dragons, about to enter Junior year at a High School that had thousands of kids running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine.\" You comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Look at all these snacks.\" She grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara...\" you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I didn't mean anything by it. I just... If we were dragons, they wouldn't dare oppose us. But these... humans are just so arrogant. I don't believe I actually prefer Dragon Slayers.\" She huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice hair hot stuff!\" yelled a young man probably in your grade, obviously saying it to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If one more of them...\" she started to which you cut her off by starting to walk toward the school. \"Hey, wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walked down the halls and eventually landed in your first class. You could tell it would be a long and boring day. Unlike the ecentric dragon you brought with, you actually had been in and conquered high school before. Sure some of the classes and subjects had different twists, but they were pretty much the same. Nothing really interested you that much until a blonde girl came into one of your classes. You and Kara were sitting at the same table of course but you looked over at her a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see something you like?\" Kara teased to which you looked at her as if to ask her to explain. She knew you never really was 'interested' in human girls. Even when she teased you with her new, apparently very attractive, body did you show hardly any interest. \"That is the 10th time you've look over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl and the boy don't smell strange to you?\" you asked. You both took a secret whiff of the air from her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it... She does smell a little different than most humans, so does the guy I guess. What are you thinking?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, usually, there is one thing unique to each realm. Like the dragons in our, or the ninja in the last one. I've been keeping an eye out for this one's unique trait. Maybe it's nothing.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe it's everything. When has a dragon nose ever been wrong?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there was that one time Sarah...\" you started but she elbowed you to which you laughed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't fair. She used a genjutsu to make me eat that.\" She defended. Sarah had switched a burger with a rotten onion for her dinner one time. \"Ok, wise ass, I'll ammend my statement. When has a dragon nose ever been wrong, excluding evil sister witches with ninja skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll watch her for a while. May give me something to do. But you still need to pay attention to the class. If you get an 'F' than you have to deal with Sarah. You're on your own for that.\" You warned and joked. She immediately straightened up to attention but smirked as you mirrored her. You both knew that Sarah was by far the scariest person to piss off, dragon or human. But you now had a new activity, watching this new girl, while you gave the boy's activity watching to Kara. It would keep your vastly superior attention spans busy during the long school days and what not. Besides, you were both going through withdrawl from the lack of physical contact and challenges. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't hard to find out why those two smelled different. Within the day, Kara observed the boy flying, and it didn't take you long to see a few injuries heal in Claire or smell blood from a wound that wasn't there anymore. Your family discussed this as well as the possibility of super powered individuals being this realms 'unique trait'. You all kept an eye out but all decided that the 'Butler' family should be approached. However, they seemed to be in hiding, like the 3 of you were, more or less. So you all picked a day when they were all in and a weekend to further ensure they would have time to tell their end and you three would be able to likewise tell them. So, here you three were, in front of the Butler home, awaiting the door to open from your knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, can I help you?\" Asked an older woman with an annoyingly small dog. You had trouble keeping away thoughts that she was holding a candy sized snack, but managed to look past it. However, the dog seemed to pick up your and Kara's scent, at least partially. It wasn't sure what was going on but jumped away from the woman to get away from you two at least, barking all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon the intrusion Ma'am. I go to school with your daughter. I was wondering if we could have a moment of your family's time?\" You asked as politely as possible. Both you and Kara guided her mind to assume something nice rather than the slight panic she was otherwise headed toward. You all sealed it with pleasant smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, by all means, come on in.\" She welcomed as she ushered you three into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nice speach,' Kara thought to you to which you and Sarah just grinned. Kara was still having a hard time acting human. That, and she now understood what you meant when you said that your wings get cramped in dragon form. She was acheing to fly, but knew it would be a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all were led to a family room of sorts then left there, you asumed so she could go get the rest of the family. You three sat on the same couch. You figured it would be safer that way. You were in the middle, with Sarah to your right and Kara to your left. You all waited patiently for them to come in, trying not to listen in as they talked just out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Said a younger male voice as they came into the room to which you three stood in respect. He was of course referring to the two female members of your group. To humans, they were VERY attractive and 'hot'. Sometimes Kara would bath herself in fire, when in private, and say something like \"Now I really am hot\". Either way, the boy was getting a little red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Max, and Kara.\" Claire greeted, as she knew you two from school, a little bit at least. She more knew Kara for knocking out some of the more... intrusive cheerleader members when they came to rip on her. All the girls in that type of crows, since then, gave Kara a very wide birth. Claire on the other hand thought it was awesome. But her constant need to keep her identity a secret prevented her from vocalizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire!\" Kara greeted warmly as she could. A well practiced form that she was working on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou for seeing us like this,\" you greeted as well that ended in a hand shake with Mr. Butler and a smile to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, we are always glad to hear from friends Claire has made.\" He responded, giving Claire a look at the end of his statement. \"Please, have a seat. Then you can tell us what brings you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all sat down, your group back on the couch, and the others in seats around the room. Claire seemed to have a seat of egg shells. There was an uncomfortable silence in the room for a while. Neither side wanted to go first or confirm anythiing without the other doing so. In that regard, you nudged Sarah to start. She did look the oldest of your group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are here to talk to you about Claire.\" She started, to which they all stiffened. She waited a moment to let their imaginations work then added, \"... and us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you three?\" asked Mr. Butler. He was smarter than he looked. Rather than scramble to secure their own secret, he turned it around on you three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... are different. But more different than anything you've ever seen.\" You started. You weren't really sure how to tell them. \"We've observed Claire and saw her... injuries, or lack there of. We've noticed your family looks to walk on egg shells for some reason. We've also noticed other tell tale signs that your family are not what they appear to be. It took us a while to determine that you all were on the good side of that equation. We don't think its fair that we know about Claire and you don't know anything about us. Especially if we are in such close proximity. That, and we need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\" asked Claire, probably sooner than she should've. As evidence of this, her father looked her way to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are having touble... adjusting to this 'normal life'. It isn't exactly the same with us, but we figured your family could help us out a little.\" Kara stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Mr. Butler asked, trying to get more information before giving anything that could endanger them. You admired the concept of his protection but wouldn't be able to do anything worth gawking at while in their house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be easier to just show you.\" You stated as you held out your hand to them. Kara and Sarah made sure they were in contact with you for this. It took a while but, with Mr. Butler's nod, they all met your hand in the middle. As soon as they did you teleported them to the Wisconsin Bunker. They had to catch themselves then retracted to see the incredibly large structure around them. It was large enough for you to do VERY tight flying circles. Basically it was a place, other than the obvious reasons of a bunker, to stretch out your and Kara's wings. Along with training. Couldn't really practice any high level jutsu anywhere near anything that could observe you all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?!\" Mr. Butler demanded as soon as he confirmed his family was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you asked.\" You responded comically then continued before any emotions could get heated. \"Relax, we didn't want our conversation being overheard by anyone or anything. That and, what makes us different, can't be shown in the small confines of a house. So I teleported you all to a very large bunker. No one knows it is here except us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you expect us to trust you?\" He almost spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you can find a door, yes.\" you answered to which they looked around and noticed there were none. It was just a HUGE room. \"Really, you can leave any time you want. If you can. But if you want  me to help, then by default you have to at least trust me to do that. We didn't open up to you so we could kill or harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You're going first then.\" Claire replied, not entirely venomous but not nice either. </span></div></div>",

We know all about her... well as much as we can know by watching her for a little bit. We came here to show YOU what WE could do and what we are.\" Sarah answered her. They all looked at her with a doubtful glance. She then gave Kara a nod to which Kara turned and walked to an open spot. She didn't need that much room compared to you, but Sarah thought that the Butlers/ Bennets would need a little distance at first. \"We would normally ask you not to overreact but it isn't like you can go anywhere so... just give us a chance, like we have for you. We will not harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Kara turned to face you all again then started to glow. Her way of transforming was infinitely more preferable than yours. She started to glow a bright white and blue. Then smoke came from her, like the stuff that comes off of ice when it hits the warm air. Not enough to impede sight but enough to be seen. The source of the light became larger as she changed. It didn't allow people to see anything other than the bright light until she was done. She could do this in the span of a few seconds if she wanted to, but was taking it slow for their sakes. When the light began backing down it revealed hear beautiful dragon form, glimering in the extra light. She was definitely more majestic than you were, and beautiful in the full sense of the word. It was why she was going first. You were hoping you wouldn't have to change at all. One dragon was enough. Yours would no doubt scare the crap out of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... what is that?\" Asked Lyle, Clairs brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 'who's that?' mister.\" Kara corrected as she flexed her wings and tail before coming over and lying down in a presentable position. \"My name only has 4 letters. Is it really that hard to remember for you humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a dragon!\" Claire exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good to see your eyesight is as keen as ever. Perhaps you would like to point out my blue color next.\" Kara teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara...\" Sarah warned as she gave her foreleg a good whack. \"... be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let the curious humans have their questions.\" Kara relented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Bennet, that really isn't going to help.\" You said as you saw him holding and pointing a gun. \"Even if you got a lucky shot, do you really think a bullet of that size could stop a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?\" he asked, as he switched his target to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons can read and enter minds. Helps with talking and understanding other sapient species. It also helps if our flapping jaws are making others nervous. So naturally we know your actual name.\" You answered then narrowed your eyes on him. \"But back on the gun topic. The only person a gun would work on between us three is Sarah. However she is the last one you want to use it on. She's the ONLY human that both Kara and I are scared of. Try to shoot us and we'll brush it off. Try to shoot her, and she'll kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right.\" he replied then holstered his gun. \"That makes you a dragon as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but different type that Kara. Honestly, I don't really want to show you that form of me. It... well it is not anywhere near Kara's beauty. I would rather leave a good sight to establish us by. I can show you something she can't do though. I can grow parts of my dragon side.\" You answered and presented your wings and tail, along with your eyes, as did Sarah. They oggled at the new developments for a while, then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a dragon as well?\" Mrs. Bennet asked Sarah for the rest, because of her now showing eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Max was nice enough to give me the ability to see through a dragon's eyes. No, I... actually all of us, are also ninja. We can do many things that normal humans can't even dream of doing. I got enough power to hold my own against Kara in a straight fight. Max on the other hand... I am just glad he is on my side.\" Sarah answered as she stroked the edge of one of your wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be possible.\" Mr. Bennet stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon part or the ninja part?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is two dragons and a teleportation to our count that says that it is possible. Do you have ANY proof to the contrary? Really, for someone who has a daughter that can grow back limbs would be able to accept things he hasn't seen before.\" Sarah replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you want from us?\" Mr. Bennet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what we said, some help. As dragons, and people, from... let's just say a very far off place, we try hard to fit in and live in secret. But supressing dragon instinct and helping the right people at times can be a challenge. So, we were hoping you could help us. At the very least, we can talk to people about things we don't understand.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you need help adjusting?\" Claire asked, glancing at Kara before going back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't imagine how hard it is to pass off as a human.\" Kara answered. \"All your little things that you all do and don't do. It is hard not to roast someone that slaps my butt going down the street. Sometimes I lose it a little, like that instance with the other cheerleaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was awesome.\" Claire defended to which Kara hummed a content hum with a friendly smirk, keeping her teeth hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you liked it. But we had to work overtime to... convince the police and school board that Kara wasn't at fault. As warranted as it may have been, it was far too high profile a move to do. Kara still has a ways to go as far as her human actions are concerned.\" You said back, to which Kara turned her head away for a moment. \"In the end, we have a lot to learn and could use the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\" asked Mr. Bennet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch, unless you count babysitting a couple of dragons a catch, in a manner of speaking. On the positive side, you have a few ninja and dragons to help if you need it.\" You responded back, in a tone that was a little embarassed. Your tail twitched along with your wings as you waited for them to respond.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I've observed one thing about your family it is that you all know the value of our secrecy from personal experience of some kind.\" You answered simply as you could, retracting your dragon parts to help them become less distracted. \"Kara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, not already.\" she whined. \"I just got changed. You have to at least let me do a few laps of flying before I have to be all cramped in human form again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Take your laps, but keep an ear open. We'll be leaving soon.\" You relented. She happily nuzzled you a little then took off to do some laps around the room. At the farthest point of the room she roared happily as she twirled and dove to her delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really is beautiful.\" Claire observed. You knew Kara could still hear you, but it wasn't worth saying at this point. Kara deserved some praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's happiest when she is flying with someone. Sadly, she hasn't been able to fly as much in general lately.\" You stated as you all watched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks good as a human too.\" Lyle stated, that got him a few looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she would appreciate the compliment, Lyle.\" Sarah praised, which got him to blush and go silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Max.\" Mr. Bennet said suddenly, after a short round of just watching Kara soar around the room. Perhaps the whole situation was becoming clear to him, or he could've seen that you all cared for each other like he does with his family. Either way, he had come to a decision. \"We'll help your family out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose having you on our side would be a good thing. At the very least, you can keep Claire safer than what I can do by myself.\" He replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we can do that. Not like she will be a pain to deal with.\" Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing, who's in charge between all of you?\" Asked Mrs. Bennet, finally catching her voice in this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I am.\" You said simply but then had to give some credit to Sarah, so you continued. \"But Sarah is the smart one. She usually makes all the decisions. But if it came down to it, I would be the one with the final word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she older than you?\" Claire asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am the oldest, but only by about a year. We all are near 23 years old. Dragons just age slower than humans in appearance. That and we can live for a few thousand years if we aren't killed by an outside force. Our human forms follow that same rule.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, dragons.\" She said, then leaned on her husband for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you look like?\" Claire asked you. It was her best shot at asking a good question and breaking the silence while her father comforted her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dragon form?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Are you as big and beautiful as Kara?\" Claire asked in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am a few times larger. But my dragon form is a little bit...\" You started but didn't really know how to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awesome.\" Sarah butted in. She nudged you a little as she joined the conversation. \"But he is a huge black dragon with red eyes and REALLY big teeth. It isn't a secret why he doesn't want to show you. It isn't something that is peaceful or 'beautiful' like Kara. But once you get past his size and scary ass looks, he is a big teddy bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not true.\" You stated to which they looked at you. \"Teddy bear? I got no fur.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok smarty, how does a giant reptile plush toy sound?\" she teased back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll stick with the Teddy Bear reference.\" you joked back. Hoping that the intereaction between you two woule lighting things up around the group. You then looked at Lyle as he had his eyes still glued to Kara. \"You don't want to ride her, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He almost coughed in suprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been a while since anyone rode with her. If you want to, I'm sure she would love it. Although, she might show off a little. Its been a while since she's had a crowd or anyone new to impress.\" You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, is that even safe?\" asked Mrs. Bennet, recovering from her mind overload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, as long as he doesn't jump off or anything. Kara is an expert at flying.\" Sarah responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I try first?\" Claire offered but continued her point before her Father could say anything. \"If I come back in one peace than we know how safe it is. If not, then I don't die... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. But only if you can convince her to take you.\" Mr. Bennet receded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ride her?\" Claire asked the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't a pet. You have to ask her.\" Sarah informed as she pointed for her to ask Kara instead of the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY KARA, CAN I TALK TO YOU PLEASE?\" Claire yelled. She recieved a roar as a response then saw her aproach. She backed up as Kara landed then approached the approaching dragon. \"Um... I was... I was wondering if I c-could, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well spit it out already.\" Kara stated. You could tell she was in a good mood from hearing all that praise of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering... If Lyle and I, could go flying with you... on you... like riding you... please?\" Claire asked to which Kara smiled at her nervousness, but even more than that was that someone new wanted to ride her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can!!!\" Kara answered and gave her a lick. That made Claire fall back a few feet with suprise, not to mention a slightly wet frontside, wet with a barely noticable amount of dragon drool. \"Oh, sorry. I forgot you humans don't do the whole kissing affection thing, or tongue baths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Mr. Bennet demanded of you, not wanting to ruin a good moment for his daughter if it was just a communication error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We dragons are kind of like a dog/cat hybrid when it comes to human loyalty and affection... well when we value humans as company anyway.\" You started to explain. \"Anyway, Kara just got her human form and, like I said before, lacks her human understanding. It wasn't a bad thing in any way. She was just thankful and excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I taking you both at the same time?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense Kara, but my family just wants to make sure it is safe. Then, provided that it is, Kyle would like to ride you.\" Claire stated then peckoned for Kara to come closer to which she did. You didn't know how Claire was dealing with the normal fear that most humans had of being that close to a dragon's jaws, but she was handling it very well. Claire then proceeded to whisper something to Kara, that of course you could hear. \"I think he has a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though so, but I wasn't sure about human behaviors yet.\" Kara said back. \"Well get on already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just climb up.\" Kara instructed, moving into a more obvious position so she could see what to do. It took Claire a few tries but she eventually got up and into the place at the base of Kara's neck. It was a good thing that you taught Kara how to make a saddle jutsu. Otherwise Claires legs would be shredded by Kara's scales. With that done and her holding onto Kara's neck spike, she turned and took off. It started with screams, and before her father could ask a concerned question she started laughing and screaming like she was on an insane roller coaster. Kara was really good at flying and knew, even better than you, what felt good to a rider. This anxious day was turning out good after all.</span></div></div>",

However, you felt he was still alive, so you didn't worry too much about it. The part that really got to you was the protective hiding they were doing with your group. In the end, they didn't want your family to be on anyone's radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we can't let the company or anyone like them get their hands on you.\" Claire defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they do? What in the world could they do? Seriously, you humans aren't THAT stupid as to openly threaten a dragon.\" You stated. You were alone with Claire at the moment. So much had happened since telling them that you all thought it was best to keep seperate unless needed and at least one dragon with Sarah at all times. Not that you doubted Sarah, but there was just something about being watched over by a dragon that made her feel a little safer, and you less worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Sylar?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, that guy that cuts open heads and gains abilities?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and if he gets the ability to turn into a dragon...\" She started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" you interupted. \"Is that really what you all are worried about? Being a dragon is not an ability. It is what I am. Would Sylar be able to turn into a dog if he cut its head open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not. But what about the people that take away abilities?\" she asked, thinking of another threat to your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chakra is a physical ability, not like the one you have. Our ninja skills will always remain. The only ability they COULD take away is my and Kara's ability to turn human. And if they take that away... well then they will be having a really bad day. I can be a little... annoyed when forced to change like that. I might even change my ruling on eating the people that do such a thing.\" You stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that would backfire pretty bad.\" She agreed then thought for a little bit. \"What about time traveling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one would be a pain.\" You agreed. \"But if things got too bad, I could always wait a few thousand years to eat the idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You being a dragon, just isn't fair you know.\" She teased then pushed you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I'm going to appologize for that.\" you answered back with a smirk. But your smirk turned to a concentrated face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I haven't met a lot of your super powered friends but... are you expecting anyone?\" You asked as you sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, who is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, never smelled this scent before. All I can tell you is that it is a person with an ability. People like that smell a tad different than normal humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little. Kind of like the difference between white and black people. Still human, just a 'tad' different. Not something that anything less than a dragon nose can pick up.\" You answered back, then snapped your attention to the direction of the person. \"The person is in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You both got bord waiting so you started talking about random things, like school stuff and past experiences that were not emotionally draining to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine Sarah being that young and clueless.\" Claire stated. She had only seen Sarah as a calm SIster to you and Kara. Sure she was nice, smart, and hot, but never young and clueless like you were implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. She was all innocent back then. Still a smart ass but...\" You stopped it there at the presence of the person finally coming into the room. Claire seemed to shoot up with fright. The chairs you two were sitting in were pointing toward the rest of the house. You wanted to have enough room to fight a little, if necessary. You remained seated, relaxed, as you felt nothing too dangerous from him. \"Friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" The man stated for Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suggest you tred carefully, boy.\" you said, glareing for a moment then looked to Claire. \"So, who is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max, that's Sylar.\" Claire stated, not taking her eyes off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say. Well, isn't this interesting. They say you are a monster, that hunts other people like prey.\" You said, looking over at him again but still not getting up. \"I find that desciption comical. To think you are the highest predator alive is very arrogant of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we've been introduced.\" Sylar stated as he looked at you as if trying to figure you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My appologies. You're right, I didn't introduce myself.\" You said as you got up. \"My name is Max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know about me, then you know why I am here.\" Sylar stated, as he looked at Claire than back at you. \"But it seams I get one more for my trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'One more', what do you mean by that?\" You asked, cocking your head to the side as if confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's here to get our abilities, to kill us.\" Claire informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he now? Claire, I already told you. No one can do what I can do. As for stuff like this...\" you said then held out a hand and started cycling different styles of jutsu until you ended on a small verson of a fire dragon jutsu. \"... it is not something that can be taken. Takes a lot of training to get this good. As for you, aren't you like the only person that can survive his little head examination? You really think he can kill us, or me in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.... nevermind.\" Claire said, being snapped out of her fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can stop me?\" Sylar asked in an almost vindictive voice. He obviously got a kick out of scaring people before he killed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try attacking if you want. I am not about to tip my hand to you. I am not one to start a fight. But if you threaten or harm those I care about... then I'll retaliate.\" You answered in a strangely calm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just kill him. He's killed dozens of people.\" Claire almost begged of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've killed hundreds. People's intentions are hard to judge from a distance. I can't control what he will do, but I can control how I will respond. I won't kill someone simply because someone says he deserves to die. If I thought like that, there would be a lot of dead people around here.\" You scolded, to which she looked down in almost guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Claire responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I am scared of you?\" Sylar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now. If I wanted to scare you, then you would be running from the house with soiled pants. But I tire of this. My Sister is waiting for me and Claire. I am sure that her wrath is far more harmful than yours. So make a move dumbass.\" You said rather bluntly. </span></div></div>",

Then, with a flick of his wrist, flung both you and Claire against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.\" Claire said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told you that he couldn't do anything.\" You said back, not even thinking this as anything more than an annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" Sylar stated then threw some knives at each of your limbs to hold you both still. However, this was more than forseen. You put a barrier on Claire before he got there, and your skin... well, if a bullet couldn't breach it, than how much less would a dull knife. Not to mention you grew a layer of scales underneath your skin. The projectiles broke to pieces as they tried to impale either of your limbs. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop now. Go ahead, I'm sure you'll get us eventually.\" you urged sarcastically. Claire seemed to understand a little more and smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your power? I'd like to see how that works.\" He stated then approached you. He pointed his finger with his smirk back on. But that too fanished as his little slicing off head trick was rendered useless against your scales and barriers. \"I'll figure this out later. For now, I'll get what I came for.\" He then went over to Claire but didn't get past your barriers any more than he did with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, giving up already? I'm sure if you work at it hard enough, you would be able to cut us somewhere. It would take you about a hundred years, but that is nothing for an ageless guy like you... Oh yeah, you don't have that ability yet. Guess you don't have that long then. But we do, go ahead, take your time.\" You teased. Sylar would've sealed your mouth if he could. But you weren't about to forgo the pleasure of openly messing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Sylar said, but not letting either of you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max!\" called an aggitated voice that you and Claire knew as Sarah's. Both of you cringed with a little fear. It wasn't long before Sarah and Kara came in. \"What the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hagging around. Oh, this is that Sylar guy.\" You said, introducing them to him. \"He is trying to figure out a way to get our abilities. It is a comical exercise to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So HE is why you are late?\" She asked, glareing at Sylar, to which he backed to a position that he was still holding you and Claire but facing the two that just came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want anything to happen to them than...\" Sylar started but was thrown by a Shadow stitch jutsu from Sarah. You and Claire were let go and dropped to your feet. Sylar didn't have much time to recover as Sarah grabbed him by the leg and threw him into another wall, using a jutsu so he just hit it with a 'THUD' rather than smashing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just ruined an entire evening of peace and relaxation. Claire, please let him take your ability.\" Sarah boomed then requested more calmly from Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" She asked. Sylar looked shocked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to punish him properly. But he would die after a few seconds. Unless, he could heal. After that, I can pummel him to oblivion and lock him in a genjutsu for a hundred years if I want.\" Sarah explained. Claire seemed to think about it. It wasn't like she would die, as you had previously pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, you know I don't want you to be harmed. But in this case I agree with Sarah. I personally guarantee that you will be alive at the end of this. If he tries to kill you, I'll force feed him his own spleen.\" You assured as, the last part you said in a serious tone to Sylar, as he got up from his impact against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Claire agreed. It wasn't clear if she did it because she didn't want to risk Sarah's mood or if she like the idea of the three of your family pummeling Sylar for the fun of it, and not ending at the normal death state. Perhaps it was a little bit of both. She then walke nervously over to Sylar than say in a chair. \"Just get it over with already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just giving me this?\" he asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we are going to punish you afterward.\" Kara explained. \"This will just allow us to take it further. So if you know what is good for you, you will make this a pleasant as possible for Claire. We like her, but already want to rip your arms off.\" She finished with her practiced smile on. As odd as it seemed, Claire smiled at this sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Sylar didn't know what entirely was going on. But he did know that he was getting what he originally came for. So he started. You all flexed to hold yourselves back as Claire screamed in pain. But, either out of fear or sadistic equallity, he took what he wanted and put her head back together. He watched a cut on his hand heal then looked toward the three of you standing in his way. He charged up, what looked like a fire attack, and let loose on the three of you. But you simply sucked it in like air, then breathed out some smoke at its conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was foolish.\" You informed as Kara breathed in and let her own jet of blue flames out, covering him in the blue inferno. You had a hard time keeping the wards you placed to protect the house and Claire. But Claire was well enough to get out of the way and stand next to you. Upon Kara's completed exhale, Sylar stood there burned to the bone and in pain, as his remaining skin was aflame. But his body just healed and didn't end his agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was a proper flame attack, and I was holding back.\" Kara said with some pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, my turn.\" Sarah stated then, in a flash, appeared before Sylar, reached into his revealed organs, and started reducing each of them to mush with her hand while the other held his throat so he couldn't stop her. She then started severing nerves until his skin and other parts grew back. He was in agony, begging her to stop by the time he was completely healed again. She then stopped after a few kidney jabs, but brought his face to hers, so she could speak more... intimately. \"Now, I trust we don't need to have this conversation again. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! yes! What the hell are...?\" He started but was cut off by her letting go but bringing her knee up to meet his gut. He might have a whole army of powers, but he was still human. A well placed punch or knee to the gut hurt just as much. He clutched his midsection and cumpled to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The corrrect response would be, 'Yes, I understand' then leaving as soon as possible.\" Sarah informed, looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I UNDERSTAND!\" He yelled in an attempt to get across his obedience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing.\" Sarah said to which he froze just as he had been able to get back to his feet. \"You owe Claire an apology, then you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.\" He stuttered out then stumbled out of the house as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd see him run away scared like that.\" Claire informed in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I get to kick his ass too?\" Kara whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause Sarah is scarier than you.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it mister!\" Sarah snapped, to which you all stood staight up at attention. \"Now the whole mood for a relaxing night is ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on... I'm sure we can still make something of the night. How about a heat massage and a lick down?\" You offered. Even if you didn't like the idea of anything close to eating anyone, especially her, she still tasted amazing and your dragon tongue, even in your anthro form, was more than a comfortable bathing tool for her. Not in a sensual way. She bathed her private parts by herself. But you licking off blood or sweat from her legs, arms, and back was a very desired addition to the occasional massage you gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a deal. Let's go.\" She said, in a lighter tone. The rest of the night would be pampering each other in different forms while recapping experiences and sometimes picking on Claire. She was the only one there that was actually of this world. And the only one in this realm that could withstand any accidental instances where the jokes went too far. But, all things considered, you all like this kind of night. Slowly, there was another human becoming a part of your little group. You hoped it would be a good and lasting thing.</span></div></div>",

If you could learn it as well, you could do the same thing.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, fine, you've made your point. But how, you are the only one that can go back and forth between dragon and human at will?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think for a moment.\" You answered then dove into your mind. You were getting better at the whole looking into your genetic memory think. It was still a very hard thing to do, but it was now possible for you to push a considerable amount to get a targeted reply from the memories about a problem you were having. After about an hour of searching, you found one that would work. \"Ok, I have something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sarah asked for them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a combination of the Transformation Jutsu and a magical spell, but it also rewrites DNA a little bit.\" You answered, trying hard to find a way to explain it, but failing. \"It is the only thing I have, and it is kind of hard to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it give Kara a human form?\" Sarah asked, getting a little pointed, to which she backed off a little bit. She was still nursing what she did to you. She didn't want to do you any more harm, a feeling that would apparently be difficult to overcome, as will your feeling of fear around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it will. But it will hurt you, a lot. After that though, you should be able to go from human to dragon at will.\" You answered, part directly at Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are right about people possibly attacking us because of me, then I'll take the chance. Just do it and get it over with.\" Kara said, as she almost read your mind, laying down and bracing for what you would be doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that ready, you started the process. You had to infuse an inhalable smoke with changing magic, transformation abilities, and the physical nature to withstand the form in either, while still keeping her primarily dragon. It took some doing, but finally you spewed the thick red smoke over Kara. Sarah jumped back, just in case, and Kara caught the hint and started breathing it in. After that, she started thrashing around. She was using almost all her control to keep quiet, so not to draw attention with a roar. However, that meant she would thrash and buckle to this pain and transformation. She did this for a while until, finally, she was no longer seen among the smoke. You cleared the smoke out of the area, to which you and Sarah rushed over to the limp body of Kara on the ground... her human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a look at it as you both approached. As Kara had never wore clothes, she had none on in her transformation. Her body was very fit, but also a bit thin, probably reflecting her thin nature as a dragon. In her dragon form, her thin body made her a bullet in the air, in human form, it probably made her more agile. She had average to well endowed breasts that weren't overly huge but big enough that they would never be considered flat by any means, while still not being big enough to impede fighting. Her skin was fair but had a little darkness to it, making it look slightly Asian in skin tone. Overall she seemed delicate, but you knew that she was anything but, as far strength and her overlapping dragon powers were concerned. Most noticeably perhaps was her long, silky smooth, flowing, blue hair. It reached the small of her back and was currently spread around her in an oddly attractive mess, covering her to a certain extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let's get her somewhere else...\" Sarah suggested. You could tell she was suppressing basic human instinct to have you turn away from her as she was completely naked. But she didn't want to be rude after just getting you back. But her point was sound. You could feel the hooves of horses approaching and it would be best if they didn't catch you all there. So, you grabbed Kara's limp body and you all made it away, off to find a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where are you???</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life soon became more interesting. Luckily your group found a small village to hide in. Ninja and dragon instincts/powers made the transaction an easy one. It was useful for getting a place to yourselves and space to properly train Kara. But she needed a lot of work. After Sarah had got done teaching her how to be a human woman, she took it upon herself to ninja train her. But Kara still picked your brain as well. Most noticeable about this land though, that magic was outlawed, by penalty of death. Even things that weren't magic that looked like magic got people killed. So teaching Kara things and practicing yourselves was not an easy task. But you all managed, having dragon instincts helped immensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No magic, are they insane? There is no way to beat half the 'magical creatures' without magic!\" Kara complained as she practiced a spell that you had taught both Kara and Sarah. But for Kara, she still had Ninja training to do, a long way before she reached Sarah's level. So for her, she was practicing the spell while walking on the ceiling of the cave you all were in at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention that without good wizards and whatnot, the bad ones go unchecked. I mean really, if no one can defend against spells, then they just make easier targets... well except us ninja.\" Sarah added, as it was a source of frustration to her as well. As for Sarah though, you had also taught her 'Dragon's Eye'. Since Kara had all her strength as a dragon and her eyes as well, minus growing parts like you could, Sarah was feeling left out. So you developed a Jutsu that gave her some of your abilities, at a relatively high chakra cost. So she was working on endurance so she could use Dragon's eye without such a drain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" You put in as you practiced a few jutsus as well. \"Seeing people being executed for being different... good think we learned to blend in... well mostly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't help my hair!\" Kara defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing that all three of your human bodies were highly attractive, you all got a good deal of attention for it. It was a constant battle to evade people so that you could all get out and train. But it sharpened your wits, so it wasn't all bad. However, you and Sarah had it easy compared to Kara. Her beautiful blue hair made her even more of a target. So she most often  pin it up and keep it out of sight. In extreme cases she would color it with a jutsu. But it was her, and she actually really liked her hair. When cooped up in human form all the time, her blue hair made her remember herself better, making her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It also doesn't help that we are ogled by every guy in the area.\" Sarah added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well considering the circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind the humans staring at me. At least this human body is good for something. I've gotten a few free meals with that... what did you call it Sarah?... batting eye routine.\" Kara commented, making you look over at Sarah and she started to blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, did you give what I said earlier any thought?\" Sarah asked, changing topics rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one, you say a lot of things?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About moving, to Camelot. It seams like a good idea.\" Sarah reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I gave it some thought. I suppose, after Kara's training is done, we can go. I am concerned about being in that city though.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, because of the rule on magic?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is strict enough out here. But in the heart of the kingdom, where their eyes are probably more vigilant about such things... We will have to be VERY careful. Even our enhanced strength could be viewed as magical in their eyes.\" You answered back, obviously concerned about their safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it matter?\" Kara asked, to which she got a look from you. \"No, seriously though. I know we want to fit in and all that. But seriously, if it ever got to the point where were going to be executed then we can just turn into dragons and get out of there. At that point, we would have just as much reason to run, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want us doing that though.\" You stated, more securely. Very rarely did you completely stampede over one of their ideas. They were both smarter that you, Sarah infinitely so. But in the area of dominating over humans, in any regard, you felt very strongly on the matter. \"However, I understand. If they actually start burning us, it wouldn't hurt. But that would be the point where we could and should separate from them. And I suppose showing them a dragon wouldn't be a horrible thing in such a case. As long as we don't start fighting them in such a situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand, Max. We do not want to be painted in that light either.\" Sarah confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, there is that rumor... or legend... or whatever that is.\" You stated, referring to Arthur of Camelot. While he was young now, you all had heard whispers that he was more or less destined for great things, and on the good side of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to see about him...\" Kara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no seducing him!\" Sarah boomed at her. Not out of Jealousy of anything like that. But they had already decided not to do that to the poor boy. Against two dragon ninja women like them, if they wanted him, he didn't stand a chance. Again, not like they needed it for how attractive they looked. Most girls and women around had at least a little bit of pudginess to them. Apparently it meant they were wealthy, and those that were fit, were that way from being poor and working all the time. However, toothpaste was not on the shelves and the poor didn't have the luxury of keeping their teeth clean. So most men had a choice; nobility with an arrogant and few extra pounds, or simple with bad teeth, humility, and a fit body. Some didn't have a choice, but for people looking at Kara and Sarah, they were obviously a sight not usually seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to! But what is the harm in being friends?\" Kara asked, oddly in an innocent tone and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because men are stupid. Show some interest in them and they will think you are in love... uh... no offense Max.\" Sarah commented back, the last bit with a little more tenderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, we males are... yeah stupid would be a good word.\" you agreed, winning both of their favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that settles it then, right? We are heading to Camelot.\" Sarah said, slightly excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as Kara is done...\" you reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Max...\" Kara said sarcastically. The meaning soon became clear, as Sarah was in charge of training Kara and she wanted the most to head to Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kara, time to pick up the pace!\" Sarah said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was sure, with this new fire in her eyes and Kara's ability, as a dragon, to pick stuff up quickly, it wouldn't be long before you found yourself at the gates of Camelot.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Halt!\" came yet another guard. It astounded you of how many of them stopped your group, yet didn't do normal security checks. You supposed that it was because Sarah and Kara had hooded cloaks. It seemed like a good idea at the time. But the hooded look only made people want to look underneath. \"Who are you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just visitors and future residence of this great city, hopefully.\" You answered for the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reveal yourselves.\" He commanded, speaking mostly the two girls. He was highly on guard at the moment. Even if you all could get past him with little difficulty, you thought it unwise to knock out every person that pried too much, because that would be a lot of people. You gave each of them a nod to which they took off their hoods. He started ogling almost immediately, but just like all the others, changed to impressment mode rather quickly. \"What makes beautiful young ladies like yourselves want to cover your angel faces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would like to seek a future residence here and live in peace. We would like to avoid attention and wondering eyes to prevent getting in any trouble. But if we paraded through the city then we would gather a crowd of curious people rather quickly.\" Sarah stated in a very logical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can let us go, won't you?...\" teased Kara, giving the guard's arm a light stroke with her hand, a cute smile on her face. He was so distracted that he just nodded dumbly. \"Thanks, you're the best!\" she finished as she planted a small peck on his cheek, making him almost pass out before the put their hoods up and you all made your way through the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting rather good at that...\" you observed, pointing your comment to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't help it if men are powerless against a beautiful woman.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I am not a beautiful woman?\" Sarah asked in a slightly hostile tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! not at all.\" Kara answered quickly. The one thing that scared her, more than any threat you've made about eating her, was Sarah's temper. Sarah's temper could spark very quickly and end with a very... sorry person for whatever offense they had done against her. While she tempered her wrath towards you, as result of her actions against you with the leaf ninja, Kara was still fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all continued until you found a small piece of land or area that had a few broken down houses. You asked around and was able to find someone to buy the spot from. With your ability to materialize money, gold was an easy way to convince such people. So, with that done, you three started ripping down and building a forge and shop. You all figured that it was the best way to both stay under and over the radar. You also had a small area in the back for  training. Although, the only training you all could do was with the normal kind. As any chakra use would be considered magic. Your excuse would be to train in self defense and test weapons your shop made. All of you would be able to use the forge and tailoring parts of the place, but each of  you had specific jobs most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou primarily made the metal and weapons, Sarah appraised them and did the running of the place and basically anything that made good use of her escalated brain, Kara was the greeter and customer service face. Her figure and blue hair made people look twice and come back for more... at least that would be the concept. As for supplies, you could materialize it but that would raise too many questions. So you all didn't mind going out of the city for extra training, disguised as getting supplies. And, in no time at all, you all had a working life in Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max! Can you come in here please!?\" called Kara from the front of the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually did this when you weren't busy and a costumer had a question that she couldn't answer, mainly about what you could make for them or how something was made, like ninja tools. (Not that they knew them as such, they just looked weird enough to ask questions.) You came into the room from the back forge area to greet whomever was there.</span></div></div>",

His gaze lingered on the girls for a moment too long, but came back to the collection that was displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work hard, Sire.\" You answered with a slight bow. \"What can we help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just looking in this new shop. I make it a point to know about everything in this city. Mainly because I have to search it all the time. So, I came in, not expecting much. But I see a very... interesting collection here. Did you make them all?\" Arthur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sire.\" you answered, to which you got a look from Sarah, \"Of course with the help of my sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so they are your sisters then?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sire.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you don't mind my ladies. But you are quite fetching.\" He compliment to which they gave a polite bowing curtsey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are honored you think so, Sire.\" Sarah stated, as Kara was still learning the whole polite and royalty way of responding to humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you noticed a boy that was about Arthur's age. You were surprised that you hadn't noticed him before, since you could clearly tell that he had the gift of magic, but far greater than anything anyone around the kingdom had. You wondered for a moment how he could be so powerful but still so unnoticed, then moved on to entertaining his apparent master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something in particular that has caught your eye, Sire?\" You asked, referring clearly to the collection of clothes, armor, and weapons that was displayed. You even had some potions around, but that wasn't the main attraction of the room. It was a forge and tailoring shop after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this one. It seams a bit strange.\" He said as he picked up a Katana. Kara almost freaked at this, as did Sarah but wisely didn't vocalize it. However, Arthur seemed to pick up on this and put it down carefully, trying not to offend the gorgeous women in the room. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, that is a Katana. Pardon the reaction, but most of the weapons that we make are very high end and VERY dangerous. For most that don't know what each item is, it is like having a child play with a loaded crossbow.\" You explained to which you saw him start to get defensive. \"Not that you are a child, Sire, it is just that most of these things need a certain amount of training to wield them properly... Maybe it is best to just show you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" He said, slightly intrigued. You took the Katana off the rack. Arthur seemed to note the care you were taking with it. Then followed you into the back. He was slightly disappointed that the girls weren't joining him though. Eventually you made it to the training and testing area. \"Nice training spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we use it to train and test new weapons we make.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to train? You are just a blacksmith.\" he asked. Despite the rude comment, he was curious and it was a question you got a lot. Apparently a trained villager, blacksmith aside, was cause to expect trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it helps making new types of weapons. If I know how a weapon is used and the ways to used it, then I can improve on weapons that already exist with more accuracy.\" You answered then reached a practice dummy next to a rock. \"Would you grace me with a demonstration of your sword's power, just so you can see the difference?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur may have been more noble then most if not all royalty, but he still had pride and liked to show off. So, with a smile, he took out his sword and started hacking away at the practice dummy, taking impressive chunks out of it. He stopped when he was satisfied that he proved his superior skill. The dummy was in rough shape, but still solidly standing. For what you had seen of the skill around this area, he was impressive for his age. Nothing compared to you and the girls, but still, not that bad. You stepped forward and he gestured to the dummy, as if to say, 'your turn, see if you can top that'. So you unsheathed the sword and held it in a basic but strong stance for a Katana. Then you sliced at the dummy four times in proper but again basic slashes. You didn't need them ogling at your fighting skill, just the blade. Which they did, as the dummy split into 8 cleanly sliced pieces of the dummy. You then moved over and did the same to the rock. After that you wiped the blade, very carefully, on your clothes and sheathed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What matter of sword is that?!\" Arthur almost coughed out, not knowing what to say. Even the boy with him seemed impressed, as if he'd just seen magic... then again, from the power you were feeling from him, magic shouldn't be a surprise to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is called a Katana. It is not made like the swords that are primarily around here. It takes a great amount of effort to make just one, but the result is well worth it. However, it also takes practice a separate skill set to master. It is extra strong and, as you have seen, VERY sharp. Which is one of the reasons why we were freaking out when you picked it up. If a random person wants to come in and accidently chop off their hand, then fine. Their fault for touching what is not theirs, but if you were to do it... that would be a bad thing in many senses of the word.\" You answered, you paused so he could understand your position then continued. \"This type of sword is superior to many types, mainly because of the material and fighting style. But an amateur is more likely to hurt themselves than any opponent that they might have. I suppose the most prestigious effect of this type of sword, that tends to catch people's attention, other than cutting through other swords, is that it can be used against magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say again... does that mean that it is also made with sorcery?!\" Arthur almost accused, getting very tense in a split second. You kept your cool, as freaking out with him wouldn't help anything. You didn't need to explain much to him, but using a Katana from the ninja world that could deflect the elements and magic was not magic in itself, but it looked like it. So having the prince understand, so you could use in in defense without being executed, could only be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it does not use magic nor is it made with magic.\" You answered, then thought about how to explain it in terms he would understand. He seemed still on edge, as evidence to the hand he had on his sword, but was less hostile. \"Think of it like this. Imagine if the normal weapon material was wood, and someone comes in with the first steel sword ever. Cutting through their apparently strong weapons would seem like magic. When the reality is that the blade is just superior to what is before it. Likewise, the katana is made and crafted at such a high level that it is superior to many magical effects. So if, for example, a dragon was to blow fire at a person using a katana. The person would only need to tilt the sword at an angle that it splits the fire being thrown at him or her. So, in a way, a katana is perfect example of how a normal person can defeat magic, without using magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that is hare to take in.\" Arthur stated, not really believing it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it this way then. Would I boast about a magical sword in front of you? Especially knowing the penalty for sorcery?\" You asked, pretty much rhetorically. He thought about it for a moment then nodded in agreement, taking his hand of his sword and standing more at ease. The boy with him still seemed to have questions though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a very interesting weapon. Could other weapons be made like that one?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. You could make a knife or other type of sword with the same metal and it wouldn't be as effective as a Katana. Then again, when two swords are fighting with the same skill behind them, the stronger and sharper wins. So, find me a superior metal, and I can make a better sword for you than what you have, in any style you wish.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you tell me this? It has to be a secret of some kind.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. But if a magical being comes around and I kill it with a katana, it would look like magic. Explaining it to you now would save on the explanation later, and you would understand. I really like my head, so losing it because I used a sword that others don't understand would be a pain.\" You answered, throwing a joke in there for good measure. He smiled at this, it probably also helped that you had jut complimented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it has been... interesting. I think I may return soon.\" Arthur said, taking a quick glance at the sword and toward the shop, as if penetrating the walls and looking at the gorgeous women inside. Women that could probably rip him apart, not that he needed to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is an honor to have Prince Arthur as a guest.\" you said with a bow. He then took his leave through the door to the street, from the training area.  </span></div></div>",

While Kara couldn't turn into a dragon as part of keeping her other side and she was incapable of growing parts like wings to stretch, she still had fun hunting, even if she couldn't use her teeth and claws to do so. But either way, they were gone when you heard a loud pounding at the door, just after you had closed for the night. Unknown to him, there was a certain amount of protection for the building. No one, even you, could teleport in or out of the place. But you knew that putting barriers and wards to strengthen the walls and such would only cause suspicion. So you reinforced the frame with high grade steel and thick enough to withstand a few hard hits from a dragon. You didn't need a robber to intrude and make off with some of your advanced weapons. Either way, when you went to the door to tell the person that you were closed, you opened the door to see a very familiar prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire...\" You said, as if surprised. Honestly, you could smell him from a block away. But he didn't need to know that. You got out of his way so he could come in. He walked in and looked around as you shut the door. He was obviously looking for Kara and Sarah. \"They are out, training and gathering supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is just the two of us?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sire.\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I wanted to talk to you.\" He responded, pacing a little bit nervously. You squared your stance so he knew he had your complete attention. He took a pause then continued. \"It has been bothering me, ever since I came here last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has been bothering you Sire?\" You asked. Honestly, he could have a bunch of questions that you had anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that you train, and that you make weapons. Any idiot would understand that you have a halfway decent knowledge base of fighting if that is the case. I thought that maybe it was not the case. But after seeing that.... sword... I have to know, how good are you? And are you a Noble by any chance?\" He asked and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to say that I have a lot to learn, Sire. But I can handle myself. As for being a Noble... I can't say that I am.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to see the skills you possess.\" He stated, or more demanded. It was hard to tell with royalty when they were stating or demanding something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you came so late, and with no one around?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I don't want your customers being turned away when you lose. I know that could deter business.\" He answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Sire. I have a smaller area in the forge that is open enough to have a sparing match.\" You answered as you pointed him to a way to the place you suggested. You didn't know wither to be offended that he thought you would be bad enough to lose or impressed that he would think of a peasant's business as a concern. You both quickly arrived at the place where you could have a match without any prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, are you going to use that Katana?\" He asked as he got in a ready stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sire. A fully dispatched Katana like that is not meant for sparing, it is meant for killing and/or defeating an enemy. I can use this though.\" You said as you took a practice sword from the bench. It was still metal but not sharp at all. However it still had the shape. You got in a ready stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hold back. I am not leaving here until I see your ability to fight.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then he started by slashing at you. A solid opening move that you had seen many times since coming to Camelot. But he obviously hadn't faced a Katana before, or a Dragon ninja wielding it. While his arm was up you easily brushed passed him and rapped his side with a strike. You didn't  hit him too hard, but enough to know that you had just beat him in a single blow. He tried again, and again, and again... over and over again, you beat him in a similar fashion every time. His final attempt he jabbed at you and you sidestepped, bringing your practice sword up and into his wrist in a way that made him lose his grip on his sword. You caught it before it was a few inches away from his hand while sweeping his legs then pinned him to the ground with both swords in a cross against his throat. He was out of breath from his attempts but you weren't even slightly winded. You looked into his eyes and he into yours so he knew you had beat him and wouldn't be losing anytime soon. After that you got up and he did likewise. You tossed your practice Katana on the bench and then humbly returned his sword to him. He took it, as if he didn't really understand it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you are the best swordsman I have ever seen, let alone fought. You soundly defeated me, many times. I am glad we were inside.\" He stated as he sheathed his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, you said not to hold back. I didn't wish to displease you.\" You answered in a tone that implied that you thought you had done just that. While you weren't afraid of him, angering a member of the Royal house was drama you didn't need, especially if you wanted to stay in Camelot peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. You did very well. I am just wondering how someone as skilled as you is just sitting here making swords. You could be a Knight with the skills you have.\" he said before he realized what he was saying, then stopped himself. He knew almost better than anyone that people that weren't Noble couldn't be Knights. So flaunting that was not a nice thing to do. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it as an insult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No apology needed Sire. You are right, I am no Noble. If it makes you feel any better, our skills are yours if you need them.\" you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... wait 'our'... you're not telling me that your sisters are as good as you...!\" he said as you both made it back to the front of the forge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in fact, probably better than me actually.\" You responded. And you weren't lying. Sure you could do more damage. But as far as raw weapon skill, Sarah was by far the most skilled, you and Kara had different strengths that exceeded the other in that category. When using chakra and magic, not to mention dragon abilities you were better, but that was not allowed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that is just crazy.\" He said, staggering a little bit, trying to get his head around the matter. If he only knew how far above them and him you three were, he would probably faint. \"W-will you three, fight for me if I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sire. Of course we will. Although....\" you started, but paused as you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Arthur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You might want to keep the two girls out of it when possible. They can get moody and have a temper, especially Sarah. Having us deal with an enemy would be one thing, but stopping her when an enemy wants to kill her, for whatever reason...\" you stated than added a shiver for dramatic effect. \"Let's just say, she isn't that good and going half speed, even in tournaments and sparing. You shouldn't let those two loose unless you really want someone dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let who two loose?!\" Said a slightly escalated voice of Sarah coming through the door, carrying a very large load of unprocessed metal, much more than even a horse could pull. Arthur almost gulped at the sight and your warning, not to mention that they were apparently more lethal than you are. However, as soon as they saw who it was, they put their loads down and bowed respectfully. \"Forgive me your highness, welcome to our home!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arthur took his leave rather normally considering the events and what you had told him. In the end, you figured that he didn\u2019t really know the really shocking stuff\u2026 yet. At the very least you had a potential ally on your side. But if any of you used any kind of jutsu or magic then\u2026 who knew what could happen, but probably nothing good. However, you didn\u2019t think that things would remain quiet for that long. Something was always happening for some reason. Maybe it was because no one really liked Uther, or maybe it was as they said, magic in this realm drove most people evil. But either way, there was always something to keep the three of you entertained. It was just such an occasion that Arthur had invited your three to witness him being crowned prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did he invite us?\u201d Kara almost whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wants to become better friends with us. Isn\u2019t that what he said?\u201d Sarah almost repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he would like a friendship with us three, sure. But I also think that having two hot young women around all the time is another motivation.\u201d You stated, Kara almost immediately agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like\u2026\u201d Sarah started but stopped as Arthur looked over at them, again. \u201c\u2026 ok fine, he might be slightly interested at the eye candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut must we wear these uncomfortable dresses?\u201d Kara asked, not liking the \u2018formal wear\u2019 that women had to wear to things like this. She was getting used to dresses and girl clothing, but the higher end things didn\u2019t appeal to her. \u201cFor something that is supposed to look \u2018proper\u2019 it doesn\u2019t feel any better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least they let you care a knife.\u201d You said, trying to improve her mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and you got to bring a Katana and full battle gear. Even if these noobs don\u2019t understand what ninja battle gear is.\u201d Sarah stated for the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore eye candy then. He has been mystified by the Katana ever since I showed it to him.\u201d You returned, shifting the Katana a little bit. It was true, Arthur turned to look at it almost as many times as he looked at the two women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that is our fault.\u201d Sarah replied back, sticking out her tongue at you for a quick second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the ceremony and the vows from the soon to become prince. He was crowned that way. And just as you all were about to celebrate and let young Arthur bask in his glory, something just HAD to happen. To that effect, a crash came from the large window at the end of the room. In crashed a knight on a horse, dressed in all black. The noncombat personnel we hurried out of the room. A few of those escorting tried to do the same to Kara and Sarah, but they wouldn\u2019t have it. You all crowded around at the end of the room, you ended up to the immediate right of Arthur, while the girls were directly behind you, watching him approach. Arthur looked at you as if you were crazy, not pulling your sword out like the rest of them. In fact, you looked utterly bored. The Black Knight came to a stop before the crowd of people, and threw down the gauntlet, quite literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, if you don\u2019t pick that up, I will.\u201d Sarah more demanded of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur heard it as well. But still having a fresh memory of her apparent danger and temper, he didn\u2019t hazard a quizzical look at her. Arthur\u2019s muscles flexed in a preparation to pick it up, but you were quicker and without hesitation. The King, never had seen you before, looked strangely at you as you held the armor, then tossed it back to the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted a fight, you just got one.\u201d You stated, accepting his challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSingle combat, Noon tomorrow, to the death.\u201d The Black Knight said in a monotone voice, filtered by his helmet. You could tell that this \u2018Knight\u2019 was not a human. Well he was, but you had smelled the undead before. Wither it be a wrath, Vampire, or something else, you could tell when a dead person was walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d You answered Rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight turned and slowly trotted out on his horse. It took a moment, but finally the Knight was out the window and the room could recuperate. It turned into a hall with the people moving so the King and Arthur could address you. Sarah and Kara stood beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally we get some action.\u201d Kara whispered to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much though\u2026\u201d You said, before the King could address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Why would you accept the challenge?\u201d The King asked, or more demanded an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather, these are the three I told you about, from the forge.\u201d Arthur put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Max, Sire.\u201d You started, throwing in a bow for good measure before continuing. \u201cI accepted because I came here as Prince Arthur\u2019s guest, not to watch some idiot trot in on his horse and ruin what could\u2019ve been a very calm and delightful night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your sister told you to.\u201d Arthur put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough.\u201d You answered back, nodding comically, but still respectful in a sense. After all, you were still in the King\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are not a Knight.\u201d The King responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery true, Sire. However, I have reached a similar level where I come from. So, if you transcend the language gap and mannerisms, I guess you can consider me a Knight from\u2026 very far away. I am sure Prince Arthur can vouch for me that I have the necessary battle skill.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is it called where you are from, if not Knight?\u201d The King asked. Probably nervous that some nobody was about to offset the power balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sisters and I are called, \u2018Dragon Ninja\u2019.\u201d You answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon?\u201d He asked with a gasp. \u201cYou are of magic?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me for my forwardness, Sire. But isn\u2019t your last name \u2018Pendragon\u2019? Just because something has a dragon in its name, doesn\u2019t mean it has any connection.\u201d You replied, sending mental winks to Kara and Sarah, who were having a hard time not smiling or laughing. Especially since the bluff seamed to be working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Even if I wanted to jail you till I am sure, you have a challenge to uphold tomorrow. The code demands you complete it. We will see if you are worthy of your own Knight title, and how it ranks with a true Knight.\u201d The King stated, a touch too arrogant for your taste.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are you sure about this?\" Arthur asked, as you were walking to the arena where everyone was pretty much waiting. Sarah and Kara were walking with you. But Arthur was concerned about people's safety, like always. \"I could take your place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Arthur, my I be blunt and forward?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Arthur returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then shut up. I doubt this Knight will put much of a challenge to Max. Are you really trying to take away the little bit of fun he is allowed to have? Trust me, you don't want to get in the way of this.\" Sarah stated to Arthur's shock, then accepted as he did say she could speak as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true though. The three of you were getting antsy, specifically you and Kara. Not being able to do magic, fly as a dragon, or use chakra was making each of you restless. Arthur finally nodded, remembering his own experience with fighting you. Although no one knew about it, he didn't need another lesson on how good you really are. Your walk split as you went to face the Black Knight and the other four (including Merlin) went to their spots to watch. You took your spot in the arena with the Black Knight. Arthur came forward to start the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This duel will be determined by the Knight's code and rules... to the death. May the match, BEGIN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you turned and faced the readied Knight across from you. He was inching toward you, but you didn't even draw your sword. You just stood there, waiting as he got closer. People watched with eager anticipation, some with confusion or fear. Once the Knight got close enough he swung a good slash with his overly large sword. You simply dodged it with ease. He tried again, and again, and again. Each time you simply dodged. But you knew that you could do this all day and it wouldn't make him any more tired, he was dead after all, not that any other people knew that, other than Sarah and Kara. So when he to a lung, you hit a few points, making him drop his sword and you back handed him so his helmet flew off and you had his sword in hand. The crowd gasped at the dead face that was now out and for all to see. You figured you should address the situation before anyone else did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, a Wrath huh? This is going to be more fun than I thought.\" You said so others could hear, then plunged his sword in the ground and backed away from it. This puzzled most of the crowed, but amused Kara and Sarah. They knew you were just playing with it. \"Go ahead, pick it up. I have no desire to fight a Knight without his weapon. You are bad enough the way it is, without your oversized weapon you would be hardly a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!!! I will kill you!\" The Black Knight Wrath screamed, which made some flinch after laughing at your mocking of him. He ran forward and grabbed his weapon, then started attacking you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you would dodge and do some damage. A punch that would drive him back, or a kick to his back side to make the crowd laugh, despite the situation. You even saw the King laugh, despite his bias against magic. A few times you disarmed him again, but gave his sword back. The whole think looked like a charity case instead of a proper fight. Eventually the crowd would laugh at the previously frightening screams and cries of the Wrath. You had loads of fun, since he didn't tire. But eventually you had to end it. So, you finally flicked open your katana. And when the Wrath rushed you with blind rage, you drew your sword and sliced through his sword, his armor, his body and then sliced a few more times. This rendered his limbs and head separate from his body, then sliced each of them in half as well. As soon as this happened, the other pieces turned to ash. You then caught a glimpse of a woman that was different from the rest of the crowd, only in the fact that she was utterly furious at the sight, while everyone else was cheering at the conclusion. You only glanced at her then brought your attention to the front, where the King was standing... apparently well entertained, as was Prince Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought that it only made sense that the King would want to address the whole thing. So after the whole celebration thing, you were brought to the Throne room. Sarah and Kara weren't invited, then again they weren't the ones in the spot light at the moment. So they headed home. You stood in the almost empty room, with King Uther and Arthur sitting on their respective seats/thrones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was rather outstanding. Giaus has revealed that the Wrath was... well he wasn't a beginner by any means. Very skilled, and you beat him easily. In fact, I doubt you needed a sword at all. Making a grown and magic infested Knight seem less then a child in comparison. But also, Gaius has said that no mortal weapon can kill a Wrath. So, that begs the question, What manner of weapon did you slay him with?\" King Uther asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Katana, Sire.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean? Is it magical in nature?\" King Uther asked. From both reputation and mood, he obviously was paranoid about magic. His campaign against ANY that practiced it was proof of that, wither they be bad or good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Sire. The type of Katana that I used is simply superior to magic, which means that it can be used to destroy magic things and beasts. That, normally, would require magic to destroy. As I have said to Prince Arthur, it is like a kingdom that uses wood swords as the standard. If someone comes in with a steel blade, then it would seem like magic when it easily slices through the wooden swords. When in reality, it is just a better blade, made with better material, and wielded correctly.\" You answered, using your tone to direct King Uther's mind to an acceptable place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... sounds very useful. Is there a way to make swords like that for our Knights?\" He asked. You knew that it would come up eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower grade Katana, certainly. But those would not be on the level necessary to deflect and defeat a magic user. A Katana like the one that I wielded, takes a considerable amount of time, effort, and skill to make, not to mention the materials are extremely rare. Even if you are able to obtain enough to outfit your entire army, or even just the Knight, they would have to be trained to use it. The style of using this particular Katana is far different than the sword style you have come to know, as you've seen.\" You answered, a long winded way of saying no. But just saying it bluntly might've been considered as disrespectful. You had enough trouble without adding a pissed off King to the mix. Especially if you wanted to remain in Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you suggest?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I may be so bold, my sisters and I could be like... mercenaries. Mercenaries that only serve the Kingdom of Camelot.\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that help?\" The King asked, almost on top of Arthur, who was thinking the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I've heard, there is no way that we can become Knights, and we do not wish to cause a conflict in this matter. We understand that you can't allow for allowances, otherwise everyone and his brother will request it, deserving or not. So, to make use of our talents, without losing face, we could be glorified mercenaries. Able to come and go as we please, answering only to Prince Arthur. That way, if someone would inquire, you could pass it off as a hobby of your son, rather than your kingdom relying on us more than your Knights.\" You suggested, again using tone of voice to make it seem like a good idea to his mind. Humans were so easy to manipulate in this way, especially arrogant ones like Uther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would obey this country's law's?\" He asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. In a sense we would be obeying Arthur. So if you or he needs something done that is not on the books, sort of speak, then we would get it done, even if it slightly outside the law. This instance with the Wrath can be an example. It would've taken magic to defeat it, but I was able to do so without compromising your kingdom, and without magic. So, I technically broke the law in accepting a Knight's challenge, while not being a Knight. But it worked out.\" You explained. They seamed to get it, Arthur would require more time, but understood a little bit. And... you could sense that his servant, Merlin, was listening in as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a good point.\" King Uther replied. \"Will you fight the curse that is Magic in this kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When necessary, but I wont go looking for it.\" You answered, which got a concentrated look from Uther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Magic is a blight on this land!!!\" Uther exclaimed. He obviously felt strongly against magic, if there was any doubt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I respect that you think that, and I will definitely help when there are innocents in the crossfire. But I am not ok with committing genocide on any group of people, regardless of their choices in life, especially if they have done no harm to date. That being said, if a magic user were to start murdering people, I would definitely take notice. But, as I have said, I have no desire to slaughter any group of innocent people, magic or normal.\" You answered, sounding very logical in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those that practice magic are evil! You must understand that!\" The King stated, pounding his hand down to emphasize his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would include your own family?\" You asked, to which his eyes narrowed. You saw that you would have to explain, before he blew... \" Do you think that, if some sorcerer used magic to give... let's say Arthur a magical ability, against his will. Arthur would be the same person, and the sorcerer would definitely be at fault. However, what would become of Arthur. You know there are enchantments capable of this. So, would Arthur be evil at that point?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not!!!\" Uther exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And THAT is my point exactly. I will not interfere with how you want to do with Magic users, but don't think that I will actively pursue all magic users, regardless of their ties. Until they identify themselves as a threat, I will not interfere.\" You put forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes a certain kind of sense. But would you protect a sorcerer, if they were in hiding?\" He asked, still in an accusing tone. But then again, he is the King, so he can do and say pretty much whatever he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will not hide a dangerous magic user from you. I will at worst turn them away, but if they have committed a crime then I will probably hand them over to the guard or you to deal with as you wish.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that will have to do.\" The King stated, slightly put off that you disagreed with him about his black and white vision of magic. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had wondered when the young Magic user at Arthur's side would come around. All three of you could sense that he had great magic within, more so than any other mage you had met to date. You assumed that he would be able to feel that you and Kara were not normal. But after watching him a little bit, you noticed that he was keeping this part of him a highly guarded secret, even from Arthur. So you three just waited for him to be ready. And true to that, you all heard someone come into the shop at night, just before closing hours. After your display with the Wrath you had a considerable amount of business, but luckily the shop was empty at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hello, how can we help you?\" Asked a cheerful Kara. She was getting good at that. Most of the time, people lost themselves in her... charms and bought something regardless if they needed anything. To this effect Merlin blushed a little bit but then seemed to remember why he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes. I was... that is I was hoping you, or maybe just you...\" looking over at you. \"... could help me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, was wondering when you would be coming around.\" you answered. He had a questioning face on, but you just waved him to follow you into the back. \"... could you two close up shop and meet me back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" they both said, being in a good mood today, or maybe it was that they thought something exciting was going to happen that they could take part in this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led Merlin to a back room that was usually used if you needed to add an enchantment on something. Since you couldn't have anyone from the outside hear the spell, the room was sound proof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, have a seat.\" you said as you gestured to a chair then sat down yourself. \"The girls should be around shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just wanted to talk to you.\" he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you want to talk with me about, and believe me, they are a part of it. Plus, they hardly ever get any excitement around here. Best to let them have some when they can get some...\" You said and advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you two were joined at a table by Kara and Sarah. They took their seats and you could tell that Merlin was slightly distracted by their looks, but once again was motivated by why he was there in the first place. Sarah and Kara seemed amused and impressed by this. Boys his age, even Prince Arthur, could barely do anything around them besides try to look down their shirts and whatnot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am not sure how to ask this...\" Merlin started, obviously nervous. After all, the magic topic got a lot  of people killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about like this.\" Sarah suggested then used a simple spell to light some torches around the room for more light. Previously it was just lit by a few candles on the table. Now it was well lit and could see his admiration and shock all the more. Not that any of your eyes needed the help, perks of being dragons... and dragon ninja in Sarah's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do have magic!?\" Merlin almost whispered, but with a great deal of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, even if we know your name, it is a bit rude not to introduce yourself...\" Kara stated. She only knew this because she had to learn it herself. And if she, as a dragon, had to learn it, then others that were already born human should do it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I am Merlin, Servant or Prince Arthur.\" He responded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kara\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to answer your question, yes we have magic. Not that we use it very often, especially in this kingdom. We also know that you have magic as well.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" He asked, a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean beyond seeing you do a few spells? You really need to learn to hide those gifts of yours. Other than that, we can feel your magic. You have a great amount of power inside you. Some that I don't think you even know about.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was more than true. Both you and Kara could tell that there was something familiar in him that you both liked and didn't like at the same time. It was as if he was a good friend, but one that could be a master if he wanted. More so for Kara, being full dragon. But you felt it as well. You were currently researching what kind of person would have such potential power over a dragon, but hadn't finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could... sense it about you as well. That, and Giaus had said that a Wrath could only be destroyed by magic.\" Merlin responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max wasn't lying to the king about that part.\" Sarah stated, making Merlin pay rapt attention. \"A Katana like the one he used is more than enough to defeat a Wrath, and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Main point is Merlin, we are Dragon Ninja. While we have a considerable knowledge of Magic, it isn't our main thing that we use. We utilize our abilities as Dragon Ninja first, especially around here.\" You started, then continued, \"We have also found that of all the people around, there are a total of 2 people that we would serve if it came down to it; Arthur and yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME?!\" He almost coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you.\" Kara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?... and why Arthur?\" Merlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, is a noble person. While we all agree that he has his moments, he is generally a good person and a just future King, leagues better than his father. As far as you are concerned, you are not ready to command us, but we find that your potential is there regardless. You two are the only two that we would heed of called to aid one of you.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand...\" Merlin stated, blushing at the attention, specifically from Kara and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do we, to be honest.\" Kara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they are trying to say is; for some reason we are being compelled to you. However, Max and Kara are getting the brunt of it. I still have the most freedom as far as that is concerned. That being said, if you tell them to do anything too dishonorable...\" Sarah said then leaned forward with a suddenly serious face. \"... I will force feed you your own stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I understand.\" Merlin stuttered out, sweating bullets. He obviously understood. Sarah had the unique ability to make someone feel extremely good and special in one moment and in the next be riveted with a sweating and shaking fear. It was safe to say that whatever power he had for controlling dragons, he would be careful if he ever learned of you and Kara.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going without us are you?\u201d Asked Kara as you three rode up to the part of people that was leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had heard that Merlin\u2019s mother was in town and asking for help. Besides being able to come and go in the castle, with limited supervision, you all had dragon and dragon like senses as well as being fully trained and very powerful ninja. So overhearing things was a constant. You each were on a horse with a considerable amount in packs strapped to each of your horses, not enough to tire the horse too much. But you knew that these people you were going to help probably didn\u2019t have much, so you brought some good swords and light armor. Of course all three of you were dressed in full dragon ninja battle gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you three are coming too!?!\u201d Arthur exclaimed and asked. He obviously wasn\u2019t expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah. Merlin is our friend too. His Mother and his home village is in trouble and we are supposed to what?... just leave them to die? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Kara replied and gave Merlin a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerlin\u2026 friends\u2026?\u201d Arthur asked, thinking that it was too forward for him to admit such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, may I speak freely?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Arthur more asked than answered, knowing she only asked that when she wanted to be overly blunt with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen please shut your trap before I accidently put a foot in it.\u201d She said with a sarcastic smile. Merlin was on the brink of laughing along with Gwen, Morgana however didn\u2019t hesitate in her laughing at Arthur\u2019s shocked and silent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026?\u201d You addressed Merlin\u2019s Mother. \u201cWe will be glad to help your village. We brought along some basic but decent arms and armor for your people as well. But we dare not intrude. May we help?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes indeed. Thank you my lord.\u201d She said with a bow. You held a hand to have her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, we are not knights or lords or anything like that, just friends.\u201d You stated, being very clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you all started on your journey. Eventually you all stopped for rest and you could hear a small conversation between Merlin and his mother. First she addressed Arthur\u2019s presence, as well as the lady Morgana. Then she got to you and your \u2018sisters\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat of them. They seem strange, and the way they talk to the prince\u2026?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2026 they have magic as well. I think they are very powerful. They knew of me just by feeling I had magic. Not only that, but I\u2019ve seen them fight and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. They use no magic, even though they could, and they still make people like Arthur look like kids playing with sticks.\u201d Merlin explained. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will have any trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you manage to gain their friendship then?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, they just said that they felt drawn to me. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d Merlin revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a bit then went to sleep. The following day you all were riding to the village when another attack was heard. A man was in the middle of killing a villager for talking back when Arthur threw his sword and the fight began, though all you and your sisters did was get off your horses and wait, at least for a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve got you!\u201d said a man as he pointed put a blade to Sarah\u2019s throat. The fighting stopped with this development. \u201cDrop your weapons!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d walk away, if you plan on having kids someday.\u201d You said in a bored tone. Arthur was a bit concerned, but upon seeing Sarah\u2019s souring mood and face to reflect it, he was more curious. He had never seen her fight before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it!\u201d He said and drove his blade toward her, while the leader got on a horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah moved at the last moment and brought a foot up to meet his family Jewels. Everyone cringed as they heard a crunch and blood began to seep from his is groin area. He fell over, probably wishing he was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeepers, I told you so.\u201d You stated before Sarah finished it by kicking his head in a way that snapped his neck. With this the leader rode away, yelling back curses and threats. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are trained in this kind of thing, while we are trained in farming and whatnot!\u201d One of the villagers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think there is nothing stronger than someone fighting for their home.\u201d Arthur responded as he addressed the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were understandably nervous and frightened, even after a rousing speech from Arthur. Most had heard of Prince Arthur and didn\u2019t doubt his skill, they just doubted their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we are mere villagers, with nothing but farm equipment and our fists to fight with!\u201d Said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Kara replied to which they all looked her way. You had just got done setting up a table and all three of you had just placed your packs on it. With Kara\u2019s little outburst and everyone\u2019s attention, you three started unwrapping an impressive display of weapons and armor. \u201c\u2026 I am sure you can put these to good use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 how did you get these?\u201d Asked Merlin\u2019s Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe made them. We told you we didn\u2019t come empty handed.\u201d You answered then turned to Arthur and nodded for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are able and willing, you may arm yourselves for battle. It may not be what you are used to, but you deserve to live in peace, and this fight will determine that.\u201d Arthur declared with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that we are complaining, but most of us don\u2019t know how to use half of these things.\u201d Said another man as he held up a large but deceptively light broad sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry, we will be doing a majority of the fighting. But you should still be armed to fight for your own village with quality arms. Better than a wooden stave if nothing else.\u201d Kara responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you certain? You are just a girl after all and they are highly trained soldiers.\u201d Said a boy from the village. Kara almost took it as an insult but saw he was more trying to protect the \u2018beautiful girl\u2019 rather than promote his own skill over hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can handle ourselves.\u201d Sarah butted in. As if to prove her point she flipped up a small knife from the table and threw it at a makeshift target that someone had set up to practice, burying the knife in the post to the hilt in the head of the target. The doubting members gulped nervously then went to outfitting and practicing with their chosen weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing how you three just gave these weapons to them as if they were nothing. These swords are better then what most of Camelot\u2019s soldiers have.\u201d Merlin responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was no problem at all. Honestly, it was getting a bit crowded around the shop with all these just hanging on the walls and such. We need room for the new stuff. Ever since Max fought that wrath with his Katana, we have been visited by anyone and everyone that wants something similar.\u201d Kara responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really as good as Max?\u201d Merlin asked. He had seen you fight, but not the girls. So he was as worried for their safety as the others. Arthur just knew better than to voice it, especially around Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, you\u2019re so cute when you are worried. Such a sweet boy\u2026!\u201d Kara flirted back with a brush of her hand on his arm, making him blush deeply. \u201c\u2026 but honestly Merlin, no one is better than Max. I am far above Arthur and about Sarah\u2019s level, but we are both below Max\u2019s skill and power. Max is just too nice to take credit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you will be ok right?\u201d Merlin asked insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we all will be fine. No need for you to\u2026 exert yourself, ok?\u201d Kara said, making sure he understood that he didn\u2019t need to resort to magic, especially not some that others could link to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thanks again for everything.\u201d He said then went about his business with his home village. He still had a bit to catch up on and talk with, most of which was his Mother and a boy that he seemed to know well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Kara asked as she saw you and Sarah looking at her suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly hope you aren\u2019t giving that boy any ideas without cause.\u201d Sarah scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a small bit of flirting. You said that it could be used?\u201d She said, blushing a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful. We still don\u2019t know why we are pulled to obey him to some degree.\u201d You warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention the broken heart he would have if you lead him on just to tell him you are\u2026 what you are and he hate you for it.\u201d Sarah added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara began heavily thinking on this. It was unclear if she actually was having feelings for Merlin, or if she was just pressing her knew advantage that her human beauty gave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most of the village was out of sight, waiting for the offending party of soldiers to come in and trap them. You however was in the direct center of the trap, standing in a cleared area in a relaxed position with one hand on your katana. Well, not yours but one that was of very high quality. You had been creating one for yourself that had some of your dragon attributes, materials, and skills in it. But that wasn\u2019t ready yet. Unlike most of even the higher end things that you were making, it was far more complicated and potentially impressive. Either way, the men came into the village and surrounded you as soon as they saw you weren\u2019t moving. They thought that they had trapped you, but it was more the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere have all the villagers gone?\u201d Asked the leader, trying to usurp his power and pride over yours and was slightly put off when you were just looking bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are around somewhere. I am standing here to give you one last chance.\u201d You said to which he looked comically at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChance for what?\u201d He asked with a bit of a chuckle in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave and never come back. Either way, this village is done doing your bidding and will not bend to you anymore.\u201d  You responded, a bit more serious than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you insane? We number over fifty, and there is just you and some petty villagers.\u201d He boasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance.\u201d You stated, almost interrupting him, which he obviously didn\u2019t like at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill this dog, and burn this village to the ground!\u201d He boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that a horsed spearman came forward and tried to impale you. You sidestepped and sliced him in half as you drew your katana. Of course the move was normally impossible with the armored horse in the way, but you had easily sliced through the armor, horse, and soldier in one fluid strike that was so clean that the man had time to look down before his half and the horse\u2019s neck slid from the rest of their bodies\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the trap was sprung and the village was suddenly filled with fighting. As promised, your group did a high majority of the fighting. Most were so dumbfounded by your three style of fighting that they were easy to pick off by those less skilled. Even without magic, draconic abilities, or flash jutsu the moves that you and the other two ninja were so different, successful, and refined that people couldn\u2019t help but watch. The only one that had any ability to look slighting good in comparison was Arthur. You all made it a point to leave him a few to play with. Of course it was hard fought for him, but it would make him feel accomplished later so you let him have his glory for what it was worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was easy\u2026\u201d Commented Arthur as he took down the last of his enemies. The leader and all of his men were now dead. You half thought that there would be some king of last battle between their leader and either you or Arthur. But the Leader was stupid enough to gawk at Sarah then try to attack her\u2026 he didn\u2019t last long after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill fun though.\u201d Kara interjected as she joined you and Sarah with the rest of the Village gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a strange girl, you know that right?\u201d Said the same slightly rude boy from before. He was one of those that hated princes and any high form of government, mainly because of them leaving villages like his to fend for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get that a lot!\u201d She said cheerily. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you three were technically mercenaries. So you could, in theory, do whatever you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific, we know a lot of things.\u201d Sarah answered as she dusted a weapon\u2019s rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lack of food and water\u2026\u201d Merlin filled in for Arthur. As always, Arthur rarely went anywhere without his trusty servant by his side, wither he wanted him there or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the curse that you triggered. Yes, that is a right pain in the backside. Do you have any idea how far we have to go for water?\u201d Kara replied in uncovered annoyance. But he didn\u2019t really know the half of it. Normally, it didn\u2019t matter, but Kara in particular had to drink a lot of water. Her transformation was not like yours. While a Dragon could survive without food for sometimes years at a time, water was something that they needed more often. And as staying in human form was a toll on her in the form of effort and suppressing dragon lungs, she needed a generous amount of water in storage inside herself or drinking it. While she could last about a year without food, she could only last a month tops without water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you get water?\u201d Arthur asked, wondering if there was some secret place that Camelot could utilize for the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrooks and streams just outside the kingdom. We have to tow it back here in the big reservoirs that we usually fill for making weapons.\u201d You answered, pointing through the wall to where they knew them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou carry them there and back, by yourselves?\u201d Arthur asked, looking at the two girls for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSire, can I speak bluntly?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa, I get the point!\u201d He quickly said, knowing that question usually came with a blunt way of putting him in his place. He lingered for a moment then looked at you with a change back to the original topic and a question. \u201cDo you know who and what is causing it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You were stupid enough to kill a Unicorn.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you too\u2026\u201d Arthur moaned, glancing at Merlin, then back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think that after killing an ancient, mystical, pure, magical, and protected creature like a unicorn that you can just mount the trophy on your wall and not pay a price?\u201d You asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be it\u2026\u201d Arthur stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you think it is some disease that seems to follow you were you go. Didn\u2019t know you went out with plagues\u2026\u201d Kara teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t do any such thing!\u201d He defended then caught on that she was just messing with him, \u201c\u2026 oh ha, ha, very funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw Merlin smile humorously for a moment then hide it at Arthur\u2019s glance, but it was enough to make Kara smile and you thought you saw a measure of pride as she had made Merlin smile. It was still unclear if she had feelings for him. You didn\u2019t want to invade her mind just to find out something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you know what is doing this then?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have little doubt it is the curse you released when you killed the Unicorn.\u201d You stated with confidence, then changed to a questioning look. \u201cWhat made you do something as foolish as to kill one???\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know any better?\u201d Arthur blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 There are many things that we have hunted over the years. Things that you can\u2019t imagine\u2026 yet. But none of us would ever be caught dead killing a Unicorn. We\u2019d rather fight a Dragon.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do I fix this?\u201d Arthur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to prove to whatever governing body protects them, that you are of a pure heart. Either that or die. Either way, the curse is specific to the one that killed it. So, you must prove yourare worthy of clemency by their standards. Until then, I would recommend NOT killing any more unicorns.\u201d Sarah revealed. He seemed ready to argue but she raised an eyebrow, as if to ask what he wanted. He stopped right before voicing his difference in opinion. He knew better at this point to go against Sarah in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is nothing you three can do?\u201d Merlin asked for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is something Arthur must do, since it was his had that killed the Unicorn.\u201d You repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, we will see you later then.\u201d Arthur said, not so happy that you couldn\u2019t just slice the curse in half, if that was even possible. Merlin bowed a thank you then hurried off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiots, the both of them.\u201d Sarah said as she went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerlin isn\u2019t that bad\u2026!\u201d Kara defended before she could stop herself, then blushed red and hurried off to go do some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just see that?\u201d You asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she looks like she is falling for that Merlin boy.\u201d Sarah confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. But is it love, or whatever is driving us to obey him???\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard to tell, maybe a bit of both.\" Sarah said as you both thought on it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cKara, hide now.\u201d You said as soon as you got through. The area around you was like a street corner in between a few buildings. You knew what they were from your time in Kisara\u2019s realm but Kara was at a loss for all the sounds and smells that bombarded her. She went to jump but you just waved with a motion that indicated to hide low and quietly. She laid down and put on her cloaking ability. It wasn\u2019t a cloak exactly, more of an illusion where her kind\u2019s scales reflect and refract light around them to make her more see through but it was not by any means flawless. It was best in the air when it combined with her movements to make her even harder to see. As for now you hid in the shadows while she did something similar with that ability just as a few humans looked down the alley where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I let Sarah out?\u201d Kara asked after she sensed the humans were far enough away to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but quietly.\u201d You answered. She did well as her otherwise noisy hacking was silenced and the only sound was the fleshy walls of her throat moving around Sarah as she moved up her neck and plopped out onto the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara\u2026 not so much drool the next time. I\u2019m completely soaked.\u201d Sarah said as she dripped with dragon drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time? No offense Sarah but I hope I don\u2019t have to do that again.\u201d Kara said back after catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, did I taste bad or something?\u201d Sarah asked as she rid herself of the majority of the drool and you helped by magically doing so along with drying and scenting her so she didn\u2019t smell like dragon breath and insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you tasted really good actually and wouldn\u2019t mind another taste. But while going down was enjoyable, the coming back up was\u2026 not that much.\u201d Kara said as she tried to tip toe around the taste of humans and her specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok. I get it. Max, where are we?\u201d Sarah asked as she looked up at the buildings around them. Some were very tall while others as tall as Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it looks like an advanced city. That means that we can\u2019t fly without them shooting us down or making a spectacle of yourselves. We need to move carefully to\u2026\u201d you started but was interrupted by more voices coming towards you and the others. You all hid as they came and as there was nothing but a dead end where you were you hoped they were just lost and went away, soon. But the closer they got the more nervous you became. For starters they didn\u2019t smell like humans not matter their appearance as they rounded the corner and stopped to look into the alley as if searching for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, are you sure this is the right spot?\u201d asked one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, can\u2019t you smell them? They\u2019re here alright but obviously good at hiding.\u201d The other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. We know you are here. We don\u2019t mean any harm, we just came to escort you to more\u2026 accommodating areas for our kind.\u201d He said and you thought on it for a few seconds. \u2018our kind\u2019 was he a predator, it didn\u2019t seem likely that he was a half-breed like you and neither of them were human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018our kind\u2019?\u201d you asked in a tone that couldn\u2019t be pinpointed in the darkness of the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell our security system alerts us when new arrivals come to our world or realm or whatever you think this is. Anyway we are monsters like you, or most of you. We can smell a human there as well, two humans actually.\u201d One of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonsters? I sure hope you are referring to a distinction and not a description or we might take offense to such talk.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. I apologize. Rather than address each type of being by their kind and getting it wrong most of the time we just address most by the default \u2018monster\u2019 title. It makes it easier and less offensive when humans refer to us as such. It keeps tempers down as well from not getting breeds and variants right.\u201d Said the \u2018monster\u2019 as he waved his hands at the accusation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, where can you take us so we can move more freely?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell new monsters under a certain age usually go to the monster school to receive training and teachings with the rest. And of course you\u2019re human friends are\u2026welcome but their safety can\u2019t be assured as much as a monster\u2019s would. You see monsters usually eat humans so going to an all monster school as a human is\u2026 problematic. However, since you are all new to this new world, to you at least, it would be best to learn how to survive it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, one of us is rather large. How do we get there?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that won\u2019t be a problem. We have emergency teleportation devices for such cases. How big are we talking about?\u201d he asked. At this you stepped out and he eyed you. Then you waved the others to which Sarah came by your side then Kara stood to tower over the two of you. \u201cWhat! A dragon? Holy crap I thought your kind was extinct!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually she is the full dragon, as you can see. I am a half-breed dragon and this is my\u2026 I guess you could say she is our rider, friend, and family all in one.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026 we have more than a few questions but we need to get somewhere other than the back alley of the human world. Now I just have to touch you three and I can bring you to the Monster school administration area. Where we can get you all checked in.\u201d he said as he walked forward but back peddled as Kara growled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lay one finger on Sarah and I\u2019ll gut you.\u201d Kara said in a continuous growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, hold on. I wasn\u2019t going to harm her. I just need to be in contact with everyone one so I can teleport you there with me. Look I\u2019ll let you each touch me as you see fit. I won\u2019t even move.\u201d he defended with his hands up in a passive stance. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The one you were holding onto looked intrigued at this but did something that resembled a few hand signs then teleported. The scenery changed to a wide open field in the center of a building, like a stadium and just as big. However there was desks in the middle as other \u2018monsters\u2019 we teleporting in then walking and flying out. None were anywhere near Kara\u2019s size so a lot of them stopped to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are they all staring at me?\u201d she asked as she was slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters you are the only dragon they\u2019ve seen. They became extinct some\u2026 thousand or so years ago and even then they were very scarce and not as large.\u201d He said as he turned into a large green ogre. \u201cAh, much better. Human form can be so\u2026 restraining.\u201d You said as he stretched his arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to transform into my dragon form as well?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in order to enter the school we need a record of who and what you are. Just so that the faculty and facilities are notified and appropriately stocked to house you.\u201d said an attractive woman that walked forward from a desk in front of the spot you and the others were facing. \u201cGuard, you may leave now.\u201d She said with a wave to which he bowed then walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, here goes nothing.\u201d You said as you grew wings and took off into the sky. When you got far enough away you exploded into your dragon form and soared for a minute above. Kara seemed to read your mind as she made a little extra room for you to land to which you did. The grass was somewhat soft so when you landed your claws sunk in a little to your steps. You then laid down but kept your head looking around at the silent group of \u2018monsters\u2019 that surrounded you. \u201cOk, all done.\u201d You said to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dragon as well? I\u2026 umm\u2026 My name is Vickie and I am\u2026 will be checking you in to Monster Academy.\u201d She stuttered as she looked down at her papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, come down here. You\u2019re scaring them half to death.\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d You said then lowered your head to lay on the ground and Sarah sat on a chair that she pulled next to it, Kara took the other side and both received her light petting like you both used to in the castle all that time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe field got back to its normal functions, although you and Kara were constantly watched and gawked at. Vickie had begun asking spermatic questions and finally went to get the conversion representative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening, it is a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d Said a naga woman that was about twice Sarah\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know. We were beginning to feel a little out of place.\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it isn\u2019t every day that two dragons come by. However I am here to assist in your disguise. From what I\u2019m told, one of you needs a human disguise.\u201d She said back as she looked at both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we need one?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe school is open to all monsters. But having all those different individuals in one place and interacting can get hectic and unstable. So we have a rule against being in monster form while attending. Along with that another rule is that the students are not suppose to reveal what they are to each other. As you can imagine, a known vampire and a known werewolf would generate unnecessary problems and conflict. So which one of you needs the disguise?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean I can change back?\u201d you asked to which she just nodded. Sarah removed her caressing hand from your snout then you took to the sky again. Another explosion and you were flying in human form back down, afterwards retracting your dragon parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s you then?\u201d she asked Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She simply responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a seal of sorts used by many monsters that are larger than usual like me.\u201d She said as she pulled out a chained necklace with a symbol of a giant mouth with fangs on it. You couldn\u2019t tell what it was but it kind of looked like a made up predator from all kinds of monsters. Probably to prevent the biased remarks on its design. \u201cIt transforms you into a human form. However it has never been placed on someone so large before.\u201d She said and got a small growl from Kara that made her flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she meant it as a compliment.\u201d Sarah said and for the first time a monster in the area looked at Sarah with thanks and admiration as Kara calmed. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Sarah asked as she held her hand out. The naga was more than happy to hand it over to Sarah so she could fasten it around Kara\u2019s neck. As soon as the clasp was set the symbol started to glow and the mouth on it was shutting but it seemed to be having a hard time. You all waited to see if it would work and what the outcome would be. Kara closed her eyes against the bright light and when she opened them\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDamn, it actually worked.\u201d You said as you looked down at a stunned young woman. She was just as old as you and Sarah so she was about 17 years old and it showed. She blinked her eyes open and looked at her human parts with a mix of shock, amazement, and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor goodness sake Max, get her some clothes.\u201d Sarah said as you observed a few hungry looks at her lean figure. She had blue hair like her scales but looked to be almost silky smooth and well kept. Her face looked\u2026  well in a word cute with silver eyes but slitted like her normal dragon eyes. Her skin was white and more Asian looking but just in color with a little darker shade to it. Otherwise her form was best described as ample and fit. Not too large to ogle on one thing in particular but not small enough to suggest that she still had some growing to do. She was not used to the concept of clothes she didn\u2019t think to cover herself at Sarah\u2019s reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I got it.\u201d You said with a few hand signs and magic to make clothes that fit her appear on her to save time in explanation. \u201cI trust you will show her where everything goes and why she needs them, later. We dragons don\u2019t usually see the sense in clothes so\u2026\u201d you started but Sarah waved that she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell. How do you humans walk?\u201d Kara said as she tried to stand but fell over. The closest she got was on her hands and knees as if she was still in dragon form. You started laughing at her to which she just glared at you before responding. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just remember my first attempts at walking and looking at you now is kind of hilarious.\u201d You said as she tried again to stand and prove you wrong but only fell on her butt. \u201cHere, you just need to figure out how your legs work. You can lean on me until you get the hang of it. After all, you don\u2019t have a retractable tail to help balance. Besides, now you know why humans are so easy to catch, well except Sarah of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice save.\u201d Sarah said as you propped Kara on your shoulder but made sure she was attempting to walk on her own. It didn\u2019t take that must pushing for her to try walking, again to not be inferior in any way. Although she did crack a smile at the human remark and you were convinced that it was the only thing that saved you from a whack over the head from Sarah for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed it was. Now there is one more\u2026 concern you should be aware of before we permit you three to attend the academy.\u201d The Naga stated to which you all looked up at her. \u201cYou see there has never been a human attend before, well not for more than a couple days. You see, while humans outside are rare treats to most of us, one\u2019s that can be eaten without the public knowing of course. But here where Monsters are the majority you will find that humans are more in danger because we monsters don\u2019t have to deal with running and hiding from the other humans. And while the students aren\u2019t permitted to show or go to monster form this school is like any other as far as rule breaking. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just for the sake of argument, if someone tried to eat one of the other students what are our options?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you could just sit there and take it. Or you can fight them. Monsters tend to be more aggressive than humans so we do have a small amount of fatalities every year. However if your monster form is revealed it is seen as a major offense. So you can fight back but never in your full monster form.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. These are you schedules and books will be provided by desk computers. You are all in the same classes as a favor to you three for your human being a rider and family. The bus to the academy will be leaving soon so you need to hurry.\u201d She continued after a long silence as if to give you all a chance to change your minds. You couldn\u2019t tell if she hoped that you did or didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Max? What are we going to do about clothes and other\u2026 necessities?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou know we girls have a few more things to take care of than guys do, especially our new arrival here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that hard.\u201d Kara defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let me put it to you this way. With all I know about humans and dragons I will never understand how and why women of either species do the things they do. I don\u2019t think I am suppose to but in any case, from what I\u2019m told, there is a lot more work than what guys are allowed to see.\u201d You stated. \u201cAnd as far as that is concerned, I can still do magic so I can materialize what you need and, as soon as you get me some of their money, I can materialize that as well for the more\u2026 sensitive products.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 forgot you could do that\u201d She said, looking down as she thought and while you helped Kara along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! This is going to be a pain. I can\u2019t walk, run, fly, fight, or even breathe fire like this. What CAN humans do?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans can do all of those things.\u201d Sarah stated as she demonstrated a fire jutsu small enough to not cause any major attention but big enough to make her point. \u201cIf you get good enough, I\u2019m sure we can train you to be a Dragon ninja like the rest of the family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I want to do that? Besides being more powerful as a human. I mean if worst comes to worst I can just go back to dragon form.\u201d She said as she was starting to get the hang of leg movements but not enough to walk in any decent amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember how I was able to make over 500 of myself before?\u201d you asked to which she nodded. \u201cWell for starters you can do jutsu like that in both forms, if you learn how in human form. You can also create justu to bring out your dragon parts like I do. So being trained in both is extremely useful.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t there any more students on the bus?\u201d Sarah asked as she was hoping to get to see some of the other monsters before the rules took into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Well because this is the bus for new arrivals such as yourself.\u201d Said the bus driver. He was in human form but had an almost hermit aura around him and under his uniform. \u201cMost monsters that were born here already know where the Monster Academy is. So they just get there themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, the naga lady that processed us said that there wasn\u2019t any humans there. What happens if a human wonders in by accident?\u201d You asked, both testing if he knew about Sarah as well as the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy, they\u2019d be dead in no time. We monsters are usually hunted if exposed so any that come in by mistake are usually dealt with by the students. In fact, it is one of the only \u2018special occasions\u2019 where students are allowed to go into monster form. To keep the school safe and a secret they can eat, kill, torture, or otherwise get rid of any human that comes in the barrier surrounding the school.\u201d The driver answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to know.\u201d Sarah said with a shy and nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you passed through a long, dark, and curvy tunnel where the scents around you changed, then the bus stopped after exiting the tunnel and you three got off. Then without a word the driver turned around and headed back. During the trip you had helped Kara with some limbering exercises so she could gain better control over her new human form. Her arms worked and she could write with a pencil without breaking it but when she went to stand she just fell over again. So she was back to leaning on your shoulder for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a strange place. Looks like a cheap horror house.\u201d Sarah said as she looked around. There was a castle of sorts in the background but looked also to be an elaborate academy. A line of scarecrows lined the road with different fake bodies on them that spanned from human to naga and almost everything else. Long and gloomy forest was around with different specialty creatures inhabiting it. You noticed as you all went through it, the spiders were pretty much all extremely deadly as well as the snakes, tigers, wolves, and other things that probably protected the students as well as prevented them from changing to monster form out in the forest rather to get out of the school\u2019s rule. Although for you and Kara it seemed like excellent hunting grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell seeming as all the monsters are actually real in this place, I think that it would be for a human. Well accept you. I actually pity the monster that tries to get at you.\u201d you complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, you\u2019re scary enough from a dragon standpoint. Plus everyone I\u2019ve seen up to now look to be weaklings.\u201d Kara agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you two are right and I\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d She said as she shot a look at Kara that got her to flinch and you to chuckle a little, to which Kara just slugged you with her free arm then continued. You noticed that, despite being in human form, she still retained a good amount of her strength. Not enough to be superman but more than enough to take care of herself when you aren\u2019t around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello!\u201d said a woman at the entrance as she and a man beside her greeted the three of you. With your dragon eyes you could tell that the man was a wolf anthro and she was a neko, well under their human disguises. \u201cOh, my dear. Are you hurt?\u201d she asked as she looked at Kara leaning on you like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is her first time walking as a human. She\u2019s use to walking on all fours with her tail so she just needs a little help with her new\u2026 human parts I guess you could say.\u201d You said for her as she was too embarrassed. They seemed to immediately understand and smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we understand that all too well. Especially those of us who have tails to help balance us. But I\u2019m afraid this is where we split your group up. You see we need to get you two to your dorms and, as you can probably guess, the guys side is separate from the girls for a reason.\u201d The neko said as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Sarah you think you can\u2026?\u201d you asked as you gestured to Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come on limpy. I got to show you the human ways to deal with your body anyway.\u201d Sarah said as she took your place as her support. You got a little \u2018see ya later\u2019 look from Kara as you all waved and went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how does a guy like you get two girls like that?\u201d asked the man escorting you to your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they are kind of like my sisters. We all came from rather\u2026 abusive families that threw us out so we found each other and bonded to make our own family when we were younger. So I guess, it isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking but yeah they are pretty amazing girls.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSisters heh. So\u2026 do you mind if I hit on them?\u201d he asked rather boldly as you both walked down corridors and halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe my guest. Although the last guy that Sarah rejected ended up in a hospital and in Kara\u2019s case ended up in her stomach so\u2026 I\u2019d be careful if I were you. They are two ladies, despite being family, that I wouldn\u2019t want to piss off.\u201d You answered that got the guy to gulp hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they anyway?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not suppose to say what we are, remember? I just got into this school so I\u2019m not really looking to get kicked out right away.\u201d You responded with a comical finger wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright. This is your room.\u201d he presented as you both stood in front of\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh\u2026 great, I think. Look I don\u2019t mean to be rude but are all the rooms this small?\u201d you asked. You had been led into a room that only had a bed and a desk with barely any room from that to the door. There wasn\u2019t even a bathroom or closet to put anything that a student might\u2019ve brought with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty much. You see, this is the only monster school in the world so it tends to be packed and overcrowded. But because of each monster being unique they need separate rooms so we/they don\u2019t eat or kill each other in their sleep. So... the rooms tend to be rather small and the community bath is severely overused. I hear the girl\u2019s side has slightly bigger rooms but we aren\u2019t allowed over there so we wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK\u2026 So when does classes start?\u201d you asked as you went to your new desk and sat in the chair while the man walked in to get out of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually they started a week ago so you and your sisters are going to have to play catch up. In a sense you three will be the talk of the school since they have never seen a monster from another world before.\u201d He answered then after explaining where everything was on a mini map he had with him he then left you to think for the rest of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t any formal curfew because of the night time monsters that were more active during that time, regardless if the classes were all held during the day. The barrier around the school allowed for things like vampires and other elemental dominated species to attend without worry. Not to mention that everyone was usually in their human form but you noticed, as you walked around exploring, that random students \u2018accidentally\u2019 changed to monster form and it wasn\u2019t a huge deal. Even some of the teachers did it during class. Maybe it was similar to a \u2018no running in the halls\u2019 rule from human schools. I mean it is important but hardly enforced unless it becomes a problem or obviously intentional. You found a nice spot on a bench overlooking the very large lake near one of the school ground\u2019s exits. The combination of the barrier, the clear water, and the moon was making the water shine and glisten beautifully. I was like a shimmering mirror in which you could see a glorified reflection of the sky between the ripples from students taking a swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know anyone was here.\u201d Said a voice from a girl that had literally plopped right out of the sky and onto the bench you were sitting on. You took a moment to look her over as you did with the others in the school, mainly to check what kind of monster they were as well as their danger level to Kara and Sarah. This one had pink hair down to the small of her back with a thin yet wavy look that caught the breeze but was heavy enough not to fly everywhere. Her eyes were a radiant green that complimented her\u2026 innocent yet cute face. Her complexion was a little pale but not enough to seam weird. More like she had rarely been in the sun at all. The rest of her body was athletic but not slim like Kara\u2019s new form. She wasn\u2019t fat or pudgy, just\u2026 thicker in muscle mass while still looking dainty. Her pink hair brought out a blush as she waited for you to respond. Although you had to be careful as her scent betrayed a\u2026 dead scent but one with a tint of decaying blood, but not so much as to be unpleasant, unless you took it in too deeply The only monster that came to the description was a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, I was just taking in the view. My name is Max, my sisters and I have just transferred here today so I was just exploring while I had the time.\u201d You answered back with a light smile before looking back over the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you must be those new transfer students that everyone is talking about from another world. I never thought I would meet you before everyone else like this. Oh\u2026 my name is Mia and welcome to Monster Academy.\u201d She greeted but when she just saw you staring over the lake she joined you. \u201cSo you like the night as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, kind of. I guess I like it just as much as the day time. What I like about this spot is it seems so tranquil. Everything is so alive from this view, nothing out of place.\u201d You answered then took a longing look up. You hadn\u2019t really been able to fly that much. Sure when you first arrived but not for the pleasure of flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean. I come here after a long day at school for the same reason. No one is gawking at me or trying to take me somewhere. Instead I am the one caught gawking.\u201d She said as she dazed off  into the scenery with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you! get away from her!\u201d came a voice that broke you pleasant thoughts, followed by an impact that sent you off the bench and through a tree before hitting another and crumpling down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott! What did you do that for?\u201d Mia asked as she looked at you with a combination of guilt and pity but strangely no shock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He said it in a way that made it seem like he was deeply concerned about her. So much so that you did know if it was an act or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d she started but he just guided her along and out of the area while doing the equivalent of pouring honey into her ear, metaphorically speaking. She only took a concerned look back at the fallen tree that had fell right on top of you. It didn\u2019t hurt by any means but it did give you a clear example of how tempers and personalities of the students could vary to extremes and what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out of sight you picked up the tree and, with a little wood style jutsu, repaired both the small tree you were sent through and the one the cushioned your ride. But you thought it to dangerous or at the very least problematic to sit on that bench again so you leapt onto tall tree so you could look over from its top as you got comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max.\u201d called Sarah\u2019s voice from the tree next to you. \u201cWow its beautiful up here.\u201d She said as she and the leaning Kara she was holding looked where you were looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is why you don\u2019t just keep your dragon eyes active all the time.\u201d Kara said as she looked over the scene with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, dragon eyes are so powerful that they are at a loss when you just want to sit and relax like this. They would just target all the things you would want to see, except the unhindered or explained view. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to know why the lake reflects the night sky or why it is just gorgeous to look at.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your room small like ours are?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe smaller. All I got is a bed and a desk then the door not 3 feet from that. I guess I won\u2019t be spending a lot of time inside of it. Especially with nights like this. I would feel more comfortable though if I could sleep in dragon form out here.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? They said we couldn\u2019t reveal our form or change while IN school but while this is part of the barrier world it is OUT of school.\u201d Kara asked with a confused look. She had obviously made plans to do so later instead of sleeping in a human bed in such a small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it. We are the only dragons on this world. Not to mention bigger than anyone else that we\u2019ve seen. If we do that, than it will be like broadcasting our status to the world. It would rule the rest of our time here. Everyone would be either too scared to come near us or want to use our power for themselves. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t already seen that kind of action in small doses around campus.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess you\u2019re right. But you can with only half transforming and such. Then I should concentrate on learning how to support myself and learn how to be a Dragon Ninja, like the two of you.\u201d Kara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, how are with walking? Did you both get around with\u2026 explaining all her new\u2026 parts?\u201d You asked as you clumsily dodge the subject of open female anatomy. Even as a dragon it was still a social no fly zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks to a little skirmish with a cheerleader, she learned how to walk, run, and stuff like that rather quickly. And yes I taught her most of the other stuff about being a woman. However we need your help.\u201d She answered but the final little bit got you to look at her as if to ask \u2018how can I possibly help with girl problems?\u2019. \u201cWell you see\u2026 all we have is my ninja gear and the clothes you gave her. So\u2026 we need some money to buy a new set of things that are too... complicated to explain. Otherwise we would ask for you to just materialize it.\u201d With that you all jumped down to the ground to address the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell did you acquire some samples?\u201d you asked to which she pulled out a gold coin, a few paper bills, and other assorted coins. Kara demonstrated how she was able dot walk around easily while Sarah explained their individual worth. Apparently the gold coin was the only one that was exclusively for monster like purchases and far more valuable than the others. \u201cOk then, try to conserve. If word gets around that I can materialize money\u2026\u201d you started but was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We are good at keeping secrets.\u201d Kara said with a wink. You just laughed then tossed them each a bag that neither had seen you materialize. They opened to find at least 100 of the gold coins in each, the bags with a magic on them that allowed them to be small yet carry a lot more than a few trucks worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 you didn\u2019t have to give us so much.\u201d Sarah said as they both gazed inside the bags. Kara hadn\u2019t been human for long but she was well aware of gold\u2019s value, and now that she needed it to obtain things she wanted in her current situation she shared in her amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t have my sisters cutting corners when they don\u2019t need to. Go ahead and be sure to get what you need without worry. Just don\u2019t act like one of those idiotic and flashy nobles like we all love from home. No reason to flash your wealth like those peacocks.\u201d You said back and they immediately agreed. Another thing you all had in commons was your displeasure with those kind of people. Mainly because the expected Kara to give them rides and Sarah to do\u2026 other things with them. Those reasons, plus many more, granted them a unique humility in such situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you\u2019re the best!\u201d Kara said then gave you a hug with Sarah. Afterwards you all headed back to the campus and split soon after revealing what you all learned so far. They almost blew up when they heard what Scott had done but you waved them down so not to make a scene.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am sure you\u2019ve been anxiously waiting the students from the other world and we get all three of them, since they are family.\u201d Said the feline, almost neko looking, teacher. She wasn\u2019t in her monster form but with your eyes you could tell what she was. Her human form was kind of typical for a young teacher like her. Although it appeared that she just LOOKED young. Her scent betrayed that despite her 20 something look she was closer to 40. Her light brown hair swished as she looked over to the door and beckoned you three in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turned to face the class to which you observed an assortment of wonder and curiosity from all but two. They happen to be your two acquaintances from the night before. Scott was looking at you as if he thought you were nothing special then started drooling at Kara and Sarah with the rest of the guys. Mia looked at you mostly after looking the other two over. She seemed surprised as she didn\u2019t see any bruise of wound from where her \u2018boyfriend\u2019 had hit you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Miss. Burg. Why do they smell like humans?\u201d asked Scott in a slightly confronting tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they must be really good at their human forms.\u201d She answered before assigning you and your sisters the three seats in the back corner. You were in the corner, while Kara was to your right and Sarah in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe. You smell delicious.\u201d Scott said as he turned around to Kara. Mia was just to the right of him and looked over as if she couldn\u2019t stand his behavior. You couldn\u2019t blame her. He was hitting on Kara while still claiming her. You didn\u2019t really have a good chance to see what he was before, but now you saw that he was an Orc and a large one. He stretched out his tongue as if showing off but you almost cringe at his smell and couldn\u2019t imagine his breath was any better for Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh chew!\u201d Kara sneezed with a fire ball hitting his head and throwing him sideways into the wall. They whole class looked at her as she covered her face daintily. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m allergic to jerks.\u201d She said with a sniffle to further cover her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott, will you need to go to the nurse\u2019s office?\u201d asked Miss. Burns while most of the class was stifling some snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll be ok.\u201d He said then went back to his seat, the way that avoided making eye contact with your glaring sisters, both with their dragon eyes showing. This also got the others to snap their heads back to the teacher for the rest of the class. This immediately gained her support for you three. Although you saw several times during the course of the class, a certain vampire\u2019s eyes drift to you then back to the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class was pretty much like that through every subject. Every once in a while a student would get out of line but then another sneeze would come on or an \u2018accidental\u2019 kunai would fly that got them to pay acute attention. The only thing you did was put a slight snarl in the air when Scott looked back to you then flashed your eyes at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax wait up.\u201d Interrupted Mia as she ran up to your small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, you need to practice chakra anyway.\u201d You told Kara as they looked at her then you. Sarah gave you a teasing wink but you just sighed at it. Although it was true, Sarah developed a training schedule for Kara to learn about chakra and jutsu. That along with strict training sessions to improve combat as well. To them walking away you turned to her as she approached. \u201cMia, good to see you again. Although if Scott tries to pummel me again I might not just shrug it off this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I hope he doesn\u2019t. He was kind of forcing me into a relationship with him. He might get jealous but other than that I don\u2019t really care what he thinks. Your sister was right, he is a jerk and I\u2019m glad he got torched.\u201d She returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is he forcing you? I thought that V\u2026 ah\u2026 your kind were among the top in this world in terms of strength and overall prowess.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I am? How?\u201d she asked in a shocked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell for starters your fangs grow when you\u2019re around someone with a strong human scent for too long, like my sisters and I. The second is that I can tell what each student is just by looking at them and taking in their scent. I get a little confused if I haven\u2019t encountered the type before but in general you all might as well being wearing name tags. So now that I answered your question now answer mine.\u201d You answered but then asked her yours again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father made my seal especially for me. I can\u2019t take it off myself.\u201d She said as she touched a chained cross hanging from her neck, similar to where Kara\u2019s now hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t transform and he can so he just\u2026 what? Forces you to put up with him and that horrid smell?\u201d You asked to which she just looks down then nods. She obviously didn\u2019t like it at all and the fact that she was a vampire was just an added factor. Besides Sarah and Kara, she was easily one of the top 20 hot girls for those who paid attention to that kind of thing. You had never really cared that much as a dragon that could eat her much sooner than consider her visually attractive. It appeared Kara had the same mentality about the guys around her. She had already knocked a few out that made the mistake of touching her without permission and although she was coming along way in such a short amount of time, she still had the habit of snarling when angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe, get back here!\u201d said the boy as he ran toward you and Mia.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since she was a vampire you were tempted to let her handle it but your pride was getting in the way as well as the sudden urge to implant a kunai in his chest. It only got more of an urge when Scott looked at you and thrust his arm forward as if to back hand you without a second thought. However, unlike the previous night, you weren\u2019t distracted and he was anything but subtle. So you easily caught his arm before it found its mark but when he tried to pull back to either retreat or to try again you didn\u2019t let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was just going to just let her handle this. That was until you tried to push your weight around and thought I would just let you do it. You must think you\u2019re something special.\u201d You said as you squeezed his arm, causing some bruising and obvious discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, get off!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful what you wish for.\u201d You said as he tried to pull you let go and he sent himself flying into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lowly human!\u201d he said, which got more attention than the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if I\u2019m a human than you just got schooled by one. It would actually be a compliment for me.\u201d You retorted that got everyone that chimed in at the mention of a human to agree with you. Normal humans wouldn\u2019t be able to fight a monster and survive, much less win by such a large margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, who\u2019s this?\u201d asked Sarah as she and Kara were walking back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop mocking me!\u201d Scott said. He obviously didn\u2019t like that you weren\u2019t taking him seriously or that none of those present was afraid of him. With that his body started to shake and turned into a 20 foot Orc, drooling everywhere. You looked around to see that you were just outside the school so he the most trouble he would get is for revealing his monster identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, didn\u2019t think he could smell any worse.\u201d You said with a smile that spread to Sarah and Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this is funny?!\u201d roared Scott then stretched his thick and slimy tongue out and grabbed Kara by the ankle. Pulling it back he lifted her up into the air in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww, you smell disgusting.\u201d She said as she felt the drool from the tongue travel down her leg and drip onto her in various spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, aren\u2019t you going to help her?\u201d Mia asked as she saw neither you nor Sarah was moving to do so. In fact you were both smiling  a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the one in trouble. You see, Kara hasn\u2019t really had a successful time controlling herself and gets a little carried away. And she has a temper.\u201d You explained. Mia listened then looked at a flustered Kara just as she let out a good amount of flame breath. It was slightly comical to see it in her human form but it still did the job of roasting Scott\u2019s face and tongue enough to drop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou slimy\u2026 disgusting\u2026 perverted\u2026 sorry excuse for a monster\u2026 get\u2026 out\u2026 of\u2026 my\u2026 sight!\u201d Kara said between blows that sent Scott into walls and trees. Each hit broke at least a few bones and made the observers cringe until her last word in which she kicked him and he flew about 100 feet and landed unconscious on the ground by the entrance. \u201cWhat!?\u201d she growled at the stunned crowd, making them start clapping making her, to their relief, calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now we have to get you a bath before training. There is no way I am going to train you smelled like that.\u201d Sarah said and another round of comical bickering started as they both waved then left to the direction they were going as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister is\u2026 strong.\u201d Mia stated but she was obviously just as scared as everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little rough around the edges right now. Her first time in human form so she gets a little moody. The real scary one is Sarah.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I walk with you?\u201d she asked as you started walking toward the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the road is open.\u201d You answered. She hurried to your side and you both walked away from the growing crowd around the defeated and unconscious orc. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had only been a week but Mia had hung around you and them all the time. Maybe it was because you were one of the few people that didn\u2019t look at her by gawking at her and you didn\u2019t care that she was a Vampire. Either way you all were now in the small group that protected each other and with Kara quickly learning jutsu and other ninja related tasks Mia was the only one that needed it, sometimes. As a vampire, even a sealed one, she was capable of many things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I how can you eat normal food?\u201d Sarah asked as she finished the sandwich she was eating and the others were completing their meals as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only really NEED blood about once a month. Like a transfusion since my normal blood isn\u2019t really normal. I need blood that does what its suppose to do and for that I drink fresh blood from the living. But normal food satisfies my hunger and boosts energy just like anyone else.\u201d Mia explained and glanced over to see that you, again, didn\u2019t care she drank people\u2019s blood. In fact none of you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no offense, but I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do it. I mean just stopping at blood seams wasteful to me. But I guess we all have our ways.\u201d Kara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not fair that I don\u2019t even know what you all are and you know about me.\u201d Mia stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not our fault that the school has that rule.\u201d Kara said in a pouty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we can just go into the forest and no one will know, and it is outside school\u201d she defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know so badly? I mean it isn\u2019t like it will change who we are or anything.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything that complicated, I just was curious. You three are so strong but no one knows what you are. Well except the teachers, they treat you like royalty or something.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they just like us\u2026\u201d Sarah teased to which laughed and Mia stuck her tongue out at her. While your home room teacher like the group for keeping the class attentive, most of the other teachers had tried to assert control over one of you at one point or another and didn\u2019t get a very good response for their attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t trust you or anything. It\u2019s just a pain to change back to our monster forms. On top of that we would be more inclined to act more primal in that state. Coupled with our desire to keep it a secret we would probably kill or eat anyone who \u2018accidentally\u2019 saw. So I guess we could tell you we get the time but defiantly not show you. Does that make any sense?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. I still would like to see them eventually but I can wait. Maybe over summer break we can go to where you live and I can see it.\u201d She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 about that.\u201d Sarah said which snapped Mia back to the three of you in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, we are from another world and for complicated reasons we can\u2019t go back. Which means we have no home in this world. Hopefully we find one but if not we\u2019ll be pretty stuck\u201d Kara explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you can stay with me.\u201d She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, no offense but our personalities and that of normal vampires would probably clash. We think we are the top of the food chain. And I hear that is a sentiment that your kind also believes. So\u2026 it might be a little awkward for us to say otherwise and expect to still be housed. Not to mention each predator should have their own territory.\u201d You input, but Sarah seemed to be getting uncomfortable with monster talk as she was the only human there, and no one besides you and Kara knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen can I help you at least find a place?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. You know more about this world than we do. Thanks Mia, you\u2019re the best.\u201d Kara said as she gave her a comical hug. Kara had just figured out how good more subtle bodily contact could feel. As a dragon the pressure points and sensual contact was done differently so she was just learning why and how her body worked in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok. Come on will you stop that. You know how good you all smell.\u201d She said as she pushed Kara off her in a more playful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said you wouldn\u2019t drink our blood.\u201d Sarah stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, but you three just smell so good it is hard to resist.\u201d She teased and for some reason, unknown to her, Sarah was the only one to react to such teasing. It made her wonder what monster you three were and if she was actually scared of her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But now what the moment had come she was getting very anxious for what you and the others were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I guess I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Sarah said to which Mia looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! You can\u2019t be a human. Humans can\u2019t throw orcs around like bouncy balls and shoot fire, not to mention your eyes that show every once in a while.\u201d Mia stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s because I am a dragon ninja. Max gave me dragon eyes and I was trained as a ninja so\u2026 I know how to do really cool stuff the trumps most monsters but I am still just a human.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that make you two human as well?\u201d Mia asked as she looked at you and Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 well kind of. We decided that you should, despite our bias against it, see our monster forms. So now that you know Sarah is human we can show you what we are. Remember that I said we were adopted family and since Kara finished basic ninja training we are all dragon ninja. Kara, if you please.\u201d You answered then she jumped to her right and touched the seal on the necklace. There was a bright light then Kara was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! You\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026 a\u2026 dragon?\u201d Mia asked as she fell over, looking up at Kara who flexed her wings and looked down, almost blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Was all she could say. Mia shuffled back until she hit a tree then stood and braced against it. \u201cMax, I don\u2019t think you should transform. If she\u2019s that scared of me then she\u2019s going to freak when she sees you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, he a dragon to?\u201d Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell more accurately I am what\u2019s known as a half-breed. But unlike the ones over in this world I\u2019m not some kind of anthro. Although I can grow parts like this.\u201d you said as you grew some of you dragon parts to make your point then retracted them. \u201cIn my world, the half- breed can go from all human to all dragon. So in a sense I am 100% human, but being a half-breed allows me to keep all my powers as a 100% dragon in human form and likewise in dragon form. So I do have a very large and apparently very frightening dragon form I can turn to, but I won\u2019t do it if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to see it.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, here it goes.\u201d You said then exploded into your dragon form. The trees and earth that blew away impeded her vision for s short time but you were hard to miss as you laid down and ducked your head so others didn\u2019t see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re huge!\u201d she said as she looked over you. You didn\u2019t flex your wings but then again you didn\u2019t have to and doing so would only broadcast your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re ok with this?\u201d You asked as you looked directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could she not. You two are the most awesome friends and family someone could ask for.\u201d Sarah said as she jumped on your snout then hugged it. \u201cI mean dragons are so cool and I\u2019m a sister to two of um. And in this world your two are only known my myth and legend.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Mia, what do you think? Can you be friends with a human and two dragons?\u201d Kara asked as you three looked at the very shocked and impressed vampire. It wasn\u2019t every day that a dragon asks to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 think\u2026 I\u2026 can\u2026 handle that\u2026\u201d she said between breaths then passed out. In a split second after that you and Kara were back into human form just as some students came by and ran as soon as they saw all your eyes, still having them out from the transformation and explanation. You three had become well known in the school and as such was certain tells and one of those were each of the group\u2019s eye chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes fluttered open, looking around the familiar setting of the room. At one point or another, every person in the school visits the nurse\u2019s office so her heart was beating at a normal pace. That is until she saw you sitting next to her. Her heartbeat jumped and you could hear it race but to her credit she didn\u2019t show her temporary fright then suppressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Mia, you get a good rest?\u201d you asked with a light smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 what happened?\u201d she asked with a confused face, remembering what happened prior to her fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fainted and we didn\u2019t think it would be considerate of us to let you sleep it off in the woods. So I brought you here while the others went back to their rooms. I stuck around to make sure you were ok and to answer any other questions you might have.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all that\u2026 it really happened. So that\u2019s why you three are so strong?\u201d she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a nut shell. Sarah is still\u2026\u201d you said before remembering that a few others were in the room. \u201c\u2026well she\u2019s slightly different than Kara or I but we are still family. She is actually strong enough to beat Kara in a fair fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you all be family when your all so\u2026 different?\u201d she asked. Your face almost immediately got remorseful and sad with a touch of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 all three of us were abandoned by our parents in different fashions that demonstrated more hate than love. We found each other and bonded almost instantly through that. Eventually we were the only ones to trust in each other like a family should so we just made it official. While not related by blood or species we are no less family than any other out there. We each have our own story and demons in our pasts but love each other regardless.\u201d You responded as if you were looking into your own memories before snapping back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your story?\u201d she asked out of pure curiosity before she could stop herself. Before she could make it right you separated yourself from her. Until that point you had your hand on her\u2019s to sooth her emotions and provide stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re feeling better.\u201d You ended with as you exited the room. While you felt comfortable sharing what you are with her, you didn\u2019t even like thinking about what was in your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Most people got out of your way when you were walking. They knew that you wouldn\u2019t beat the crap out of them for no reason so they made sure there wasn\u2019t one. Besides, out of you and your sisters, you were the nice one by far and much more understanding. You made it to your room without really remembering how you got there then fell into bed after closing the door. Tear streamed down your face for reasons you didn\u2019t know or were aware of at the time. Maybe it was the sudden overlook of your past and what had happened since then. You fell asleep emotionally confused and dampening your sheets with tears.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia was a little more careful around you when asking questions. Not for fear of you as a dragon, but because she obviously brought up a sore topic when she asked about your past. Honestly, you didn't really know why you reacted like you did. You hadn't cried in so long that you hadn't stopped for a while. Sarah, Mia, and Kara stopped by and saw you in that state. Your bed was actually soaked with tears. They helped cheer you up but were as confused as you were. They had never seen you cry before. Maybe it was pent up feelings from years of unfortunate and bad things. Or maybe having to leave a really good place and reminding yourself of what all the other places were. Maybe everyone in your home was gone forever was another side. It could've been all or none of those. So you pushed it out of your mind for the time being and focused on school, friends, and family. It was such a day when the 4 of you walking around the school when some commotion interrupted your conversation with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe how he just took a swing at Max?\" Kara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and Max was just like, 'hey, did something just hit me or was that a mosquito?' The idiot was so freaked out he just ran off.\" Sarah laughed out as you all joined her in laughing. Not a lot of people were dumb enough to pick fights with your group. One at a time, sure, but not when all of you were there at the same time. But you all weren't bullies or anything. In fact, you were the people that deterred bullies, which made your group favorites with many of the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOUND YOU!!!\" Came a voice that was getting closer. You instinctually dodged a person coming from behind but caught the young lady in midair, holding her up so she was dangling in front of all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira...??? What are you doing here?\" Mia asked as she looked at her hanging from your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just hanging out. Can you tell your boyfriend to put me down?\" she asked in a playful and irritated tone. You couldn't figure out if she was irritated that her attack, or lack there of, was so easily avoided or that she had lost any and all momentum in whatever she was trying to do. Perhaps both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, you know her?\" You asked, looking over to her. She nodded her head in both an answer and a request for you to let her down. You did so slowly so she wasn't dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means I can't torch her?\" Kara whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't. She didn't know any better and she is my sister.\" Mia answered to which all of you looked her over than Mia, then back to Mira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I don't see the resemblance.\" Sarah remarked. She was right. Mia had long pink hair that flowed very well. She had a very long but attractive figure that was curvy when it needed but not so much to be considered by anyone to be too much. Mira had orange hair, freckles, short body type, and had a few pounds to lose. Her face wasn't even close to Mia's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know? Human...\" Mira blurted out, the last part obviously meaning in an insult. You and Kara froze at this and Mia sprung into action as she say Sarah's eyes narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I am human. You have a problem with that... little girl?\" Sarah asked, her temper rising. Sure people teased her from time to time. But not too many were stupid enough to insult her outright. Her glare alone was making Mira back down. She further glared as she bent down and glared daggers into Mira's eyes. Obviously not relying on her non human friends to help her. At this distance, a Vampire could decapitate a normal human in a flash and even you wouldn't be able to get there in time, despite being only a few feet away. But the only person in danger here was NOT Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no Ma'am...\" Mira stuttered out. Wither she knew why or not, this human was extremely scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good answer.\" Sarah commented as she backed off and bounded off. \"Let's go Kara, training time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, why do I have to get beat on because she called you a human?\" Kara whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW KARA!\" Sarah hollered back that got Kara to stepping and bounding after her. \"Max, you deal with Miss. Rude Bloodsucker. Next time being Mia's sister won't save her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it grumpy.\" You teased to which she and Kara both glared at you, for different reasons. Sarah for the tease and Kara for you making her training partner even more riled up. They turned and were on their way. \"Mia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know.\" Mia said before you could advise her. She turned to address her shocked sister. \"First, NEVER EVER talk that way to those two. Second, why are you here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just visit you?\" Mira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you could!\" Mia answered a pleasant smile. \"But I know you better than that Sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I was getting lonely at home. I want my sister back, and not this low version that you are. Why don't you take off your seal so the real you can come out?\" Mira relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we aren't allowed to. Plus, you know that Father made this seal so that I can't just take it off. I don't even know how. But I am still me.\" She responded. True enough, you hadn't actually seen her true form yet. Apparently, the seal had other effects than just altering her form and power. It had a 'nice' filter too. It made two separate but connected versions of Mia. You could almost sense the other side. But that seal was strong enough to keep you out if you weren't using a considerable amount of force. The kind that would rip her mind in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I find a way to get that thing off.\" Mira stated as she started backing Mia down, but only to back into you. She looked at you as did Mira. \"I could always kick your boyfriend's ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try.\" You stated with a little growl that made her back off a little. \"Being Mia's sister has got you some grace in this rude streak you have going. But not much. You best be careful. I might like playing this game with people, at times, but Sarah.... you must be crazy to insult her. Also, we are trying to keep it a secret that she is human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I won't tell everyone about...\" She started to which you interrupted her by making your eyes glow and closing the gap between the two of you in seconds, having a mere inch between the two of your faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have a better chance fighting us than surviving after you let Sarah's secret go.\" You said then you three looked to a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERVERT  !!!\" Came Sarah's voice to which a large \"Boom\" was heard, then a creature scream, followed by an airborne monster of some kind that was easily over 50 feet tall. You all could see that its face was caved in and it was heading toward a small cliff. It impacted the underside of it with a crash then fell with a much of the cliff itself. The monster in question was a flame demon that was a very accomplished peeping tom. He was really good at melting into the area and was almost impossible to find. But his kind were also REALLY powerful. Which is why other student didn't make him stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, she isn't in the best mood right now.\" You highlighted. Mira just nodded dumbly to which both you and Mia sighed that she finally got it. It was oddly fortunate that the pervert was there to help things along in his own way. You doubted that is what he intended, but he was actually of use for once. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Going through the portal wasn\u2019t that bad this time around, probably because you weren\u2019t ignorant like before as well as not half dead in both body and mind. However on the other side you were bombarded with a lot of noise and an overload in sensory projection. It took you a while but with your natural athletic and physical prowess you avoided people until you could tell what was going on. Over the course of a month you learned a lot about this new realm you were in. For one there was no magic, at all, well accept what you knew. The buildings around you were so big that it memorized you. You were shown what a computer was by some kid then you spent a good amount of time learning all you could. You both learned and saw that the military hardware could take you down if they wanted and that it was an extremely bad idea to reveal anything about your other side. Luckily for you, when you worked your way into the system, your blood was human with a small abnormality in it. What they didn\u2019t know what that it was your dragon blood seeping through the seams of your human side. Shortly after you learned what you needed you acquired your identity, without bringing up suspicion, as well as a small house in which you bought with gold since you didn\u2019t know enough about money to materialize it. But that was a problem that easily was fixed via internet and experimentation. You were delighted to know that while you would no doubt be a subject of scientific interest if found, dragons were considered fiction in this realm by most people. A problem arose soon after you started phoning in crimes that you smelled from your house. The city was huge and you didn\u2019t know everything about it but your senses could smell blood from miles away so you phoned in locations until one day when you opened your door to a group of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, can I help you?\u201d you asked as you saw a few police officers and people you recognized from walking around murder scenes as they solved them. They were fascinating to you and it was a good thing you could see them from afar or they would\u2019ve noticed you right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m Gil Grissom with the Las Vegas Crime Lab and this is Sara Sidle. Are you Max Drake?\u201d He one of the men you recognized asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You answered as you looked them all over in a general setting, eyes resting on specific things like a badge, gun, field kits, and sight line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if we come in?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I need to ask for a warrant or is it at least partially a social call?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just need to ask you a few questions. You placed over a dozen calls in the last month the Police Department of murders and other violent crimes before the crimes were even fully committed. We just are here on curiosity more than anything.\u201d He answered. You nodded then ushered them in. Your house was very neat and open with comfortable couches and not a spot of anything misplaced. Mainly because you liked flexing your wings in the house and needed both the room and the privacy to do so. \u201cHmm, very clean in here. Never saw something this vacant of activity before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment. I do have my secrets like most but I worked hard so they couldn\u2019t be seen on the surface, nor any other activities that would put someone off. I do have to occasional visitor but that is easy enough to clean after.\u201d You responded. The officers remained standing as the two sat on a couch and you in the chair opposing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to tell us how you can report these things so quickly?\u201d The human named Sarah asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you believe that call from here?\u201d you asked and they both gave you a skeptical look. \u201cI recently lost all my memory and the government had to make a new identity for me. Since then I have been walking around the city to get to know the place. It\u2019s a big place. You\u2019d be surprised what you can see just by taking a walk. Anyway, when I hear a gunshot, scream, or something like that then smell blood I call and report it. I know that going anywhere near the scene will just place me as a suspect and in some cases the only one. So I do what I can with the limited exposure at my disposal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when you hear someone scream out for help you don\u2019t bother running to help?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the law that well but I have seen your unit work and know what I\u2019ve already told you. I also know that by the time I get over there I would just be contaminating the scene and they would probably be dead by that point. Not to mention that I\u2019ve almost been shot before and don\u2019t really want to repeat the experience, especially if I can\u2019t shoot back.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t say anything about self-defense in such situations.\u201d Grissom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. One bullet is all it takes to take another life and I want no part of it or the aftermath. I intervene and there is at least one more death added to the scope when you and your\u2026 team could\u2019ve solved it without the extra casualty.\u201d  You retorted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne reason we are asking is\u2026 we are investigating a murder that you called in. We were hoping you could share something you saw.\u201d Sara admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only smelled the blood and heard a shank before I called it in. Thinking back from it I would say that it is a bladed attack but not seeing a body I can only guess. But the sound was refined and swift, like someone who was using a sword and knew what they were doing.\u201d You reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gathered that by just the smell and sound?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I know about that world a little. For someone to not scream but be cut down with a single stroke of a sword and disappear enough to not make an additional sound. That has to be someone very skilled and very efficient, like a ninja or something like that.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinja?\u201d Sarah asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr something like that. Bare minimum someone that could use a weapon like that and assassinate someone well enough to get you guys stumped. Probably not the work of an amateur and not someone who sticks around after completion. Unless you know of another assassin like group in your society that uses bladed weapons rather than firearms I would not rule out a ninja of some caliber.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What did you mean by that?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no other way to say it. I am a ninja, dragon ninja if you want to be precise.\u201d You admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a ninja?\u201d Sara asked, again skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, unemployed as it were. A highly trained ninja can do a lot of damage. More so than any fool with a gun.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon ninja? What does that mean?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the fighting style and methods and more of a nickname rather than an actual position. Although a while back it was a feared rank among those that are ninja.\u201d You explained as you tiptoed around the actual reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any of your tools? Things to give us a reference?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come with me.\u201d You said as you got up and they followed. You led them to the basement to a titanium vault door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a titanium vault in your home?\u201d Sara asked as the others, except Grissom, shared her disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinja hide their tools and techniques as closely guarded secrets. For that reason I would like for the officers not to enter, and that neither of you touch anything. A single drop of poison could kill an elephant in seconds and this is where I store all of my ninja gear so other ninja can\u2019t get at them. I\u2019m trusting you two on this.\u201d You said as you typed in the code, used a hand print, eye scan, and blood test. The door glowed a red dragon on the door then opened. You motioned them forward but the officers stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are all yours?\u201d Grissom asked as he viewed the collection with a deep fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, haven\u2019t actually used them in a while but no proper ninja allow his or her tools become rusted or otherwise compromised. That and different tools for different jobs although I prefer hand to hand combat and relying on skill rather than an assortment of toys.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to take a few of these to test for blood.\u201d Sara said as she glanced at some of the katana you had displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need a warrant for that. Like I said, ninja keep our tools and secrets a secret for a reason. I am helping you out of respect as I\u2019ve seen your work and watched you do your work. However if that doesn\u2019t matter and you do prefer to tread on that then I will reconsider my stance and just let you do your job without that help or respect. I can tell you right now that all of these weapons have human blood on them but none belong to anyone you have ever met. Take that anyway you want but you are not taking them without a warrant and documented verification of the dangers of doing so.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Officer, will you escort him to the police station while we continue?\u201d Grissom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears you didn\u2019t hear me. Maybe this will clear things up for you.\u201d You returned and in a single snap of your fingers they dropped a few inches as the vault and weapons dematerialized and disappeared from view. \u201cGo ahead and do what you want since it doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference if I want you to or not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 did you do that?\u201d Sara asked. As the others looked around, Grissom trying to find out how you did it and the officers in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter does it. You\u2019ll believe what you think regardless of what I say. Now it appear like I get my first arrest on this.\u201d You said as you walked over to the officers and they escorted you out of the house. You could hear the two of them try and figure it out and almost laughed. Magic was fake in this realm and not a lot of people even suspected otherwise. You had successfully dematerialized everything that could be used against you as well as the vast library of scrolls and books containing your research and jutsu lists, along with their instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drove to the police station and put in a cell. You ignored the others in the room, taking the time to take a nap until you were shook awake by a larger man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a jail cell not a vacation, let\u2019s go.\u201d The man ordered to which he and another officer led your back down hallways then sat you in a room that you recognized as what the internet described as an interrogation room. You were left alone in the room so you looked around from your seat. You could see clearly through the one sided glass but didn\u2019t allow them to know, heck you could hear and almost smell them through the thing layer and under the doors. You almost smiled as you could hear that they were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were letting you \u201cSweat\u201d or so they said but you almost fell asleep yet again. Seeing that what they were trying wasn\u2019t working they came in to talk with you. The large man was first, followed by the two you already knew while two others remained behind the glass. They started by placing photos in front of you. They were of a business man sliced in two like you\u2019d expect from your limited observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective Jim Brass, we didn\u2019t get a chance to introduce ourselves. But then again you know this guy, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said as he fingered one of the photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wealthy business man of some kind, not sure beyond that.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you do this to people you don\u2019t know? I doubt it.\u201d He responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill this man. Not my style and far too low. It\u2019s obvious to me that the killer went for the easy kill rather than the skillful one. What a mess.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were going to kill him, how would you do it then?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a sword or in general?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with a sword then go to the general.\u201d Grissom chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with a sword I would\u2019ve attacked from behind and penetrated the heart and left before he hit the pavement, I may have punctured a few other organs judging on the amount of exposure and time I had but this would be too clean up later. In general I would\u2019ve brushed passed him, slicing him in an unnoticed spot with a poisoned Kunai. The type would numb the area so he would die in front of someone else and switch the suspects up then found an alibi for myself, or if it was a hit then I would already have one in place.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat proof do you have that you didn\u2019t do this?\u201d Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout as much as you have to put me there, which is not much. But don\u2019t worry, I learned my lesson in this whole thing.\u201d You responded to which she looked at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lesson?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there is a lesson in everything we observe if we are willing to see it. This one was that it was not smart of me to interfere in your affairs. I thought I was helping by calling in the crimes that my ninja senses could detect. I was wrong so I learned that and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d You said and immediately could tell that is not what they wanted to get across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that not what we meant for you to do.\u201d Sara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter either way. Looks like you all don\u2019t need the help. So if it causes this kind of trouble then there\u2019s no point . It was a mistake to do it in the first place and my consequence is arrest, jail, and the destruction of all my ninja gear and research.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They followed your sightline as one of the other people from behind the glass came into the room, a woman with blonde hair. She whispered something in Grissom\u2019s ear then stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it looks like you\u2019re free to go, but we would like your help if you\u2019re still offering.\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would I help you at this point? Last time didn\u2019t end up so well and I don\u2019t like making the same mistakes twice.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother few were just found, a few officers that were checking out a warehouse. They were diced up with a long bladed weapon that matches this one.\u201d The blonde woman asked and you stayed on her for a bit.\u201cCatherine Willows.\u201d She introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom our research into ninja, don\u2019t you take care of your own?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not from around here and don\u2019t know who it is. Most likely it is a rogue or there would be a group of at least 3. Still too much for any normally trained person like police or even SWAT. In the end the enemy ninja has not come after me so I don\u2019t have a beef with him or her.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you would let this, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, ninja just go about his business?\u201d asked Brass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much. Ninja aren\u2019t loose cannons. We are assigned missions and carry them out. From doing the dishes to assassinations. You\u2019ll only have a problem if you pursue the ninja and they feel threatened. Think of them like wolves and it will be easier, very smart wolves.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t help us?\u201d Asked Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said that. I asked why I should and no one has given me an answer yet.\u201d You retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it will undoubtedly prove you innocent.\u201d Willows stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 you do know that if I help you find them then they will die one way or another right?\u201d You asked and they looked at you quizzically. \u201cNinja have strict rules about capture and success, particularly the assassin driven clans. Basically if they can\u2019t finish their mission or are about to be compromised they will protect the rest by killing themselves. Although dying in battle is more desirable so they will probably fight to the death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere has to be a way to capture them alive.\u201d Brass stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is, but they would either kill themselves or kill you the first chance they get.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a ninja without their weapons aren\u2019t much of a threat. I mean, look at you.\u201d Brass stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah look at how well you and your men search me.\u201d You stated as you pulled a knife from a hidden place, then imbedding it into the table. \u201cIf I were that ninja you all would be dead.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Take me to the warehouse.\u201d You agreed and they did. You didn\u2019t have any of your gear but then again you didn\u2019t need it. You rode separate from them and the officer wasn\u2019t that talkative then finally you arrived and immediately smelled the scent of fresh blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever did it is still in there. We surrounded the building and no one has gotten out since we sent the others in.\u201d Detective Brass informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably waiting for dark in order to disappear. I suppose you are coming with, bad idea but it\u2019s up to you.\u201d You more asked but already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou can\u2019t do it by yourself.\u201d Brass stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays you, just don\u2019t attack at all and you\u2019ll be fine. That is unless she doesn\u2019t have any pride, then she\u2019ll kill anyone she can regardless if they\u2019re a threat.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a she?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA combination of scent and wound analysis. A man would just slice while most women ninja tend to be more artistic about it. Now let\u2019s not keep her waiting.\u201d You said then started walking toward the door. You could already feel the woman\u2019s eyes on you. The others were a little hesitant but followed. You all walked into the bare room through the door into the darkness of the room. The ones following you took out flashlights but you just looked around and found her right away as she stalked around them. Brass went to the dead officers right away, as did the others while you moved to a clear portion of the floor and stood still. Just as you thought, she had enough chakra to fight but was unfamiliar she had it, similar to you before going to Naruto\u2019s realm. She was just really good at sneaking around. \u201cStay back.\u201d You commanded as the others were making their way to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what is it?\u201d asked Grissom as he rose his arm to stop their progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is between her and I, if you don\u2019t threaten her she shouldn\u2019t attack. You may do as you wish after but you asked for my help and this is it. Just don\u2019t move and you\u2019ll be fine. Try and attack her in any fashion and you\u2019ll be dead before you can draw your gun.\u201d You instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we\u2019ll cooperate for now.\u201d Detective Brass said, putting away his weapon at Grissom\u2019s prompting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get down to business. Will you negotiate or not?\u201d You asked. Soon after a knife implanted into the floor near the other group with a note on it. Grissom carefully retrieved it as evidence it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt says \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d Grissom stated then deposited it into an evidence bag of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to hear her speak you need to turn out your lights.\u201d You informed them as you used some magic to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No way, then we really will be helpless if \u2018she\u2019 decided to attack.\u201d Brass stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re helpless now, the average ninja can throw multiple projectiles at once just as efficient and deadly as the ones that killed those officers. In relation your little light sources won\u2019t help in the slightest. Might I remind you that it was your idea to bring her in rather than just kill her so it\u2019s your move.\u201d You said and reluctantly they turned their lights off and placed them on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill me? You think it would be that easy?\u201d said a feminine voice from the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well for me anyway. Did you kill that business man out of a mission or freelance?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d She asked as she moved around so her voice couldn\u2019t be tracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo me it does. I guess another way of asking is\u2026 Are you a rouge ninja?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She answered then continued a little while later. \u201cI am a contractor and hired assassin. The FBI took down my clan years ago and I\u2019m the only one left. Can\u2019t run a clan with just one person. So I do small jobs for people to make a living. Nothing too big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you consider stopping that life if you had another option?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you did some time then were able to live free would you accept it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Detective Brass if she gave you her client how much time would she do for it.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMandatory life sentence. She has murdered multiple people and may good police officers. There\u2019s no jury or government in the world that would condone that.\u201d He almost hissed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case I can\u2019t exactly ask you to just come in now can I? Instead I\u2019ll give you a trade. You give them hard proof of every client that you\u2019ve worked for in the last year, including this one, and I\u2019ll give you a give you this.\u201d you said as you materialized a scroll then threw it to her. She was somewhat surprised that you knew where she was but in any case she opened it and a gasp could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a ninja technique from ancient times of this country. I found it a while back and mastered it.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you give this to me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a trade. If you accept then you will do no more assassinations and give your client list with hard proof to these people. If you don\u2019t accept then it looks like you and I will have a little showdown. However, knowing that I am capable of that technique should tell you that I am not amateur.\u201d You answered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When all I have to do is kill the people in the room then leave with the scroll.\u201d She said then threw some shuriken at the others. However you were expecting this and rose a fire barrier to block them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Brass said from the inside as he could see out with the rest of them. The fire illuminated the area, her presence, and the shuriken that turned to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, that barrier will protect you only if you remain inside. Now watch a ninja battle, however short it may be.\u201d You said and after a little testing they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so low of me?\u201d She asked as she took out her sword to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. I have done nothing but give you compliments however you are far underneath my level.\u201d You stated then the fight began. She was pretty fast for a human of this realm but not fast enough. You danced with her for about 15 minutes in sword play before she got tired enough to look for an exit. But with a quick lunge you disarmed her then struck her neck, causing her to fall unconscious to the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d You said, opening the door and taking down the fire barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a rather interesting show. Didn\u2019t know people could move that fast.\u201d Detective Brass stated as they grabbed their lights then he went to call the rest of them inside. The others approached as you started to undress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemoving her of any unnecessary baggage.\u201d You said as you started taking out hidden weapons from almost everywhere on her body until there was a heaping pile of blades and with a poison flask in her tooth you were done then dressed what you had taken off and left her for the officers to bind and take away. With that done you grabbed the scroll and let it burst into flames before their eyes then there was nothing but ash. \u201cNow she is safer to transport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Grissom asked as he was at a loss for how you made both the fire barrier and the flame to take the scroll away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNinja secret I\u2019m afraid. One that that one didn\u2019t know. I also have an insanely high sensory progression as well as physical skill, like I just displayed.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t show us?\u201d asked one you had heard to be called Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t have it on record or other ninja would be drawn to it and strive to obtain, not to mention every fool that thinks it would be fun to summon fire with their bare hands. I can show you later but not with such an audience.\u201d You said as the police officers came in as well as a few squads of swat and one FBI agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, and we have work to do.\u201d Grissom stated then started assigning tasks for the team. They all say what you meant when the FBI agent tried to squeeze your abilities out of you. You didn\u2019t budge and just played dumb in a comical way that got them to laugh more than once and the FBI agent leave rather flustered. You kind of wondered what was going to happen now. You had demonstrated that you could easily be a threat but also a great asset. Grissom seamed fascinated with you and the other members of his team as well, in different amounts. However, that wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause them to accept you by any means\u2026 but it was a start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were there to get an official spot on under Grissom\u2019s command, more or less. It was a contract of sorts that only required you to follow his orders and it allowed you to come and go as you pleased, in government buildings and crime scenes. Mainly so you could help them with whatever they needed on the record while you methods remained off record. The female ninja was causing some racket when she woke up in the interrogation room so you nodded you answer to him to which you both went in the room to find her trying to fight brass and 3 officers while her hands and feet were cuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you please stop being such a pain in the ass?\u201d you asked which caused her to freeze. Throughout her fight with you she more than realized that you were far better than she was. She didn\u2019t have a chance against you before and she sure as hell didn\u2019t have a chance against you with her hands and feet as they were, and no weapon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d She almost spat but wisely didn\u2019t but it didn\u2019t stop her from glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I gave you a way out and you chose this. Now, please behave yourself while you\u2019re here. I hear they are going to transfer you soon and you can do as you wish after that. But it would be an even bigger pain to come back here every few minutes to regulate your little outbursts.\u201d You said and all she could do was sit in the chair and look away. She knew you were right but didn\u2019t want to admit it. \u201cJust to be clear, you don\u2019t want me to come back here to calm you down.\u201d You said as you tapped into a genjutsu that made an illusion for just her that made it seem like you were a demon and was threatening her with torture before an eternal suffering. She almost pissed herself before you slowly dispelled it, bowed to Detective Brass and followed Grissom out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d he asked as he must\u2019ve figured that you weren\u2019t just talking, smart guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother ninja trick. This one just made her more\u2026 submissive to my request.\u201d you said with a little smirk and he returned it. He had read from her that she was scarred beyond belief of you and, at the moment, he didn\u2019t mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your house was wrecked they let you finance an addition to their lab that only had three entrances/exits; one being a door attached to the lab that was a carbon copy of the other vault door but with only a hand print activation. The second was like a hanger door to the top that covered half the complex and big enough to allow you to change to dragon and fly out. The third was a hangar like door on the side for entrance of larger things that maxed out at your size and this door was the most secure with all your seals, blood, handprint, eye scan, voice match, combination lock, and an added chakra seal just too be safe. The rest was just a wide open space with very little except a few things for human living. Basically you wanted to be able to stretch your dragon body and your excuse was to give CSI a free space to work on larger things. However, since you put the money up for it and financed a major budget increase on their part they authorized it to be YOUR space and you had full control over it, even if they were to kick you out of you limited employment status inside the unit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human part was just inside the door and had a blood sealed vault door to the rest of the complex to prevent uninvited guests seeing you as a dragon. There was a second vault that you kept all your human weapons and ninja gear. Through some training, provided by the government, you were able to see and train on different things like guns, explosives, flying (human aircrafts), driving, and a host of other things. To make the other part of the complex believable you stored an assortment of larger items in it like military vehicles, including tanks and a jet with all the artillery and ammunition to start world war 3. You also had a few more practical things or store evidence vehicles in a more secure setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like you\u2019ve settled in nicely.\u201d Grissom stated as he came in and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, finally got the last of the security installed. Did you get that that guy?\u201d you asked as you were referring to a suspect you helped track down instead of scent dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you for that. Although, because he\u2019s a minor he\u2019ll be out in a few months.\u201d He stated as the rest of the group that was in your little seating area scowled at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well you can\u2019t do anything about it so at least he\u2019s off the streets for a little while and not shooting anyone else up during that time.\u201d You said back and as much as they hated it they also agreed. \u201cSo what is it you wanted to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as we\u2019ve stressed, we appreciate the help you provide. In the form of interrogation alone you scare the suspects to give up their bank account numbers if we want them.\u201d Grissom stated then waited for the door to close fully before continuing. \u201cHowever we have noticed that some of the things you do are, in short, not humanly possible. Scaling a 200 foot wall or getting across town in seconds is getting harder to defend when asked by observers. We don\u2019t mind the help but we could use some extra\u2026 details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019ve been working here for a year and have slipped up sometimes in that manner. I guess I can tell you, but only if it remains off the record no matter what I reveal. Even IF I say that I am a nuclear warhead on legs.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that would be interesting.\u201d Greg said with a smile but with all the serious faces in the room he took one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, we\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using magic, I can materialize almost anything that I have a complex knowledge of.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense man, but you expect us to believe that?\u201d Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot without proof. Isn\u2019t that why you made sure the door was closed?\u201d You asked and they all sat up at this. \u201cGranted I\u2019ve yet to see a magician around that can do real magic it does exist. I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d You said then held your hand out and a light started to glow above it. You did it as slowly as possible so they could observe it and they turned wide eyed as they did. The light turned into little particles then started to come together, floating in midair as they started to form something solid. You continued and soon they could see the starting of a pizza and one they all would eat. Soon the pizza was done and you got to work on the box. Soon after you brought the other hand and materialized a table in similar fashion then placed the floating pizza box on the table. Then you sat back and gestured to the box for them to analyze it. They did to which Greg was coaxed to take the first piece. To his moaning at the flavor they all grabbed one and tested it. Their eyes dissected the rest for other possibilities but after exhausting logical possibilities they looked back to your smiling face, observing their amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is how you happen to have every tool you need no matter how many times we confirm you aren\u2019t carrying anything?\u201d Catherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaves on unnecessary baggage if all I need to do is just\u2026\u201d you started then snapped your fingers and the table and box disappeared. \u201cBasically magic is spells that use magic energy to manipulate things to produce a result. There are spells to unlock doors, to cook a meal, to wash the dishes, to move something without touching it, and so on. Now ninja tricks or \u2018Jutsu\u2019 are effects that are made possible by one\u2019s inner energy or \u2018chakra\u2019 to utilize what is already there. For instance.\u201d You explained then produced a rasengan in your hand. \u201cThis is known as the \u2018Rasengan\u2019. Utilizing wind and air I can concentrate it into this and use as I will. In this case I have more control and can only use things that are already there. Teleportation justu is just using a location seal to transport one energy signature from one space to another. Anything that has the seal and/or contract can be summoned to another space. So that is how I get around town so quickly. I have marked areas with certain seals and can just\u2026 go there in an instant. Still have to walk from there to the final destination and it does have a range limit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not going to say I understand, because I don\u2019t, but I do understand the words you are saying. I never thought someone would prove magic in front of me.\u201d Grissom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to see another? I have a healing spell that is very effective but dangerous.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell takes someone else\u2019s problem, wither it be a paper cut or severed body part, and transfers it to me. That way my body can combat it and, as you have seen before, my body is better at healing than most people. However it still carries a risk that I will not be able to heal. I\u2019m not all powerful, obviously.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you take?\u201d Captain Brass asked as he was sick of taking a back seat to what the rest of them were so interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t taken in anything yet that I couldn\u2019t handle. Although the more sever the wound and problem to more affected my body is until it is fixed. I\u2019ve actually cured someone of cancer before, spent a week unconscious and a month after that bed ridden but it still worked. Grissom, if you\u2019d allow me?\u201d you asked as you pointed to his ear. By this time everyone knew he had a hearing problem. He was hesitant but leaned forward to you. Then, reaching up, you placed a hand on either side of his head the magic took effect as light both kept him from moving and also entered his ears, then came out as if transferring the energy of his problem to your hands. You slouched for a moment and leaned back with your eyes closed and thankfully his problem wasn\u2019t as bad as you thought. It took about 5 minutes to heal then you opened your eyes to address them. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did that as if it was nothing. I\u2019m feeling fine, how are you feeling?\u201d he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a little dizzy while my body dealt with the problem but it\u2019s over now so I feel fine.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just so I don\u2019t end up fainting from shock.\u201d Greg said then got up and walked a little bit away. \u201cThis is the most awesome thing in the world!\u201d he yelled as if expelling the excess excitement then went over and sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, there is one more thing. It\u2019s been bothering me for a while and now especially after that little demonstration.\u201d Grissom said as he rounded the topic to figure out how to say it. \u201cAssuming that what you are saying is true, a human can\u2019t do anything of what you do and especially not survive the things you\u2019ve admitted to surviving. Forgive me for saying this but, and I wouldn\u2019t even thing this a possibility before your little demonstration but\u2026 The way you act and react indicated that you aren\u2019t human. Am I just assuming to much or am I actually accurate in that assumption?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes suddenly went downcast as you remembered all the times people have asked this of you and overreacted, right away or down the road. You weren\u2019t really paying attention but they could see the sudden change in mood as Grissom asked his question. Normally they would just let it go and forget about it. However the question asked and the slightest indication that it was accurate spurred a great amount of curiosity. But it didn\u2019t make them blind to the obvious mental strain it had on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that my question has struck truth. But there is obvious pain behind it. You should know that no matter what you say or are, we will still feel the same way about you.\u201d Grissom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if I am something that could devour you all in seconds?\u201d you asked in a cryptic yet directed direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fact that we are all still here means that you\u2019ve already shown restraint if that is the case.\u201d Grissom responded and his answer brought the others back from the shock of what the question brought up. They didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d do if you turned out to be what you said. But he had answered it in a way and with a tone that indicated that they knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ok, here goes nothing. I should start out by saying that I\u2019m not from this realm. Realm meaning I am from earth but\u2026 different. The best way to describe it is if you could enter a movie and live in that world or realm. You\u2019re not fictional by any means but that is the closest thing to explain it. I arrived by a portal from another realm that kicked me out for being potentially dangerous, too dangerous to keep around. I know my kind have come here before because of the legends and myth surrounding my kind but it has been a while.\u201d You said but saw a million questions pop up in their expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d Sara said as they others just took it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is magic and I can do it just fine. Look, minus taking you to another realm there is no way to prove it so you\u2019re just gonna have to trust me on that one. Although that is where my kind has come from in your realm\u2019s history. Care to take a guess on what I am?\u201d You asked, trying to lighten the mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Are you saying you\u2019re like a dragon of something?\u201d Catherine asked in confusion but you suddenly looked at her with a face that indicated she had said something right. It didn\u2019t take them long to figure out what she had said. \u201cYou got to be kidding me. A dragon, they are just fictional or at best myth. No one has ever proven the existence of dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTells you how long it\u2019s been, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d you almost stated but looked down again. You were expecting them to freak out but then again they hadn\u2019t actually seen you in that form yet so they had a little ways to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be willing to prove it would you?\u201d Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 to be honest. Every time I have it brings the same result. In all my time I have met a total of 3 people, dragon or human, that accept me. Pretty much everyone else wants me dead just for being what I am. You have no idea what it feels like to be hated by literally billions of people when you\u2019ve done nothing to spawn such hatred. My own mother hated me the day I was born. I like you people and I don\u2019t want you to hate me to.\u201d You said as you fought to remain emotionally stable but that fight was seen through your expressions and speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would your mother hate you?\u201d Catherine asked, being one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy type of dragon is called Dark Hunters. The most powerful type of dragon by far. We are like\u2026 a dragon version of Spartans where only the strong survive and as such we are feared by dragon and human. Dragons in general are not really that friendly so this only makes us more dangerous. Dark hunter females are about twice as powerful as the males except for one. Every 50 generations a single male is born that is known as a \u2018Half-breed\u2019 or a \u2018King\u2019. A Dark Hunter King has all the genetic knowledge of the Kings before him as well as genetic power and intelligence. Physically a King maxes out at double a Queen\u2019s max, Queen\u2019s being 250 and a King being 500 feet tall and proportionally long. There are two ways to tell off the bat if a hatchling is a King. The first is red eyes instead of orange eyes for males and blue for female. The second is if the hatchling is human when breaking out of one\u2019s egg, then turns dragon. That one is one reason why humans don\u2019t like Kings either. If a human can turn into a dragon to evade or catch them off guard then they got problems to say the least. So\u2026 when my mother saw me and being the head Queen she grabbed me minutes after me hatching, chewed me up and spat me off our mountain with disgust and distain. There was no love, not kindness, and because of Dark Hunter\u2019s status in my home world, no mercy from anyone else either. But I survived and here I am despite the odds.\u201d You said in a retelling of your mother\u2019s rejection, or the short version anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re being one of these \u2018half-breeds\u2019 is why you appear human now?\u201d Warrick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can grow dragon parts to help me and I have all my draconic powers in this form. However transforming is insanely painful, even with the jutsu I developed to make it instantaneous it is no picnic. Not to mention my fear of rejection. I can show you my dragon parts that I can bring out in human form. Those don\u2019t hurt when I form them.\u201d you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it hurt for you to transform and not to grow\u2026 parts?\u201d Asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause going from a 6 foot tall human to a 500 foot tall dragon is a bigger change. My body literally has to rip itself apart to change, generate and destroy organs, and grow parts that are not applicable to the other body. For example, my dragon body has two stomachs and a human only has one. So I have grow a stomach and the organs to make it function then destroy it when going to human form.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can we see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come with me than.\u201d You said as you got up and went to the vault door that led into the rest of the compound. It opened to which they all quickly followed and watched it close behind them before following you. \u201cOk, since my jutsu is, in a manner of speaking, an explosion, I need to do this the old fashion way. It hurts a lot so that is why I will be snarling. I has nothing to do with any emotion of feral behavior.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, thank you for doing this. You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want. You\u2019ve told us more than enough.\u201d Grissom stated which made the others look at him but then realize that he was right, again. Grissom had a tendency to be right. So people tended to listen when he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t panic and stuff and we\u2019ll call it even. Now stay there.\u201d You instructed as you walked into the open space then turned to face them. They nodded to you and you to them then started. Doubling over, dragon parts started coming from you and even though you were use to the pain it hardly helped when transforming like this. You kept it more contained but your claws were making trenches in the 20 foot thick titanium floor as they grew. After about 5 minutes of growing, growling, snarling, and puffing you were done and collapsed onto the floor. You were breathing heavily as you recovered and looked at them. Brass had his gun out, as did some of the others but Grissom quickly told them to holster them. For starters they wouldn\u2019t do anything to what laid before them, that much was obvious at this point. You struggled to a more comfortable and composed position and was grateful that you built the complex with such a high roof as you could stretch out and so you did. Your wings stretched out then returned to your back as did the other parts after being suppressed in human form for so long. Finally you were composed enough to speak with them. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2026so this is you as a\u2026 d\u2026dragon?\u201d Catherine asked, remarkably before Grissom as he was too entranced with the sight of you to put a sentence together, at the moment. You answered with a nod as every movement you made had them on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be dreaming. I mean this kind of thing only happens in dream. That and movies, TV show, Mag\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg!\u201d Warrick interrupted which ended his almost panicked rambling. \u201cSo can you do that magic stuff like this to?\u201d He asked as he changed the subject slightly. You looked over at the trenches you made and they filled up like nothing happened. \u201cCool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 This is very\u2026 we could use you the force you know?\u201d Brass said as he tried to comprehend the situation a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the point of him keeping it a secret was the opposite side of that. Do you really think that once others got wind of this that they would let him stay here? At best he would be a lab rat and zoo attraction.\u201d Grissom stated and again they came back to the fact that he was right and you were still a person, just\u2026 bigger and with teeth, very large teeth. \u201cSo this is why you built this place so big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I wanted a space I could stretch out and a roof so I could fly away if it was necessary. I can\u2019t fly for fun because of satellites and other technology you humans have in this realm. I really do miss flying but in any case it is\u2026 cramped I guess to be in human form all the time.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo being a\u2026 dragon, you can do all that other stuff right; breathing fire, magic, flying, and other stuff like that?\u201d Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly yes. Although most of your realms facts about dragons have been idolized and obscured over the many centuries since the last one arrived and no I don\u2019t know when that was. I can\u2019t grant wishes minus what I can do via magic and other draconic abilities and there is one ability that I won\u2019t do anymore.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 which one is that?\u201d asked Sara, as she was the one yet to react and was dead set on reacting better than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the last realm I learned all my ninja skills and went on missions both as a dragon and as a human. For people without planes and cars I was quite useful. But one mission I was assigned was a rescue and aid mission because of me medical skills as I\u2019ve already shown. But there is one place that I can perform healing spells that can cure almost anything without taking it into myself. So I put them in my second stomach in which I can increase my healing powers by at least 10 or more depending on the situation. When I got back I was tired from fighting and healing the people in that stomach so I drifted from consciousness but, as you can imagine, someone finding out I ate a bunch of people without the reason can be problematic. So they\u2026\u201d you started then rolled over so they could clearly see the scars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness\u2026 they did all this?\u201d Catherine asked as they looked at all the scares that riddled your dragon body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just this one.\u201d You said as you traced the cut they made with your claw then went back to a more proper position. \u201cThe rest were from my mother when she tried killing me as a child. Anyway, they couldn\u2019t get me to cough them up so they cut them out of me and sewed bombs inside to use afterward and use them they did. So that is the only ability I won\u2019t use. It is probably a source of comfort for you but I will not eat anyone that is good or a friend, even to heal them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you cough them up?\u201d Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one I was unconscious from the energy I used in flying so far, healing them, fighting and a few other things. Second, they were in the middle of healing so removing them would\u2019ve killed them from the shock alone. They were pretty bad off and in critical condition.\u201d You answered to which they started to understand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not a lot of other people had the ability to get in but you couldn\u2019t take the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, someone\u2019s coming.\u201d You said then started to snarl again and in a matter of a few minutes you were back to human just as someone\u2019s cell phone went off. You were, at this point, laying on the floor and steaming from the relatively cold body from your dragon one. Grissom spoke with the person calling then hung up. From his conversation, it appear it was the sheriff\u2026 again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, are you ok?\u201d asked Grissom as they moved to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tired. Transforming takes a lot out of me. Probably nature\u2019s way to make sure I don\u2019t go on random rampages after changing.\u201d You said as you tried to get up but fell down again. You tried again but was caught by Warrick and Nick, who let you lean on them and was pretty much carrying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can\u2019t sleep yet. We need you to open the door.\u201d Warrick said as they carried you and the others followed. When you got to the door you opened it for them to which they all went through and that ended your consciousness. It reminded you of why you made the jutsu to get to dragon or human form. You woke to a mostly empty room and on the couch you had in the human area. To your movement you saw Grissom look up from his book to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIronic, the very act of you becoming more deadly leaves you so vulnerable. Welcome back, you\u2019ve been asleep for a few days. We each took turns watching you.\u201d Grissom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know why I created a jutsu for it. One more thing you should know. I am just as strong in this form as I am in dragon form, just a different shell to contain the power. Which is why I have nose far better than any dog. Hard to beat a dragon\u2019s nose.\u201d You said as you sat up and leaned back in your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are magnificent. Never thought I would witness both magic and a dragon in the same day, or at all for that matter. Two things that are supposed to be only fiction. I have to rethink my entire way of evaluation.\u201d He said in a compliment manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily. I made it so no one could follow me to this realm. I\u2019ve done a fair amount of research and have not found a single other person that can do magic in the real sense and the last dragon was at least a couple thousand years ago. So, other than me, your rules still apply. But now you know why all those murder claims are pretty much B.S.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I were going to kill someone and hide it. I have much more\u2026 permanent methods to do it. Incineration, teleportation, and digestion to name a few, just for future reference for future allocations.\u201d You said with a smirk and he returned one. \u201cUh, do you mind if I stretch a little?\u201d You asked as you looked over to make sure the door was shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStretch? Oh, yes, go right ahead.\u201d He said as he figured out what you were referring to. You then let your wings stretch out as well as your tail and eyes. You flexed then just let them lay and pulse as they willed. \u201cAmazing.\u201d  He said as he looked at your dragon parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. Oh that reminds me. Being a scientist and all I grabbed one of these before I went back to human form for your collection.\u201d You said as you tossed him a Frisbee sized scale. He caught it then gazed at it in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my scales, yes it is. Dragon scales are harder than any metal I\u2019ve come in contact with, well the armored ones on my back anyway.\u201d You said as he looked over it more and smiled wide at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Max, I\u2019m somewhat confused. You\u2019re so nice and helpful to us, why?\u201d he asked as he held the scaled as if a treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it before, I like you guys\u2026 and girls. I like being useful to friends and family and hate when others threaten those people. It\u2019s a dragon thing, a sort of complicated version of loyalty and such. Just don\u2019t ask me to eat anyone, especially yourselves, other than that I would do anything for any one of you. Giving you a scale is just one of the perks of having a dragon as a friend. You are a friend right?\u201d you asked, making sure you were gauging him right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely. Max, we are all your friend.\u201d He said calmly but with that glint in his eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey boss, what\u2019s going on?\u201d you asked as you approached Brass and Grissom. Over the weeks since your little confession your group had gotten pretty close, using you as much as they could and you telling them about your past. You were a convenient scapegoat for using scent dogs and could actually see something as small as a scent trail when fresh. Both of them stood outside the house as the spoke, you could smell blood and death inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know those serial killers we were tracking? We got a warrant but someone beat us to them.\u201d Grissom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen do you two want to look with me?\u201d you asked and by this time they knew what you talking about. Instead of describing to them what your senses were picking up or training them in chakra to use Dragon\u2019s eye, you could share what you were seeing with them and leave your senses in them for a little while. \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 5 minutes before they come over to report.\u201d Brass said as he pointed to the two officers across the street. They turned to the house and you poked the back of their head, imparting your heightened senses to them for 4 minutes just to be safe. All three of you now had glowing red dragon eyes as you looked through the plaster, wood, stone, and metal to the crime scene. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you can see like this all the time.\u201d Brass stated as he looked around and sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t smell like it was those two that came. I can still see the vapor and scent trail he left.\u201d Grissom stated as he wafted the air in front of the door. You all followed it with your eyes until it dispersed into the night. \u201cIf you excuse me, I need to locate all the evidence before this wears off.\u201d He finished then quickly went through the house, identifying and targeting choice pieces of evidence to be collected later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Brass asked, still unable to turn around because his eyes were still glowing. However your senses were rarely wrong, and when they were it was because you hadn\u2019t smelled the scent before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Cap. But I think a cop or ex-cop did this one. If it was a civilian than the likely hood of them shooting and killing them both with only two shots with no noise and a makeshift silencer is almost nonexistent. They would also have access to the lab and the police reports and constant workings. Only someone inside somewhere would be able to pull it off. Not sure who did it though, yet. I\u2019ve got the scent on record as well as those finger prints so I\u2019ll know them when I see him. Grissom will probably find them before I do.\u201d You said as you pointed to the prints and leftover bottle from what the suspect shot through. Grissom had already found them and were taking note of their location. \u201cDefinitely not those two, but you\u2019re going to have to clear them anyway. They are here and these killers are dead so fingers are going to be pointing until you or CSI proves them clear.\u201d You said as a returning Grissom came through the door and you all turned to them approaching, the effects of your senses departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gave their statements or reports depending on one\u2019s point of view. They kept looking at you and Grissom like less them they were. But they knew better than to act on any impulses, even if they were alone with you and off duty. The last dirty cop you helped expose tried to sucker punch you and ended up with a few broken ribs, hands, face fractures, tail bone broken, and bruised all over. That and you had helped more than your fair share of police chases to earn both their fear and respect. Although Brass was the only officer of any rank that understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you think we\u2019re dirty cops to?\u201d one asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if I did, you know I wouldn\u2019t be able to say. Just let us do our jobs. If you\u2019re dirty it will show, if not than no harm no foul and you\u2019re back doing what you were doing no less than you were before. Off the record though we know it wasn\u2019t you, but we still have to prove it.\u201d You answered and they got your reasoning better than how Grissom explained it. Soon after you caught a whiff of something and started walking to which Greg of all people followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you got?\u201d Greg asked as you stopped and looked at a storm drain. You snapped your fingers, after looking around, and magically brought a cop shirt from the drain. You materialized an evidence bag around it and left it floating there for Greg to grab. \u201cI take it this smells like the killer?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, most of the DNA will be useless but I do see some on the collar.\u201d You said, flashing your eyes to be sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d Greg said as he was off to do his work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally he came in to the room and looked over both you and Grissom with a normal level of scrutiny as most like him did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you called?\u201d he asked as he stood before the two with you sitting off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you lose your badge?\u201d asked Brass as he showed him the badge that traced back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost one a few years back filed for a new one.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m aware of cops losing their badges.\u201d Brass stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we don\u2019t have a problem do we.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we have a problem because your badge was found in the proximity of a crime scene.\u201d Brass revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you manage to lose your badge?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch is life.\u201d He answered in a targeted way in a clear attempt to get under Grissom\u2019s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, let me see if he even smells right.\u201d You interrupted the scene tow which you got up and started lightly sniffing around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, the human sniffing machine. Do you your thing long enough and people will think you actually do part of the work.\u201d The officer stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that almost sounded like an insult. Off the record, I\u2019ve busted more ass than you will in 3 lifetimes so just shut up and stand there, silently.\u201d You replied back that got on his nerves as you circled around him. \u201cNo good, not the right scent. He\u2019s clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad the sniffer got something right.\u201d He said back to which you stopped mid step back to your chair and pivoted on your heel to face him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may not be a match for this but I have caught you sent before and can prove multiple other things that could end your career in a heartbeat. I didn\u2019t say anything because I agree that some people need a little something extra. But don\u2019t mistake my passiveness and respect for Brass and the P.D. for fear. I am not and never will be afraid of you. But you should be afraid of me and you push hard enough you\u2019ll see why.\u201d You almost growled at him before slowly sitting down but keeping a glare to him and not backing down from it despite the one he returned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy shou\u2026\u201d He started but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI highly advise you not to finish that question. Even I\u2019m afraid of what he could do.\u201d Brass advised to which the officer\u2019s eyes went to him as his Captain. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d They all stayed quiet until he was out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure it wasn\u2019t him?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe scent wasn\u2019t even close and wasn\u2019t even faint at the crime scene. He wasn\u2019t there at all.\u201d You revealed as you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who do we have left?\u201d Grissom asked\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was being held for beating a man to death and they just needed evidence to back it. Usually such conversations were done outside the room but it didn\u2019t really matter if and when they told you about the people they wanted you to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that guy that was beat to death? We thing Mr. Darian here is the one. Can you confirm?\u201d Brass asked. You went over to the man and took a good whiff of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s the scent that was on the dead man. But with evidence like this why do you need me here?\u201d you asked, not even paying attention to the angering man in the room. You could feel his body temperature was hotter than normal people and could hear his heartbeat increase to your lack of legitimizing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the guy that listens to words in the same way we do. Plus with the beating he gave the our victim I wouldn\u2019t mind you here, just in case.\u201d Brass stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, looks weak to me but whatever.\u201d You stated then sat on the other side of the table from him as he glared viciously at you. \u201cI suppose you think that look scared me, it doesn\u2019t. You just interrupted my lunch so I would love it if you threw a punch so I can have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not soft.\u201d He said above his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get to the good stuff that the evidence is going to tell us anyway. Did you beat that man Tony to death?\u201d you asked and he got no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to need to take some scrapings from under your nails.\u201d Grissom stated as he took out his tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Walter asked, still in an angered voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he said so, you don\u2019t need more of a reason. Just shut up like you were doing a moment ago and do as he sais.\u201d You stated that got him to bolt up and try to push the table aside to get at you. But it was bolted to the floor. \u201cNeed a little help with that?\u201d you asked as you ripped the table from the floor and flung it out of the way, coming face to face with the angered man. However even he had some kind of survival instinct and knew better than messing with you. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of you, I will never be scared of you. Now sit down and do as you\u2019re told or I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got him to lose his cool and throw his hands up to your throat but try as he might he couldn\u2019t push you back. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d he said to which you rose a hand to the others to keep them away, you were fine and they knew it. Even if they didn\u2019t know the reason, they knew that none among them could take you on. So this man with a serious anger problem wasn\u2019t going to be able to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you did that, now I get to work out a kink in my neck.\u201d You said as you brought a knee up into his gut then grabbed both of his wrists in with your left and held them away from your but steady. He was coughing up blood which you instantly healed to which you took your right hand and picked him up by the throat. He dangled in the air but you continued to heal him so he would remain conscious and aware of his position but still feel the suffocation he felt from your hold. You waited there for a moment then brought his face down to meet yours. \u201cSit down and do as you\u2019re told you little insect.\u201d You said than almost threw him into his chair to which he grasped his throat and you put the table back as if it had never been broken then sat yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, but I felt like making a point. I could tell he was rearing up to take some of you on so I just made him relent such thinking.\u201d you answered as you all looked at the coughing and wheezing man. \u201cCare for another round?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d he answered simply as fear replaced his anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, struggling for one\u2019s life does wonders for cooperation.\u201d You said the allowed the others to continue. Walter kept looking over at you as his temper flared but didn\u2019t dare let it out while you were there. Later though he did and died do to his large heart and rush of a fight, his last fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk, Doc. I know you sometimes call me in but this is a first time you\u2019ve done so with a question. You know being what I am doesn\u2019t make me an all knowing expert.\u201d You stated as you went into the morgue to inspect a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know but this one is strange, more strange than the usual cases. The victim is clearly dead but is still bleeding, the eyes still dilate and we have partial brain activity.\u201d Doctor Robinson said as he referred to the body before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what makes him dead?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor starters there isn\u2019t a heartbeat because the bullet that killed him destroyed it completely. One tends to miss when a heart is absent.\u201d Grissom stated as you joined then in standing around the body. \u201cWe were hoping you could detect something before we go carving or knew something about this kind of thing. Perhaps with your genetic knowledge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let me see here.\u201d You sighed then let your eyes glow as you looked deep into the dead corpse on the table. You could see blood still going through the veins and a single heartbeat kept it going, to small and segmented for them to pick up. Muscles and cells were still getting messages from the brain and you could see his stomach and other organs still processing at a decelerated rate. Finally something triggered an alarm in your brain as you identified a weird infection coursing through the veins. The infection was immediately recognized as your genetic knowledge would know as the \u2018Walking Dead Virus\u2019. It caused your body to freeze almost in fear as it was confirmed from a single bite wound to the corpse\u2019s arm. \u201cStep away now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d you demanded and didn\u2019t wait for them to comply as you used some magic to force then back and against a wall just as the corpse rose and took a swipe at them. You dodged as it came for you but incinerated it with a glance, turning it to ash. \u201cWe are in big trouble\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, do you mind?\u201d Grissom asked to which you released them gently from your magical hold and thought for a moment. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk you need to get everyone one in my vault that hasn\u2019t been bitten, right now.\u201d You stated almost in a panic mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Max, what\u2019s going on? Why did you burn that corpse and play it like a puppet?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to move it I only burned it. You really don\u2019t get it? Think outside the science and medical fields. What disease is contracted with a bite and turns the dead back to life?\u201d You asked in a heightened state as it began to register to them. \u201cNow you get it. Unless  you have all the victims here now this will get really bad really quick. My knowledge knows it as the Living Dead Virus. My kind and other dragons on my world stopped it by wiping out all life in the area no matter how small or kind. But in a population in this planet\u2019s size it is impossible to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right. You mean to tell me that we are dealing with Zombies?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the best description yes. It gets worse than that. While dragons are one of the few that can\u2019t contract it no matter what, we can\u2019t do anything to heal someone once infected. Now enough questions, you need to get everyone in my vault now and I will be there to put them in the main chamber as I clear them. If they aren\u2019t cleared then we\u2019ll put them in holding cells for their loved ones to say goodbye but you have to act fast. Call everyone back, now!\u201d you explained and demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a little hard to believe.\u201d Doctor Robinson said as Grissom went to do as you asked and you teleported him to your first room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do magic and am a 500 foot tall dragon and you want to argue on what is real? Look, I need your help in this so I\u2019m going to give you my eyes for the rest of the day. When people come in, put the ones that have a bite or specifically the virus over there and those that don\u2019t on the opposite side of the room. I need to go and get people to further help. Hopefully we\u2019re not too late.\u201d You requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I get it. What about my family?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse your phone and tell them to meet you here. Once we get things going we\u2019ll be able to store people in my safe area here, surrounded by a few foot thick titanium walls and floor. I can\u2019t go flying in search mode until later when they are too focused elsewhere to try and shoot down the giant dragon.\u201d You answered and he nodded as you dashed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg, you get the text?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo joke, go to my place and take as many people as you can and help out Doctor Robinson once you get there. I gave him my eyes so he can see clearly.\u201d You stated which got him to become in shock. \u201cGreg! Not time for being shocked. We just found this out when a corpse in the morgue came back to life from a bite and the virus. You need to get going now. You can be shocked later when we are safe. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreg! Understand?\u201d you said as you splashed water in his face to snap him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, yes go and do your thing\u201d he stated to which you nodded and vanished from his view to go get and warn more people.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We are swamped as you can see.\u201d He said with his hands gesturing to the people around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, now.\u201d You insisted and pulled him into his office then shut the door. \u201cThey\u2019re Zombies.\u201d You said, pointing to a person trying to bread their way into his office but not getting very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, are you playing some kind of joke?\u201d Brass asked in an irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does everyone ask me that? No I\u2019m not. To be fair they aren\u2019t Zombies but they are close enough, otherwise known as the Living Dead that spread their disease via biting their victims and trying to eat them.\u201d you asked back to a very shocked man. You smacked him in the face to wake him up \u201cHey, no time for that. I am gathering everyone I can think of to my place but I have to get back there.

I simply don\u2019t have the time to go get random people that would just start panicking and kill a few people once inside. After you I\u2019ll close the doors and take trips out the roof to get people. You need to get as many people as you can and don\u2019t worry about supplies, I got enough to last years.\u201d You stated as you pointed to the men still trying to contain the \u2018zombies\u2019. \u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone that is bitten but you can save a few of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, this is going to be hard.\u201d He stated then when out with you and shot every zombie in the room, making the officers inside look to him in confusion. He reloaded his gun to the silent rrom as the came around him for an explanation. \u201cListen up everyone, this isn\u2019t going to be easy to say or believe but, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m ordering you to believe me as this is not a joke. We are dealing with, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, Zombies. Yes they are and no this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this because he sais so?\u201d asked one of the officers that were bitten and also had a grudge against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is, seeming as you are bitten you may not join those that aren\u2019t in coming with me. But just for you I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d You said then used a bit of magic, that got them all to look on in awe to bring a new zombie that an officer just brought in to the center of the room. You then grabbed a pistol and shot the person in the heart and chest a few times. They all raised their guns to you as you did this but hesitantly looked over once the obviously dead person got back on her feet, foaming at the mouth and going toward one of the officers. He unloaded his gun on her but she didn\u2019t go down. You got in front of the thing and pushed the barrel of a shotgun in her mouth then lifted so she was almost impaled by the weapon but still fighting to get at you as she swung in the air. \u201cAny other questions or would one of you like to let this fine young lady infect you as well as you escort her to a holding cell?\u201d You asked. Some dumbly shook their heads and when you knew they all got the idea you blasted the woman off the end, her head almost blowing completely off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, show\u2019s over. As you might have noticed. Our touchy friend here is not normal but that can wait in explanation after we are safe. Everyone that hasn\u2019t been infected will come with us. The rest of you see to your families and get them safe before you turn. Let\u2019s go people, move.\u201d Brass commanded as they all started moving and they separated into 2 groups of bitten people and not bit people. Only one officer tried to hide among the uninfected and that was the hostile one from before. \u201cOfficer Rale, Max said you were bitten, go join that half so you can help those that haven\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho says I\u2019m infected, him? I can\u2019t stay out here. I\u2019m not infected! I deserve to\u2026\u201d He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026die.\u201d You finished for him and shot him through the heart, again to prove your point and counted down with one hand from 5 seconds pointed as the dead officer got back up to which you shot him in the head to finish it. \u201cI don\u2019t make mistakes and I can\u2019t entertain such idiocy at the moment. You all need to go save your families and take out as many as you can. But on your last bullet I would recommend using it on yourself to prevent you turning your own family. Get the survivors safe and visible so I can find them later. I\u2019ll be back for them as I fly over.\u201d You instructed. They all went the opposite way then you turned to those that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about our families?\u201d asked one of the officers that was in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all have phones for now so once you get to safety you can call them and get them to secure themselves. I\u2019ll go get them if I can but dying yourself isn\u2019t going to help them any more than advising them now. Everyone put a hand on someone next to you.\u201d you answered and commanded and when they all were connected you teleported them all to the room where everyone else was. You almost fell over to which you were caught by Brass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeleporting that many people is no picnic.\u201d You said as you pulled the people that were still in the area inside the door then closed it. \u201cDoc Robinson and the others have my eyes and are sorting out the infected and putting them off to the side. Give them a hand while I get some rest.\u201d You said and using a last bit of effort you imparted your eyes to him like the others you had trusted with it then passed out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood you\u2019re awake.\u201d Grissom stated as you woke up and sat on the coach they put you on. The room was loud and chaotic with so many people in it. It took a bit to comprehend his words and address him that you were ready for whatever he had for you. \u201cWe separated the infected from the others but, as you can expect, some don\u2019t want to admit it on either side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well I have to get something to eat anyway so\u2026 I guess I can deal with this.\u201d you stated then got up to which they all became quiet and those that you knew came forward. You went over to the vault door that led into the rest of the complex and opened it. \u201cCome with me please, keep the infected separate.\u201d You stated then the crowd did as requested. It was unclear why but they were all listening to you. Maybe because you were responsible for saving them. They were separated into the two groups with a little apprehension but followed what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Max, I\u2019m agent Smith from the FBI.\u201d Stated a man in a suit that led a few others. You nursed a headache before turning to him and shaking his hand. \u201cThis is some place you have here. From what I see here, you could start a small war from this place.\u201d he finished as he looked around and saw the assortment of military grade vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, but right now I should concentrate on the task at hand. I need to get these infected out or here and go look for more people. I promised that I would go get the families of those in here if they were still clean and I intend to do so. If you are looking to help then please keep them calm for the time being.\u201d You requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, go get them? We can\u2019t have someone open the doors just to do that. What we need is to establish a chain of command so we can unify and get some help.\u201d He argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is easy. My house, my stuff, my rules and there is one door that won\u2019t let any of them in.\u201d you stated and brought up a display then opened the ceiling. \u201cIf you want to leave you may, I can take you anywhere after I secure things here and secure those I can still save now stand back please.\u201d You said then walked to an open spot away from them. Agent Smith was about to follow you but Brass whispered something in his ear to which he stopped. With that you used your transformation Jutsu and went to Dragon form, blowing away the spoke and shaking your head to get the remaining cobwebs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone calm down.\u201d Called Brass as the others approached you. \u201cHe\u2019s on our side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou good?\u201d asked Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, little hungry but otherwise just peachy.\u201d You answered then rose your head. \u201cHello everyone, I am Max and yes I am a Dragon, no I am not going to eat you, and yes I will go get what is left of your families. You are protected in these walls and safe for the time being. Anyone that would like to challenge me for this place please do so now or accept it.\u201d After that the people got a better attitude and even the FBI agents back down from any argument of who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Max, do you mind giving me a lift?\u201d asked Grissom to which you lowered your head then raised it when he was on it. \u201cOk, if you still have family out within the city that you called and are still in contact with then make a line so he can take your requests one at a time. But we should deal with the infected problem among us first. I\u2019m sorry for this but we can\u2019t have those that are infected inside the walls. We all discussed it and you will each have 3 options; First is you can be let out and do what you can while you can before you turn. Second is we can end it for you now, either by feeding our friend here or whatever way you wish to go. Third is you can panic and resist to which you will have no choice in the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you wouldn\u2019t eat us?\u201d asked a woman in the infected group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t if you don\u2019t want me to. Honestly I would rather not but I can\u2019t get infected and I need energy to save people and get you all food and stuff. So I can eat infected people, alive or dead, as a substitute. I can just as easily get a few on my way to save other people but if you wish to go out that way I\u2019ll allow it.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to fear from him. He has saved everyone in this room so you at least own him some time to prove himself.\u201d Brass said as you let Grissom off and lay behind them but looked over the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut for now we need to split into 5 groups. For those that are infected you need to pick one of the two options. He will take in any requests to search while he searches for others. For those that aren\u2019t infected you need to get in a line of people who are in contact with living people waiting to be rescued and those that aren\u2019t but would like him to check points as he is flying over. Everyone one else help out those that need it and above all, everyone needs to stay calm. We all are in this together and need all the support we can get.\u201d Cahterine Willows called out to which they all started moving, all very wary of the large dragon looking over them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOk Max we\u2019re ready for you.\u201d Catherine stated as the infected was more or less separated into two groups. One on the right were looking at you in an apprehensive way while the others were slightly or mildly depressed. \u201cThis group has opted to feed you while this one would like to be sent outside with some kind of weapon to fight and take down as many as they can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Brass, can you take those to the weapon vault and have them pick a weapon of their choosing? Don\u2019t worry about ammo or anything, I have extras of all that are available so they can pick whatever they want and give them a back up to do themselves when the time comes.\u201d You asked and he led the group out as Grissom turned the living group away from the scene as you turned to the group. \u201c I am both honored and sorry for this. If any of you decide to change your mind I understand but I\u2019ll make it as quick and painless as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you just do it before we lose our nerve?\u201d asked a woman you knew from the front desk to which you looked at her then away with a sigh then back at them. There were about 25 of them total, while the other 50 went with the other group and were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, please close your eyes.\u201d You requested and they did so, well all but a few. Before you could second guess yourself you started. You used your tongue and teeth to scoop them up and swallow before they could react. You could hear screams as you swallowed but no one else could. You did this in three stages as you got a mouth full then gulped them down. You increased your digestive system so they were almost immediately digested as they hit your stomach. You closed your eyes for a little bit and allowed a few tears to drip down as you heard the last of their screams and cries. There was no pain, as you promised, but the sudden action had brought up the terror they were so desperately hiding up to that point. It felt a little better when it was all done and your power was back up to full. For the sake of the others you didn\u2019t chew them so your mouth was empty of blood or body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 you\u2019re crying?\u201d Sara asked, bringing your attention back to them. With that all done the rest had returned and the others were turned to address their concerns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 sorry\u2026 I just don\u2019t like eating people that are still alive. Makes me feel like a mass murderer or at least a heartless beast, like the others I hate so much.\u201d You explained as you wiped the tears away then shook the idea out of you mind and settling on the other infected. Some looked slightly comical with the large weapons they had while others looked like they knew what they were doing. \u201cNow for this group. Just think about where you want to go and I\u2019ll send you there\u2026 as long as it is within the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Warrick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they power the other people gave me allows me to do it. It is still a drain but I owe them that much at least.\u201d You responded then waited for each of them to get a spot then teleported them out and finally the infected were out and you could concentrate on the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just say that you are like the coolest person I\u2019ve ever met?\u201d Greg said with a smile that, at first, no one followed. But seeing as it improved your slightly down mood they joined in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Greg, you think you can find some light music to lighten things up around here?\u201d you asked as you brought up a display near him and he smiled then got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the record Max. We don\u2019t think of you as a monster or a heartless beast.\u201d Grissom stated to which you smiled a little and nuzzled him as well before be gave you a pat then you all addressed the other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now\u2026\u201d you started then brought up an interactive display of the city at the their level and between you and the people but slightly off to the side so you could see them and the display from your end. \u201cOne at a time, point out the location of places you want me to check for uninfected. As I am out and passing over I will pick them up if I can and bring them back here. Don\u2019t be pushy as I won\u2019t be leaving until everyone has pointed out where they would like me to search. You don\u2019t have to explain, I\u2019ll pick up any that are uninfected in the areas and this is time sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAmazing how quickly this has all happened.\u201d Grissom stated as you flew above the city on your way back from another pass. You had gathered all the people from the places they said but not as many as you hoped you\u2019d get. Most people were either too stupid or smart to think that they could get infected, making the uninfected search not as successful as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it been, 4 days?\u201d you asked back to him as he was held on your back with some passengers you recently picked up with spikes. You also had a bus and van full of people being held by your front claws. The people had all stopped screaming after a while and just whimpered while comforting each other. Grissom did his best to calm the ones he could reach so they just silently observed the interaction between the dragon that saved them and the human on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that yes. You getting tired yet? You have been searching and collecting for the better part of 3 days without sleep and I can\u2019t believe that missile was as small as you made it out to be.\u201d Grissom asked. When you first started flying around there was a military gunship that pursued you until it saw what you were doing and you\u2026convinced the pilot to stop shooting at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI healed just fine and I have no shortage of food, as bad as the walking dead are they do provide more than enough energy to keep going. Although I could use a nap now that my sweep is more or less done.\u201d You agreed but then saw something. \u201cAh that\u2019s just great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Grissom asked to which you soared at an angle so he could see. \u201cLooks like a tour bus for one of those pro wrestling tours that were in town last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and full with clean people but I don\u2019t have any open spots to carry them.\u201d You stated to which Grissom understood you comment and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHate to say it but you got one more.\u201d He returned to which you glanced back at him and he pointed to his mouth as and teeth to replicate and communicate that your jaws would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, last time I captured a car in my mouth I impaled the driver on a tooth. Not to mention that it is a bus and a lot heavier than a car, especially filled with people.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the only spot left. If we don\u2019t help them then they will probably all die. If you accidentally kill or injure some then at least most of them live. You know it is the only choice, besides we are almost back to your place anyway.\u201d Grissom combated as the people both under and over were listening to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but you got people duty when we get back.\u201d You said as you descended toward the speeding bus as it was barreling through infected people but running out of room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you closed the distance the driver must\u2019ve saw you or someone through the windows because they made a sudden turn in the opposite direction that you were traveling. You adjusted as the course they were going ended in a demolished bridge. You sped quicker and as the bus attempted to jump the gap you caught the middle in your jaws then took off with the heavy load. You were immediately bombarded with screams and cries as you sank your teeth into the metal and glass of the bus to secure it as you flew with your head dragging to the building. You snarled a little as you felt sharp objects being rammed into the relatively softer tissue inside your mouth. The worst one was when they used something electrical and plunged it in the space that anchored you tooth to your gums. You almost dropped the bus a few times as it was hard enough to hold the couple ton metal box as you flew and it didn\u2019t get any easier with people trying to get you to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, almost there.\u201d Grissom comforted after hearing an angry and annoyed snarl from you. Finally you landed and dropped the bus rather unceremoniously the last few feet and spit out some blood and tools that were used to cause multiple small wounds in your mouth that quickly disappeared. You were more gentle with the other two you held then laid to let the 50 or so people off your back along with Grissom as you got into your normal spot on the floor. Most of them were more than happy to get off while Grissom had grown to love flying with you, better than a roller coaster he would said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the people were away you shook your head and growled a little as you moved to pull out the few tools still imbedded in your gums and tongue. Some of the people winced as you spat out things that looked nasty to be stabbed with, even for you as evidence to the blood on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch, that has to hurt.\u201d Greg stated and noticed that you still not done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need some help?\u201d Sara asked to which you looked down at her as you still were growling a little at the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please, one of them lodged something in between a tooth and the gums that has an electric charge to it, feels like a cattle prod or something.\u201d You stated then opened up your jaws and put the area right next to her. You waited as you felt her hands on your gums then the pain went away as she pulled the impending tool out as to which you closed your trap and looked at it as it sparked. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, just as long as I stay on this side of your teeth I can pull out a few annoyances.\u201d She joked back and you chuckled a little then looked at the almost panicking people coming out of the destroyed tour bus. \u201cLooks like you really freaked them out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Max, but I can see why.\u201d Nick stated and you just nodded a no kidding but Greg had a confused face. \u201cThey were running from zombies and a giant, unknown, legendary, and mythical being buries his teeth in their little hope and security. Again, no offense, but being in a dragon\u2019s mouth in any situation is frightening. In their already panicked one it must\u2019ve been beyond that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t impale anyone this time.\u201d You stated as you got into a more comfortable position and watched as Grissom, along with others, calmed and explained things. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d You joked as they saw it to and laughed. They all had to do panic control at one point or another and could only laugh as the usually nonsocial Grissom attempted it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hey Max are you done yet?\u201d asked Catherine as you concentrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became very evident that the power and water would be turned off eventually. It was also obvious that sleeping in the open of the large area would also be a problem, especially if you kept bringing people there. So you started on a project to make a bunker like living area for everyone. You started with an elevator that went down a very long way. Then from there you began materializing each floor and of course extended the 100 foot thick titanium barrier around the entire thing. You didn\u2019t need some tunneling zombie or idiot getting through and causing problems. You also were lucky enough to find a water line deep underground so you set up a hydro plant and water storage system to generate your own independent water and power, not enough to light up a city but pretty close and more than enough to power your whole compound even under liberal power spending. You put this part at an isolate spot so no one could get control over it, well except you of course. The rest were sub basement levels. The rooms were like a studio apartment size. Not to small but large enough to be a bedroom/personal space for each person. You of course had security systems around the place for multiple problems that could arise, chief among them to make sure NO infectious materials. You didn\u2019t need to study it and you convinced Grissom as much\u2026 although you didn\u2019t have to convince him that much. He knew all he needed and asked you about anything extra. You were just making the finishing touches when Catherine approached. You were in human form as your dragon one couldn\u2019t fit in the living area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 It isn\u2019t as easy as it looks you know.\u201d You said as you took a seat on a nearby chair or rather slumped into it, visually tired from the 12 hour exertion. You were in human form but you still had your wings, tail, eyes, and some scales on your back showing. They flexed as if stretching to which you sat back before addressing the group that sat with you. Joining your close group of people was the FBI agent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is it complete?\u201d asked Agent Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, the personal rooms are the bottom 15 floors and the top two are for dining and entertainment. The water and power are separated and all the security devices are monitored by the complex and for view if I wish from anywhere I wish. The living areas will fill up and unlock the next so that people don\u2019t get lost. Each room may be a tad small but more than capable of holding 1-4 occupants with their own water and power systems including shower and toilet.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the administrative area or rooms for important people?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t make any, but you can use the holding area on the 18th floor if you wish, but then again anyone can go in and out of there as well. Basically I am the only one in charge on that level and I stay in the main area, hopefully as a dragon for as long as I can.\u201d You answered, not caring that it wasn\u2019t what he was wanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if the president comes here?\u201d he asked as he looked be pulling out his trump card in this argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he can sleep where he likes but seeing as our current arrangement was just on the floor in the main area I think this is an improvement. But I\u2019m not about to play a political game with you. In the end I am in charge of this place for 3 reasons. First is that I built it and know how to maintain it, second is I am the most capable in terms of strength to keep everyone safe, third is that all this was made in by my hand and so I am the only one that CAN manage it correctly. For instance the Power and Water deep underground is something only I can get to. So it you don\u2019t feel comfortable in the titanium surrounded haven I have made then you are more then welcome to try your luck outside it. This isn\u2019t a negotiation so stop trying to seize control.\u201d You stated rather bluntly to the flustering man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, that wasn\u2019t a very nice way to say it.\u201d Sara said as you finished, the others following the same thought pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I just got done materializing an entire sub basement for them and he wants special treatment. I guess I am just a little tired to listen to political crap. Maybe later I can have a proper argument but right now\u2026 not interested.\u201d You replied to which Agent Smith just slumped grouchily into a his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way, we should probably get things situated. Is there anything we should know? You seem a little out of it to give us a tour.\u201d Brass asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of what I put down there should be safe unless someone is being an idiot. Pushing your finger in an electrical socket is still a bad idea.\u201d You started with a joke that got them to grin a little before you continued. \u201cBeyond that, the Kitchen and other areas should be stocked for the time being. My materialized versions of things might not be as\u2026 fresh as what you\u2019re use to but they are infection free at least and better than what you would otherwise get or I have to eat. The holding area at the bottom has cells in it to hold people that cause trouble. Brass, Grissom, Warrick, Nick, Sara, Catherine, Greg, and Doctor Robinson are the only ones that can open or close them\u2026 for now. Other than that you can pick whatever rooms you like. I\u2019ll only come down if something needs my attention. But be sure they know that coming all the way back up will be heavily restricted once they are down. Don\u2019t need some little kid accidentally shooting off the tank or something like that. Besides that, you all can managed stuff down there as you see fit. Please don\u2019t make me enforce things.\u201d You answered as you were half asleep by this point. They all could see that so they didn\u2019t bother you as you fully fell asleep just before it looked like you were going to say something else. You hoped that they would be ok with it. Living their lives underground would be a large change for them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grissom insisted on being on your head so he could see around, unless you were flying of course. But his preference didn\u2019t change when you ate. But for his sake you usually didn\u2019t chew your food. Not that you wanted the decaying blood and meat stuck in your teeth anyway, or staining your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it makes you feel any better, they taste like crap. Old, rotting, and decaying meat with equally descriptive blood, yuck!\u201d you returned as you walked down a street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure the slow zombies tried to attack or follow you. But they posed no threat to you. And as long as Grissom stayed off their level he was safe as well. Even if the streets were crowded with them you could simply walk over them and trample them under your massive clawed feet. You stopped killing every single one you saw as you needed food. Besides, there was no way they were getting into your home. Sure they could force iron gates and wooden doors open but if they could really get through a couple foot thick titanium wall than you would have more problems than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be insensitive but\u2026 yeah, it does kind of make me feel better.\u201d He said than noticed you looked up at him before going back to your default search setting. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I wish you could have a decent meal for once. But I guess the less appeasing a human is to you to eat the better, for us anyway. Most of us know you wouldn\u2019t eat us, even so it helps calm the nerves a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so. Maybe I\u2019ll find a farm or something. That would be nice\u2026 provided that the animals aren\u2019t undead as well. I could really go for a fresh cow about now.\u201d You said as you licked your lips at the thought. You heard a chuckled that brought you out of your little fantasy. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just was recalling how strange this is. It\u2019s been a month and even before then. I never would\u2019ve guessed that I would be getting to ride a dragon. Never mind being this close to one\u2019s mouth without going in it. Then there is the magic thing and this whole Zombie apocalypse that we are ironically being held safe by the same dragon most are deathly afraid of. Now here we are just taking a stroll despite the hoards of undead as if it was normal. Just funny how normal all this strangeness is getting.\u201d Grissom replied. You chuckled, indicating that you understood and shared in his little attempt at humor. You also looked down at the ease you were walking through the street of undead hordes when so many were running for their lives from similar sights in other places. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you can. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to bite your head off for being curious. If I don\u2019t want to talk about something you bring up I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it feel good to be so\u2026 powerful? I mean over so many things. You are like the top\u2026 well let\u2019s just say no a lot can push you around. Another way to say it would be that you are the top of the food chain. But I know you don\u2019t like that reference. But you understand right?\u201d Grissom asked, trying mid sentence to find better ways to address it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand and yes, I suppose it does feel exhilarating at times. But not all the time. Sure I can push my weight around, literally, if I want. But when people assume I do is when I have a problem with it. It just isn\u2019t my way to do things like that. Sure I can put my foot down when I have to. But I much more prefer people like you that I can just talk with. People that let things fly and are not nervous when saying things. Of course I appreciate the respect for what I am, it is the fear and assumptions that bother me.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really like us, don\u2019t you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do. Some humans can be a little\u2026 too human I guess. But I do enjoy a human\u2019s company very much.\u201d You answered as you continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does \u2018too human\u2019 mean?\u201d Grissom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 It is hard to explain for you, as a human, to understand. Especially since it is a delicate matter.\u201d You said then stayed silent for a moment before sighing. \u201cBut I suppose you\u2019ve earned enough credit for me to just say it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may get a little, human, but I\u2019ll be as understanding as I can.\u201d Grissom offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Well let\u2019s face it. You humans are a food source to dragons, a delicacy even. Very delicious and very tempting even at a distance. But you humans also have a mind. You aren\u2019t just like an animal that can be gulped down and not be missed. But I think you humans know it and expect everyone to treat you as such, even other humans. I\u2019ve seen humans stick up their nose and expect one of the evil dragons to obey them. They\u2026 well they don\u2019t last very long. Then the other humans get mad because the dragon killed or ate the idiot human. They start hunting us, causing more death on their end, and eventually paint the dragon as the bad guy. Sure the dragon was evil but the human was just as much at fault. I mean, what idiot would do something like that? Anyway, that is what I mean when I say \u2018too human\u2019. It has much more to it than that. But I won\u2019t try to explain how a dragon\u2019s mind works. For starters it can\u2019t be explained in the human tongue.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we are like that. I half want to defend us. But you are right, we can be very\u2026 Human.\u201d Grissom stated. He was about to continue when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your conversation stops as you both hear a scream to which you freeze as you are able to tell it is coming from underneath you. You must\u2019ve not been paying attention as you were talking with Grissom. You looked down at an angle that Grissom could also see but not slide off your head. You saw a little girl not more than 8 years old bracing herself against the ground and curling up as if waiting to be crushed. A avid description from her position underneath your front claw as it was about to come down. But her scream had definitely saved her. You backed up and laid down on the street. The scream and your presence had drawn the hoard to the area so you had to act relatively fast. The Zombies would be there in a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! I\u2019m sorry little one. I wasn\u2019t watching where I stepped.\u201d You stated. Grissom saw that it was probably partly his fault as he had distracted you with such a personal question. While you took the blame he was not by any means going to rub it in or bring it up without need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away!\u201d she screamed without opening her eyes. Without a word you brought your head down which allowed Grissom to get off and go over to the little girl. He gave you a hand motion to his eyes that indicated he wanted you to cloak until he could calm her down. Seeing the thing that almost stomped her flat would not improve the situation. When you did and was invisible to her eye, and his, Grissom went over and put a gentle hand on the girl. It took her a few seconds but she opened her eyes to see a smiling Grissom looking down at her. \u201cWhere\u2019d the monster go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is hiding. He was very sorry he almost stepped on you. He\u2019s sad and didn\u2019t want you to be frightened. Can you tell me your name?\u201d Grissom asked. He usually wasn\u2019t that good at this kind of thing. But with Catherine\u2019s help, he was getting much better. Not to mention the ample amount of people he had to deal with on a daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose. My name is Rose.\u201d She whimpered then clamped onto Grissom. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you trying to eat me like the other adults?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see, the other people are really sick and died. But the sickness keeps them moving and tries to get you. But don\u2019t worry, me and my friend will keep you safe\u201d Grissom answered as he held and soothed the small child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your friend?\u201d she asked, not getting that you, the dragon that almost stepped on her, was his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is that dragon that almost stepped on you.\u201d he said but felt her quivering and getting ready to run from him so he continued. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t hurt you. He is actually a really nice dragon. He just looks scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB\u2026 but he almost stepped\u2026ed on me.\u201d She stuttered out in her crying whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and he\u2019s very sorry. He\u2019s very big so it was hard to notice you all the way down here. He\u2019s really sad that he scared you. You think you can forgive him and pet him a little?\u201d Grissom asked in a tone that even got you to feel bad for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t he a monster? A big scary monster?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s just really big and scary. But imagine what it is like for all those Zombies trying to get you. Wouldn\u2019t you like it if the big scary dragon was on your side? He would be a pretty good friend to have wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Grissom asked in an obvious but well hidden bait for little kids. She thought for a minute then nodded. \u201cOk, watch now, he is going to reappear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod from him you slowly uncloaked yourself from your jutsu. You saw her bury her head back into Grissom\u2019s chest at the sight of you. You saw Grissom comforting her then give you a look as if to tell you to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose? I\u2019m really sorry for almost stepping on you.\u201d You said and put on your best \u2018puppy dog\u2019 face. Granted your overall size and look made it hard to do but passable. You then decided to put a little joke in there. \u201cI just have really, really, REALLY big feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to help and she looked down at your \u2018big feet\u2019 then back at your face. She didn\u2019t know what to do at this point so Grissom whispered in her ear, fully aware you could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really likes it when people pet him, especially pretty girls like you.\u201d Grissom whispered. She nodded then he brought her over to your snout and wisely avoided the front but settled next to your eye and started petting your eye ridge. You blinked and purred, effectively rumbling the ground that got her nervous again. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. That is just his purr. You know, like a cat when they really like the petting they are getting or are really happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a kitty?\u201d she asked as she hid from your wondering eye by hiding behind Grissom\u2019s back. It was unclear what she would do. But there was little time. You could feel the undead hoards on your back side and, even at their slow speed, would surround the two humans on the ground in less than a minute. Finally she\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully there was a little more time since the undead seemed unable to climb your body no matter how hard they tried. So they had to go around and it took the additional time, since you were effectively blocking the street they needed to go around for a while to get to her. That is if something else didn\u2019t catch their attention. For now, you all had a little more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice dragon?\u201d she asked Grissom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he is very nice.\u201d Grissom answered as he continued to demonstrate petting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled forward with her hand out while rounding the temporary wall that was Grissom. She continued this until her hand made contact just under your eye to which you she stayed there for a little bit before rubbing. She flinched every time you blinked but eventually got use to it. She circled above to your eye ridge and got more confident as she moved around to which you nuzzled her gently then shot the end of your tongue out to lick her a little. You knew she was too young to realize you could just easily eat her. So she giggled at your soft muscle as it licked her face and she made a sudden game at fighting it back to its resting place behind your scaly lips and teeth. Grissom chuckled at this play time but soon your fun was cut short by the sound and sight of the undead coming down the only access to the street and area you all were in at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Grissom, I\u2019m scared.\u201d She said as she now noticed them coming and clung to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, remember, our friend is bigger than they are.\u201d He said as you stretched your tongue out and wrapped around them. The girl squealed at this but stopped squirming when you placed them on top of your head before retracting your soft appendage. With that done you raised your head so they were now high above the hoard of approaching undead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, we are really hi.\u201d Said the girl as she looked over the side and saw your start walking, stepping on and over the hoard as if nothing was in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore we go any further, do you have any family Rose? Max can pick them up if you want.\u201d Grissom asked. But to his question he saw a look that he had seen all too often in the last month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they all got bit and told me to run. My Daddy tried to get some other people to open up and let us in but they killed him and told me to go away.\u201d She said, almost sobbing the last part. Grissom held her close as you continued walking, this time back toward your home with you new package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was obviously more people out here that you couldn\u2019t detect from the sky. Not to mention there was an entire world out there. You wondered when other people would hear about your little safe haven and demand entry. You doubted what was left of the government had turned a blind eye to the only functional building around with bright lights on it and the dragon that was flying around. You had demolished and cleared out a large area on all sides of the now single complex. It helped to see where all the undead were coming from as well as you made all the entries to the area have barriers on it. Barriers that didn\u2019t allow the infected in. This got a few groups mad and killed for not leaving their infected loved ones but you couldn\u2019t take chances and let any in. But you did make a safe zone for them inside the barrier but outside the building so they could say goodbyes and what not or keep them safe while deciding. You also made a runway on one side so that jets could land if there were any left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to keep conscious upkeep on those barriers all the time in the form of jutsus. So you made barrier and power emitters in different areas that could hold out if anything short of a nuclear blast hit them then built a hydo power plant for just the barrier system right next to the existing one. All in all you had a pretty good system. Not flawless as the occasional hybrid got through the barrier. But that was why no one that wanted to live was outside the walls. The outside area was just for arrivals and what not. Even most of those that you brought back were done via the roof entrance. There was talk about having you dig up gas pumps to fuel the cars you brought back but in the end you didn\u2019t need it and could always materialize the gas if it really was a necessity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Rose. It is completely safe where we\u2019re going. Nobody eats anyone and I\u2019m the only dragon.\u201d You said up to her. It was as if she didn\u2019t realize that the thing carrying her could still speak, despite what she had heard before. She acted just as surprised as the first time, minus the terror of being stepped on\u2026 or almost stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I don\u2019t have to run anymore?\u201d she asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you want to play tag with the other kids.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are other kids there, that aren\u2019t like\u2026 that?\u201d she asked in equally as excited tone as she pointed at a group of undead children. For a little kid, she was surprisingly conditioned to the whole Zombie Apocalypse thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, only the living ones where we are going.\u201d Grissom chimed in and it looked like she was about to burst with excitement and anxiety until her stomach growled. She looked down at it then back up at Grissom in an embarrassed but cute face that you could picture in your head. \u201cHow about Max makes you something special while we are traveling, would you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has food to?!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, why don\u2019t you tell him what you want, just this once?\u201d he asked with a playful wink that got her imagination going. The little girl went over a little until she could see part of your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you\u2026 I mean can you get a cookie and maybe some juice?\u201d She asked. You could tell she was holding back so you looked in her mind just deep enough to see she wanted a cream filled Danish with some chocolate milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d you said that got her to look down disappointed. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ll give you this instead.\u201d You said as you materialized a cup in Grissom\u2019s hand then filled it with ice cold chocolate milk and a plate with the Danish she desired. Her eyes sparkled as she looked over the treat and was too shocked to move. Finally she took her treat and bit into it while Grissom smiled and held her cup for her as she ate. She then drank the beverage before the dishes dematerialized and she was there licking her fingers of the precious cream that had gushed out of her treat when she bit into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, nice dragon, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Grissom asked rhetorically as all the children you rescued seemed to fall in love with you like only little children could. You assumed that when they got older they would be more wary of what you were but for now you enjoyed their innocent and childish love and admiration for you. She burst into tons of question as you all made your way back to your home. Questions that were so overly asked that you could answer them on default.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMr. Max Sir!\u201d came a voice just when you were at a rare good part in a dream. Granted a good part was dedicated to a lack of substance because of your constant nightmares but even so you were actually enjoying the relative peace just as the unmistakable sound of Agent Smith\u2019s voice woke you. You drearily opened the eye closest to him and moaned an affirmative and for him to continue. \u201cAir Force One is in trouble and needs help landing, here!\u201d he exclaimed in a rare form of exertion for the self important man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAir Force One?\u201d you asked more to yourself as you thought about it. You supposed that it was a good enough reason to get up. So you felt around to make sure no one was too near then stretched and yawned sleepily but in a large way that you needed but knew frightened a high majority of people. But if you were going to get up for this man than he would just have to bear it. As you did this your tail accessed the roof and opened it. \u201cWhat is the trouble? Isn\u2019t that like the most secure plane ever made or something, thus why it holds the President?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but they\u2019ve been in the air for a few days and just made radio contact. They are almost out of fuel, not enough to land on your air strip not to mention their escorts.\u201d Reported Agent Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose this is a stupid question, but do they know who they are asking. I don\u2019t need a missile up my ass because they are \u2018surprised\u2019 to see me.\u201d You asked as you flexed your wings to get the sleepiness out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do, now please help them. They didn\u2019t have much time when they called and that was 10 minutes ago. The will probably risk a crash landing before long.\u201d Answered Agent Smith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, go and tell them I\u2019m coming and get all the others up that need to be notified; Grissom and all them. Might as well get Doc Robinson and some of the doctors on standby. One more thing. Make sure they know that if any are bitten I can\u2019t let them inside. Even if it is the President.\u201d You replied. He looked at you as you said that last part with a face that betrayed his hostile feelings of what you just said. \u201cGo, not point getting mad if it won\u2019t be a problem. Even so, report the message so they don\u2019t panic and all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done and Agent Smith running along the door finally opened all the way and you shot from your spot into the air. It didn\u2019t take you long to reach a normal plane\u2019s altitude but it wasn\u2019t there. You then saw they were lower and went to their level as they lined their jet up with your newly made runway. It was massive, even by your standards. I would take a considerable amount of effort to life and guide down safely. You would no doubt have to use chakra, and wind style jutsus to help as well as all your draconic might. But that wasn\u2019t your only issue. First you had to get them to turn off their engines\u2026 and not shoot at you. So you flew up to the rear escorts and lined your head up with one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you.\u201d You called as the pilot looked at you and banked to get away but you held his jet with a front claw as you soared. \u201cHey, I\u2019m here to help that big boy land so relax. I need to approach without receiving a missile up my ass. Can you refrain from shooting for a few minutes please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou the dragon they said is coming?\u201d asked the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many dragons do you know?\u201d you asked sarcastically. \u201cNever mind, just let your buddy know and the pilot of that big guy that I\u2019m coming to talk with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou received a hesitant nod and waited till he did his calling before you let go of him and made your approach. You did likewise as you soared so the Pilot could see you out his window while the other windows were filled with gawking faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou the dragon?\u201d asked the Pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does everyone ask that? Like there are so many dragons around here.\u201d You stated with a clear annoyance in your voice then calmed down. \u201cOk, I\u2019m going to grab a hold then I need you to shut the engines off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re kidding right?\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is going to be hard enough to land this sucker without your engines burning the crap out of my wings or working against me. I would just materialize fuel for you but we don\u2019t have the time and I don\u2019t know how to make this type of jet fuel yet, not to mention I wouldn\u2019t know where the gas tank on this thing is. So just do it. Heck, you were going to crash land anyway right?\u201d you reasoned. There was a few shouting matches before the Pilot nodded to you. You then positioned yourself above and grabbed the thing. With that done you waited for them to get closer before you took over. \u201cNow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the Pilot did as you requested just in time for your wings to spread and not be burned but the engines. You felt the strain you were waiting for as you used all the tricks you could to keep the thing gently moving down. You had your new air dragon jutsu times 10 under it and a half dozen others along with your own strength as you pulled and steered it until you were right about a fitting parking spot within the barrier but not within reach of the building so you could separate them. It was also off to the side of the runway so the escorts could land without dodging the huge thing. When all was said and done you got off the metal tube so it didn\u2019t crush under your weight. But you more than were happy to feel the ground beneath your feet as you slumped into a halfway decent sitting position between the parking and emptying aircrafts. You let your head rest on the ground as you panted from your sudden exertion. You relaxed for a bit as they collected themselves and came over to you. Not that they had much choice.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As such I also have both real and fake characters in the story living out fictional lives. It by no means describes what I think of them. In regards to the President the one I use is not a real person in relation to the real world. But it doesn\u2019t reflect the respect I have for the office and those under him in reality. Just wanted to make sure I was clear on that before someone thinks that I am radical in political views or bashing someone in response to something or to my political views. This is FICTION so treat it as such. That being said thanks for your patience and read on.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting heavily until they were about halfway to you and by the time they were in speaking range you had settled but was still laboring under the previous strain. Your wings would stretch and muscles would as well, flexing your claws into the ground in deep trenches before relaxing than doing so again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe thank you for your hard work in keeping us safe on behalf of the United States of America.\u201d Said a suited man. Judging by the way he was treated you assumed he was the President. You never really paid attention before about politics. Sure you understood it but the few years you were in this world didn\u2019t strive the importance of learning names and faces of the countries\u2019 leaders, especially if you were planning on leaving anyway. But you now had an obligation to stay, for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am honored to have the President give me such high esteem and praise. I apologize but I am a little out of the loop on names and faces.\u201d You said as you unofficially asked for his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can\u2019t fault you on that.\u201d Said the man. You could tell that the others were ready to draw their weapons if you made even the slightest false move. \u201cI am Henry Olson, President of the United States of America. May I be so bold as to ask your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonor to meet you sir. My name is Max. I never really had a last name until I came here but if you must have one that Drake is one I placed on official records. I assume I don\u2019t have to say why.\u201d You joked as you flexed your wings again then pinned them closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that we have introduced ourselves, may we enter your fine\u2026 home?\u201d he asked. You took a moment to look over the crowd before answering. It was faint but there was a few that were infected and a few on the plain that had yet to rise. When they did the barrier would incinerate them but you couldn\u2019t let them inside with those people among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith respect Sir, I can\u2019t let any that are infected inside. No matter who it is. It is one of very few ground rules of this place that keeps it safe. No infected people, no testing even to make a cure, the barrier itself will incinerate any walking corpses inside with the exception of hybrids, which the thick titanium wall keeps out.\u201d You explained with a bow of your head at first but got more serious when vocalizing your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are none. We checked.\u201d Mr. Olson stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen either they are lying to you or the ones that are infected are trying to sneak in on their own accord. But either way my eyes and dragon senses can instantly see who is infected and who is not. There are 10 people in your group that are infected and I believe a few scientists carrying some infected tissue samples. With your permission I can root them out. I can tell you aren\u2019t infected so I can let you in. Or you can stay while I deal with the others then all go in at once.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I would like to stay until things are settled. I would like to see those who thought it was ok to bring such things onto my plane and deceive me. Will we need to surrender our weapons when we go inside?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can do as you wish with them. But there are a few rules. Just common stuff really. No murdering. Don\u2019t bully others with them. No rebellions. Trying to kill me or overthrow me. Stuff like that. I can read minds if I need to so I can tell when someone is lying. But as a sign of respect I won\u2019t read yours unless the situation demands it.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is awful thoughtful of you. Now we should get on with this. I\u2019m not too keen on being out here in the open.\u201d President Olson stated to which you nodded and looked over the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll take the nice approach then the mean one if I need to. Will all the infected people and samples, including parts of the original virus, go over in that red box please?\u201d You more directed then asked. One by one a few of the infected walked over and stood where you asked them to. The President was surprised that his personal assistant was one of them as she walked over. \u201cThank you for your cooperation. The box is surrounded by a barrier so you can\u2019t get out or touch anyone on the outside but we can touch you if needed. But we still have a few that think they can escape my gaze. Those will go in this other red box barrier. Just so they don\u2019t cause any unpleasantness to those that came forward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Drake, I don\u2019t think you have the right to tell us what to do.\u201d Said a white haired man as he stepped out of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you would be?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRichard Barkly, Vice President of the United States.\u201d The man said with his nose in the air, that posture was really starting to piss you off. But you could see why he was acting like that. He was infected and obviously didn\u2019t want to lose a position he had worked hard for. That and he looked a decent bit power hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell being one of the infected you must want to stay alive until a cure is found. Let me tell you something. I have over 6,000 years of information in this head of mine. A genetic knowledge passed down. I can cure cancer, heart failure, broken or severed body parts. But there has never been a cure for this disease. Long ago, on my world, we only could wipe out every living thing and start the population over to get rid of it. So don\u2019t expect me to allow your selfishness to influence my decision.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But just for the sake of argument I\u2019ll play nice.\u201d You said then thought about it. \u201cOk, go in the circle. It is designed to keep infected people that are still alive in so they can speak with their loved ones but not accidentally infect them. But uninfected people can walk in and out at their leisure. So walk in then out. If you can than I will admit I am wrong and you are clean. If not or you refuse than it is proof that you are infected.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything you tell me to do. I am the Vice\u2026\u201d he started to which you growled at him and cut him short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was woken from my sleep to save your ungrateful butt. I carried the whole plain and brought it down safely. As you can imagine I am quite tired from all that, not to mention I haven\u2019t got more than 9 hours of sleep the last few days. Suffice to say, you are wearing on my limited patience.\u201d You almost growled more so at him but also in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRichard, do as our large friend says.\u201d President Olson stated. Being the only society ridded person that could order him around he reluctantly went into the empty circle then tried to come out but was stopped by the barrier. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry but are you sure he is infected?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not control the barrier in those spots. I am sure but even if I wasn\u2019t, the barrier senses it as well and doesn\u2019t allow him to come out while the infection is present in his system. You can walk in the other red circles if you want to test that an uninfected person like you could come and go.\u201d You suggested. You could tell he was doing so just for the sake of the others. He walked in one of them then back out. Just to be sure he walked in the one the Vice President was in then walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry my friend.\u201d President Olson stated as he looked at him then back at you. \u201cWill you kill him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to give those that came forward an option to go out fighting, quick death, or being eaten. I would\u2019ve just tossed the others out as carelessly as they had thought of the others. A single person inside could kill the thousands that are safe inside. I am not too happy with people that think they can play with that many lives. But I can leave him alive or end it quickly as a favor to you.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any others?\u201d asked President Olson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the samples those two scientists are holding.\u201d You stated as the two in question flinched as they were pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey hold the key to my salvation. If they can synthesize a cure than\u2026\u201d Barkly stated but again was silenced by a growl from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it before. I will allow NO infectious things inside. I don\u2019t care if you do have a \u2018possible cure\u2019. Like I said, you are wanting me go against a couple thousand years of wisdom on the chance you MIGHT be right. No I will not risk all the lives here for that. I can fly you anywhere in the city but that stuff is not getting inside.\u201d You said, this time more bluntly and with more authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we must be able to\u2026\u201d argued one of the scientists but you snapped your attention over to them that made them be silent as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay another word about it and I\u2019ll incinerate those things on the spot. So I\u2019ll give you a choice.\u201d You said as you materialized a full commercial helicopter all fueled up off to the side and inside the Vice President\u2019s circle. \u201cThe A.I. in the Chopper will take you anywhere it has the fuel to take you then dematerialize upon your arrival. You can either put that stuff in there and come with the rest of us, or you can go with him and do your research elsewhere. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon it was off and far away but not too soon for your taste. With that done and everyone separated you used your tail to access a virtual control panel on the side of the door that you were in front of. It was more like a hangar door as it was big enough to fit you or the big Air Force One jet through its frame. The humans watched the 4 foot thick titanium door opened. They were both intimidated and happy that such a large and thick door would be protecting them. When the door was open enough the humans from inside came out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, Agent Smith at your service.\u201d Agent Smith said with a salute to the president that was received and returned so he could continue. \u201cWhere is the Vice President?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was infected. So our mutual friend let him and the scientists take a chopper out to do their research.\u201d One of the other Officers said to which Agent Smith looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim Brass, you mind taking care of the other infected? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll opt for the going out with a fight option but let me know if they choose one of the others.\u201d You said than looked over at Grissom and the others. \u201cSorry, as usual, you guys are on people duty. Don\u2019t think they want be scared out of their minds while figuring things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll handle it Max.\u201d Brass replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I could use a nap.\u201d You said as you got up shakily then went into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good to be able to trust them. You had did your best to rid the city of hybrids but they were always on the look out with really big guns. Some of the officer snipers went up top to practice or be a look out. So there was no way a Hybrid Zombie would be able to surprise you or them. This was the first time you were tired but still had a majority of your energy. So you just needed a nap. Hopefully longer than the others that you have gotten lately. You took one last look in their direction as you took a spot on the floor and curled up to sleep. Unfortunately your dreams weren\u2019t as calm as when you had been woken up. It seemed the harder you tried to have good dreams the more you had the bad ones. Either way you knew that you had regain your rest so you forced yourself to remain in the nightmares for a while then woke up when you figured you had enough rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max!\u201d came a voice as soon as you were moving and opened your eyes. You knew who it was all too well. Even if she didn\u2019t have the same feel as Sarah, Rose was still a joy to have around. She was in midair by the time you opened your eyes and landed as far up on your snout as she could. You chuckled as she climbed your snout and sat on the end of it. \u201cYou were asleep for like a whole day. The adults said I couldn\u2019t play with you until you woke up. But now you\u2019re awake now right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as awake as I\u2019m going to get. Did you have a good day so far?\u201d You asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of the boys were picking on me but other than that it was pretty good. I had a hotdog for lunch too!\u201d Rose answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear a conversation start over to your side and you glanced quickly over there to see a circle of the President, some of the high ranking people he arrived with, along with Agent Smith and Grissom. You kept playing with Rose but half listened to their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that girl scared?\u201d asked one of the men as he looked over at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe use to be. They met when he was out on patrol and almost stepped on her. But now she really has taken a shine to him.\u201d Grissom stated as they looked over at you and Rose as she jumped around and excitedly told you about her day and asked meaningless questions that children often thought of like why metal was gray and how long it took to make the door. You didn\u2019t mind as she was just a kid and, unlike most of the others with parents, she was both allowed and desired to be around and with you. That desire made her infantile questioning almost cute and acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I hear you right, that he can turn into a human?\u201d asked President Olson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed he can Sir. It appears to come with a considerable amount of pain and effort. So he stays as a dragon. Can\u2019t really blame him. If I could change to a dragon you would bet I would stay that way to, especially now days.\u201d Agent Smith replied and they seemed to all nod and put sounds of agreement out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, he could probably rid the whole city of the undead. What\u2019s stopping him?\u201d Asked another General of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is simple, he needs to eat.\u201d Grissom stated in a less demeaning way than it would otherwise sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe eats them?!\u201d asked President Olson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith respect Sir, I didn\u2019t understand for a while either.\u201d Started Agent Smith. \u201cBut there are very few abundant food sources to feed him. Most have been killed or are being used by\u2026 well us. He can survive a bite or eating them so he does. He does say they don\u2019t taste too good. That I also believe as they are decaying and I don\u2019t know of even too many animals that would eat decaying meat. He also needs energy to fight, live, and materialize things including our food. I guess eating a materialized version of pizza is better than what he eats.\u201d He finished and you felt oddly better as the man usually did nothing but question you and now he was defending you\u2026 kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should be glad he doesn\u2019t eat us instead.\u201d He said as he looked over just in time to see you catch Rose as she jumped off you snout with your tongue and pull her into your mouth, closing it behind her. \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d Grissom said calmly before any of them could panic and looked over at him and Agent Smith as they sat there as if nothing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had taken their seats again they looked over to see you open your mouth again and Rose bouncing around on your soft tongue like a extremely soft and wet bouncy house. They seemed to become more calm as they heard her cheers and laughter as you played with her. You had to admit that it was not your favorite thing to do with your mental injuries to this sort of thing, not to mention she was really tasty. But as long as she didn\u2019t go down your throat or get impaled on your teeth you were ok with it. She would be too old for this kind of thing soon enough so you just let it happen and was pleased you were making her happy. With a snap you closed your mouth again and let her play inside to her heart\u2019s content.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact his body can heal people from injuries and diseases as serious as mutilated body parts, paralysis or cancer. He has a second stomach that can enhance those healing abilities and techniques by at least 10. I admit that his mouth would be the last place I would dream of being. But for a child that has no concept of things except trusting her loved ones and friends. Being on a bed of velvety soft tissue inside her closest friend that can protect her from the Zombie threat we all fear. Can you really not see why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he what? Swallows people to heal them?\u201d President Olson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he CAN but he WON\u2019T. He has had a rather colorful and betrayed life so far. Let\u2019s just say he has his reasons for not eating innocent people. I\u2019m sure he is having a hard time with catering to Rose\u2019s wish of playing. Even if the flesh of humans is apparently a dragon delicacy. Honestly I am surprised that he chooses humans over his own kind. Instead he hates dragons and loves humans. Again, he has his reasons that I am sure will get around soon enough.\u201d Grissom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is his intentions? It looks like he could start a war from here.\u201d President Olson said as he looked behind him at the collection of military grade vehicles as well as ammunition stockpiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently all of that was just research at one point. He also wanted to be able to help in situations like this. So he researched things so he could materialize things like Ammo or the Chopper the Vice President used. I think his number one goal is just to live peacefully. But people don\u2019t make that very easy. So he thinks it wise to be well versed in as many areas as he can. The way it is, a thousand or so people depend on him. He provides shelter, food, water, power, training, Safety, and many other things. All he asked in return is for us to give him a chance if a trust issue ever comes up.\u201d Grissom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he also is in command here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked a suited man next to the General that spoke earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But is what he asks really that hard. He has yet to command us to do anything. He always asks and if we can\u2019t than he does it himself. The only things he doesn\u2019t budge on is safety. There has only been one instance of murder here. He was quick to find the person and place him out in a remote but relatively safe section of the city. Instead of starving or stomaching the slop others are probably having around the world. He can materialize real food for us. We don\u2019t go wanting and he isn\u2019t exactly charging us rent or anything. He just wants us to live happily with each other. Anything that threatens that can make him a little\u2026 feral or angry I guess.\u201d Grissom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all looked over as you put Rose on the ground, dried her off from her playing, and sent her along with a woman that was in a teacher\u2019s uniform. The teacher was understandably nervous but Rose was giggling and waving goodbye to which you waved back with your tail, which got her to laugh. Now that she was gone and out of the way you could stretch and yawn out the rest of your kinks. You were a little sore from the whole lifting their Jet but other than that well rested. With that done you walked over to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, I hope you all slept well.\u201d You greeted with more of an upbeat attitude than they saw the night previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough, your set up here is very impressive.\u201d Said President Olson. He obviously didn\u2019t realize you could hear the whole conversation. But it looked like Grissom understood and just nodded that he too had slept well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrissom, did Captain Brass send the others on their way?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they left once he brought them some weapons to use. You might want to restock soon. He said a few of the more popular guns and ammo are running low.\u201d Grissom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll remember that. For now I think I\u2019ll be off to make my rounds and get some breakfast.\u201d You replied back then looked over to the whole group rather than just him. \u201cMake yourselves at home and don\u2019t be shy about grabbing what you need, baring stealing from others. We have plenty and I can always make more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe thank you for your hospitality Mr. Dragon.\u201d Responded one of the Generals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, it\u2019s just \u2018Max\u2019. Saying \u2018Mr.\u2019 just makes me feel old.\u201d You joked then walked toward and open space over the roof door that was opening. You knew they were watching as the morning light came in and you spread your wings before taking off once again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so overbearing that you had to dial back your senses so not to pass out. Although, despite the loud noises, you were glad that once again you woke to the sun nourishing you. You heard a beep in the room then snapped to the sound, finding a small device that you looked to. You examined it for a while and determined that it was some kind of advanced security device. It was also obvious to you that you had just appeared in a realm that was full of relatively advanced technology but also, you could feel great power that rivaled yours, not surpassed but rivaled. You couldn\u2019t located the feeling but it was definitely there. You hit a button on the side of the bed by mistake and found that it rose the back so you could sit relaxed and upright. It was then that the door opened and a very proud looking person came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you finally awake.\u201d Said the man as he closed the door which was followed by the surveillance device beeping again then, with you enhanced vision, you saw it lose power. The man was wearing a very nice suit made of silk, had brown hair, blue eyes, and a powerful feeling coming not from him but his case that he carried. It was as if something in the case was watching you but not directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? Where am I?\u201d you asked in rapid succession. For some reason he seemed offended that you didn\u2019t know who he was but then he looked past you at something. You followed his gaze to see your tail twitching beside you. You quickly retracted it but you guessed it was too as anyone that saw you or heard would know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a confession that you\u2019re not from around here. You plunged through my building and into my office half dead. You\u2019re currently in a private hospital because of your\u2026 tail. As for who I am, I am Seto Kiaba CEO of KibaCorp and the number one duelist in the world.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuelist? That means you fight other people in a ring or something?\u201d you asked then looked his body over. \u201cNo offense but you don\u2019t look like the physical combat type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of duel monsters?\u201d Kiaba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean beasts you force to fight each other, like dogs or something?\u201d you asked back, trying to gauge the man you were dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No, duel monsters is a card game.\u201d He stated then went on to describe the basis and background of what it was about. Some of the things he mentioned were obviously fabricated but in general you got the general idea, especially when he showed you a few cards. You immediately sensed the living\u2026 soul was the best term but not really. More like a compliant and illusion based transportation jutsu but utilizing magic instead. Each card had an original where the \u2018soul\u2019 or the monster resided then copies of it where it could also be used but on a much less\u2026 direct manner. However, on the surface they were just cards in a childish game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Amusing little game, might actually be some fun. Is that really all this realm has to offer?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRealm? Where are you from?\u201d he asked and based on his explanation you decided to try to explain some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically a different world or version of earth that is, apparently, very different from this one. The realm(s) I come from are still using knives and swords to settle our differences, that and dragons, giant animals, and other things that honestly put these things to shame.\u201d You said as you handed him back a card of a dragon type monster. \u201cI mean, have you actually ever seen a real dragon before? Not on the councils things you created, but one that could just as easy eat you than have a conversation with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have, Slifer the Sky dragon, Winged Dragon of Ra, and Blue Eyes White dragon to name a few.\u201d He stated as he said the last one it was obvious which he preferred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re still alive, that either means that they are relatively loyal, weak enough not to attempt an attack, or just didn\u2019t care to take a chunk out of you. Never really heard of them before but the way you said it means that they have some kind of loyalty but also favor. Doubt you had an actual conversation with one of them but\u2026\u201d you stated back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have spoke with dragons?\u201d he asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have. Although I mostly slay and eat them but I do have one that I\u2019m on good terms with. That and I am a dragon so I know a little more about that topic than you would.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh\u2026\u201d he started but left a pause for you to fill in you name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d You introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you\u2026 a dragon, do you take me for a fool?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you already saw my tail. But to be more accurate I am a half-breed. I can go from 100% human to 100% dragon as well as grow dragon parts and not lose any abilities as human or dragon.\u201d You said and to make your point more accurate you grew your tail again, along with wings, eyes, and some skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok, I get it.\u201d He said to which you retracted your dragon parts. \u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After your little conversation with Kiaba, he brought you to his lab then showed you a \u2018duel disk\u2019. With his permission you made one of your own. It was retractable so that it appeared to be a titanium wrist band on your left arm. You could activate it and it sprang out with a more sickle like or long axe blade shaped design with a razor sharp edge so it was not only for dueling but could be used as a deadly weapon. He inspected it and made sure its programming was correct. While doing this you got a crash course in modern, to them, technology so you could function in the world. But when it came down to picking a deck you were at a loss. He knew you had to get schooling so he enrolled you into the school that he started for teaching students how to duel as well as the other classes. But you had asked about specialized cards for you, dragons being the main focus. He knew a lot but when you asked if your dragon form could be a card he was at a loss. So he, reluctantly, escorted you to a man named \u2018Maximillion Pegasus\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello young man, I was briefed by Kiaba boy here about your unusual request. You want to be made into a card and have a specialized deck, yes?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct. How much do you know?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything, Kiaba boy has been nice enough to share the video conversations so you don\u2019t have to repeat you most magnificent story. I also know that you wish to remain a secret. I\u2019ve never actually made a card from a monster that is physically in front of me, and both willing and able to tell me what it\u2019s capable of.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of this nonsense. I came here to get him started and to finally see him as a dragon. Let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d Kiaba said, probably sick and tired of being called \u2018Kaiba boy\u2019 by Pegasus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of anxious to fly around a bit. It\u2019s good to know that I don\u2019t have to worry about people overreacting to it in small and distant doses, since they see your holographic monsters all the time.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then. I gave my entire staff off then went over to this private island by my lonesome for this. You can change when you wish.\u201d Pegasus stated the Kiaba looked at you as if to tell you to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need more room.\u201d You said then was led out to a large and open area that looked to be prepared for you to pose and plenty of room on the side for you to land, stretch out, take off, and anything else you needed. You formed wings and a tail then took to the sky like a bullet to their surprise. But they fell over when you exploded and turned into a dragon, larger and more fearsome looking than they had been expecting. You decided to push them a little and let out a deafening roar that you know was loud enough to reach the cities that were miles away. You soared for a while then came down and landed in the open area in front of them, flexing your wings before slowly walking over to them then laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2026 can you still talk?\u201d Pegasus stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as I have said, I lose none of my abilities of one form when going to the other. It was because of this that I am known as a dragon ninja.\u201d You said down to him as he looked your body over and Kiaba was recycling his pride and stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re bigger than the Egyptian gods!\u201d Kiaba exclaimed as he looked at your body in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, I already told you that Dark Hunters are at the top of the dragon tower. Sure we may not be as long as the sky dragons by our size is nothing to snuff at, and it is one of the smallest considerations when judging our level of potential danger. I can do magic, ninja techniques, normal dragon skills, and a host of other things that even I am not aware of that my genetic memory tells me about.\u201d You responded and the info intrigued Pegasus more than a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, can I get started please?\u201d asked Pegasus as he attached some kind of digital art brush system to his head and body to begin designing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of course Mr. Pegasus.\u201d You answered and Kiaba reluctantly but also instinctually retreated to a seating area nearby to which he just gawked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, stand up so I can get a good look at you.\u201d he said to which you complied. He walked around you, under you, and even on top of you (with your permission). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he looked to have a few ideas. He asked you to perform attacks and abilities that you were more likely to do in a fight, only in dragon form. He drew, and drew, and kept drawing as he created card after card of your attacks, magic, and poses. The one he went with for your personal card was a picture of you roaring at him. You looked like you did when attacking another dragon, fierce, blood lusted, ferocious, with your eyes glowing, your muscles flexing, some spikes out, claws digging trenches, tail flattened, your jaws poised to tear the offending dragon to shreds. You thought it portrayed you perfectly how people that didn\u2019t know you saw you. The other cards depicted your exact look when you did something that he thought deserved a card, which was a lot since he had never seen a real dragon outside his creations do what you were doing. Kiaba just sat back and watched the show. Finally the surprisingly exhausting exercises were over to which you took both of them for a ride then went back to human so they could explain things to you and you could to them. Most things about what the cards should be able to do and how to play them, what the rules in do so were and such. But then it came down to distribution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with you Pegasus. I mean no offense Kiaba but I can sense the living forces inside the cards you hold. It is strange but I can feel this card resonation with me and when you put it in a duel disk I could actually see through its eyes, moving on its behalf to your commands. I can\u2019t imagine my consciousness being split again and since the rest of these are exclusively for him and the other dragons to support him and also exclusive to this deck I feel like these should be the only copies of\u2026 well me. I know that having a card out there that is more powerful than the gods and that Exodia thing is a little strange and one sided but that is another reason why there shouldn\u2019t be a copy of it.\u201d You said as Pegasus and Kiaba were arguing over wither or not to mass produce this new set of cards that literally had your essence in them. You even could materialize them at will and have them appear inside your customized duel disk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Kiaba asked as he was surprised by that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, imagine how you\u2019d feel if someone was giving you orders that you literally had to follow. Makes sense why the big three kick the crap out of people that they don\u2019t want controlling them. I do thank you Mr. Pegasus and Mr. Kiaba for this wonderful gift and help.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were relaxing in the duel hall after you arrived. Pegasus and Kiaba had given you two more things, besides themselves as possible support figures. The first was a copy of every card they had ever produces, even god cards, and stayed around till they were certain you could materialize them at will. Although they insisted that you only materialized the cards that you\u2019ve dematerialized, for no other reason than to not piss off the monsters for making extra copies of them, which you now more than agreed with. You also had one blue eyes, compliments of a fourth to Kiaba\u2019s three that he told you about. So in essence you could materialized any deck you wanted as you dueled. The second thing was a unlimited data retrieval unit that displayed all the information on anything they had access to. Through this you were studying everything, from the elements to different tech and what to expect. By this time you had a fair knowledge about most of what people knew, as well as a flawless knowledge of dueling and the society that had now built itself around it. You also met with each of the monsters to determine who and what they were, along with what level of willing cooperation they were up to. The gods were harder to convince but in the end, and after a transformation on your part, they submitted to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax Drake, please report to exam field three.\u201d Said a voice that snapped you back to the room. Even with Kiaba\u2019s jet you had arrived late but with a call from him directly the professors let you in. You saw a kid named Jaden duel and he seemed ok but young. It almost pained you that you were going to be in the same level of class he was in. Little kids that looked weaker than\u2026 well they were very weak, physically at least. Dr. Crowler waited for you in an attempt to rebuild his loss to Jaden by defeating you. He looked at you with disdain as you entered the arena and exam field across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you lose your duel disk amateur?\u201d He asked which caused some laughter until it came out of its hiding spot with your deck already inside it, activating without you even raising your arm. The action got the laughing to stop and Dr. Crowler to drop the cards he just drew. He quickly picked them up and started the match after you drew your set. \u201cWell I\u2019ll start just like last match except I can\u2019t look at your cards, pity. But I can still do this!\u201d he said as he brought out his \u2018legendary rare monster\u2019 that looked more like a legendary scrap yard to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI win.\u201d You said as you drew a card then placed all the pieces of Exodia on the disk in one sweeping motion. The big guy came out and just stood there to the crowd\u2019s amazement. \u201cKick his\u2026 butt\u201d you said as you had to censor yourself around so many kids. Exodia almost laughed at you for this but wisely decided against it. Unlike the others that summoned him, you could come over to his space and kick his ass if you wanted. In fact, that was exactly what you had to do to\u2026 convince him that you were worthy of his power and stronger than he was. Exodia sent the oversized scrap yard off the field with one attack than overloaded some of the circuits, ending the duel with you the winner. \u201cLater.\u201d You said to him then deactivated and retracted your disk and sending him back.  The room was silent as you bowed to your overdramatic teacher who laid on the ground after the attack. Sometimes the attack power of the monsters appeared physically to the combatants, which is why people\u2019s clothes ruffled and such when cards were played. But in the case of such powerful monsters like him or you, the attack power could have a slight effect on those that it was aimed at. Nothing fatal of near actual injury but enough to send someone off their feet or blow them hard enough to take the cards out of their hand if they didn\u2019t have a firm grip. With that you assumed you got perfect scores on both your exams and went back to your seat. You could feel many eyes on you as you did so but you didn\u2019t really care, that was until that kid Jaden came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that was awesome! Never actually saw someone play Exodia before and I don\u2019t think it has ever been done on the first turn. Not to mention your duel disk is cool to.\u201d Jaden said as he sat next to you but not in the seat, rather on the one in front of that one looking back straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think. But you beat him just as easy.\u201d You said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but it wasn\u2019t as fast that. I\u2019ve never seen someone win that fast against someone like him before.\u201d He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you do it?\u201d A blue haired kid that was named Syrus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame way you did. Draw cards, play them right, and win. Doesn\u2019t really matter how fast you win. You both won so that about sums it up. Not that hard once you figure it that way.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so. I just get really nervous when I duel.\u201d He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease report to the administration desk for your departure.\u201d The announcer said over the loud speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like that\u2019s us.\u201d Jaden stated and you all went that direction. It was then they saw how big you were. Even if your relatively young age to dragons gave you a youthful look you were 6\u20194\u201d tall and obviously very well built, like a fleshy looking statue made of metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re huge to? Man you got everything.\u201d Syrus stated as he looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everything. Besides, being small isn\u2019t that bad\u2026\u201d you said and purposefully walked into a low sign, although it looked accidental to prove your point to which it improved his attitude and caused the three of you to laugh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo you\u2019re in red to huh.\u201d Jaden asked as he was observing the others and making friends. You were in the Slifer dorm but for you it was by choice rather than doing poorly on the entrance tests. You liked how open it was and that you were allowed to sleep in the woods or outside if you really wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, although for me it was by choice as I did ace the entrance exams and was suppose to be in blue.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were? Then why did you choose this place?\u201d asked Syrus as he gestured to their dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause this is the only dorm that doesn\u2019t require you to sleep in your room. I can sleep outside under the sky if it\u2019s nice. That and all that overpriced stuff they got in the other two dorms is just too\u2026 eccentric to me. I like things simple. As for the color, I\u2019m not wearing it anyway and I couldn\u2019t care less what color rank I am when wiping the floor with someone in a duel, doesn\u2019t matter what their wearing either.\u201d You answered as you gestured to your clothes. They were a pair of boots that were durable but also good for running, a black pair of loose pants, and a black sleeveless shirt that was tight enough to show your highly developed body but not tight enough to be considered skin tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not even going to sleep in the dorm?\u201d Syrus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I got permission to build my own if I want. But I like it outside and it is still considered my dorm.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your deck and duel disk? You got to be able to put it somewhere safe and to recharge.\u201d Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, this is my duel disk.\u201d You said as it sprang from your wrist band and slinked out like a sword or switch blade knife. \u201cIt also stores my deck and other cards. I really don\u2019t need much else. I use the dorm for showers or use the water over the cliff to wash up. Either way, I\u2019m fine and more comfortable traveling light.\u201d You explained then retracted the duel disk as they watched it sink back into the wrist band like magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat has to be the coolest duel disk I\u2019ve ever seen. Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d Jaden asked with Syrus listening intently for your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had KibaCorp make it for me. Got a specialized and exclusive deck from Industrial Illusions as well. Not that I\u2019m going to need to use them but all the same.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Seto Kiba and Maximillion Pegasus?\u201d asked Syrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of, currently we are more acquainted than anything.\u201d You reported to him as you nervously scratched the back of your head. \u201cWell I need to take a look around and you two need to go find your room so, see you later.\u201d You said and they dumbly waved back as you walked away toward the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou identified several spots of interest, including an abandoned dorm that gave off a weird vibe. You also checked out the coast and the cliffs around it. This lasted for a while as you became familiar with the area then went back for the welcome dinner. It was fine but a little small for your large appetite. So when you all went to bed you took a quick swim and caught enough fish then wolfed them down. All in all you thought that this slightly boring but easy life would work out just fine. Unlike the other realm, monsters here were accepted and, despite the belief by most that they were just cards, were pretty accepting of people like you. Even if you were leagues away from spreading your true self to anyone but the two already had, you hoped that things would remain the way they are. As you drifted off to sleep in on the grass near the edge of the cliff you slept peacefully for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life was working out just like you hoped. Sure the long classes and the exams were a little boring but that was more or less what you liked about it. You only had to duel once during a field test that Dr. Crowler set up and you creamed them in a single move with 5 headed dragon, Heavy Storm, Future Fusion, and Dragon\u2019s mirror to get him out on the first turn and clear the field of nasty magic and trap cards. Other than that it was very peaceful around with no real drama, for a while at least. But just for fun you hung out with Jaden, as he seemed to be the one that had the most excitement around him and accepted people more often. As a default you got to know Syrus and Chumley pretty good as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexis?\u201d asked Jaden asked as the four of you looked around and arrived at the abandoned dorm. They exchanged words about why she was there. How the dorm was a spot where students disappeared frequently and one of those people was her brother. Then she melted away into the forest when they weren\u2019t looking. You were almost impressed at her ability to mask her presence but then you and the others went inside the dorm. You and Jaden kept agreeing on ways that you could make the place livable then a scream was heard and you all tracked it to a space where Alexis was being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexis!\u201d they all called as they saw her in a freaky looking coffin of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, ha, ha\u2026 she can\u2019t hear you. She\u2019s locked away\u2026 in the shadow realm.\u201d Said a man as he rose skillfully out of some artificial smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, give me a break.\u201d Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe me? Then let me show you, in a shadow game.\u201d It was then you chimed in. You had been in the shadow realm before when talking with duel monsters and traveling to their world of sorts. Not only was this guy a fraud but a bad one that only the kids beside you would believe. It also didn\u2019t help him that he was only asking for a duel and that you could see right through it with your dragon senses and your skills as a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow game? If you can actually pull one off then I accept. What are the stakes?\u201d you said before Jaden said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can, and I will.\u201d He said as you stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I wanted to duel this guy.\u201d Jaden whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have all the fun Jaden. I doubt this guy will last more than a single turn just like the rest. But it will be worth it just to see him squirm. With his half baked tricks and attempt at magic.\u201d You retorted and he agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my magic isn\u2019t fake nor is it weak. I will send your soul and those with you to the shadow realm.\u201d He said in an ominous voice that echoed through the room. You then noticed that while he might\u2019ve been playing around the space he picked wasn\u2019t. It was a doorway for doing exactly what he was bluffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to have a shadow game, you should be careful what you threaten. For those who are actually responsible for this kind of thing don\u2019t play halfway or in your circles. One more threat like that and I\u2019ll make you wish you had never crossed me with such an inferior display of power and trickery.\u201d You warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but that is exactly what I am doing.\u201d He said as he activated his duel disk and started up with the smoke again. You just sighed and activated yours as well. \u201cNow witness the terror as my fiends come out to play.\u201d He said then put on a show as he summoned a fiend type monster in attack mode with a fair amount of attack points with a field spell that changed the room to his liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you want a shadow game so badly then let this room do what it intended.\u201d You said as you stepped forward, making the room activate a glyph on the floor then you both were surrounded by a space to duel in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! What have you done?\u201d he asked as he tried to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I did. You did this. This room was made to house shadow duels and all it takes is someone to call for one and another to accept. So you called and I accepted and they are the security. However, unlike me our little slug friends are not as fearful of you as they are of me.\u201d You answered as the little mud or slug like monsters shrilled away from you but swarmed him until he was taken over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shadow\u2019s hunger for a soul.\u201d The man said as he was possessed by the little buggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t get it. We\u2019ve met before you insignificant little pest and my answer still hasn\u2019t changed. But this time you challenged me to this childish card game. To top it off you won\u2019t even face me yourself. So I\u2019ll kick your ass then leave and you can have the idiot human that thought he could intimidate me.\u201d You stated then drew. You smiled then put your card on the field. \u201cThis is something special. No one has seen it in battle before so you\u2019re the first. A monster more powerful then the Egyptian God cards and Exodia. The Dark Hunter King, if drawn on the first turn I can immediately summon him to the field. He is immune to traps, magic, and other effects other than ones that specify his name directly. To top it off he starts out with 10,000 attack and defense points and gains 1000 extra for every dragon type I send to the grave yard, with from the field or from my hand. Not that he needs any extra power so I\u2019ll just introduce you to him.\u201d You said then summoned\u2026 well yourself and just for fun you let your eyes flash red as well, just to put the little man in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dragon form came out and almost crowded the space, roaring at the man and making him shake. This was a shadow game so everything was more physical than just an ordinary duel. The extra slugs screeched away. You didn\u2019t even have to command him as you were both the duelist and the monster. So\u2026 you incinerated the opposing monster and his life points along with it, careful to leave him alive but highly scorched and smolder. That left the slugs as you deactivated your duel disk and walked to the exit, they consumed him and you left him there as he willed and remembered to change your eyes back before exiting, joining the others as they saw to Alexis.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are you all doing here?\u201d Alexis asked as she woke from her sleep to see the four of you near her and she laying on the ground. She sat up and observed the people around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Well that\u2019s a hell of a way to say thank you. We\u2019re here because we defeated the bad guy, and rescued the damsel in distress\u2026 or more or less. Max did the whole shadow game thing and carried you out here.\u201d Jaden answered as he referred to you as you sat on a low branch of the tree next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did, I mean you did?\u201d she asked you to which you swung and dropped to the ground then sat against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were we suppose to do, just leave you there?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost people would\u2019ve.\u201d She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t most people then. Oh, we found these.\u201d Jaden said as he handed her a picture and her card that led your group to her. Of course you could smell her but that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 this is my brother. This is the first sign of him that I\u2019ve seen in a while.\u201d She stated almost in shock as she looked at the picture. You also made a mental note of his appearance to reference later, if you ever saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know what. You don\u2019t have to search for him alone. Because, from now on, we\u2019ll be searching with you.\u201d Jaden said as she took it in with a pleasant smile of gratitude and happiness. But any form of verbal acknowledgement was gone as the sun came up. \u201cDarn, we got to get back before they notice we\u2019re gone.\u201d Jaden said as the three of them quickly got up and started running back to the dorm. They knew that you didn\u2019t have to so they didn\u2019t even bother asking why you were staying. \u201cOh, and if anyone asks, we were never here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou you guys were here.\u201d She said more to you but also in response to him, although they were too far away to hear it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like they do. I got special permission to sleep outside if I want, which I exercise more than enough to make sleeping in the woods believable.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for saving me. That guy, he just grabbed me out of nowhere. Such a creep\u2026\u201d she said as she droned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be more careful. You of all people know about this place. If you\u2019re not ready for things like that to happen you shouldn\u2019t be here. You will not do your brother any favors if you end up disappearing too.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I just can\u2019t stop from coming here in hopes of seeing him again.\u201d She said as she looked at the abandoned dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be more careful next time or learn to defend yourself against idiots like that. Either way, you are the last person that should be taken by surprise around here. Unlike the others, you know more about what and why people are disappearing.\u201d You advised as you got up and helped her to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.\u201d She said as you turning to walk away. She had her hand on your arm in an attempt to hold you there but not force you. You turned toward her so she could speak. \u201cWhy did you come in the first place?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOriginally, we just came as a follow-through of a horror game we played back at the dorm. We didn\u2019t even know you were here until we saw you at the entrance. After, when we heard your scream there was only one option as far as we were concerned.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks for saving me.\u201d She said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Alexis.\u201d You said then started walking back to school and leaving a smiling Alexis before she to left for her dorm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was then decided that you and Jaden would be in a tag duel where if you won you would be cleared and if you two lost then both of you would be expelled. You both agreed to it. A few days later and a few drama filled events, including Jaden dueling Zane on Syrus\u2019 behalf and Chumley facing his dad to stay at the school, you and Jaden now stood on the field waiting for your opponents. Neither of you were even the slightest bit worried. Although Jaden had asked you after you beat him a single move to allow the duel to play out so they could have some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let me introduce the Parodox Brothers.\u201d Crowler said as he did so and they addressed you and Jaden in a rather demeaning manner. But Chancellor Sheppard wasn\u2019t going to let it slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaden, Max. Are you two willing to continue?\u201d asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, these two couldn\u2019t even beat male pattern baldness, so there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to lose.\u201d Jaden said to which you knuckle pounded him and you two took you spots. \u201cNow remember, don\u2019t beat them right away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think beating us will be easy\u2026\u201d One of them started to which the other finished with \u201c\u2026 We will make this more than breezy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah whatever, You\u2019re not even going to touch us.\u201d you said as you started off your move with the same strategy as another time to get 5 headed dragon out and with future fusion having another ready in two turns. Crowler seemed ready to piss his pants as he saw how easily you brought such a high level monster out on the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, take it easy. We want to have some fun remember?\u201d Jaden said as you brought out his hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to leave myself wide open. It also helps that my friend here can\u2019t be destroyed in battle. So let me know when you want to end it while I bolster my line with monster capable of doing the job.\u201d You returned to which the crowd cheered, Jaden and your other friends smiled, and your opponents scowled. You attacked one of the monsters just for fun as you knew it wouldn\u2019t get through the squall barricade while Jaden did his thing. By turn three you had another five headed out and a baby Dark Hunter that was a level 4 monster but at 2000 attack and defense points it was a hefty addition, not to mention the special ability. If destroyed it is resurrected as a Dark Hunter Adult with 6000 attack and defense points but can\u2019t attack for 2 turns. You also had a new card called \u2018Dragon Wall\u2019 that protected all dragon type monsters on the field from the effects of spells, traps, and monster effects. By turn five you had those three plus Red Eyes black Dragon and Blue Eyes white Dragon on the field. Your line up stunned most that looked at it as the brothers, even with gate guardian on the field, didn\u2019t risk attacking in fear of your counter attack. For a short while you just used traps and sells to protect the life points, boost them, and protect Jaden\u2019s monsters as they were attacked by different strategies. But in the end Jaden used a super powered Tempest to take them down and with a little help from your lineup of course. The final life point count at the end of the match was 10,000 with all your bolstering and of course there\u2019s was 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also had taken a long enough vacation from training and, to be honest with yourself, missed the physical exertion of ninja training. The only problem was that any kind of ninja or dragon training would be noticed to readily by others around. So you built a home out of the cliff near the dorm. The door looked to be part of the cliff but led into a vast system of rooms. The first section was for people and hanging out, when you were ready to show your place to the others. Then there was a vault door that led to your training room and weapon armory, which included new weapons you saw and wished to be trained in. With that done you made a space rift so that the enormous complex was housed in the cliff itself and was protected so that someone couldn\u2019t just destroy the cliff to destroy your new home, even if it was on purpose or accident. However you couldn\u2019t just stay inside all the time so you set up a small training area outside and practiced outside when you could. Nothing much in the open as far as dragon abilities or jutsu but you could more than practice fighting moves and get some target practice in. Inwardly you felt better to get some pent up aggression out and more than once people saw you train, but since you weren\u2019t doing anything compromising to your secret you didn\u2019t really care if they watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d said a voice as you were wailing on a punching bag and firing Shuriken at targets between rabid strikes. You stopped to address whomever it was to see Zane walking up. You had changed to shorts and no shirt to be more relaxed while training so you quickly washed yourself off with a bucket of water then used a towel to dry as you walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZane? What\u2019s the number one ranked duelist in the academy want with me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can cut the ignorant rap. We all know you are the best here. Most are just in denial or chalk it up to luck. But I\u2019m no fool, you draw your cards and play them as if it were second nature and effortless.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest at winning I\u2019d say that is accurate, but I\u2019m far from a decent duelist. The title of best duelist in the school still belongs to you, although Jaden is nipping at your heels in that respect. Personally, I like physical combat multitudes more than this passive version of it. However, since it isn\u2019t really possible around here I decided to make the best out of it and use dueling as a substitute, and to be honest it isn\u2019t that bad of one. At least at the end of a duel no one dies or is seriously injured.\u201d You returned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, I guess that makes sense. But there is still one thing that I saw in your entrance match and in different doses in your other matches, as short as they are. Every monster that is summoned reacts to you personally in some way. The opponent\u2019s monsters are wrought with fear and the ones you summon are proud and relational. How do you explain this?\u201d Zane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Zane, we\u2019ll talk inside. This isn\u2019t exactly something I want any audience to hear.\u201d You said then led him into your home then back to training vault, closing the door behind the two of you. \u201cDo you recognize these cards?\u201d you asked as you handed him 8 cards. He stood there, stunned and shocked at what he held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get these?\u201d he stammered as he looked at the 5 pieces of Exodia and the 3 Egyptian god cards. You held out our hand for them to which he gave them back before you continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is a simple question to answer. I got them from Mr. Pegasus and Mr. Kiaba made my weaponized dual disk. The real question is how I can summon them and it directly corresponds with why the monsters respect and fear me.\u201d You started as you took out\u2026 you and handed your card to him. Again, it was a strange feeling. When it was with you it felt normal but when separated it felt like your consciousness was being split but you were still there. \u201cThat is the reason why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this? Is it a form of god card?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, truthfully I don\u2019t like the title \u2018god cards\u2019 in relation to duel monsters or like creatures. But in a sense it is a card more powerful than the god cards and Exodia. It has an entire deck surrounding him and made exclusively form me with no copies. You want to take a gander at why?\u201d you asked and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026 you\u2019re friends with its creator?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, although that is true. Zane, what I\u2019m about to tell you is a highly guarded secret and I\u2019ll probably erase your memory or kill you if you spread it around. Do you understand?\u201d you asked as a final precaution to which he simply nodded his head. \u201cI am that card, that is me. I allowed Mr. Pegasus to make a series of cards for me and of me only for me. The reason why even the big four fear me is because I am, in a sense, a duel monster vastly more powerful than they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 that\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen play it and find out. Only this once will I allow you to summon me. Otherwise I would react similar to the other three.\u201d You stated as you and them had that in common as far as punishing those that summoned you without your support in doing so. He activated his duel disk and summoned you. He looked up at your enormous holographic form as it snarled and growled at him instead of facing the direction he was. \u201cBelieve me now?\u201d you asked through the hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 him\u2026 how\u2026 Wait a minute, if you\u2019re a duel monster than why are you in two places at once?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a weird feeling to say the least. The best way to describe it is looking through an interactive camera made in your image. I can see you through either eyes and act in both bodies. However the hologram version has less\u2026 freedom I guess. It is highly governed by the rules of duel monsters and as such so am I, when looking through his/ my eyes. Which is why I am the only possessor of\u2026 well me I guess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had brought him into the living quarters and placed him on a couch as you looked out the window and over the academy. The window was like a hologram and space distortion so it couldn\u2019t be visible or accessed as a normal window, rather it just acted as a peep hole outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I might\u2019ve put too much on you at once. It\u2019s a lot to take in you know.\u201d You answered as your wings and tail flexed. He seemed put off by this and more visibly with your back turned but calmed down as he collected himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, that wasn\u2019t all just a dream?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. I hope you don\u2019t feel like I placed an added burden on you. You\u2019re a strong guy so I thought you could handle it. I could always wipe your memory if you would prefer it.\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!... ah no, that won\u2019t be necessary. You trusted me with this and I\u2019ll gladly accept. Although\u2026\u201d he started then almost froze when you turned and looked straight at him with your glowing eyes. Perhaps the added emotions was him seeing those eyes in the dragon version of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d you asked which broke his temporary silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a few things that I would like to know, I rather not be partially informed then be victim to rumor and speculation.\u201d You said to which you nodded then sat down in a chair opposite of him. \u201cYou\u2019re not like other duel monsters, why is that? For starters you can turn human and interact on both sides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually I\u2019m from another realm all together and traveled through many to get here, learning and such on my way. Best way to describe my relation to your realm is a movie or TV show, but if the episodes really took place. Anyway, I entered this realm and was found by Mr. Kiaba. I was then introduced to Mr. Pegasus and he agreed to make a specialized set of cards for me and of me, along with some of the abilities I am capable of. They also gave me a few welcome gifts, like a copy of every card ever made by them and my duel disk. Since this school is basically the main mode of education around Mr. Kiaba entered me into it.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2026so you weren\u2019t originally a duel monster?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m a half-breed. I can turn all human, all dragon, or grow some parts from either side. I don\u2019t lose any power or abilities in either form. Like I said, when my card is played it is an interesting experience to say the least. But I\u2019m kind of like the god cards as I don\u2019t like being summoned by others unless I authorize it and will punish those that do. Also makes it easy to locate\u2026 well me if it is stolen.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be considered a on the side of good or evil?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question to answer. I try to be good and do what is right. But let me ask you. If you were a dragon and other people and even other dragons were actively trying to kill you and those you loved, what would you do to protect them?\u201d you asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything.\u201d He responded without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise. To that effect I have done some things, while noble from my point of view, still weigh heavily on my heart and could easily be considered as an evil action. I do hold back though. I don\u2019t bite people\u2019s heads off, literally, if they are offending me or those around. Heck, I\u2019ve been close to dying multiple times and not done anything to retaliate or get revenge. So if I had to answer from my perspective then I\u2019d say I\u2019m on the good side but not on the side of what others say is good, if that makes any sense to you.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, you are on what you thing is good and not some corrupt politician\u2019s version of good. So why don\u2019t you help out more when\u2026 bad things happen?\u201d He asked, a little more comfortable now but still being careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it something that someone can handle I let them. People can\u2019t grow if you take all their opportunities to do so. I intervene when I feel like having some fun, when the opposing side makes the mistake of challenging me or low balling people around me, or if they really can\u2019t handle it. The hardest part is when people die or are majorly injured and I know I shouldn\u2019t do anything about it. I feel almost helpless in those situations.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. I thought I had the hard end\u2026 It\u2019s tuff being you, isn\u2019t it.\u201d He stated as he became more relaxed and more like his usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarder than you know. I won\u2019t bore you with details of predator mindsets and abilities that are always active but it is very difficult to interact with humans and not, well split them in half when just putting a hand on a shoulder. Keep in mind I still have all the power of my\u2026 other side so shaking hands, drawing something as flimsy as a card, not flying or speeding somewhere, and the list goes on\u2026\u201d you said as you let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think I\u2019ll ever be able to use\u2026 your card in a duel?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. If you really need the help and I find the reason to be worth it. Try to think of it from my end. How would you like someone summoning you and ordering you to attack or just take hits from other monsters, not a lot of fun you know.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d He smiled which spawned more conversation and story time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait we didn\u2019t do anything bad did we?\u201d Jaden asked Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Chancellor Shepard said then explained about the Sacred Beast Cards under the school and you wondered why they weren\u2019t with your collection, if you really had all the cards ever made. But you guessed there was a good reason. But finally you were able to really sink your teeth into a world threat. You were all presented with the keys to which you and the others each grabbed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo these Shadow riders HAVE to win these things in a duel?\u201d you asked in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Shepard answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the keys we are holding are, more or less, bound to us until that time by more than just proximity.\u201d You stated as you looked at it then put it in your pocket which was a portal of sorts that transported things you put into it to a little area in your vault. This made your pocket very deep and secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take this so lightly if I were you. These shadow riders play for keeps and fight dirty.\u201d Shepard stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m sure that, between the 7 of us, we won\u2019t let the world end on our watch.\u201d You stated and you could sense Zane crack half a smile. After all, he was the only one in the room that knew how easy this would be for you. While he was still the best dualist you had told him your story and he had asked many questions over the weeks. So there was virtually no chance that someone would be able to beat you in a dual or otherwise for that key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who\u2019s dueling first?\u201d Jaden asked then an open argument started on who the best was, each voting for themselves and each arguing against the other.

Maybe these idiots will at least be able to last a few rounds, doubt it though. I am curious to see what bluffs and threats they use. I\u2019ve seen pretty much every type of monster that each shadow rider could be in their natural habitat and shadow games will be easy on my part. Can\u2019t wait\u2026\u201d you answered but was cut short as you caught the scent of high level magic and a bunch of people being rapidly moved to another location. You tracked it with your senses as it deposited in a volcano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to have some fun, want to come and watch?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well, that\u2019s why we\u2019re guarding these things.\u201d Zane said to which you grabbed him then raced to the volcano as some guy in black robes was introducing himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Night Shroud\u2026 what the hell!\u201d he said as you and Zane leapt beside Jaden and Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDibs.\u201d You said after a little silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Alexis asked and Jaden looked at Zane as he cracked a slight grin before it disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call Dibs on\u2026 sorry what was your name again?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Night Shroud and\u2026\u201d he started but you didn\u2019t let him finish as you made Syrus and Chumley, who were being held hostage, appear next to you in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, that guy. I call Dibs on him.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I was hear first!\u201d Jaden declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you were still shaking in your boots when I got here so I called it. Besides, you get to duel in all the cool matches and I get stuck with\u2026 Crowler. You can have the next one, unless they challenge me directly.\u201d You persuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026 you can have him. Now that Chum and Sy are ok I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter. But I get the next one.\u201d He verified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow entertaining. You kids are arguing on who gets to lose to me in a shadow duel.\u201d Night Shroud said as you walked forward, after putting an invisible barrier on the others so that Shroud couldn\u2019t use them as hostages again, or be effected by the heat around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, I never said anything about losing. But since I want to stretch my legs I will indulge in a longer match, rather than beating you in one turn like I usually do.\u201d You said as you both drew your hand from your respective duel disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne turn? How will you deal with me in one turn with this?\u201d he said as he summoned a troop dragon in defense mode. You growled under your breath and it caught everyone\u2019s notice that the dragon was quivering from you. All the monsters in the world knew you and they also knew you hated dragons, well most dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. It appears you have a dragon deck, what a coincidence, so do I. But mine are more powerful than yours are. Let\u2019s start small by bringing out a friend of mine with this.\u201d You stated as you used one of your cards called \u2018dragon summon\u2019. It takes up to 10 stars off a dragon type for one turn, in your hand or otherwise. To his amazement you summoned Blue Eyes white Dragon with that and fused Red Eyes and Summoned skull from your hand to bring out Red Eyes Black Skull Dragon. Then you used another original to fill your hand with new cards. \u201cUnfortunately for me, I can\u2019t attack the same turn \u2018Dragon Summon\u2019 is activated so I\u2019ll just put two face down cards and end my turn. Good luck little dragon boy.\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a Red Eyes?\u201d he asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, and no offense to either of these two, but I have stronger dragons to call on if I need to.\u201d You stated to which the two in front of you nodded to you in understanding. At the very least you were one of the dragons you were talking about so they didn\u2019t take offense to it and appreciated the respect in summoning them rather than others you had at your disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, it\u2019s time I brought out mine as well.\u201d he said as he did a succession of moves that brought out his Red Eyes Black Dragon then put a face down card of his own out. \u201cJust try and attack.\u201d He challenged. You were planning to but with what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway it provided 3 sacrifices without taking up zones in the battlefield. Since your card used 5 if it was summoned normally. But that wasn\u2019t the one you were aiming for. Black clouds formed overhead and lighting erupted as you called Slifer out. He gave you a courtesy growl before roaring at your opponent. You used another spell card to bolster your hand to six cards, making him 6000 attack points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! You have Slifer?\u201d Jaden asked as he was the only one, other than Zane, that could speak from the shock of you having one of the most powerful cards, to them, in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know, he\u2019s pretty amazing isn\u2019t he?\u201d you asked rhetorically as you reached up and scratched under his chin. This being a shadow game allowed you limited interaction while still on this side of the duel. He rumbled the area with a purr that, to the untrained ear, sounded like a light growl. \u201cOk, will you three please teach this idiot a lesson on a real dragon\u2019s appreciation?\u201d you asked. They all roared then attacked. First Slifer attacked the Red Eyes and Shroud, followed but the other two in on large beam that brought his life points down to zero. With that done and the protection fields crumbling you deactivated your duel disk and transported everyone outside the volcano like it was an effect of you winning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 what just happened?\u201d asked Chumley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax defeated the shadow rider and freed you.\u201d Zane stated and walked over to the older boy, now that you got a good whiff of him without his mask on. The mask was now locked in the cards that the Shadow duel was played in. You transported it to one of your vaults for such items then joined them as Alexis recognized the boy as her older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, guess we kept that promise didn\u2019t we. Not the way we wanted to find him but at least he\u2019s back.\u201d You stated amongst Alexis\u2019 crying and the others still shocked but, for the moment, happy for Alexis. There was also a certain amount of relief in the air as you bent down and picked up Atticus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Alexis asked as she was not done crying over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t mind the attention later but for now we should probably get him to the nurse\u2019s office. That is unless you happen to be carrying a hospital room in your purse.\u201d You said in a comical manner that got her and the others to lighten up. They were glad you were there, not only for winning the duel but also to carry the unconscious Atticus down the mountain and to the nurse\u2019s office. They talked amongst themselves with Zane by your side, as the mode of conversation was mostly about Atticus and you, topics that Zane already knew more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you busted out Slifer for this one.\u201d Zane stated quiet enough for you two to talk and no one else could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the big three were getting jealous of Exodia and the other monsters I\u2019ve been summoning. I mean, they get summoned a million times by, no offense, weak humans. So I think they like the change when summoned by someone they could more than adequately describe as their master.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense. Do all duel monster feel that way?\u201d he asked as he looked at his own deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost don\u2019t, especially when they are with someone they pick, like your Cyber Dragons seemed to have chosen you. Again, try to see it from their point of view. If you had to be controlled who would you prefer, someone of your choosing or a random idiot that picked you up at a random card shack?\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken, which explains why the gods harm those that they don\u2019t\u2026 agree with.\u201d He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed it does.\u201d You ended as the others regained you and Zane, hoping to catch part of your conversation. But all they could do was compliment you about your win and ask to see your deck, like that was the first time\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you had to guess it was that it was a first intense shadow duel you had and your body had to fight its magic just like all the other things your body had to fight. However, with this being a little\u2026 strange, it took your body a little longer to address it. The group was huddled around your bed as they gave you a progress report. You had been in bed when Dr. Crowler was taken and now it was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to duel her but she insisted on Zane.\u201d Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was about to win but\u2026\u201d Alexis started but paused as she looked over at Syrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCamula grabbed me and used my soul to blackmail my brother. He had the world in his hand, but he chose to save me instead.\u201d Syrus stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d you asked in a low growl that made the other shiver, even if they didn\u2019t know how your voice could do something like that. However your suddenly serious tone forbid them from asking anything more and just answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to duel her again tonight at her castle.\u201d Chaz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s so dead\u2026\u201d you growled as you grabbed a pencil then threw it into the head of an observing bat to which the one next to it shrieked before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Max, calm down now\u2026\u201d Chumley stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll know when I lose my cool. I\u2019m as calm as I\u2019m going to get. Let\u2019s go vampire slaying.\u201d You said as you got out of the bed. They didn\u2019t say much as they led you to the castle, although that could be because of your intense glare that bordered on the insane intensity level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you want to\u2026\u201d Camula started as you all entered into her castle and appeared where she apparently was ready to duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your trap shut you parasitic moron. New rules, I win you return the others then leave and never come back. In case you were wondering, you don\u2019t have a second option.\u201d You growled as you activated your duel disk to which she almost flinched as she saw that it could easily slice her in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when I win I obviously get your soul and key. You will pay for such words.\u201d she stated then drew to start the match. \u201cI summon, Zombie Werewolf in attack mode then lay one card face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmateur, you\u2019re a disgrace to other predators. Don\u2019t you have any pride?\u201d you asked before you drew. Now the only question for you was wither you were going to finish it quick or make her suffer in a shadow game. You had a few things that could cause her actual pain until you decided to end it. Of course you would like to get Zane and the Doctor back as soon as possible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think I\u2019ll drain you instead of all that blood you have in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re under the false assumption that you can. But that is for later, make no mistake. You will return the others back to normal, if I have to rip your head off to make you do it than that is what I have to do. For now I need to finish this so I\u2019ll bring a friend to help verify my point. Rise Exodia.\u201d You ordered as you placed the five cards on your disk and he came out, facing down Camula and her pet wolf she had on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot possible, there\u2019s no way you can draw all the pieces on the first turn.\u201d She said as she looked up at the mammoth of a monster before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he\u2019s here and he\u2019s going to kick your\u2026 butt.\u201d You said, again, censoring yourself for the kids. \u201cExodia, get rid of that stain to the monster name.\u201d you ordered to which he agreed and happily obliged. The duel was over with a bag as it the blast could be felt for a while and left Camula almost charred in its wake, being that it was a shadow game and being attacked by Exodia in one tends to make one feel a little put out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne turn, that\u2019s all it took to defeat me? I\u2026\u201d she started but you took the opportunity that a falling piece of the castle gave you to bridge the gap of the two sides of the field you were on. You landed next to her but didn\u2019t stop as you closed your hand around her throat and shoved her against the wall which shook with the force you used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will release the others right now or I will crush you and so that maybe reducing you to ash will do the trick.\u201d You roared at her. She was grabbing at your hand in an attempt to force you to let go but she soon realized that you were no ordinary human, to her eyes. Currently there was only one person in the room that knew better and that was a doll version of Zane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa Max, take it easy.\u201d Said Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah man, there\u2019s no reason to kill her or anything. Just let her go.\u201d Jaden said as the group ran over to where the two of you were. For a moment you increased the force you were using that caused her to indent into the wall and gasp for what little air she was previously getting, then let her drop to the ground. You stood over her to which she looked up at you glaring down at her, waiting for her to make a move in the wrong direction so you could justify killing her. It was like a leash being held by the circumstance as evidence to your straining muscles in their attempt to restrain yourself. It had been a while since you had the opportunity to physically deal with a problem and you were itching to rectify that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are\u2026\u201d she started before you hit the wall next to her head as she stood, demolishing it in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease the others or you\u2019re next.\u201d You growled at her. \u201cNOW\u201d. She touched her shadow charm almost instantly to which the Zane and Dr. Crowler puppets came back to their normal self. With a quick analysis of them both you got very close to her so you could whisper in her ear. The position would normally be a stupid move to have one\u2019s neck so close to a vampire but there wasn\u2019t a hope in hell that she could penetrate your skin. \u201cIf I have to have this conversation again with you it will be to your corpse little vampire.\u201d You whispered in her ear to which she started shaking and continued to after you separated and went over to help Zane get to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d he asked as he saw her shaking in fear of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just a little predator talk.\u201d You said cryptically as you pulled him to his feet and he nodded. He wasn\u2019t going to pretend what that meant but he did know that it probably wasn\u2019t a set of compliments to get her shaking like she was. \u201cI need some rest. She\u2019s going to apologize to each of you and Chancellor Shepard before she decides wither to stay and help of leave and not bother you again. I\u2019ll be in the nurse\u2019s office.\u201d You said to the others and also shot a look to Camula as if to say that she didn\u2019t have a choice in refusing your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d Jaden agreed to which you left and went back to the bed in the nurse\u2019s office. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dammit you were hoping that in the middle of the mansion collapsing he didn't notice but he had to notice because he told you to stop and put her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah about that .... well you see you are the first friends that I've had and I .... I didn't want any harm to come to you so when I beat her I kind of lost it a little and got a little to over protective of you guys and I'm deeply sorry for that\". \"Ok that does make sense\" Jaden said with a look of surprise on his face and at the same time you were happy in your mind that you managed to come up with something believable and that it looked like Jaden had forgot about the hole dam wall you destroyed with one punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Max we know you've got Exodia and Slifer the sky dragon but do you have anything else like that I mean you know are main cards like Zane's Cyber end dragon and my Flaming wing man so could you tell us what yours is please cos with how fast and powerful your cards are I would like to see if you've got anything more powerful in that weird deck of yours\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh) ok I guess I could show you guys but only on one condition .... That you don't tell anyone outside of this room ok\" you said with a hint of anger in your voice which got them all to node. You made your duel disk appear and took ... You out of the deck and the made your duel disk disappear again which they still couldn't believe and slowly you looked at the card and gave a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what any of you think about this card (it was painful to say this as you were really talking about yourself) but this card is more powerful than Exodia and the three Egyptian god card combined\" you slowly handed it to Jaden who handled it or you with great care until he saw its attack points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWANT 10, 000 ATTACK POINTS THATS INSANE!\" Jaden yelled as he was quickly calmed down by everyone else then he took a deep breath and termed to look at you as if asking for an explanation \"I only summon this card in emergencies and that's in extreme conditions only as it could tear apart the area it's summoned in to and maybe do even more damage if I'm not carful\" Jaden handed the card or you back to you and it disappeared back in to your deck were it was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this everyone left so you could get some rest and after a day of rest you were back to full health and when you left the room you were going to go see Jaden but you were told by the nurse that Chancellor Shepard wanted to see you which was weird but you went anyway and as you enter you you saw the Chancellor, Doctor Crowler talking then turning to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are Max I heard about you defeating Camula but that's not what I've called you here it's just I've been hearing rumours that you have Slifer which I am fine with as you really don't summon him but I have been told by someone that you have a card In your deck that dwarfs tune god cards and Exodia and I've called you here to see if this is true because if it is then I may have to take it off you or see to it that some rules are made about using this card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he started talking about this card you knew he was talking about The Dark Hunter King and he must have seen your face change because he immediately asked you if he could see this card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see it in you face that I'm right in saying that this card exists\" \"yes sir it does\" you said as you took it out your deck and slowly handed it to him to make sure he got the message that this card was very important to you and he handled it with just as much care as Jaden did. \"My my what a card and what high attack points and apparently according to are database this is the only one and it was made by Pegasus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was talking you could feel your self in two places at once which you still hadn't got the hang of and was starting to slowly take its toll on you as you were focusing on a lot of things at once. \"Well it will take some time for me to decide what to do so you can go Max\" he said as he handed back your card and then as you you left and put the card back in your deck two things were going threw your head one who told the Chancellor, two what he will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t know what it was so Miss Fontaine put you in bed to which you almost immediately fell asleep. You were again pelted by your usual nightmares but couldn\u2019t really get out of them. One thing strange though was 3 figures that you never saw before, roaring at you. From afar one could mistake them for the 3 god cards but up close they were extremely different. You could also feel a muck over your mind as your body worked on it. It seemed to eat away at your control to stay in human form. Once it healed it wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore but it was taking forever. However, finally, you were well enough to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d Said a voice you knew was Zane\u2019s. It took you a little bit to recognize shapes and figures as your eyes darted around. Finally you locked on his figure from your slightly inclined position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d You asked as you rubbed your head and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were out for quite a while. Longer even than Atticus, Alexis\u2019 brother.\u201d Syrus answered in his usual insecure voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you? You were rocking that last duel and that Vampire lady left for good. Never saw anyone do the stuff you did. I thought you were invincible and then you were in here for all that time.\u201d Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess the shadow duel infected me somehow. I must\u2019ve caught something from them. But I\u2019ll get over it, what\u2019s happened around here?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou missed a lot. We got all the way through the last Shadow rider, Professor Banner.\u201d Jaden said in a shocked and excited voice in telling his/their story. He told you a play by play timeline about how everything was done and all that. You then noticed the absence of your spirit key as he pointed it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, and now you\u2019re just waiting on this danger Banner was worried about. I suppose you\u2019ll be the one having all the dueling fun?\u201d You summarized and asked to Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, who else is there?\u201d He asked with a laugh and a smile. It was true enough. For whatever reason he had risen to a very high level of dueling. With you bed ridden he was the only one to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case I\u2019ll lend you this.\u201d you said as you activated your duel disk, took out your card, then retracted it while giving it to him. \u201cThat is my most powerful and prized card. Even higher than Exodia and the Egyptian gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe \u2018Dark Hunter King\u2019 it has\u2026 10,000 attack points! I could win against anyone with this thing. But wait, if this guy is stronger than the others and they kick the living mess out of people that play them won\u2019t he do the same?\u201d asked Jaden. You looked over at Zane, who looked at you with both a questioning and shocked gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, he\u2019ll let you this once. Just don\u2019t overdo it and he\u2019ll be glad to help.\u201d You answered. \u201cIt will return after you use it once so you don\u2019t have to worry about returning it to me, yeah he is that powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, um\u2026 I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d Jaden said as he carefully put\u2026 you in his deck. You could feel the other cards around you as he did so. They seemed to all have the same feeling you did. Except they were weakening from it more so than you were. After a little more pointless talking and you avoiding questions about how you did the things you could do and how you had such a powerful card, they all left and Zane remained behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how are you really? You wouldn\u2019t have given your card away to him if you had another choice.\u201d Zane induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruthfully? The shadow games took a toll on me, but not in the way I said it did. The sickness is actually eating away at my ability to suppress my\u2026 other side. If I exert myself too much I\u2019ll have no choice in the matter, I\u2019ll be force into the other form. Luckily my body is working on it and it won\u2019t be a problem after it is done. However, I am also feeling a presence that is making it harder to resist. Something else nearby that is tapping at that control. If it gets much worse I\u2019ll\u2026 well I better be outside when it happens.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be the Sacred Beast cards. They say it has a strange effect of those around them, especially duel monsters.\u201d Zane returned as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can feel the monsters that are weak around me starting to fade, even in Jaden\u2019s deck. Well if Jaden summons me, there is a pretty good chance I\u2019ll lose it or be there in person rather than the hologram, or in addition to it\u2026 hard to tell what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d You agreed then looked at your had, flexing it then putting it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll get to see you in action, finally. Not that saving me from that Vampire wasn\u2019t impressive enough. Thanks for that by the way.\u201d Zane said back, trying to lighten you mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. No one picks on a friend of mine without angering me. Using your brother as a blackmail chip. That girl had it coming.\u201d You stated and the anger caused your eyes to shine until you slapped your hand over them and calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take it easy until you have to do your thing. Last thing we need is a full grown dragon bust the school up\u2026 yet.\u201d Zane stated with a hand on your shoulder in a comforting and secure fashion. You just nodded and shut your eyes to rest and soon his hand was gone and walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZane?\u201d you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You finished then went back to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were standing almost directly over Jaden. Now you knew what happened. Since these three were bringing all the monster energy to them it required you to come to them as well. However, since you were involved in the shadow game you were just forced to solely reside in your card for a bit. This doubled your attack points to an impressive 20,000 attack points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, so you\u2019re the Dark Hunter King. How did your attack points double?\u201d Jaden asked but only Zane would understand if you explained. You looked down for a moment, as you silently communicated to him that you wanted to wipe the floor with them, then looked back at the others in front of you with another snarl and roar that dwarfed theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Max say that all the other monsters were afraid of this one.\u201d Zane said out loud, expertly weaving around the fact that you were the monster in front of them. \u201cNow I see why, we all see why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at those Sacred Beasts, they are backing away from the duel.\u201d Chaz stated as he pointed at them. It was true. To your roar and presence, they were definitely not wanting to be there. Definitely not as your enemies and facing you snarling and wanting them dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible, I\u2019ve never heard of this monster before. No, it can\u2019t be. These beasts aren\u2019t afraid of anything. I\u2019ll just play this trap and have all my Beasts attack you directly.\u201d Said the man across from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters did as they were told but you put your tail in between him and the attack, stopping it with little effort before retracting it so Jaden could see. Your teeth were bared now as your snarling became more fierce at their attempt to get passed you. Fiery drool dropped on occasion from your jaws, scorching the earth beneath it heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo direct attacks either, you have to be the most powerful monster in all of Duel Monsters.\u201d Jaden complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible, this can\u2019t be happening. I\u2019ll place three cards face down.\u201d Said the man but you only roared again to destroy them, wiping them from the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, and I bet he can do the same with spell cards to.\u201d Alexis stated as she observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax had a card this powerful all this time?\u201d Syrus asked in a whimper. It was clear that he couldn\u2019t figure out what emotion to act on. He was scared of your holographic form but was glad you were on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk big guy, do your thing and win this duel!\u201d Jaden commanded as he pointed to the man and the monsters behind him. The man was so lucky that you were restricted by the rules of a shadow game. His monsters on the other hand\u2026 You flexed against the ground, digging huge trenches in the earth below. Then all at once you let out a massive amount of flames that engulfed all the monsters and the man on the field. The monsters went down and had to let go of all the monster spirits they had absorbed. They were heavily injured, even inside their cards while the man was charred as well. Not as bad as it would\u2019ve been if you weren\u2019t restricted but he still was thrown into the wall of dirt behind him, smoldering as his skin had severe burns all over it. It transferred onto his old frame as well but not as severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what an attack!\u201d Jaden exclaimed as it was more intense than anything they had ever seen before. It took a moment before the shock wore off. However when it did and it was time for you to go you decided that sticking around was not the best plan. So you flew off then exploded in the air. In the smoke from that you teleported, using a jutsu, to your bed again. You repaired it then laid back just in time for the nurse to come back in. You also kept your word to which your card transported back into your deck as it was after the duel. It sure would be an interesting time explaining to them about that whole thing but left that for later. One good thing that you needed and that the nurses office was good at giving was rest, and you planned to get a whole lot of it. Now that those Sacred Beasts weren\u2019t sappin your power anymore. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike most times when you slept, you didn't feel the drain or the need to get up. You basked in this rare time to just relax as much as you could, needed, and wanted. While you couldn't be sure, you had a halfway decent gauge on time when you were sleeping by choice. If you had to guess, you would've said that you were asleep for about a week. Well beyond enough time for your body to heal and come up with immunities to the Shadow realm effects and Sacred Beast powers. However, there was an even bigger concern that you decided you wouldn't worry about until you woke' which was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, now. We don't need to crowd him as he wakes.' Said a voice as you started to flicker your eyes open. The voice was unmistakably Chancellor Shepard. You were lying in a slightly declined position, a few higher than 60 degrees. They must've put your bed like this so you could address them and they you when you awoke. As your eyes adjusted you saw most of your inner circle of growing friends, Chancellor Shepard, Doctor Crowler, and' Seto Kaiba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's about time. I have been waiting long enough while you were taking your nap.' Kaiba said. His presence in the room was well known and respected by the others. Why not? He was in the top 2 duelist spots in the world and the owner of the largest gaming company in the world and also the academy you were currently residing in. Each one of them had a reason to look and admire him with awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's good to see you to. Not that I mind the company, but what are you doing here?' You asked more directly to Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I heard you were directly involved in a duel' and that you helped seal the Sacred Beast cards. Then I heard you were in here for your efforts so I came to see why. Was one trip to the shadow realm too much for you?' Kaiba asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I've never been there before' and I've never met beasts like the Sacred Beasts before. My body just needed time to adjust, time that the idiots trying to steal them didn't seem too fond of giving me. So I did what I could and just slept it off. Wait' are you jealous you didn't get to see me duel?' you asked in a joking manner and he just huffed at it. 'I have to assume that you told some of them?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even Yugi had the other twerps to help him. If you are really going to be at this school than you need your cheerleaders.' Kaiba stated in a sort of confirmation. It was just his way of expressing his concern. You didn't really mind the off book approach. As long as he wasn't condemning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How much did you tell them?' You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I let the ones in the room see the footage of you speaking with me and with Pegasus. I'm not a fan of telling stories, nor am I suited for such an obscure task.' Kaiba answered. You looked over at the rest of them and at Zane, he gave a nod in agreement of what Kaiba just said. This confirmed for you that they knew EVERYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I guess I better start Q&amp;A.' You sighed and let your wings and tail go so they could flex and remove any doubts of what and who you are. 'Before I start with them, do you have something else?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I only came here to make sure my investments were well and growing.' He stated then stormed out of the room. It was hard to read him but you had been use to such things from others so you knew a back handed compliment/concern when you heard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, you' know him?' Syrus said, he obviously didn't know what to ask first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I kind of crash landed into his office. Made a big mess and all that. He was kind enough to get me started around here and make my Duel disk.' You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok Max, I think it is time for you to tell us what is going on. We still have a few holes to fill.' Doctor Crowler said, but when you looked over to him he flinched at your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If they told you everything and you saw my' other side, than what other questions do you have?' You asked as you flexed your wings a little and your tail was draped but swaying off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you really that kick but dragon?' Jaden asked as his excitement burst and lost all sense of subtle insertion into the conversation. You activated your duel disk and drew you out of it before returning the disk to its closed state. Then handed the card to him. He took it with even more care than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Look at the eyes and the tail, wings are a little hard to see the subtle differences. Then look at mine.' You instructed as you brought your tail up, flattened it, then let your eyes glow like your image in the picture. Being as he could hear monster spirits you roared through your card to get his attention. The roar was loud and obvious enough so that all in the room could hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That is so' cool!' Jaden started, first slow than with more excitement as he passed your card to the others so they could see. When it got to Zane he handed it to you and you made it disappear, sending it back to your hidden deck. You heard the door open and instantly retracted all your dragon parts so that the interrupting students didn't see anything then left, seeing all the high level teachers in the room. Not a lot of students prefer to be that close to such people, especially around this academy' and Crowler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I take it that you would prefer not to be known around the school for your dragon half.' Chancellor Shepard induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am sure that it will come out eventually. If for no other reason that trouble seems to be popping up all the time. But would like to keep the whole dragon thing a secret as long as I can. I don't need people around here to be afraid of be biting off their heads for walking past me the wrong way.' You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You wouldn't do that would you?' Alexis asked to which you looked over at her with the same gentle face you usually had with her. 'Just for the record' She added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok, just for the record' No, I wouldn't. It would take someone very evil and beyond saving for me to do something like that. Duel monsters and that area is one thing. They and I have an' understanding about dueling. I don't incinerate them and they respect me and come when I call. I won't even eat any of you for the sake of transportation or healing. I'm sure I covered why in the videos you watched.' You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, we heard. Those people were mean and disgusting to do such a thing. But' I am kind of glad that you don't and will not do it again. No offense, but I would like to stay on this side of your other side's teeth.' Syrus blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'None taken, I don't plan on using that form outside of duels anyway. Unless I get a little stiff, to which I'll just take a few laps to stretch out my other side. You can't imagine how cramped it feels in this small body for so long.' You said as you gave another stretch as if to emphasis the point. 'Have no fear, I will not be pushing that point in the slightest. Duel or no duel, I will not be swallowing, eating, killing, or in any way harming any of you. This is a peaceful world and I plan on living peacefully in it as long as I can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well said.' Zane added to which another round of fan and paranoid based questions started surfacing and lasted well into the late afternoon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn\u2019t believe that a whole year passed. While you still trained and improved as a ninja and with research for the Portal Jutsu you also were really enjoying the relative peace you had in this realm. You were able to stay on school grounds and move around as a dragon during the summer. When you weren\u2019t doing that you had your vault that you could stay in. But you really preferred the open sky and elements when relaxing, even if it was raining. You were so use to it that you really didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the new year started you were greeted with some returning friends. They were all glad to see you, which was a first for you. Even Sarah had her reservations about you, perhaps she was glad to see you at times but you always could feel that she had a little ping inside her emotions that feared you, regardless how calm she made you. Either way, it was good to be wanted as you were. Maybe it was the constant exposure to monsters in this game of Duel monsters but they really admired you, even the Chazz. But with Zane gone you had to find a new person to confide in. That may take longer but you were hoping one of them would be ok with it. They were friends but not as close as you\u2019d like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you, stop right there civilian.\u201d Came an authoritative voice that snapped you out of your concentration. A boy with a yellow vest and strange bandana was blocking the bridge. \u201cHey, where\u2019s your duel disk private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 who are you?\u201d You asked. Everyone knew about your duel disk. Even if they didn\u2019t know about your other side, word had gotten around about you having the big three in your deck as well as something more powerful. Your deck and your disk was more than known. So for this guy not to know was strange to say the least. Then again, you didn\u2019t know his name either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName is Sergeant Hassleberry, now your turn.\u201d He almost commanded. You were actually impressed at the instant presence he was giving off. You sniffed the air and picked up a scent you didn\u2019t know how to place. All you could tell was that it was old and as if it was grafted into him. Not like you but\u2026 it was a hard feeling to explain. He was just different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Max, just Max is fine. As for my duel disk\u2026 well, if you challenge me to a duel then I\u2019ll show you.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Serge, that is the guy we were telling you about. The one that can summon Exodia in one turn, that and he beat the mess out of 10 people at once last year when they tried to steal his deck. Maybe we should let this one go.\u201d Said one of the boys that looked to be following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he\u2019s the one with the dragon deck?\u201d Serge asked to which he received a few nods. \u201cIn that case\u2026 go on through soldier. Dragons are just as old as Dinosaurs, perhaps older. That qualifies you for a free pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You responded as you started walking. This one was weird. You were completely ready to kick this guy\u2019s teeth in or crush him in a duel. But he seemed to instinctually know you were higher than him. Your body was larger than his but not enough that it was intimidating him. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo doubt about it friend.\u201d He said then took off. Even though the word was just thrown out in a casual sense your mind locked onto the word \u2018friend\u2019, he just called you his friend. It may have been just a manner of speech but it lifted your spirits for the rest of the day, as you went about your business and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wait, dinosaurs\u2026\u2019 you thought to yourself as you walked. \u2018That is what he smelled like. But how could he smell like a Dino if he wasn\u2019t a half-breed. He wasn\u2019t a demon or any other kind of thing like that. With that mystery opening you walked off and accepted that it would be another good and relatively exciting year. At the very least, you would have a few more friends by year\u2019s end. Slowly but surely you were forgetting about the pain and suffering of your former life. You more than accepted this peace as the one you would like to stay in. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were at your spot on the edge of a cliff that looked over the rest of the island just relaxing. It was a good spot not only for the view and the ability to see almost anywhere on the island but also it was secluded enough to stretch your dragon parts, which you did on more than one occasion. Flying was reserved for night so the darkness could hide your body. But for now you were just relaxing and letting your other side out as much as you could without transforming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat never gets old.\u201d Came a voice from behind you, as you looked to see Alexis walking up. You retracted some of your less slightly things like teeth, claws, and scales so that she would be more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere to please.\u201d You stated with a flick of your tail as it coiled and swung happily. Obviously not enough to get anywhere near Alexis or concern her but still she saw it as a good sign. Then after a moment you looked out over the school and area again. It was a few seconds before Alexis sat beside you and her legs joined yours as they dangled over the edge. \u201cSo\u2026 what brings you all the way out here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I just stop by to say hi?\u201d she asked defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you can. But I can tell by your scent and heartbeat that something is bothering you.\u201d You replied as you looked over to her. At first she gave an offended look. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time you had brought up your keen nose. The first few came with a repercussional slap for any comment about her smell. But now she understood that you could smell much deeper than simple bad body odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I just can\u2019t stand this new Crowler thing.\u201d She started. \u201cI mean, what is his problem. I\u2019m actually surprised he hasn\u2019t use you as a publicity figure. Seeing as you can command any monster in the game and being one on top of it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Mr. Kaiba keeps that secret on a short leash with the faculty. Since he controls a majority of his salary, Crowler tends to do what he says.\u201d You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. He is just going too far. Did you see what he was going to have me wear?\u201d she asked as she held up a pink dress of sorts. \u201cCould you imagine me wearing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you would shred it before it had a chance. No offense, but it isn\u2019t exactly your style.\u201d You answered which seemed to be the answer she wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, all the boys that I try to talk to are either imaging me with it one and blushing, or like Jaden and too stupid to realize the point. That reminds me, what do you think about that Hasselbery guy?\u201d She responded back to you as she put the dress away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems ok. Kind of weird but then again I can\u2019t really be the judge on weirdness by human standards. He does add a bit of\u2026 structure I guess, to the group. We were missing the muscle bound meathead.\u201d You partially joked and she laughed a little for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now your turn.\u201d Alexis said, catching you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you asked what was up with me and that I had something on my mind. I\u2019ve talked about it and now it is your turn. The others may be to dim witted to see it but I can tell you changed a little. You seem more distant than usual.\u201d Alexis answered, putting the ball in your court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 ok. I\u2019ve been kind of lonely.\u201d You said more bluntly than you should\u2019ve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLonely? Why would you be lonely? You have all of us right?\u201d Alexis asked in an exasperated confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mean it that way. You\u2019ve all been wonderful, especially considering the welcome I usually get. This has been like a really long and pleasant vacation, despite being in school. Usually I have to fight, kill, eat, and claw my way through life. I greatly enjoy this new pace.\u201d You said defensively, your wings slightly spreading in that regard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why lonely?\u201d she asked, this time more concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 the first year Zane was here. He actually found out about me right away. I was able to talk and confide in him about the problems I was having. He had a rather unique way of taking in information. I could talk with him about anything between dueling strategy to feeding problems and\u2026 delicious scents I was picking up, tempting my dragon half.\u201d You started as you tried to choose words that were less offensive and such. \u201cI guess with him gone I\u2019ve lost that little bit of support I once had. I can\u2019t exactly speak with random people about how they taste and smell in relation to food without them getting insanely nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so you are missing Zane. But without him here, you don\u2019t have an outlet to talk about your dragon problems.\u201d Alexis stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that is pretty much it in a nut shell. So I guess I\u2019ve been distant because I\u2019ve been thinking on those things on my own.\u201d You concluded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were wide as she tried to process what you were asking. You looked away from her in a sad expression. \u201cThat is what I\u2019m talking about. You don\u2019t really trust me either. Sure, being friends with a Dragon is cool in theory and I have given my word that I would never harm any of you. But when something comes up like that, there are very few people I can just be openly honest about it. Even fewer that would not be affected emotionally by such a request. I can\u2019t ask you to be that person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence for a long while as you both thought about what you said. You were hoping that she wouldn\u2019t think of you more as a mindless beast because of the small confession you had hit her with. You didn\u2019t even want to look at her as you half expected her to get up and run. Your extra limbs drooped as you thought about it. Every minute was agonizing as you waited for her reaction. She was a smart girl and there was more going on in her head than what appeared on the surface. You could easily read her mind if you wanted but you thought that would be going in the opposite direction as trust would be. You could hear her heart race then calm and race again as she thought about what was going on. Usually it wasn\u2019t like this. But You waited patiently as she processed the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it would be fine.\u201d She finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked in an open confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be fine if you wanted to taste me.\u201d She stated more clearly. You still weren\u2019t looking at her. You didn\u2019t want to at this point. Not for anything bad she did or you did but for a temporary foolish thought that this understanding version of Alexis would disappear if you made eye contact. This stopped as she turned your head with her hand on your chin to meet her gaze. \u201cI trust you Max, now trust me. I can handle anything you throw at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you\u2019re still scared. I can hear your heartbeat. You sound like a race horse that just chugged a gallon of Red Bull.\u201d You clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I am scared. I\u2019ve never been in a dragon\u2019s mouth before. But I trust you that you would not harm me. If you really wanted to eat me than you could do it without my permission. So you aren\u2019t some mindless beast that is just looking for a tasty meal. You are just curious and I\u2019ll make you a deal. If you trust me then I\u2019ll trust you. Deal?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d You agreed after a long session of you looking deep into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get it over with.\u201d She instructed to which you cocked your head as if to ask what she meant. \u201cThe whole tasting thing.\u201d You thought about it for a moment then just brought up her arm and took a lick of it before putting it back down. \u201cWhat, that\u2019s it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now, I can\u2019t transform in the middle of the day. People might see a large black dragon in the middle of the day. I\u2019ll do it later, if you\u2019re still ok with it.\u201d You answered. To which she stared at you then started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 you are one strange fellow. But you\u2019re too good looking to stay mad at.\u201d She said as she hugged rather informally into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re look pretty good yourself.\u201d You commented back as you closed your wings around her and you in a more complete hug. She felt it and was uncomfortable for a moment but just snuggled into you and accepted. \u201cHey Alexis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d she asked back as she looked up to your face from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You said softly and almost as a purr as she stroked your chest a little. She just smiled and rested in your embrace and you in hers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were going great for a while\u2026 until Jaden lost in a duel and something started messing with his head. You tried helping but it wasn\u2019t a problem you had any knowledge on so you couldn\u2019t do more than support him until he left for somewhere. You didn\u2019t really know where he went. It was as if he had fallen off the face of the earth. His scent simply vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the flip side, you and Alexis were really close. She really lived up to her promise and you were more than happy to trust her in return. Even after a slightly sensual time of you tasting her and her begging you to swallow her in the heat of the moment. You of course didn\u2019t and she apologized for asking you to. She knew by now that you would never do it. Even if you could make it safe and more than enjoyable, she didn\u2019t bother asking as she was given a more in depth description of what you went through on that end. Either way, you were more than a little connected to them and more specifically her. Jaden being down was an emotional drain to be sure. But you didn\u2019t know what you would do if Alexis joined the club of the mindlessly distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you.\u201d said a voice as you cooled off from training a little outside. Obviously nothing to fancy but enough to wow any who watched\u2026 which wasn\u2019t much as they seemed to be in awe of anything slightly escalated. It wasn\u2019t like any of them were anywhere near a ninja strength level. You slipped your shirt on and looked over to see the infamous Aster Phoenix coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does the new school mascot want with me?\u201d You asked in a bored tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to duel you.\u201d He stated in a commanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a hike, little boy.\u201d You returned that got him to slightly stagger at the words. It was obvious that no one spoke to him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t be serious. Do you even know who I am?\u201d Aster asked in an exasperated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little pipsqueak that thinks he can judge others as if he knows everything. I have no time for such an arrogant fool. If you want to pick on someone then go pick on someone who gives a damn.\u201d You answered, again he was blown back slightly by what you said and how you said it. Then his eyes turned to a combination of anger and furry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can talk to ME like that?\u201d He exclaimed as he made a move to you in an attempt to land a physical blow. This slightly surprised you. Normally people in this realm dealt with everything with dueling each other. This was one of the first times that someone tried to physically harm you. But your surprise didn\u2019t impede your highly trained and toned body. With one deathly quick move you brushed aside his incoming hand then used your other one to grab a hold on his throat, lifting him up but not putting enough pressure to bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do about it, pipsqueak?\u201d You asked as he dangled from your grasp and tried to force your hand to let him go. \u201cYou think you are so strong? You are nothing. You prey on the weaknesses of others to expose good people to your misguided set of morals. Then when you don\u2019t get your way you show your childish nature by throwing a fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He begged as he finally stopped trying to force his way out of your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all rights I should kill you. But you aren\u2019t worth it.\u201d You said then released him to which he slumped into a sprawled out mess facing up at your towering form. \u201cDueling may be your life but combat is mine. Run along pipsqueak, while I still allow it.\u201d You finished to which the dirtied and frenzied Aster Phoenix scrambled away. You smelled that he had soiled his pants and wet himself. In fact, the only thing he didn\u2019t do was go scream like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!!!\u201d Came Aster\u2019s voice as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScratch that thought.\u201d You said out loud as his scream was remarkably girl like. You huffed a small laugh as you turned and went into the forest to sleep under the stars again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the young dragon boy that I\u2019ve heard so much about.\u201d Said a voice from an approaching person that you had seen as Aster\u2019s manager. Didn\u2019t think much of him and his stench was something you definitely didn\u2019t like. Something about him just seemed wrong. But you had more than prepared and was careful not to show any dragon characteristics, yet. So you wondered if that was just a nickname or if he actually knew about you. If he did you then wondered who told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told your little pipsqueak. I don\u2019t waste time on arrogant fools like yourself. So what do you want?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you obviously. Rumor from some of my servants is that you are actually a dragon, a duelist, a ninja, and the most powerful duel monster in the game. I\u2019ve also heard you defeated all the sacred beasts in one attack.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone with halfway decent connections could get that information. If I didn\u2019t want people to know about me than you wouldn\u2019t have found out. If you actually believe the rumors than you should know that I have ways of silencing people, permanently.\u201d You warned as you stood and faced the strange man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you do, but I am destined for greater things than to be digesting in a dragons gut. And you are destined to help me get it.\u201d He replied and although he had brave words you could sense he was on the verge of bolting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho ever said I had to eat you? I could just trap you in a genjutsu for a few days. You would be alive but tortured and half dead.\u201d You said as you grew some dragon parts and let your eyes glow. \u201cYou seem to be under the false assumption that you can force me to do something. I would run along if I were you. I am not one that looks for a fight in such a way. But push me too far and you will see how hard I can push back.\u201d You remarked back then started a genjutsu in which he was trapped in a swirling space with your dragon form snarling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He asked as he braced against the illusion. You allowed his mind inside your genjutsu to start running from your approaching form. It was a slow and methodical stalking and manipulation of his mind, driving him into a pit of fear before he fell and was about to get eaten by your illusion. At that point you dispelled the illusion and he collapsed in a similar position as his mind counterpart did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was a warning. Challenge me at your own peril. But let\u2019s be clear about one thing. I am not scared of you nor will I be compelled to do what you say, ever. So don\u2019t be so arrogant as to think that you can control me. You can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll happily prove it to you again, and again, and again.\u201d You responded as his clean white cloak was in the dirt with his quivering form before he used a similar escape tactic that Aster had done, minus the girlish screaming. As evidence to the similarity, his white pants were stained with a wet and brown stain traveling down his pant legs as he ran. You gave a courtesy snarl that you were fairly certain he could hear as you heard him yelp, trip, and continue fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t often that you relished the reaction of someone in such a manner. But with people like him, it was more fun than you would care to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d asked Alexis as she walked into the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could\u2019ve entertained him for a little longer. But I honestly don\u2019t care for conversations with arrogant guys or girls like him. At least he didn\u2019t throw a punch. I scared the crap out of Aster as well, literally. Plus, can you believe he wanted me to work for him?\u201d You answered, scratching your head in slight embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it was fun to see him scamper out of here like that.\u201d She said than you both sat down, you changing to a dragon first. It was night time so you could easily hide if someone came around. No one really came this far out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sense Jaden, can you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it is like he is completely gone. I can\u2019t find him anywhere. But I guess he\u2019ll come back when he is ready. If getting lost is the key to getting him back than I suppose I should let it be.\u201d You replied as you set your head down by her and she pet your snout as you spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, but I still miss him.\u201d She said to which she stopped her stoking and looked over the school with sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all miss him. I guess we wouldn\u2019t be that good of friends if we didn\u2019t. And I\u2019m sure he misses us.\u201d You replied and for a while you both just sat and laid there in silence as you both took in the sight. Every once in a while you both would see or hear something. Wither it be an after hour duel, a dorm room light, or a random animal, either way you both just sat there for the longest time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you mind if I\u2026 Well you know?\u201d Alexis asked as she stroked your scaly lips a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you keep your emotions in check this time. I don\u2019t need someone tempting me anymore to eat someone. Especially not the girl already in my mouth. You are so delicious it is hard not to do it off instinct and taste alone.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince your little session with the first tasting she sometimes asked to be tasted again. But one time she fell asleep on your nice warm and silky soft tongue. You didn\u2019t mind and it turned out not to be that hard to keep her safe while you were asleep. The biggest problem was when she woke up and started to pleasure herself on your tongue. The taste was great and you didn\u2019t mind her doing so as she was that age and you loved seeing her happy, even if it was only because she was horny. But when she commanded you to chew her up and grinded her foot on your teeth to produce some blood is when you spat her out rather harshly. You both had a very serious conversation about her actions and she apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I promise not to lose my head.\u201d She agreed as she used your snout to get up and started to remove her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had learned after the first time that dragon drool was insanely hard to remove from clothing. It stimulated healing in living tissue, not by much but enough for her skin and hair to be fine. Even if the smell had to be conditioned it was still better to not have her uniform along. Besides, she loved the feel of your tongue on her bare skin and the feeling was mutual\u2026 from the other way around. Without the taste of clothes she was absolutely delectable. Soon she stood to the side of your head completely naked. The first time she did that, she was too embarrassed to have you look at her. However she soon came out of that as she figured there that seeing her was actually a step down from tasting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk my delectable treat, in you go.\u201d You said then opened your jaws for her to enter. You felt her hand shortly after on one of your teeth as she admired you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, this scared me before. I can\u2019t imagine why when I think back. Each time we do this I am reminded how gentle you are. Each one of these could impale me with little trouble. Yet even in the heat of the moment you are the one to say no.\u201d She said then started to climb in until she rested on your tongue and snuggled into it. Letting its softness take her in and rubbing herself deep into it to give you the taste you were so desiring and drooling for. \u201cI hope I taste as good as you say I do. I can\u2019t imagine a safer or any other place I would rather be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You said, careful not to move her around too much as you spoke, or too loudly while she was in your jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I say you shouldn\u2019t speak with your mouth full?\u201d She asked in a teasing yet maternal tone of voice. You chuckled then started to gently taste her. You had found the more preferable positions she preferred and used them all as you tasted her body, letting out a ominous \u2018MMMmmm\u2026\u2019 as you did so. But eventually you both settled down and both fell asleep in your new favorite position with your most loyal friend trusting you so much it made you sleep peacefully, free of your usually constant nightmares. After all, how could you have nightmares with her delicious and trusting form in your mouth?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through a series of events the Slifer dorm was hanging on a thread and on the balance of a duel between Aster Phoenix and Alexis. Since the two in charge of the duel wanted it to happen they didn\u2019t allow you to duel. They all knew you and what you could do. Hassleberry had joined the group as well and you had found out that he actually had Dino DNA in his body from a bone that was grafted in him. However, Alexis remained as you closest friend by far. As you sat in the stands, Aster kept on giving you nervous glances. He was always conveniently absent when you were around but now Alexis could see what you meant when you said he was scared of you. But just as the duel was about to start, a familiar voice cut through the tension, Jaden\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaden.\u201d You said as you jumped down to meet him. Unlike Aster he was not scared of you but he did respect you greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, slightly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back.\u201d You said with a fist raised. It took him a second but he just smiled and knuckle pounded you. \u201cHe kicked your butt last time, you need any help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I got a whole new deck and a bunch of my new alien friends to help me.\u201d Jaden answered with such a straight face that you actually believed him. Combined with a feeling you were getting from his deck was the end of any doubt. You nodded then escorted Alexis to her seat and watched his duel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think his new cards are actually from outer space?\u201d asked Syris as you all watched. But since you were a duel monster, kind of, they asked you these kind of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it. Remember, I couldn\u2019t sense him at all before. It was as if he was wiped off the face of the earth. That and I formally met with every duel monster in the game and these are new to me. So, yes, I would say that there is a very high probability that he did do and get those from where he said.\u201d You answered to which you all watched and continued to talk while he dueled, mainly on how strange and different his deck was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after showing off his new deck and throwing out a few Jaden style remarks, he won and was back with the group again. You heard Aster go over and announce to Crowler and Bonaparte that he was staying at duel academy. He gave you a wary look before exiting. You pretended you didn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jaden, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d you asked as you all were almost back to your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d he stated in his usual unbiased tone, not to mention clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was wondering if I could have a chat with your new pals. I\u2019ve met almost every duel monster out there and I would like to formally introduce myself and they to me.\u201d You stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, what do I do?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust summon them with your duel disk and I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d You instructed to which he did so soon there were four new monsters in front of you, Neos being the strongest in terms of power. \u201cHello\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello to you as well. Who are you, young human?\u201d Asked the Dolphin looking one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am\u2026 well it would be easier just to show you.\u201d You stated then sprang out your own duel disk and summoned your dragon form. They understandably were quivering as it landed and turned it/your gaze to them. \u201cI am known as Max. I am a duel monster as well\u2026 in a manner of speaking. I am really a half-breed dragon so I can go from human to dragon and everything in between. I was able to convince Pegasus to make me into a card and a deck around me. So I\u2019ve made it a point to make contact with all the other monsters I know of. I also ask permission to replicate their cards if needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did the others say?\u201d asked Neos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Exodia, Slifer, Obelisk, and Ra were harder to convince. I actually had to beat the crap out of Exodia to get the respect. After that they are becoming pretty decent friends. Everyone else agreed\u2026 well except for the Sacred Beasts. I kind of got pissed at them for trying to steal my essence and charred them really good. They are currently locked underneath the school so I can\u2019t strike up a conversation with them. Anyway, I have more of a respect deal with the others.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with names like that trusting you I suppose we should as well.\u201d Said the scarab looking one with a nod from the others. You deactivated your duel disk so they weren\u2019t as intimidated by your colossal dragon form. \u201cWill you call us often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not. It looks like you picked Jaden. But if someone steals his deck or something I may make a copy to let him use, or I may. I have a deck that allows me to draw any card I need at any time. So usually I use the big three or Exodia. After that there is dragons then\u2026 well me I guess. But it helps if I have a working relationship with everyone else. That way if I end up facing you in a duel than we know to be more respectful than my just charring you to a crisp.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are honored by your consideration as well as your thought toward our\u2026 um\u2026 safety.\u201d Said the humming bird one as they all bowed and you returned one to which Jaden deactivated his disk and put them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they seem to be nice.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they are awesome. Can you really just create a copy of them?\u201d Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. I don\u2019t materialize cards that don\u2019t wished to be summoned by me. So if they were true to their agreement I should be able to.\u201d You said than materialized Neos out of thin air, to Jaden\u2019s amusement and Alexis\u2019 smile. The rest of them that couldn\u2019t see monster spirits had gone on ahead. After looking it over you dematerialized it. \u201cYep, looks like they will let me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t really fair, is it?\u201d Alexis pointed out. \u201cYou can essentially materialize any card in the world as you need it. So, in the middle of a duel you can just think of a card you need and then draw it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I can. I\u2019ve said it before. I am not a duelist anywhere near any of your calibers. I am at best a Duel monster and a friend. One that just happens to be able to interact with your side and duel myself. So I am the best at winning but far from the best duelist.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t want to duel me when I ask?\u201d Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Like Alexis said, it is kind of unfair. But if someone challenges me and I feel up for it, like those shadow riders or something, then I am more than happy to cream them. A little fact to, I can manipulate a deck my card is in as well. So if you put\u2026 me in your deck, I can force my way to the top no matter if you physically put me on the bottom. You simply have to communicate you want to draw me and you will. But that is on the rare occasion that I lend you my card, like against the sacred beasts.\u201d You answered and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got like the best life ever. I am friends with the strongest duel monster in the world.\u201d Jaden said with a cheer like tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, you are all my friends.\u201d You said as Alexis came over and gave you a side hug as you spoke to which you squeezed her fragile form gently to return the half embrace. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo, I already told you Chaz. I have no interest in dueling you.\u201d You said as he asked for the countless time. Actually he never asked, he more demanded and you just refused. He was trying to get you to join that Society of Light thing that Sartorius had come to lead personally. He still had that arrogant attitude but didn\u2019t dare challenge you directly. Aster was more fond of you as you seemed to make his former manager squirm. He found that as long as he wasn\u2019t being the arrogant fool you had described him as, he was more or less safe around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a deal then Max.\u201d Alexis stated. You had been rather cross that Chaz had dueled her and brought her over to \u2018the light\u2019. She didn\u2019t denounce you but she was very cold to you. She hadn\u2019t hit any of the emotional rejection buttons but she had made it clear she no longer wished to be anywhere near your dragon half. You chalked it up to Sartorius and his influence to the threat you posed. \u201cYou beat him this time and he won\u2019t challenge you again, at least not in relation to the Society of Light is concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr are you afraid of dueling a master like me.\u201d Chaz stated with a laugh but abruptly stopped as you looked intensely at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d You answered as you walked over to the playing field. It was in the arena as they seemed to have a superiority complex that forced their actions to always put themselves on pedestals. You would\u2019ve tried talking to Alexis but she just turned and walked to her seat, cold as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, good luck Max. You can do it.\u201d Jaden cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, who do you think you\u2019re talking to? But thanks for the support.\u201d You said with a smirk. He was well aware that Alexis\u2019 attitude was draining on you so those that were still left gave you support. Even those that didn\u2019t know about your other side would cheer as they were amazed at both the cards you had and definitely didn\u2019t like the new \u2018white dorm\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have been good enough to beat me before. But there is no way you can beat me now. Now that I have the light watching my back.\u201d Chaz stated in a cocky and arrogant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Aster, doesn\u2019t that whole arrogant thing get annoying?\u201d You asked back to him. He was beginning to see what you were referring to when you had not to subtly threatened to kill him way back. With that said you both got to your places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s duel!\u201d you both said. Sure it was a tad bit nerdy but you didn\u2019t really have anything else to let out aggression so you indulged a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go first.\u201d Chaz said with a demeaning tone as he drew. You didn\u2019t mind, you didn\u2019t need to go first to win. \u201cI play Armed Dragon Level 3 and place two face down cards. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d He stated to which you simply smirked as you drew your card and played it before he could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye face down cards.\u201d You said as your heavy storm did its work. Good thing as it was Mirror force and trap hole. \u201cIf it is ok with you. I\u2019m going to have a little fun and stick around for a bit. Instead of ending this in one turn like I usually do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine whatever.\u201d Chaz pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it goes. I play Mausoleum of the Emperor and an original from Pegasus named Dragon Compensation. So I don\u2019t have to pay 1000 life points per sacrifice as long as they go toward a monster that is either divine or dragon. Bringing me to my first guest.\u201d You said as you placed your selected monster on your duel disk. The ground seemed be coming apart and circuits were blowing as the summoning was proceeding. \u201cMeet Obelisk the Tormentor\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Chaz stated as the big guy rose out of the cracking ground and was accompanied by multiple effects and blown circuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing for you, he can\u2019t attack the same turn that Dragon\u2019s Compensation was activated so I place on card face down and let you go.\u201d You said. The card called \u2018god\u2019s protection\u2019. You were well aware that while the god cards were one of the supreme cards in the game under yours they were still vulnerable to some indirect effects. So this card was made just in case and of course only give to you. You nodded to Obelisk and he to you then stood with your arms crossed and waiting for the dumbfounded Chaz to make his move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He flinched at as he saw the gazes of both you and Obelisk baring down on him while drawing his next card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll just destroy your oversized puppet.\u201d He mocked that got Obelisk to do his version of a growl or battle noise. You didn\u2019t really know what to call the sound he made but it was more than effective in demonstrating his displeasure as Chaz used a combination of moves to bring Armed Dragon level 10 out and boost him about Obelisk\u2019s 4000 point mark. Your field spell card helped him in this goal. \u201cNow my dragon, attack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. I show my trap card \u2018god\u2019s protection\u2019. It allows me to activate one ability from one of the god cards. I choose his sacrifice ability. By sacrificing two monsters I can raise his attack points up to infinity. Luckily my spell card is still out so I have no shortage of sacrifices for him to use.\u201d You said as Obelisk reached down and grabbed two of the statues from the spell card to use. His blue skin tinted red as his power was overflowing and sky rocketing. \u201cNow I do believe your dragon was about to attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t attack!\u201d Chaz exclaimed in an attempt to stop his dragon from attacking the now powered up Obelisk. But it was no use as it let out its blast and Obelisk used its infamous \u2018fist of furry\u2019 to demolish both him and most of the remaining circuits that had survived his summoning. Obviously winning the duel in the same action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks buddy.\u201d You said up to Obelisk before he nodded and disappeared from the field, leaving in his wake a knocked out Chaz and a ruined dueling platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned and walked away from it as the others that knew you surrounded you and the others were silent in shock. They had heard about you using Slifer but most didn\u2019t believe you. Most common thing you used besides Exodia was Blue Eyes White Dragon or Red Eyes Black Dragon in relation or in addition to 5 headed dragon. Of course there more than enough of other dragons and cards you used in the course of the year and during tests but this was most unique to say the least. Even Sartorius was shocked out of his words while you had silently told Obelisk to take it easy on Chaz so to make him not think about insulting him again but wasn\u2019t injured that much. As evidence to this he was beginning to stir from his passed out state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan that was crazy!\u201d Jaden exclaimed as they got to you and joined you as you all walked out and leaving the Society of Light to their thoughts and shock. Alexis was the only one that had a head on her thoughts as she knew as awesome as that was that you had a more powerful card to play if you wished, you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo doubt soldier. You have some amazing and insanely strong soldiers in your deck.\u201d Husselberry agreed as he gave you a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did he challenge you again?\u201d joked Syrus, which caused you and the others traveling along side your group to laugh and understandably infuriate the Society of light that was left in defeat. Now there was two people they couldn\u2019t beat. If they hadn\u2019t figured out how impossible it was to defeat you before now than they sure as hell did now. The presence of one of the god cards does wonders for opening people\u2019s eyes too such a truth. It was crazy to challenge someone that had one in their deck, much more all three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed, monster.\u201d Alexis said to you as you all were tossed from the intended hotel. Obviously they couldn\u2019t physically force you but she more than mentally compromised you with that little phrase. And with a threat to expose your secret to the world you were restricted out of Kaiba land as well. You couldn\u2019t do anything as they all went their separate ways and you were left alone at the docks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jaden had walked around all day with Syrus and the others that weren\u2019t in the Society of Light. It was fun to see a self guided tour of things that happened. But it was even more enjoyable for you to see how Jaden\u2019s face lit up at each sight and when you all met Yugi\u2019s Grandfather. He was a funny old man to talk to, especially watching Bastion try to explain things to the old man over, and over, and over again. But now that you had been restricted to the docks by emotional turmoil and blackmail your time was spent. You just laid on the dock, staring up at the sky with the same longing look to fly in its endless expanse. It always made you feel better when you could let loose and fly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn I hate being all alone.\u201d You said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Came a voice, unmistakably female but your senses couldn\u2019t detect anyone around you. You decided to remain quiet and still until the voice\u2019s owner came forth. You didn\u2019t have to wait long as your wrist glowed and a light shot from it and landed beside you. Shortly after you saw a large white dragon that you knew to be Blue Eyes White Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when do you talk the human tongue?\u201d you asked with a glare. It was fine when they were in your deck but this was the first time a duel monster had searched for you and approached. Not to mention\u2026 she, was a dragon. Didn\u2019t really matter that she was only there in spirit form but they all knew rather well of your dislike for dragons, despite being one yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been around for a long time. Please don\u2019t be angry with me, it just looked like you needed a boost.\u201d She said as she was understandably nervous just reclined as she was next to you. You had beat the crap out of more than a few duel monsters and was particularly vicious with Slifer and Ra when you had made contact. Regardless how strong she was, she didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near your bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they all sent you?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no. Truth is\u2026 they were all too afraid to come with. That and the gods are too powerful to come over without causing all kinds of problems. So they were just going to leave it alone but I couldn\u2019t. You have been summoning me almost as much as Seto Kaiba does. So\u2026 well I\u2019ve become more connected with you. It isn\u2019t often a superior dragon summons me so often, in either world. Usually it is either weak humans, weak dragons, or abusive stronger ones. You are nice to me so I couldn\u2019t just leave you when you were so down.\u201d She explained. You looked into her eyes as she nervously looked at you, away, then back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remind me of someone I use to know. You are significantly stronger but still, you have the same attitude.\u201d You said to which you looked back up into the sky as you remembered Kara. It had been a while since you thought about the past hells you left and people, dragon or otherwise, you left behind. \u201cShe was a good friend of mine. Respected life and was insanely loyal, even after I threatened to eat her a few times. So if you are even half the dragon she is\u2026 she was\u2026 then, thank you. I would love your company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be my honor to keep you company.\u201d She returned and scooted closer, now that it was ok for her to so. She laid her head so it was right next to where your human body laid. She saw your gaze at the sky, followed it then back down to you. \u201cYou miss the sky don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were flight restricted, wouldn\u2019t you? There isn\u2019t anything like soaring through the sky. But being that this a human filled world I have to wait until it is dark.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that isn\u2019t the source of you depression is it? I mean sure you are restricted to night flying and human during the day but it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d She asked, trying to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I think I just lost a very close friend. She said some rather hurtful things that she promised never to even think. Worse of all, I think she meant them.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it she was one of your human companions?\u201d She asked to which you nodded. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t she say is more like it. I think the lightest thing she said was refer to me as a monster. I\u2019m not talking about our duel relationship with the humans of this world but as a person. She was close enough to know all of my emotional buttons and she used all of them on the negative side.\u201d you revealed and some latent tears came from your eye and dripped down until they felt to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I understand from the other monsters correctly, it is all due to that \u2018Society of Light\u2019 thing. It is messing with the human\u2019s heads. She probably doesn\u2019t really think that.\u201d Blue eyes replied in an uplifted tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I checked by reading her mind. While the extra influence helped her voice her thoughts, she always had them. Until now they were being pushed down by her kind and gentle nature. But now she doesn\u2019t care and just lets it all out. Even when she comes back, it won\u2019t be the same.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be here. I won\u2019t lie, we are all scared of you. But we are willing to look past that if you let us\u2026 well some us anyway. Personally, it felt good to see you kick those ignorant Sacred Beasts back a few. At the very least, I can help with your dragon side\u2026 a little. Maybe you can teach me a few things and I can be there for you\u2026 when I\u2019m not being summoned by Seto that is.\u201d She offered, again, in an escalated tone to uplift you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because she was a light creature but you felt loads better and you both continued talking until she was forced to leave by Kaiba\u2019s summoning and the student\u2019s returning. But you felt better, not good enough to face Alexis but good enough to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhoa!\u201d said a voice, followed by a crash as you laid in your dragon from at night. You were at your spot and enjoying a clear night. Secretly you hoped Alexis or one of the others would come around. You rose your head to see who it was to find the spirit version of Blue Eyes White Dragon, again. This was the second time you\u2019d seen her out of duels, more accurately it was the second time she came to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlue Eyes White Dragon?\u201d You asked as you looked over to her, blinking your red eyes and speaking low enough to be sure no one else could hear. A 500 foot dragon has a pretty loud voice otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can just call me Blue for short if you want.\u201d She returned as she got up and walked over to you, laying down more in front of you and obviously lower than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Blue, what\u2019s up?\u201d You asked in a new form of exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t expecting to catch you in your Dragon form but I was hoping to talk for a bit. Not a lot of others on the other side come around when so many are dueling. I\u2019m lucky as there is only copies with you and Seto Kaiba. But either way, I can only have a segmented conversation with the others at best. You\u2019re the only one left that will talk with me, or that wants to talk with me.\u201d She explained, the last part in a more sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to talk to you? You\u2019re beautiful, smart, powerful, and seem nice to me.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d She said, her scales slightly blushing at the compliment. Maybe it was fear or infatuation for your dragon body but she seemed more shy then last time. \u201cBut that is the problem. Most smaller monsters are either too irritating to talk to, or to scared I\u2019ll eat them to come near.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand the feeling.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t have the other problem as well. My other problem is that the only ones left that don\u2019t fear me or are decent to talk to are too powerful to waste time on me. Some are nice but are too far away to see every day. So I end up in segmented relationships and alone most of the time. That is why I love helping out Seto or you whenever I can. But Seto is to proud to have a conversation with me. So, as bad as this sounds, you are the only one that I can talk to. I don\u2019t mean that as to say you are my last choice. But being the only one makes these visits special to me.\u201d She finished, saying the last part faster so she didn\u2019t upset you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it is nice to speak with another dragon. As relational as they can get, humans can be a little dense to say the least. Worth getting to know and being friends with but the change is welcomed none the less.\u201d You replied back. \u201cAlthough, I have a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what is it?\u201d she responded cheerfully. Interesting since her demeanor in duels was so fierce that she was never pegged for female. But now she seemed more gentle then Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is only one of you than how do you change to Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon? I only ask because when I change it hurts a lot. I was wondering if I cause any pain when I bring that form out.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt hurts when you transform?\u201d she asked, almost stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed it does. Changing from a human to a dragon or vise versa is not a small change. My body has to forcibly rip itself apart while trying to heal itself to make the change. That is why I am glad Mr. Pegasus made a card so I don\u2019t have to do so every time I wish to show someone. Now your turn.\u201d You answered than switched the focus on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d She said then changed to a Blue Eyes Ultimate then back to her normal form. \u201cI can change effortlessly. Although it does use more energy to go around at such a size. So I prefer my normal form. Plus the other dragons say I look to vicious like that.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a relief. I would hate to cause you any pain just to win a card duel. But I can\u2019t imagine how weird it feels to have your essence shared with multiple copies at the same time. I have only one and it already is more than a strange feeling.\u201d You sighed then added the last bit as a mode of conversation for her to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually like it. Granted I wouldn\u2019t like being split into hundreds of cards but I like that I am needed so much. It makes me feel\u2026 important I guess. Although when three of me are on the field at the same time, it is slightly comical. I have to stop myself from laughing and keep the ferocious act up.\u201d She said with a growling form of a giggle as she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pleased you that she was happy with you. While you hoped Alexis would come back you were far from lonely with Blue there. Maybe you could get her and Jaden\u2019s monsters to talk, so she could get some more friends. But for now you settled for being the one.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While hanging out with Blue Eyes was interesting you still had school. You were also pleasantly surprised when both a tournament started and when you caught Chumley\u2019s scent. But what bothered you was that you also sensed the Winged Dragon of Ra a few times. You met with the big guy and found out in not to many words that someone was summoning him and forcing him to duel. Just as you were about to go searching you were called to Shepards office. You walked in as Jaden was done figuring out what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there.\u201d Pegasus greeted \u201cI trust that everything is going well with my favorite half-breed.\u201d Him calling you a half-breed was overlooked for two reasons. One, you owed him a lot for creating your deck. Two, he seemed to make nicknames for everyone so you knew he didn\u2019t mean anything by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing alright. It is good to see you Mr. Pegasus. To what do we owe the pleasure?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone stole the Winged Dragon of Ra!\u201d Jaden exclaimed before anyone could say it any more subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, he came to me and told me such when I was visiting with Blue Eyes. Since I have him in my deck he asked for my help. Apparently whomever is using him is using a card to make a slave out of him. I ripped on him a little for letting someone control him like that but in the end I agreed to help. So what does it look like on this end?\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must rock to talk with the gods like that.\u201d Chumley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Chumley, yeah it is\u2026 interesting to say the least. But they don\u2019t speak human language to good so dragon tongue is all he can speak.\u201d You agreed and greeted him. He seemed to brighten when you spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting back on topic, my company\u2019s top researcher stole the copy of Ra we had. His name is Franz and we don\u2019t know why he did it. Would you mind helping finding him without\u2026 well punishing him? I have a feeling that when Ra is eventually able to retaliate the result won\u2019t look pretty on his end, or on mine for that matter.\u201d Pegasus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, like I said, I already told Ra I would help track his card down. Chancellor Shepard, do you mind if I use my card to duel when we find him?\u201d You asked. After Obelisk destroyed the duel arena Shepard had requested that you ask him before summoning anything near that level again. In return he allowed you emergency judgment and the authority to refuse duels that you didn\u2019t deem worthy. It was more of courtesy than a rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, you may. Just keep the match outside so that the school isn\u2019t damaged. I don\u2019t need and Egyptian god and you tearing the place down.\u201d He agreed and requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d You said and got a sigh of relief from him before looking to the group that seemed to be ready to track with you. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go find Ra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Max, you really think you can handle Ra?\u201d asked Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Even though the big three are at the top of the mountain they have their weaknesses. And I am stronger than all three so\u2026 yeah, I think I should be able to go head to head with him.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while Max boy. I almost forgot that you are really a duel monster.\u201d Pegasus replied. \u201cAnd did I hear you say you were conversing with Blue Eyes White Dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. She gets lonely since only Mr. Kaiba and I are the only ones that can summon her. And let\u2019s face it, Mr. Kaiba wouldn\u2019t be caught dead talking with monster spirits. So she comes over and hangs out with me every once in a while, more so lately.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re friends with Blue eyes?\u201d asked Syrus in a stunned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. She came too cheer me up at Domino City when Alexis said all those things to me. Ever since then, we have been hanging out when I\u2019m alone. Not a lot of people can see monster spirits but she likes seeing be in full dragon form so I change and we talk at night\u2026 sometimes.\u201d You answered, a little sad when mentioning Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Max. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around eventually.\u201d Jaden said, full of optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know she will come back. But now that I know she at least thinks that stuff. I can\u2019t really ask her to be as close as we use to. I promised her that I wouldn\u2019t read her mind unless something like this happened. So when I did I found out that what she said is how she really feels. Granted she is to kind to say so out loud but the feelings are still there. Knowing that, I can still be friends but not as close as before.\u201d You responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow close were you and this young girl you are talking about?\u201d Pegasus asked, chiming in for a drama filled conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. As weird as this sounds, she let me taste her and slept in my mouth a few times. So\u2026 pretty close.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tasted her?!\u201d asked Jaden, voicing the concern and surprise from the rest of them out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah. We began talking and I told her more detail on what happened and with all the shadow realm injuries she thought it would be useful if I could swallow someone and heal them instantly. But I am too scared to do so. That and being a dragon it is hard for me to say that humans are delicious, much more act on it. I would never eat anyone but she offered to let me taste her and while doing so she hoped to get me over my little mental block\u2026 ok big mental block. So it wasn\u2019t like I was going to eat her or anything. But that was how much I thought our trust was. I like having someone I can talk to about things that other people would react bad to. For a while, that person was Alexis. But I don\u2019t think I can do so again.\u201d You stated, the first part in a tone to help them understand and the last part back to sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you trust us?\u201d asked Jaden asked, being the more outwardly vocal person in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust you as friends but not to that level. I mean I can tell you are still panicking about me saying humans taste good. If I can\u2019t say something as simple as that without you thinking that I would eat you than I can\u2019t really open up. It isn\u2019t a bad thing but when I open up to someone like Alexis then she turns the things against me like that. It proves that I can\u2019t really talk about that kind of stuff with humans. Luckily Blue Eyes is a dragon, so I can talk to her.\u201d You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was about to reply but something stopped him\u2026 which was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If there was any doubt he went on a tangent about Ra and how he stole him. You just watched as he ranted and was combated by Jaden and Pegasus. But finally his attention drifted to you. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend of the Winged Dragon of Ra. He asked me to help because of some stupid magic card you use to force him into submission. So here I am. So if you are done measuring your manlyhood or lack thereof, maybe we can get down to dueling.\u201d You answered which got him understandably heated, especially for the stuck up crowd he probably prided in being a part of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can take on an Egyptian god? Let\u2019s see you try.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve answered that question too many times today. So I\u2019ll just let my dueling do the talking. You\u2019ll need all the help you can get. So why don\u2019t you go first.\u201d You suggested as the others stood back and you activated your duel disk to him doing likewise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll regret that.\u201d He boasted and via a few well timed moves and special summoning three monsters he was able to bring out Ra on his first turn. \u201cLuckily for you, I can\u2019t attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have your card in your had to you?\u201d Asked Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d Asked Hassleberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019ve never seen him in dragon form or the card that Mr. Pegaus made depicting it have you?\u201d Asked Syrus to which he received a dumb shake. \u201cIf he draws his card on the first turn he can immediately summon it. Otherwise it takes 5 sacrifices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive!?\u201d Hassleberry asked/ exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gods are the most powerful cards in the game\u2026 except one.\u201d Said Pegasus to which he paused as they all turned their heads as you drew a card. The displacement of drawing your card caused a small shockwave of energy to disperse around. \u201cHis card, the Dark Hunter King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was already decorated with dark clouds because of Ra, which battled the light he gave off to disperse them. He was known as the \u2018the sun god\u2019 for a reason after all. But they returned and in greater numbers as you placed your card on your duel disk. Soon a distant roar could be heard then your dragon form broke through the clouds and landed on the field with a thud that caused all to quiver, and the follow up roar from your hologram form made Ra do the same and the rest to fall over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Franz asked as he got up and starred agape with the rest as his so called \u2018all powerful god\u2019 shook with fear. \u201cUh\u2026 I play a trap, the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway between his command you controlled your hologram body as it gave a roar and destroyed all his spell and trap cards, including the one holding Ra down. It also forced the relatively frail man to his knee as he braced himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can still add my points to Ra.\u201d He said, trying to salvage his pride and the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Without your little chain card to force Ra he can refuse. Even if he didn\u2019t, I have 10,000 attack points and capable of raising it a great deal higher if I need to. Not to mention it is my turn so you can\u2019t activate his Phoenix mode\u2026 again, if he were to let you.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no way a card that powerful exists without my knowledge. Did you create that one in secret?\u201d he asked Pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, but only because\u2026 the original requested it to be made. He is like and more powerful then the gods or Exodia. Obviously people would seek it if they knew so all mention was limited to a very as needed basis. But make no mistake. Only this\u2026 young man can command him. You should not press this duel any further Franz. His attack is far worse than the gods are capable. You need to end it, now.\u201d Pehasus answered and advised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Man might\u2019ve disregarded his warning but he saw the general concern and truth in his face that made him pause before his decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think he has shown great restraint in not striking you down where you stand. Your magic card is no longer in play so he could easily do so.

He was well aware of what the hologram could do and this wasn\u2019t one of the things it was capable of. With that he fell down to his knees and looked up at him. \u201cI apologize to you and thank you for putting up with my selfishness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRa seemed to think it over as he looked down at the man. He then looked at you as if to gain advice. After all, even if he was summoned by humans every once in a while, he was just as lacking in their behavior as a majority of them would be. You nodded over to him and used your hologram that still stood over you to send him a response in a growling dragon speech. In short you told him to accept and take it easy on him. With that he ended in a roar then burst from the field in a flaming glory that was a spectacle for all to witness and left the stunned Franz in a kneeling shocked position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Pegasus asked you as Franz surrendered the duel and your card form was gone and hidden again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe agreed to take it easy on you. For no other reason than that you let him stretch his wings a little. But firmly suggests that you restrain from doing so again.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find out why some other time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After your little brush with Ra and all that no one wanted to duel you. Surprise\u2026 as no wanted to duel you anyway as they witnessed your duel with Chaz. With him back on your side and the others scared of you it was easy to rest in peace. You were able to speak with Jaden more as well as create a little zone so Blue Eyes could come and be seen by those that couldn\u2019t see monster spirits. Jaden was surprised when he found out that she was female and so nice. Hassleberry, Syrus, and Chaz were just amazed at yet another dragon that was talking\u2026 at times with them. But as they had curfews they couldn\u2019t be around all the time when she could. So it gave you a lot of alone time with her. Suffice to say that you two were getting close. It was common for you two to talk then she would watch over you while you slept in dragon form so that she could scare any threat off and warn you if necessary. This gave you more freedom to relax and get some much needed rest in the severely underused dragon form. It was one of those nights where she was watching over you and more so watching your colossal body sleep that an old friend came by. You immediately awoke but she told you to go back to sleep and you decided to listen to them and attempt to do so\u2026 if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can smell you, human.\u201d Said Blue Eyes as she lightly growled at an area that Zane\u2019s scent was coming from. He had arrived but was avoiding you thus far. He had not shown you any hostility like Alexis, so you just accepted his new turn in attitude and accepted he would also accept you in return. When he dueled Atticus you checked to make sure he was in control. After you determined he was you left his mind alone, as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware he had dragon friends.\u201d Can Zane\u2019s voice as he came from the woods into the clearing where you lay \u2018sleeping\u2019 and she lay near you so there was a cage over the edge and curved toward the opening into the area with her head and yours in the center so you both could just look the other way and take in the view or sleep with your senses toward the forest. \u201cLast I heard, he was more likely to tear other dragons in half rather than speak with them, much less sleep next to one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you know that much than you must be at least familiar to him and about him. But not every human he has shared his past with has remained an ally. I have proved to be his friend and supported him like only dragons can. So he graciously left the tearing me apart out of our relationship. Now your turn. Are you one of his friends or are you an enemy?\u201d Blue Eyes asked. Admittedly it was a question you wanted to know as well. With this new attitude he had, you weren\u2019t sure if he was really cross with all his old friends or just changed his style but still felt the same, more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I am as close as we use to be. But I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as an enemy either. At the very least I am one that respects him.\u201d Zane said back, interesting enough without sounding to scared of the very recognizable form of Blue Eye in front of him. Perhaps it was his new attitude or that her form was comparatively miniscule to yours. Either way you could tell he was holding together rather well. Even Pegasus was slightly put off by the sight of her, and he created her card. However he was surprised when she thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that puts you in the friend category. As long as you aren\u2019t planning to tell him off like that other human then you may approach.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for being so cautious Blue.\u201d You said in a groggy tone as you lifted your head and before you yawned some of your sleepiness away. \u201cHe is one of the first friends I made in this world. He kind of reminds me of Mr. Kaiba, sort of. Even has a similar monster choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard from his monsters while I was flying around. Cyber End Dragon can be rather particular and possessive when it comes to this human.\u201d Blue Eyes relented, as she accepted his status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs flattering as that is, I didn\u2019t come here for that. I came here to see an old friend and to duel quality opponents.\u201d Zane replied in a rather cold tone. \u201cBut what other human were you talking about? Did one of the others betray you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking. Alexis, she joined that Society of Light thing. It brainwashes people and what not.\u201d You replied but wasn\u2019t too fond of repeating the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat human girl has made it a point to destroy her connection to him. She has accused him of being nothing more than a heartless, blood thirsty, beast. A monster, not as you humans like to refer to us but as a person. And that is all the gentle stuff she has brought up. I have half a mind to send a white lightning attack over. But Max is too nice to allow such a thing.\u201d Blue eyes finished for you, perhaps not like you would say it but got the point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around.\u201d He said, in a rare form of civility in his new look. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you tried to duel me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Zane. I miss you around here. Everyone else is a little too\u2026 fruity and oblivious. Accept Blue of course.\u201d You started as you nuzzled Blue Eye then got back to the conversation. \u201cAs for why I\u2019m not dueling you. I trust you. Your new\u2026 attitude may not be a favorite but you are still you. And just like before, you are a duelist and I am not. There would be no reason to duel you. Someone like me that can pull any card I want, when I want is hardly a fair or even legitimate duel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d He said, remembering that was why he challenged Jaden instead of you for his last duel of the year, and his education. \u201cAnd when did you start seeing Blue Eyes White Dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little while ago. She caught me at a rough time and was able to cheer me up. Been friends ever since. No offense, but it is refreshing to talk to a dragon once in a while. As relational as you or the others can get, there is only a certain amount that can be said to a human about\u2026 dragon problems.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should be going.\u201d Zane said, reaching a stopping point in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that? Are you really going to stay in the woods, alone, or in one of the preppy dorms?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d He asked, back in his normal cold tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d You said as your eyes glowed more than usual as you materialized a room for him to sleep in. You remembered how his preferences were and gauged his body to better calibrate the room. \u201c\u2026 having a dragon as a friend has its perks. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not expecting you to spoon with Blue over here. Just thought that on the rare occasion you are hear I can make it a little less inconvenient for you. Can you honestly say you prefer to stay at the white reject dorm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d He relented after a little bit of silence. \u201cBut if you start singing campfire songs then I\u2019m out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo promises, and Blue snores.\u201d You joked to which you got a whack with her tail and for the first time you three were all laughing. You had a feeling that Zane didn\u2019t do a lot of that now days. You all settled down and you went back to sleep, with Blue Eyes watching over you and your old friend sleeping nearby. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During Jaden\u2019s dual with Alexis you watched with the rest of them. But under more verbal assaults, you were more or less forbidden to help him like the rest of them. So you just watched. Not that Jaden needed your help anyway. Your presence there helped a little as Jaden was able to use the things she was saying about you to help turn her around easier. Even if what she was saying was what she felt like underneath, her feelings and nature couldn\u2019t really agree with what she was forced to say. Wither it be subconscious guilt or whatever, she eventually cracked after Jaden beat her. You went down there with them to greet her coming back, although you were slightly at the back of the group. You wanted to support her but all of the times telling you to \u2018get out of my sight, friend eating freak\u2019 made you keep your distance on habit alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d she said as she hugged you. She didn\u2019t have any memories but she was missing you a bit. Unfortunately you had all of yours. So what usually got you to hold her in a more complete sense, she just got a one armed half hug to her full body attempt. \u201cHey, what\u2019s that about? Did I do something really bad when I was out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. You were just honest.\u201d You answered as she separated from you with a confused expression. It wasn\u2019t a small change to say the least. Usually when she did that you twirled her a little so her hold around your neck was all that kept her from falling off. Then you hugged her and sometimes, rarely, kissed her on the cheek. This was a subtle way for you to taste her like she wanted, back before her little mind lapse. But for you to be so distant and her not remembering what happened to make it like that was very confusing\u2026 and a little hurtful to her. You didn\u2019t mean to but your default smile that had no realism behind it also was a potential slap in the face. It was a clear indicator that you didn\u2019t trust her with the real answer and just used one that you used with the rest. \u201cNow that you are ok, I need to do\u2026 some things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left them there after knuckle pounding Jaden for his victory. As much as they were supporting you they also knew you really couldn\u2019t be around an uninformed Alexis at the moment. You could still hear them but just didn\u2019t pay attention as they continued the conversation while they went to a more\u2026 private setting to talk and ended up in Chaz\u2019s room at the red dorm. While you ended up at your spot. You could still hear them if you wished but tried to tune them out with not a lot of success. You were almost forced to listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that what I did to you guys and how I got brainwashed in the first place.\u201d She said while glaring at Chaz, making him sweat bullets and stutter out half completed apologies before she continued. \u201cBut you all still didn\u2019t tell me what happened with Max. It was like he didn\u2019t even recognize me, like I was just some random person or at most someone that knew about him by accident. He was there to support Jaden in rescuing me and me as indirectly but not much else. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 how to put this.\u201d started Atticus as he tried to figure out how to phrase it. There wasn\u2019t really a subtle way to say that she betrayed her giant dragon friend and he confides in a dragon from the duel monsters realm now. On top of that you had no intension of letting her get back to her previous status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust tell me!\u201d she said in a rather exasperated tone. She was getting tired of all this tiptoeing around the issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kinda destroyed him, in a way. I can\u2019t even repeat some of the things you said and none of them were nice.\u201d Hassleberry responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was brainwashed, he would\u2019ve seen that right?\u201d she defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Alexis, he saw the opposite.\u201d Jaden stated which got her head to snap to him in partial shock as she listened intently as he continued. \u201cYou started saying things like he was only your friend so he could eat you and other things that really made him depressed. At that point he entered your mind to reassure himself that it was all because of the brainwashing, like everyone else. What he found was that you actually thought that deep in your mind. You, apparently, were just too nice and accepting to let those thoughts grow. So in a sense you were only bluntly and antagonistically honest with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe told us how close you two were and that he trusted you with more than he should\u2019ve.\u201d Syris continued for the group but in a more hanged head expression. \u201cHe was really depressed for a while and feared telling us anything. Basically what you said was more than proof enough to keep him from telling us anything that he previously told you. So he found someone else to talk to and has more or less filled your old spot with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith who?\u201d Alexis asked, not the first emotion she was suffering from but the first she could get audibly out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell he spends most of his free time at his little spot on that hill looking over the school with Blue Eyes White Dragon, or Blue for short. He even puts up a little area where she can be seen and felt by us just as easy as we can feel him.\u201d Atticus replied. \u201cHe is now convinced, despite our attempts to get closer, that it is not right to put \u2018dragon problems\u2019 on us. He still hangs out with us and lets us hang out with him and Blue. But he far from confides in us like he does with her, or like he used to do with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t believe this. I\u2019m brainwashed and when I come to I find out I not only am partially responsible for almost destroying the world but also destroying my relationship with my closest friends. I have to go to him. I have make this right.\u201d She rambled off as she tried to wrap her head around what she, apparently, did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might not be a good idea right now.\u201d Said Hassleberry as he got between her and the door with his arms waving her away from both the idea and the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I need to go to him!\u201d she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right Alexis.\u201d Jaden agreed, which carried significantly more weight in it. \u201cMost nights Blue comes by and talks with him till he goes to sleep then watches over him. Considering you have been the source of a lot of pain for a while, I would say presenting yourself in front of his new protector and very loyal dragon friend is not a good idea. As it was yesterday Max was the only thing keeping her from blasting you from her spot. A white lightning attack from a Blue Eyes White Dragon could\u2019ve easily taken you out in the white dorm. I don\u2019t think she would allow you to approach\u2026 not right now anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation continued as you were too drained from all this to wait up for Blue to get there. So you changed to dragon form and went to bed right away. The nightmares were worse than usual with the distance conversation in your ears. That was until a white light came over your subconscious and almost literally chased away your negative thoughts and allowed you to sleep in peace. You didn\u2019t need to wake up to know the source. Blue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn\u2019t help but awaken as you sensed a hostile scent coming. It didn\u2019t do your mood much better to know that the scent was Alexis. Even your subconscious mind, regardless if she was back, was painting her as an enemy. The only thing keeping your from a few tears were the feeling of blue next to you. She actually had her head and neck resting on yours as much as she could. She was far too small to match your large body in any size sense. You remained asleep as she would just tell you to go back to sleep if you started moving around. So you waited and listened as Blue addressed the scent that was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you aren\u2019t very quiet and I haven\u2019t seen you before. Who are you?\u201d asked Blue as she glared at the approaching Alexis as she walked towards the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he not tell you what happened today?\u201d asked Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He was asleep when I arrived and I didn\u2019t want to wake him. He is rather cute when he is sleeping. But he was crying in his sleep when I arrived, so it couldn\u2019t have been good.\u201d Blue replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I\u2026 I was an old friend of his. Before I say anything else I would say that I was advised by the others not to come because of you. I did some things to Max that I am not proud of and they said that you wouldn\u2019t be too happy with me showing up. But I had to at least try to apologize.\u201d Alexis finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be that human that made him get all depressed when I first met him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she accused with a growl underlining her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, I can\u2019t remember what I did while I was brainwashed by the Society of Light. But I have no doubt that I am that person. My name is Alexis Rhodes. I know I am probably the last person he wants to see but I have to at least try and make up for what I did.\u201d Alexis said back in confirmation but in a way that made Blue think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake up for what you did? You weren\u2019t here to see the aftermath of whatever you did. Do you really think I would let someone like you get that close to him again? I have half a mind to bite you in half.\u201d Blur replied back. She was battling her nature and her closeness to you along with what you asked of her and your feelings on such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I offer myself as payment for my visit. If I cause any more damage than I will walk right into your jaws if you wish.\u201d Alexis replied, strangely serious at this point and more so than Blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal. Even if he may not like it I will protect him from you if I must. Tred very cautiously, little human.\u201d Blue accepted then nudged your snout gently with hers. You took this as a sign to wake up. It took a few prods but you finally opened your eyes sleepily. You might\u2019ve been listening but that didn\u2019t make you any less tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d You asked as you looked to blue\u2019s head that blocked your view of Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a human visitor. Brace yourself, it is that girl that said all those mean things to you.\u201d Blue reported to you. You rose your head and yawned out some of the sleep then came down to them to address Alexis as she stood there, considerably nervous as she realized what she just agreed to. She had doubted that she could successfully make up with you before. But now, if she didn\u2019t, she would be dealt with by Blue Eyes White Dragon. Entering a dragon\u2019s body under those conditions were not favorable to the way she use to do with you, a way she was convinced would never be open to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexis, how are you feeling?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 fine I guess. I came here to\u2026 to ask your forgiveness, and mercy. I realize, even in the indirect story the others told me, that I did exactly what I told you I wouldn\u2019t do. Mind slave or not, it shouldn\u2019t have mattered, I should\u2019ve known better. I am ashamed to say that I am the first person in this realm that has betrayed you and not in a small fashion. I don\u2019t expect to be as close as we were before. But do you have it in your deep heart to forgive me?\u201d Alexis asked as she took the frog pose for a bow to add sincerity to her request. You could see her shaking as she looked at the ground, waiting for your response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You shook your head and looked around. You were hazy and disoriented, obviously, but then got grounded as you heard and felt some familiar things. You were in a hospital bed, hooked up to an I.V. bag and such, with the beeps and other noises that you were listening to in the nurses station that you just left. But the odds of you being dropped from the portal into a hospital, never mind a bed in one... with meds hooked in... and no frantic people running around... not very likely. That meant that someone had to have found you and at least dropped you off at a hospital... that was nice of them... you hoped. You began looking and feeling around. You could see, hear, and feel a normal 21st century town for the most part. However, there was something strange about it... magic. Being the places you've been and what you are capable of, it wasn't the magic that was strange, it was the present magic. It was more of a magic that suppressed other magic and a host of other things, but not suppressing existing magic or enchantments... as if someone had developed this area as a sort of Matrix like prison for those of their choosing. You were obviously not with them when that happened, so it didn't effect you. Then again, the level you were feeling, it wouldn't do more than transport you, if used on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've awakened, finally.\" Said what looked like a very uptight woman. Your head snapped to her as she spoke. You didn't mean to be aggressive, but in your heightened state, it came across that way and she flinched just slightly. Most wouldn't have seen it, but you did. You were a highly trained dragon ninja after all. If you dragon senses didn't pick it up, your other training did. \"...and it seams like you're feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. A bit confused but otherwise unharmed. Why am I here? Where am I? Who are you?\" You asked in quick succession. You had thought about just letting her talk herself into such topics, but you didn't want to give this person, whomever it is, any indication that you were anything but a confused person that was there on accident. Definitely NOT a dragon from another realm that could kill her in a blink of an eye... or less than that if you felt so inclined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in a Hospital in Storybrooke. I am the Regina Mills, Mayor of this town, MY town.\" She answered, the last bit was a bit direct, as if flaunting her authority. You stared at her, thinking it unwise to glare at the moment. Under the circumstances, she had every right to be defensive. Although there was something about her that made your skin crawl a bit, like a threat that was underneath a smile, just teasing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...\" you started, then relaxed a little and addressed her more calmly. \"... I thank you for admitting me into your town's hospital, assuming it was you that put me here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you assume wrong. It was my son Henry that did that. If it wasn't for him, I'd have sent you out of here just as quickly as you appeared. I do not like strangers. So, as soon as you are feeling up to it...\" She corrected and answered. Although to this part she got closer as if ready to strike. This got you readjust, which she took as squirming, making her smirk and almost downright evil smirk. She dwelled in her amusement before finishing with, \"... get OUT of MY town. Have a nice day and please don't enjoy your time in Storybrooke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she spun on her heal and walked confidently out of the room and down the hall. She had a confidence as if she owned the place... which she very well could've. You didn't know why you were here, or where here was, but you planned to find out. Meanwhile, this Henry person, he may be someone to introduce yourself to, as he seemed to have a good enough heart to put you in a hospital, rather than leaving you or driving you out like his Mother seemed exceedingly willing to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought about what the Mayor had more demanded than asked you to do. It was HER town, apparently, but you were not really interested in doing as she commanded. She sounded more like those stuck up royals that you had known way back. More like a self entitled Queen than any kind of respectful Mayor. So, suffice to say, you decided to stick around. You checked yourself out of the hospital, after of course finding and destroying and additional records and samples of you. With that Mayor Lady and the magic you were feeling, you didn't want them to have access to your DNA. Even if you had no Dragon traces in it right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of the hospital and melted into the shadows, like a ninja would. You felt and saw many things that both made sense and didn't. Such as, a sign that had no reason for being broken, but was being repaired. Then you would come back the next day and find it \"broken\" in exactly the same way and the man fixing it the exact same way. Or buildings, that despite being void of direct magic, were magically sealed. Then seemingly random items that had obvious enchantments, to you anyway. Finally, time didn't seam to go anywhere with a high majority of the things. Not even ageing worked the way it was supposed to. The strangest person you saw was a guy named Mr. Gold. He owned a pawn shop in town, stocked full of almost all magical items and stuff that even you had to admit were impressive. He walked around with a limp and cane, despite not needing it, and had an insane feeling of darkness around him. His power too was hampered, but you could feel a massive reservoir of power underneath whatever seal or curse that was keeping it from surfacing. However, unlike everyone else, even though he acted the part, he remembered everything about wherever they were all from, which apparently not from whatever realm you all were living in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole situation was very strange. Then, there was the little boy named Henry, the Mayor's son. He would go to school, visit people, and generally be an overall good boy. Then he would run around with a book, read it, talk to people, then run around as if he found out something invaluable with an overly joyful look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you decided that you would stay in town. You quickly assessed what was used for currency, then found a small house to call your own. You were going to go for some kind of business, but thought that would attract far too much attention. Your place was a nice little two story house that had 3 rooms upstairs and a full bathroom, with 1 bedroom, a living room, 1 full bathroom, and a kitchen/dining room, then a full and undivided basement. You quickly paid for it and went to work on it. You didn't know how long this sense of people leaving you alone would last, but you were going to get as much done as possible. With the amount of ambient magic around, you needed to be ready. You treated the whole place with anti-magic enchants and barriers to prevent anyone or anything from intruding in any matter, even listening through the door would be impossible. Then you strengthened everything to withstand a great deal of damage, both magically and physically. Lastly you made an area in the basement that accessed a training and storage area that was invisible to anyone but you unless you allowed them access. With all the preparations done you were just in time to reach the door as a knock came to it. You barely had to guess who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to leave, NOT take up residence!\" The Mayor hollered at you. She had an accusing tone, as if to say 'how dare you disobey her every wish'. Typical pampered royal brat attitude. She obviously was used to getting her way. Definitely NOT being treated as if she was of no consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Madam Mayor, I checked to see if you truly owned the whole town. As I thought, you are just the Mayor. There was no law forbidding me from staying a while. So, regardless on your feelings on the matter, I think I will be staying for a time. I am sorry to say that you have no power to deport me for no other reason than your personal preference.\" You answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!... Just who do you think you are?!?\" She seemed to scream at you, seething openly about it. You couldn't believe it, a grown woman having a temper tantrum. Her office earned her some respect from you, but not her personally. You decided to play nice, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, my name is Max Drake. Good to meet you Madam Mayor!\" You greeted. By this point, there was a growing crowd to see what had the Mayor's undies in a twist. She seemed to see this and how you were reacting. She had no power to do anything at the moment. But for you to say it out loud and her admit it to herself was not a preferred feeling for her. She seethed, then changed to another grin, as if she just thought of something. You could read her mind, but you didn't see the point at the moment. Plus, you didn't need to. Her own laws were restraining her at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, You'll regret this.\" She said, as if satisfied at just having the last word and whatever she had thought of. She bounded out of your meager yard. It definitely wasn't much to look at from any angle, unless someone had a magical eye or knew about jutsu. You also used your knowledge and duel monster game to make some interesting additions. You smiled to yourself as you closed the door and went about your business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long after that when another knock came to your door. You opened it to see the person you actually wanted to talk to around here... actually you also wanted to talk to a few others but he was the number 1 on your list at present. Henry stood there clutching his book and looking at you excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Um... I'm Henry. You're looking better!\" He introduced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks to you.\" You said, then added a smile. He seemed to want to come in, so you moved aside and gestured for him to enter. He did so and promptly sat on a couch that was in the living room that was immediately inside the front door. You were in the middle of knocking out a wall to make the living room and bedroom on this level as one big room. He looked at that before he noticed that you had closed the door and sat on a couch directly opposite of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing, really. What was I supposed to do? Leave you in the street like that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the street? Is that where you found me?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I've never seen a stranger around here before! How'd you get into Storybrooke?\" He asked as if it was a huge thing. You had noticed that the border of the town was impossible to cross without magic. But most people had at least a little bit in them. It wouldn't take a very powerful wizard or magical being to enter. Then again, you weren't sure if humans in this realm had magic on default or not. The last one they did. Gave them the ability to interact with the shadow realm and duel monsters. It was definitely different around here. Perhaps it was harder than you thought for most to get into Storybrooke. Which meant that he probably had a bunch of questions on how you managed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry to burst your bubble Henry, but I don't really know how I got here. I was somewhere else and I just... woke up here, in the hospital that you were nice enough to take me to.\" You answered before he could ask, but you could tell that it just added to his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where are you from?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrecked your brain with how to answer truthfully, but also withhold the whole coming from another realm thing. You assumed that massively long range teleportation was better then a Dragon Ninja realm traveler duel monster of sorts. You were tempted to say 'Duel Academy' First. But you figured a well known country would be better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japan. I was going to a university there... well outside it a bit but still.\" You said. There, now it sounds like you were in college or something like that. He didn't look to have any ninja interrogation techniques to notice that he should press harder. His assumptions were good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" He said, visibly disappointed for some reason then brightened a little bit. \"... but you still randomly appeared out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what were you hoping for?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... promise not to laugh?\" He asked, you nodded. \"Well, I was hoping you were a prince or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or something?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it may sound strange, but I think that everyone in this town are from this story.\" he said, holding his book tightly. \"Heroes and Villians, Dragons and Dwarves. I was... well I was hoping you were something from here as well. No one here can remember who they are or where they are from. I have figured some of it out but, they are still in the dark.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" You said. This seamed a bit like a imagination gone overboard moment. But then again, you were a dragon, and this place was filled with a strange magic and feeling. He could be on to something. Still, the way he said it was a bit childish to be fact, at least at the moment. you could go either way as far as believing him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that of all the things that you have seen, done, and experienced, having a town cursed to become a 21st century non-magic, magic town was by far more believable. You looked at the eager boy in front of you. He smiled very wide, but more than that you saw a great hope, faith, and belief. You had seen it before, mainly with people that couldn't separate fiction from reality. Although, in this case, he was probably right. You decided to give the little kid the benefit of the doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, bud, tell me about this place and the people in it.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe me!?!\" He asked in an excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no reason to doubt you. Start jerking my chain though and I might, fair warning.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, he regaled you with great stories and their connection to the people that lived in the town. You smiled at how apparently innocent he and the stories were. Good always won, evil always lost, true love found each other, and magic was ever present. You almost growled at the mention of Maleficent. But held back, as you figured that the lady was a woman that could transform into a dragon, not the other way around. Still, you wouldn't mind ripping her head off if she made a wrong move, and for you and dragons a wrong move could be something as small as looking to intensely at an innocent. The fact that she was already designated as evil didn't help her case either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry also asked you questions about many things, but you didn't really feel comfortable letting him known anything too crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your memory will come back eventually, it always does.\" He said as you blocked yet another attempt at him prying into your past. You had a feeling that he was becoming suspicious but had no angle to find out the truth unless you told him.... or someone from another realm told him about you. Eventually he would find out, so you decided to tell him... just not this second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it will.\" You replied. Implying that he would hear about what he wanted in time, your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you going to help me defeat the evil queen?\" He asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" You said rather bluntly. So much so in fact that he almost fell over. He definitely dropped his book, which you caught and handed back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why not?\" He asked, astounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, for all her threats to me, she has yet to actually move against me or mine. I have rule that I mostly live by. If Someone doesn't mess with me or mine, then I let them be. It would be impolite to just go around demanding people change because I think so.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right. But I have to find a way to help the people around here. I have to find my Mom. Can you help with that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" You answered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, why not this time. I'm your friend right? Friends help friends out you know...?\" He reasoned. He kind of jumped the gun with calling the two of you friends. but, with the type of person he is, you didn't mind him as your first friend in this realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they do. But I know next to nothing about America and this place. I would be of no help. I'll help in other ways, getting you out of trouble if needed, but I can't help you FIND her. Make sense?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so...\" He replied back. What interested you most of this kid was that your answer didn't defeat him. He just got contemplative and inspired to \"save\" the town. You were liking this kid more and more. So, you had an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think about tattoos?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really my thing... but I suppose I'm not opposed... plus I think it would drive my Mom nuts, why?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a magical tattoo?\" You asked, your tone feeding his fantasy appetite just enough so that he would want to do it without asking questions, or too many at least. He did seem like a curious chatter box of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?!?\" He asked excitedly with a clear sign that he wanted one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, give me your hand then...\" You said, which he eagerly gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned it over so it was palm up and his fingers spread. You then did a few dozen hand signs in a flurry of moves with mixed magic in there. He couldn't see the energy, but he was so enthralled by your hand signs that he didn't mind. You then pointed at his hand and the magic infused jutsu threw a symbol on his palm. He flinched, as it stung for a second. His eyes bugged out as he saw the symbol of a Dark Hunter almost burn onto his hand then disappear. He stared at his hand as if was going to fall off, then stared at you for you to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is an emergency call button, kind of. If you are in actual trouble, like life and death trouble, and need me there, it will call me there. Odds of you needing it is very unlikely, but if you are going to save the world from evil queens, ogres, and dragons than you need some protection. Just be careful with whatever you're doing, alright.\" you said, putting a concerned hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it... and thanks!\" He said, still excited about the now invisible tattoo on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't know was that it wasn't just a call button, it was a type of magical summoning contract. It would allow you to appear at will by his side, and keep tabs on him. The more danger he got into, the more it would notify you. Sure, it had its quirks, but it would help you protect the little guy. Out of all the people and memories that you had seen so far, he was the one you didn't mind protecting.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, to be honest, were getting a bit bored, aside from hanging with Henry from time to time. The same thing happening over and over again was not inspiring you to do anything new. You tried to keep busy, but there was really only one other person, besides the Mayor, that seemed to not be on a constant loop, despite his actions to the contrary. After Henry ran away to find his Mom, you decided to pay this man a visit. Mainly because anytime you got close to his place Henry stopped you from going in. Saying that he was a \u2018Very Bad\u2019 guy. He gave you the lowdown from his book. You had to admit, if half the things were true about him from that book, then it both made sense and could cause you a slight amount of concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in front of \u201cMr. Gold\u2019s Pawnshop\u201d for a moment, watching him through the window and doors. Such small materials didn\u2019t impede your vision and senses. After you were sure that you wanted to confront him, you walked through the doors, giving the bell at the door a ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes. Can I help you? I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen you around before? New to the area?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d You responded with a small smirk. He was playing his part well, whatever that was. You smiled at him then looked around. As you suspected, a high majority if not everything in the shop was not what it appeared. Magic was everywhere here, but most was dormant, for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour name would be?\u201d Asked Mr. Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax. Nice to meet you Mr. Gold.\u201d You replied, stopping at a few of the more powerful artifacts in there before moving on. This, it seemed, didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d He asked pleasantly, with an underlining tone that implied that he didn\u2019t have time to waste on trivial matters and if you wanted something, you should not waste his time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo things actually. The First is to store something for me.\u201d You answered as you made your way to the table and register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what I do here.\u201d He said with a smirk that even you couldn\u2019t decipher the meaning behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. However, I have a feeling that you are the type of person that is into making deals. Plus, you have no idea what I am looking to keep here. I guarantee it is something you\u2019ve never seen the like of before\u2026 Ever.\u201d You replied with your own knowing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, what is it that you wish to store here?\u201d Mr. Gold asked, obviously curious but keeping a lid on how much so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese.\u201d You said as you placed your deck on the table, your card on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fictional card game for children?\u201d He asked with an almost offended tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think I have to tell YOU that there are some things that are more than they appear.\u201d You replied then took a materialized dagger out of your coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes bulged out then corrected, but he knew you saw him. For what you held was HIS dagger, with the name \u201cRumplestiltskin\u201d on its blade. He had trained himself well and didn\u2019t look where the real one was, but was obviously stuck. You laid the dagger on the table to which he picked it up then sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a dangerous game you\u2019re playing.\u201d Mr. Gold said as he handled the dagger copy then placed it carefully down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. I haven\u2019t threatened anything yet or blackmailed you. I just did that to prove a point and to get a level or respect from you. I may not know everything, as I am new to the area, but I\u2019m not an idiot either.\u201d You replied as if it was nothing, picking up the dagger and putting it back into your coat. You didn\u2019t use a coat very often, but this was a use for it. You\u2019d take it off after this. Plus, as a fully trained Dragon Ninja, you could hide daggers like that on your person quite easily. \u201cI\u2019ll dispose of that. No need to keep something like that around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 appreciate it.\u201d He said, still catching himself a bit. \u201cI hope you would know that I will store your item for you, but you can\u2019t see where.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that. As for what you are getting in return\u2026\u201d You said, then pulled out an enchanted blade with a dragon insignia on its blade and hilt. You laid it down on the table and let him pick it up. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a use for that at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to store your cards???\u201d He asked, skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, deal. What is your second thing that you need?\u201d Mr. Gold asked as he sheathed the blade and put it aside carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda goes with what I said before. I don\u2019t really get everything that is going on around here. But, I\u2019m going to be sticking around for a while. I can tell you are\u2026 well less than ordinary at the very least. So, a bit of mutual respect would be nice. I\u2019m not going to tell you about me until I want to, nor will I ask you to explain yourself. I\u2019m not really into the whole stabbing in the back thing either. If I have a problem with you or something you are doing, I\u2019ll tell you first, then confront you more\u2026 aggressively.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming that I know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026 Is there anything that you want me to steer clear of or want to say off the bat?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. You know the Mayor\u2019s son, Henry?\u201d You asked. Now getting a stronger whiff of him, you could tell they were related by the scent. But either he didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t want others to know that he knew. Either way, that wasn\u2019t why you brought him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d He answered bluntly, as if he knew everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think he is a rather unique kid that I have come to value\u2026\u201d You said, that part in a kind and carefree tone, then switched to a serious glare that actually got Mr. Gold to flinch. \u201c\u2026 Harm him and I\u2019ll make you wish you hadn\u2019t. I do believe that is clear enough for you, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe so, yes.\u201d Mr. Gold replied. He had flinched before, but obviously didn\u2019t like doing such things. Now his expression was that of someone that was saying, do what you will, if you dare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, that I got that out of the way\u2026\u201d You started in a lighter tone and expression. \u201c\u2026 I can leave my deck in your hands. Have a wonderful day Mr. Gold!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be seeing you around I suspect.\u201d He replied as you were leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be a fair prediction.\u201d You said with a smile, then exited his shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down the street and could feel his eyes watching you as you walked. You didn\u2019t know what would happen with that whole situation, but you hoped that his curious gaze was one of interest, not of spite. It was hard to tell with him, but for now you were good. You had a feeling that Henry was going to be the center of things of change, if he was right about the magic in this place.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You opened it to find Henry and a tall blonde woman at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Henry, I assume your trip to find your Mother was fruitful?\u201d You greeted and asked, then looked up from his face to hers with a pleasant greeting smile. \u201cGood morning Ma\u2019am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 good morning\u2026 Wait\u2026 you knew he was coming to find me, by himself?\u201d She asked, a bit angry and shocked. You could see why, but then again she wasn\u2019t seeing all the pieces of the situation yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you both come in and we can talk about it?\u201d You suggested, seeing as there were already a few people looking on. You looked passed her and saw, in the far distance, the clock had started working again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, ok\u2026\u201d The Woman agreed, to which Henry ran in and sat on one of the more comfy chairs that he had sat in a few times when he was over\u2026 ok, more than a few times, but still, he excitedly waited for everyone to join him. The woman followed him a bit, then nervously sat down in a seat next to him. \u201cWow\u2026 comfy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You answered as you finished shutting the door and joined them. \u201cHenry, introductions please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Henry responded, sitting up to do so. \u201cMax, this is my Mom, her name is Emma Swan. Mom, this is my friend Max\u2026 he doesn\u2019t really have a last name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to meet you, Max.\u201d Emma greeted with a hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, Miss. Swan.\u201d You greeted back, taking her hand and shaking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you let Henry come find me and didn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d Emma asked with an accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who would\u2019ve I told exactly?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis mother, the Mayor?\u201d She more stated than asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, have  you met her?\u201d You asked with an amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, not to keen on me staying in town. That one has a few screws loose.\u201d Emma responded, then saw what you were referring to. \u201cBut she is still his Mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, on both points. However, knowing that and knowing young Henry here. Do you think I would\u2019ve been able to stop him or tell anyone of consequence in time to do just that?\u201d You asked, spurring her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I get it.\u201d Emma replied, Henry just sitting and watching the exchange with a smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, I\u2019m not Henry\u2019s Father or family. I\u2019m his Friend, and that doesn\u2019t give me responsibility to judge or prevent his choices. If anything\u2026\u201d You said, then raised a fist for a knuckle pound, to which Henry happily met and sat back with a smile. \u201c\u2026 nice, job finding her by yourself bud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Henry responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that is\u2026 interesting\u2026 but do you know WHY he brought me back?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume he brought you back for 2 reasons. First, you are his Mother. Second, he says you are the savior.\u201d You answered, numbering off the reasons on your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 you believe it to?\u201d She asked, careful to not make the question sound like she didn\u2019t. She seemed to be \u2018playing along\u2019 with Henry, so she had to keep up the act while getting information from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is more like I haven\u2019t seen any evidence to the contrary. Henry has yet to lie to me, so I have no reason to doubt him. Then again, wither these people are Fairy Tale characters from a book or not, doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. In the end, it is more fun and safer to believe him than not. Plus\u2026 provided that it is all real as he describes it, it wouldn\u2019t be the weirdest thing I\u2019ve seen or heard about.\u201d You answered and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a way of looking at it I guess\u2026\u201d She said, still not willing to put her weight behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that she was barely holding onto her sanity with what was happening. But it also looked like she was clinging onto Henry, wither she knew it or not. Plus, the magic of this place seemed to be enticing her to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, what is the weirdest thing, if this is all true?\u201d She asked, catching that bit and prying to see what other surprises were going to reveal themselves to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, no offense, but if you aren\u2019t ready to hear what he just told you and believe it, then there really isn\u2019t any reason to assume you would be ready to hear things vastly stranger than that.\u201d You said in a sarcastic and logical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can handle it. You\u2019d be surprised what I can handle.\u201d She defended, obviously not keen on being underestimated, even if it was warranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet you can\u2019t. Let\u2019s just say that it this town isn\u2019t normal, than I am even less normal.\u201d You said, trying to say points that would make her drop it, but the opposite was happening. So, you decided to go with a different approach. \u201cHow about this? When you figure out what is going on in this town, then I\u2019ll give you a bit more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess that will do.\u201d Emma answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that she was not really buying it and defaulting back to what she knew. Humoring people until she got her footing would be the best bet, according to her. You couldn\u2019t really blame her, as she was rather thrown into this whole thing rather fast. Henry himself moved rather quickly on this stuff, and she was playing catch up. You had no doubt with the clock starting to move again, she would understand things in a short while. You were secretly glad that it would take a bit more until you had to actively participate in things. You weren\u2019t overly thrilled with turning into a dragon and starting that cycling again. Just an ordinary life was good enough for you. Of course you had a few instincts, and training that you felt like continuing, you still liked the lack of eventful conflict you had been a part of lately. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your sleep was undisturbed for a while. Well, to be more accurate, you couldn\u2019t wake up. Your sickness hit a peak because of your exertion so you couldn\u2019t wake up for a while. The only good thing about it was that you didn\u2019t dream while you were out. Normally people would see that as a bad thing. But in your case, with every dream being a replay of the betrayals of your past or your bad deeds, you basked in the relative peace that this rest and relaxation was giving you. Eventually your bliss of nothingness was interrupted, as you were cleansed of the sickness, by a loud banging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a truck was slamming into a metal cage. You could hear a yell of exertion then a loud \u201cBANG!\u201d as if a giant or something was trying to break out of a prison by force\u2026 and not getting anywhere. Then it hit you, prison? Why did it seem like you were in or around a prison? Duel academy didn\u2019t have any such facilities. Then as the rest of your senses started coming back you began to notice things. You were on a cold, hard, metal floor. You could hear the light breathing of others around you, lots of others, along with the heavy breathing of whomever was slamming against their cage then a larger set of lungs opposite that side of the room. You could smell that not a majority of the\u2026 people around you or in the immediate space were human. They had hints of something else or full on different scents all together. You didn\u2019t dare move or give away that you were awake for two reasons. First was that you didn\u2019t want to reveal yourself before you had effectively woken up, enough to move properly. The second was that your wings, tail, and probably your eyes were out. Other than that you were stripped of your cloths but thankfully not your duel disk, which was concealed in the titanium wrist band on your left arm. This was definitely not the same realm you knew. That much was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we try waking him up?\u201d asked a voice. You tried concentrating on recovering but with them so close it was hard not to hear what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen his kind before. He looks like a demon but the tail isn\u2019t spaded. Either way, we should keep our distance. You never know what Felarya has.\u201d Said another voice that was followed with some agreement from the others around you. Felarya? Was that where you were? Or was it the name of the world/ realm you were now on? From their speech you guessed it was. As there was not much variety in here\u2026 well, not to the degree the man that spoke was referring to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou talking about me over there?!\u201d yelled a loud voice from the direction of the slamming sound. You had to guess that whatever this female voice belonged to was fairly large. About as large as that giantess that you met back on Naruto\u2019s realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they are, they are probably speaking about how damn loud you\u2019re being. Can\u2019t you tell by now, belly dragger? All the banging in the world isn\u2019t going to get you out of that cage.\u201d Said another large voice that felt the same but a different hint and from the opposite side of the room as the other. This one was more controlled and calm when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! I\u2019ll do what I want you spider reject!\u201d Said the other with a hiss before slamming into whatever cage she was in. Obviously they were not friends and they were understandably separated, leaving only verbal attacks to be used on each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, he\u2019s getting up.\u201d Said a smaller voice, maybe a child of some kind. You must\u2019ve moved your tail or wings without thinking about it. Damn, they always gave you away. Like a dog wagging his tail, your extra appendages were linked to your emotions to an extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t going to get any more rest as is so you slowly started to get up. It started with just getting to your hands and knees but then you staggered to your feet then braced against the wall you had been placed near. You shook your head then opened your eyes, glancing around at the people around you. Although you didn\u2019t know if you could really call them people. There was about 10 humans but the rest were kind of like you. There was about another 10 of them that had cat like features as far as ears and a tail were concerned and probably other things if you got a closer look later. Another type near the 10 count as well were ones that looked human accept they had knife shaped ears and a more elegant complexion. There were two in the same cell that looked human from the top half but a snake tail replacing their feet. Then 3 that looked human but had almost clear wings on their back that fluttered as you looked at them like butterflies would. Outside your cage but in their own were two huge figures, well not by your standards but still compared to the rest in the room, huge. One was a 100 foot tall version of the snake ladies that were in the same cell as you. On the other side of the room was a slightly bigger but still around 100 feet woman but her lower half was that of a spider, tarantula maybe as it was hairy enough but also elegant to give you pause in that description. Finally you looked at something that was attached to your right arm. It was a white band that was near 1 inch thick with a crystal lit up on the top. You noticed they all had one on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mess with that if I were you. Last person in here that did ended up passed out, missing meal time.\u201d Said a knife ear man. You gave it a tap curiously then straightened then stretched a little before addressing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the warning.\u201d You said back as your wings came back to rest on your bare back. It seemed none of you had any more than a loin cloth as far as clothing were concerned and some of them didn\u2019t even have that, like the large ladies that were also looking at you but not as much as those in your cell. The cell you were in was against and as wide as the back wall of the room with 1 foot thick steel bars that were small enough apart to keep even a child inside. The other cells had relatively thicker bars and were on either side of the space in the middle of the room, far enough away from your cell so they couldn\u2019t do more than yell at each other but close enough to give the occupants of your cell a fearful apprehension of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least HE\u2026 has manners.\u201d Said a woman with the knife like ears as she glared at the human group. They seemed to glare back. Obviously there was some tension between species of this world. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d you started which snapped them out of their glare battles to look at their common mode of interest. \u201cWhere am I and, excuse my rudeness, what are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you don\u2019t know where you are?\u201d asked one of the cat people to which you shook your head. \u201cThat means you were a victim of the random portals that bring people here. Don\u2019t worry, it happens all the time\u2026 well maybe you should worry as this is easily the most dangerous world there is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDangerous for tasty things like you.\u201d Said the giant snake lady as she licked her lips. You got the distinct impression that with their half predator bodies came predator tendencies like eating those under or different than them. Then it hit you. You knew what these things were. Your genetic knowledge was giving you information on them. The snake people were Naga, the Spider people were Dridders, the winged people fairies, the cat people Nekos, the Knife ear people were Elves, then there was obviously humans. Most were species that were wiped out from your home realm many generations ago by the dragons. Their arrogance and pride didn\u2019t allow them to share their human meals with other predators so all the dragons killed and consumed the other predators. They were long extinct on your realm but here it was obviously not the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is one of the reasons why. Everything in Felarya wants to eat you and I do mean EVERYTHING. Plants, animals, giant predators, even the ground itself has traps to consume the unlucky prey they catch. There is even things lower than us that we eat, like Tomthumbs.\u201d Said one of the nekos as she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk that is interesting and unnerving. But you still haven\u2019t answered my question. Where am I, or we I guess? Is this a prison of some sort?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely, we are in the dark as much as you. We all started waking up a few hours ago and you were already here as were they.\u201d Said a human as he pointed a thumb at the two giant predators in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest we can tell it is some kind of lab or something. We have yet to see our captors but this is definitely not a prison.\u201d Said an Elf woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow enough about us. It looks like you recognize what each of us are. But what are you?\u201d asked a male fairy as his wings fluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 well I\u2019m a half breed. Half Dragon and half human.\u201d you started then paused. You didn\u2019t see the point in hiding that part as most of them were half human and half\u2026 something else as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd can you do magic?\u201d asked the female fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can, well not right now. Something seems to be blocking my magical power.\u201d You answered as you flexed your hand then opened it, trying to materialize something but only getting a light spark. It then made sense why you couldn\u2019t retract your dragon parts. If there was something sealing your magic then you wouldn\u2019t be able to protrude or retract any more than what was already out. It wasn\u2019t pure magic but magic was definitely an essential part of the process.  So without it, you wouldn\u2019t be able to go to dragon form. But you still had Chakra and your dragon based abilities.  \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese things seem to limit magic.\u201d Said a human that gave the appearance of a mage with his long white beard and old but wise persona. \u201cOtherwise we would\u2019ve broken out by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd none of you can get them off?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould we be here if we could? I would\u2019ve eaten you by now if I could. You may be a\u2026 Half-breed or whatever but you smell tasty to me.\u201d Said the giant Naga with a hungry but also playful look at you that got all the others to flinch except the giant Dridder on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment and I\u2019ll return it. You do smell delicious as well.\u201d you responded back as you took in a good sniff in her direction. She did smell very good. You didn\u2019t know what made you like her scent as a food dish; her willingness to eat people or the fact that you hadn\u2019t had a naga before. Your empty stomach and lack of sunlight could also have been playing a role in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you\u2019re a funny one. I like you already.\u201d Said the giant Dridder as she looked at the flustered response of the Giant Naga at your response. \u201cYou acting like you could eat us\u2026 funny guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, here to please\u2026 I guess. Might as well have some fun until we find out what our lovely hosts have in store for us. No reason to be afraid of something that may or may not even happen. I mean it would be a waste of time being scared of a stomach if they end up just shooting us or something.\u201d You said with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think they will?\u201d asked a child Neko asked as his eyes widened with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame difference really. Personally I would rather be eaten than be shot. No reason to give whomever put me in here the satisfaction of killing me themselves. But my point is there is no reason to fear death if you don\u2019t know what is going to happen. Besides worrying that much gives me wrinkles.\u201d You explained and joked the last part to get the little one to smile a little.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before any side could respond the lights got brighter as a door opened at the far side of the room. Shortly after a human male came in, stopped at a small table, deposited a clipboard, then took out a sort of controller as he walked in the middle of the two big cages until he was able to speak to everyone without yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome. I am Doctor Hasmond and I am here to tell you why you are all here.\u201d He said in a calm but arrogant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it is humans that captured us, I knew it.\u201d Said an Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh not just humans. I represent a company of Mercenaries made up of all species that provide muscle for hire to anyone willing to pay. We provide safe transportation through the jungles of Felarya and even lead buffets to paying predators.\u201d He countered to which it stopped the Naga from yelling an interruption. She was half angry why she was held in the cell but the other half intrigued at what she just heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d asked the Dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite simple really. We do research on predators of note to find ways to help our organization. The research about what you prefer to eat to how to best assassinate your kind.\u201d Doctor Hasmond responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why are we here?\u201d asked a Neko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would\u2019ve thought that obvious. If these two cooperate with the tests then they will be given something to eat. That is where you all come in. You will provide an ample food source until we can capture more prey to award the predators for their efforts. So, in case you still need a hint, you are here to feed them.\u201d Hasmond said as he waved a thumb at the two predators beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what makes you think that we will just let ourselves be eaten?\u201d asked a fairy. You watched silently as the conversation unfolded but the tension was obviously rising and understandably so. The Doctor didn\u2019t answer right away as he held up the controller and hit a button. Instantly you felt an electrical current running through your body. It was a strong one and ironically enough to replenish you reserves in place of sunlight. But as you saw the reaction of the others, you joined them in falling to the floor in pain. It was an act for you but it was clear that the current running through all of them, even the predators, was there to keep them obedient. No one was immune to this and everyone seemed to be begging for him to stop\u2026 well accept you. You were just acting. You had no idea what was going on in this new world. Then he pushed a button that took away the current and allowed everyone to recover before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, I am in control here. If you refuse what I say then it will happen in a much more painful way. Either way, I get what I want wither you accept it or not. That was the lowest setting. I can increase it until it is an instant kill for any of you.\u201d he said in warning to the two predators, who were panting at the conclusion of the physical assault done by this man. \u201cOh, in case you get any ideas. If I don\u2019t return to that table and punch out before the allotted time, a signal will be given to repeat that punishment until someone else comes down to turn it off, and that could be days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou son of a\u2026\u201d the giant Naga started but he hit a different button that shocked only her. He smirked as he watched her writhe on the ground, enjoying her pain perhaps a little too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I can\u2019t target individuals.\u201d He said after he turned it off and she turned her smitten face towards him. She was too tired at this point to say anything back. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll be back later on tonight to hand out food for the smaller of you and get samples from the predators. If you are good, I may even give you two of them instead of just one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant naga hissed defiantly at him but that was all she could do. He just smirked before pushing a few things on the table then left without his Clipboard. You immediately glanced through the pages from where you stood. It was the specifics and overall operations guide for the room. Apparently the wrist bands acted as a part of a two part system. The first was restraint. The restrained magic ability and allowed a current to enter the body in order to cause an effect like he had just done previously. The second part was to allow the people to phase through the bars. It wouldn\u2019t work on you so you wondered how they got you into the cell. But other than that it just gave instructions on how to work the controller, what band was for what person and all that. There also seemed to be a group security system. Like a magical shield around the bars. Even if someone could get out the shield and bars the sensors would render them unconscious or dead in seconds with a signal to the table that the Doctor referred to before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it seems we are stuck in here for a while.\u201d Said the giant Dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say. No offense, but I would rather not be eaten by you. At least you get to live.\u201d Said one of the Fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I think we got the better end of the deal.\u201d You stated to which everyone\u2019s heads snapped to you as you leaned against the wall behind you. \u201cThink about it. They are the ones that will be experimented on. Would you rather live as an expendable lab rat that will be killed slowly over the course of many years or months, or be eaten by one of them? Sure it stinks that it has to happen at all but at least we aren\u2019t the ones being prodded and tested. I mean do you think that a real experimentation will just be a few shots and samples of blood? Imagine if they need some of their skin or an organ to study. They could skin them alive and leave them just enough to heal before they do it again. Think of all the questions each of you have about each other and then imagine the ways to get those answers. That is what could happen to them. Like I said, I prefer being eaten. I suffer for what? Maybe a few hours verses a few years, not a hard choice.\u201d You ended as they thought on what you said. Perhaps the ones that thought of  the most was the predators as they seemed horrified by the prospect of what they imagined could happen to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have to be soon and timed just right if you wanted to save everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking on?\u201d asked the Dridder as she came over and sat against the bars close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Miss\u2026?\u201d you started, asking her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRudy\u201d she answered. \u201cYou?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d you responded before continuing. \u201cWell Rudy, I was thinking on how to get all of us out of here. But it is harder than I thought. I could just get me out but you all would die.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would?\u201d asked the Giant Naga to which you asked her name silently. \u201cCarol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can read that clipboard from here. In addition to the bars and magical barrier, there is a sensor. If one of us gets past it then all of us are shocked while the one that is out is either knocked unconscious or killed but these things.\u201d You revealed as you held up your wrist. \u201cIn the end, I could get everyone out but there is a few problems with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so before?\u201d Asked Rudy. This conversation started to attract the others as well, especially the part about you saving all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, we are all thinking about it aren\u2019t we?\u201d you asked back then looked away as if thinking out loud. \u201cThe main problem is these damn things. They are a nuisance to say the least. I don\u2019t know how to take them off. I\u2019ll have to read the Doctor\u2019s mind to get the answer. But that brings another problem. He is coming back to feed us. And at least two of us in this cell be fed to Rudy and Carol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you worried that you\u2019ll be the one?\u201d asked Carol seductively to which you just huffed with a comical smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a Half-breed. I can go from fully human to fully dragon at will, with a great deal of pain when switching. But that requires magic, which is why I am stuck in between right now. My dragon form is 500 feet tall and I lose none of my power or abilities as a human. So let\u2019s just say, you eating me is the last thing concerning me right now.\u201d You said with a little growl, the information was caused them all to give you a little more room, even if they didn\u2019t really believe it yet. \u201cNo, my point is; if I learn how to disable these things, then how am I supposed to disable the ones you eat? I am not about to be swallowed and risk being digested just to get something that you could\u2019ve just not have eaten. With them in there, you would still be in contact with them and be restricted as such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Rudy pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, if you don\u2019t eat whomever he says then you will be punished and be too weak to escape. The only way I see to do it is if you eat someone then bring them up and out afterwards. Come to think of it, other than that sensor and barrier, those bars on your cage are easy enough for us to pass through easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you saying? That we are going to have to get eaten by one of those\u2026 monsters?\u201d Asked an Elf with disgust. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave them here? That is what they deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep that up and you\u2019ll be my first meal.\u201d Hissed Carol which got the woman to stick up her nose but was scared to death on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs to answer your question. No I won\u2019t just leave them. And I wouldn\u2019t push too much. They can still digest you and spit up that bothersome wrist band to achieve the same effect.\u201d You warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Why would you save them?\u201d asked another person but this time a black skinned Neko with the same type of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a 500 foot dragon and you are arguing with me about predatory worth? I just arrived here so I can\u2019t just go around forcing my way. Well I can but I won\u2019t. This is how things are on this world, from what it looks like and you are all strangers. I do have a personal bias against eating people but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve never eaten someone before and will do so again. Don\u2019t tempt us. As for eating each other. Why don\u2019t we just wait until we get out? We can go our separate ways than you can eat and insult each other to your heart\u2019s content. Until then, let\u2019s work on getting out of here.\u201d You responded. The predators looked relieved that you said as much and looked to agree with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear that? After we get out of here I can hunt you down little Elf. I got your scent so don\u2019t expect mercy from me.\u201d Carol hissed which got the Elf to quiver into another at her folly and potential consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is that the plan? You read the Doctor\u2019s mind while we eat and bring back the people we eat to get the bracelets off?\u201d asked Rudy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the off chance the bracelets can attach to your insides it would make retrieving them a problem and, like I said, I am not going in after them.\u201d You responded to which the two wondered what another option was. \u201cHowever, I can use some ninja techniques to fool our good doctor into thinking as such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing what?\u201d asked Carol in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up and watch.\u201d You responded. You got up then performed the shadow clone jutsu. Then each of them went over to someone. One of them went over to a neko male and another a Elf Woman, looked them over, then walked back to you. They used a transformation jutsu to turn into a believable Neko and Elf, complete with wrist bands and all. \u201cAll you need to do is eat these two instead. They are called shadow clones. More or less fake replicas of me that act as I would in their situations. I will gain the knowledge they gain when they disappear like this.\u201d You stated and brought another out then had him poof away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we eat those then\u2026 what?\u201d asked Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile the Doctor is in I\u2019ll read his mind to find out how to remove these things. When that is done we\u2019ll all be able to use magic to bust out of here\u2026 Wait, I got a better idea.\u201d You said after thinking on it for a moment. \u201cWe will have to wait anyway to get out. So, we can wait for the Doctor to come back in the morning. He will probably bring some people with him. Once he opens the door I\u2019ll speed over to the other side and make sure it doesn\u2019t close. Then we\u2019ll have a bunch of snacks for the predators and some well deserved payback for whatever they do to us in the mean time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm. I\u2019m liking this plan more and more.\u201d Carol said as she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo am I?\u201d Rudy agreed with a similar expression. \u201cAnd I suppose there will be more than enough\u2026 snacks that get in our way on the way out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are\u2026\u201d the Elf from before started but wisely stopped then thought about it. One thing about Elves, that you knew from your genetic knowledge, you didn\u2019t want to cross one then have them live for you to regret it. \u201cI suppose they more than deserve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Maybe I won\u2019t hunt you.\u201d Carol giggled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what if they have weapons? Some of us aren\u2019t as tough as a giant predator.\u201d Said an older human as he held onto a young child that was obviously scared and whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I suppose some of you can ride on by back when I transform. But once we\u2019re all out, we go our separate ways. I\u2019m not flying you all to your homes or whatever. Got enough exploring to do without protecting strangers.\u201d You answered as you scratched your head nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t bluffing about you being a dragon?\u201d Carol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf dragon, and no I wasn\u2019t bluffing. Oh and if any of the people on my back decide to act arrogant and all that\u2026 well I might amend my bias against carrying you in my stomach.\u201d You said to which you glared at a few that you had heard talking in such a tone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell hello there my guests. How are you all doing today?\u201d asked the Doctor\u2026 huh, you didn\u2019t even bother remembering his name. Well odds were that he wouldn\u2019t be around much longer if either of the ladies had anything to say about it. He received obedient yet intensely angry glares from most of them, wrapped in fear of him using his little controller on them. \u201cI asked a question.\u201d He demanded with a smirk then activated the controller, sending everyone to their knees in pain. You started right away on mining his mind of not only the wrist bands but also any other information you would need; passwords, layout, guard strength, and other things that you didn\u2019t need to know but came with the package. He seemed to be getting a kick out of causing pain, especially to nonhumans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are doing just fine considering.\u201d Panted Rudy, as she was the only one besides you and your clones that would give a decent and believable response. The man kept looking at their naked bodies, obviously lingering on the human parts of interest and not subtly either. You could see most of them that were looked at in this way restraining from giving him a piece of their mind. Any hesitation on his soon to be fate were disregarded at this point, even but the children and especially from Carol, who had to bite her lip to keep from either yelling at him or licking her lips. You could see in her eyes that she was measuring him up. On the outside it seemed seductive and sexually suggestive but you knew that look all too well. The look of a predator eyeing up future prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Well all the other staff will be here in the morning so that is when we\u2019ll start the tests. Unfortunately they are also the ones that bring the food for the\u2026 other food.\u201d The Doctor said with a pause and grin as if egging someone to say something to allow him to punish them all again. You decided it would be a perfect way to get your clones picked as meals so they stood forward from each group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfair!\u201d Your Neko clone said, a classic and one that the Doctor was expecting. Carol and Rudy looked at you slightly so not to arise suspicion to which you winked at them. Thankfully they understood as the Doctor hit the button again, causing all of you to writhe in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t feed us to them if you aren\u2019t feeding us in return.\u201d Said your Elf Clone as if pleading but got the same result. You used your mind power, as you were downloading his memory, to give him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really, I think you two just volunteered.\u201d The Doctor stated and hit another button to which they were lifted by the bracelets as if they were being pulled up by wire. It would\u2019ve hurt a lot so the two clones started acting the part. They begged and pleaded for him not to do it as they were brought remarkably through the bars and into the Giant predators\u2019 cells then dropped a ways in front of each Carol and Rudy. Your clones gave a wink to each that only they could see before buttering it up more. Typical prey speech that you had heard over and over again. Things that were so convincing it had the children in your cell crying, forgetting what they were. To be fair you didn\u2019t explain it as well as you should\u2019ve. But they did a hell of a job acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell eat up girls, I love this part.\u201d He said as he signaled Carol to start first with a threat of the controller to further command her. She decided to add to the show and played with your clone by dangling him over her open mouth by his Neko tail while he begged pathetically. She smiled a little, unclear to you if it was a fake or real smile, then dropped him in. She tasted him for a while then made a show of her gulping him down, still struggling to give the man less reason to not like the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re next sweet heart. And none of that cocoon stuff while it is just me in here. I like seeing them squirm.\u201d He demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish. I\u2019m sorry young lady, but this is going to hurt a bit.\u201d She said to which your Elf woman clone screamed and similarly begged in a very believable sense. You had watched enough sacrifices to know what worked and what the perverted men in the villages liked to hear. You kept it real enough to Rudy\u2019s comforting to be believable and highly entertaining, as evidence to the tent growing in the Doctor\u2019s pants. Rudy slowly brought your clone up and wasted no time shoving her into her mouth, tasting her a little then swallowing. The clone worked hard to be noticed on the way down. \u201cWas that satisfactory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery, almost making me want to come in there to hear them scream in pain while they digest. But maybe another time. You two have a good night\u2026 oh and the rest of you\u2026 I hope you had a good look at what is in store for you.\u201d The Doctor stated as he gathered his things and headed out rather rushed. Most understood why as he pushed around the tent in his pants from being uncomfortable. As soon as he shut and sealed the door they all looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas all that necessary?\u201d asked Rudy, speaking of your clone\u2019s theatrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was trying to get him out of the room as quick as possible. Any less entertaining for him and he might\u2019ve fed more to the two of you until he reached the point of the need to jack off. I thought I did rather well, maybe a little over the top but still. It worked didn\u2019t it and I hope I didn\u2019t taste too bad\u2026 which reminds me.\u201d You concluded with a hand sign that made the two clones disappear. The experiences came to you as well and you found that it wasn\u2019t the most terrible thing in the world to get eaten. You had taken them out before digestion started, thank goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were delicious, for a Neko.\u201d Carol replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose you did well and did taste rather good.\u201d Rudy reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, can we get off the subject of being eaten?\u201d Asked that same damn Elf that was not rubbing you a good way. \u201cDid you get what you needed or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, I simply need to match and clone each of your bodies then sinc the frequency with the bracelet you have on. After that the bracelet can be removed and still be reading that you are attached to it, via the cloned arm. We can throw those anywhere and they\u2019ll disappear once I\u2019m out of here. This will also keep the rest of us from being shocked while they are being removed.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s do it, time\u2019s a wasting.\u201d Said the Elf. You shook your head a little then got to work. It would not be so easy and you could use a rest before the morning. So getting all them made and separated should be done as quick as possible. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, Max\u2026\u201d came a voice as you woke. You had successfully replaced and removed all their wrist bands but then took a nap to regain some strength. The voice was Rudy\u2019s as she was the only one that was hazarding getting anywhere near you. Although you had warned them multiple times in advance, when you decided to change to a dragon and escape that way, they got as far away from you as possible. Even with you outside the cages they didn\u2019t like it very much. However, due to your size, you were in between the \u2018food\u2019 cage and Rudy\u2019s. With their magic back you expected them to start some trouble. But even with all their differences they all had one thing in common, a healthy fear of what you would do to them if they disregarded your request to not cause each other trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d you asked as you rose you head and yawned. You didn\u2019t even have to check to know that such an action always freaked people out. But, as you beginning to just accept, they would be freaked out wither you yawned or just sat there. So you didn\u2019t really care if they added to the feeling they were already feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is almost morning. You asked to be woken so you could get ready.\u201d Rudy responded with a whimper in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Rudy.\u201d You said back to her with a smile but not showing any teeth. You didn\u2019t know what you preferred more. This aura of conflict or the relative peace you had in the previous realm. True you didn\u2019t have anyone fear you like usual but you were getting unbelievably board. After fighting dragons, ninja, knights, and all that. To just\u2026 sit there and play cards, even holographic ones with souls attached, was just too\u2026 yeah boring. A rumble hit the air and they all looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked Carol, not really wanting to hear the answer or hoping it wasn\u2019t what she already knew it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten in\u2026 5 days and before that it was a human sized sandwich. Guess I\u2019m getting a little hungry.\u201d You said as you straightened a little into a more sitting position. You noticed that they all seemed deathly afraid that you were referring to them as the food to rectify that problem. \u201cI told you before, I don\u2019t eat people like that. Although\u2026 I may have a few of the guards on the way out. And if one of those guards happens to be giant sized then\u2026 well you all might want to look away at that point. I\u2019m not like a Naga, that I can just swallow something that big down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as it isn\u2019t us\u2026 and I won\u2019t have any problem with letting you have a few snacks.\u201d Carol said perhaps more bluntly than she should\u2019ve. But you gave her credit for saying \u2018us\u2019 rather than \u2018Me\u2019. You could also see a natural agreement from the room. That Doctor definitely didn\u2019t make too many friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of you could converse further the lights brightened and the door started to open. The others looked at you to which you used a cloaking jutsu to become near invisible. They were half between scared and glad at this to which they couldn\u2019t see or sense you at all as you moved around to the incoming \u2018staff\u2019. As the Doctor had said, there were more than just humans. There was nekos, elves, and even a few really small looking people that were maybe 3 inches tall. You maneuvered yourself and with a bit of genjutsu and magic you dematerialized the door but made it look otherwise secured. The door was big enough to fit you through its frame, probably for machines or something to help bring in predators or build the place to begin with. However you still had an emotional drain on eating them. You saw no other option, as they were all at the Doctor\u2019s level or worse but you weren\u2019t sure if you could just gulp them down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how are my girls this morning?\u201d asked the Doctor to which he got glares to his smirking face that seemed to be what he was after to begin with. \u201cLively as ever I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are doing well.\u201d Rudy said more formally. It was becoming clear to you that while Dridders were the more aggressive they were also the more respectable as well. Probably had something to do with them balancing on eight small points all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grey skin didn\u2019t look alien on her with the designs that, for anyone else, would look like tattoos. The black markings blended with her black haired bottom half and equally shadow like hair on her head that reached her upper back in a loose but straight style. Like most predators of this apparent realm you were in, her body was very fit but not without its curves and relative voluptuous appeal. It was probably one of many things that gave predators an edge when hunting humans or like creatures. They were high in physical attractiveness. Her eyes were almost a Pinkish red that didn\u2019t come near your Glowing blood red color but were noticeable against her darkened features. Lastly her teeth and fangs looked almost like a vampire\u2019s but more primal and elegant, probably because she didn\u2019t have to hide them like Vampires did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose some breakfast will do you some good.\u201d He said with a smirk as he looked at the assortment of choices in the \u2018food\u2019 cage. Idiot didn\u2019t even notice their bracelets were off. He just trusted his little device that said you all did. \u201cSo who would like to volunteer this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an ominous growl that shook the room and made the bars rattle at the suggestion. It was half out of reflex from doing so when a dragon was asking the same question all those years ago. But to this the Doctor looked around to find the source, as did everyone else. The others that were in the cages knew it was you but it didn\u2019t make them any more calm after such a noise. It definitely didn\u2019t inspire a calm response. It was designed to scare Dragons and did more than that with those\u2026 a little lest physically inclined than that target.With that you spit some fire needles out at a majority of the lights so that it was darker in the room but still enough to more than see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?!\u201d the Doctor exclaimed, raising his controller then hitting the button but, as they weren\u2019t wearing the devices they didn\u2019t do anything but break the cloned arms you used. When he noticed this he made a break for the door, which you were blocking as you laid down. He ran smack into your side, as did some of the others while they nervously looked behind at the predators and prisoners that were no longer under their control. You dispelled the cloaking jutsu slowly so they could react to you as you came back into their visual spectrum. \u201cWhoa!!!\u201d The Doctor and a few other said as the stumbled back into the middle of the room, not wanting to get too close to the other cages but got as far away from you as they could in the increasingly small space as you revealed yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst one to deactivate the doors gets a running start.\u201d You said with as small growl afterwards. This sprung the Doctor into action, pushing the others out of his way but you flattened your tail and pointed it at him to which everyone stopped as the razor sharp and giant appendage was extended just in front of the Doctor\u2019s throat. \u201cExcept you. You have a date with a pissed off Naga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait we can work something out can\u2019t we?\u201d The Doctor begged but before he could add to his suggestion a long spongy surface wrapped around him and pulled him slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute with the new lighting for everyone to see that the surface was Carol\u2019s tongue and she was reeling him in towards her open mouth with an audible \u201cAh\u2026\u201d to further make his destination clear. Thankfully she pulled him slow enough to cause the look everyone in the cages wanted while fast enough to have him sealed away in her mouth before he could scream and beg with his annoyingly arrogant voice. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While this was going on you saw a small little man running toward the table. He was one of the 3 inch people. Everyone else was watching in horror as the Doctor was sucked into Carol\u2019s mouth. They seemed frozen as they heard muffled screams and begging from beneath the blissfully smiling lips of the giant figure. Carol smiled and hummed as she savored the human, even through his cloths. The only thing about it that didn\u2019t make you growl again was that the man was scum and now he was going to be turned to the very thing he had been living a life of. She played with him a while then slowly swallowed the fighting man, letting his descent further horrify those that could follow him, even those in the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the Tomthumb had just reached the top of the console to which he hopped around the keys to activate them. You memorized the sequence then he jumped onto an enter button that opened all the doors behind you in the facility and then pulled the bars of the cages from their place in the floor, up and into the ceiling through the holes that they came from. This snapped the group out of the horrified shock and started to panic, even the ones that were in the cage. The two giant predators were fee after all and the fairies joined them at that size making 5 giant sized people besides you in the room. But you weren\u2019t going to wait for them to have this little game. So you snarled loudly with teeth bared at them, all of them. They may have been scared out of their minds of the man eating predators around them but they were more afraid of the dragon more than 5 times any of the giant\u2019s size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow.\u201d You started with a little growl in your voice but still letting your teeth show and eyes flare. \u201cThose that are breaking out are ALL going to get out of here, ALIVE and not in ANYONE\u2019S stomach. I promised as much and anyone that tempts the predators by antagonizing them will be going in my stomach, which is where any predator will go if the eat those I\u2019ve promised to free. As for you people\u2026\u201d you said as you finished giving the previous prisoners very intense glares that forbid any attempt at argument. They your eyes rested on the group of people you had already cleared as people worth of an end in a stomach. They were each just as bad or worse than the Doctor that was already in Carol\u2019s stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get eaten either right?\u201d asked the Tomthumb out of turn to which your gaze rested solely on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you get a running start, so start running.\u201d You growled. He staggered for a moment but then raced out as you lifted a portion of your tail to show a hole big enough for him to fit after which you dropped your tail over the spot again. \u201cAs for the rest of you. You have two options. Your first is choose the predator you want to eat you and get eaten the way they want. Or you can panic and I\u2019ll eat you. Word of warning, I don\u2019t swallow my food whole. I like a wiggling and bleeding meal if you get me drift.\u201d You said to which your stomach growled to make your point that you were hungry as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fully expected to eat one as they were facing certain death. So you glared at them from your spot but finally one of them made a break for the same area as the Tomthumb used. You snapped the woman up using a few teeth to impale her in nonvital areas but enough to cause a generous amount of splatter. Your aim was to get the rest to be too afraid of you eating them to try anything. Seeing the woman\u2019s bloody and screaming form before you flipped her into your mouth then swallowed was all it took to quell any other thoughts. Even though you impaled her with a tooth to make it quick you used your magic to move her as she went down. Definitely a worse way to go then digesting in a stomach alive was to be full of holes and being digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou licked your lips a little to get the blood off and that got the rest of them to quickly move toward their chosen predators. The display was horrific enough to secure their cooperation and the relative mercy of the predators despite them eating them. The Tomthumbs that were left went to some of the nekos and each giant predator got a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, we ready to move out now?\u201d you asked in a comparatively gentle voice from the one you used earlier. It was a big enough change that they didn\u2019t want do anything to invoke the previous side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Carol stated, eager as the rest of them to get out of this cage within a cage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one really got in your way after you blew a breath of flames down the hall. All the doors were opened because of the Tomthumb that did so and you were glad he did such. The doors were designed to keep predators from getting in or out. So they would\u2019ve been a pain to force open. Finally you emerged from the complex into a field that was just before an enormous wooded area. For the first time, the trees were taller than you were. Well not the first time but the first time since you were at full size. Usually on worlds like the others there was nothing really your size\u2026 except the buildings in the last one. Not only were they tall but they were also wide. You had a problem, even when you hunted, of toppling trees over because of you size. It was a wonderful sight to see that you could walk through the forest in dragon form without worry of damaging it\u2026 too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d asked Rudy as they saw you rush over and circle around, taking in the area as much as you could. You weren\u2019t sure if a flight was the best idea yet but from the extremely enriching ground and dirt to the wonderful smelling air, you were on a sensory overload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place, it is\u2026 wonderful. It smells so\u2026\u201d you started as you took a visual sniff of the air \u201cNo smoke, no exhaust, not too much blood, it\u2019s just natural and rich. Everything is so filled of life, not like the broken worlds I\u2019ve been on.\u201d You finished, looking down and digging 5 trenches as you raked your claws in the dirt, feeling the enriched soil around them felt very relaxing and almost magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s wonderful for you. For the rest of us, everything wants to eat us.\u201d Said a cross neko as the smaller group members stood just in front of the entrance of the complex they just got out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ruin it for him.\u201d Carol scolded as she bent down to give them all a stern look but when she looked up she noticed the damage was already done. You looked into the forest and saw many things in it that would more than willingly consume a human sized or even giant sized meal. Most of them not being sentient but some, like the giant beings you just saved, were. The reason why there was minimal blood in the air was that most didn\u2019t chew their food, they preferred things as small as humans or such things to just swallow down whole. But thankfully there was a few things like enlarged plants and wild animals that you could eat that didn\u2019t have a sentient mind attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess this is where we all split ways. I have a lot to explore. Does anyone want me to drop them off somewhere? I don\u2019t know where I am going but you point me in the right direction and I can fly you there.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, but we would prefer getting away from anything that COULD eat us. We\u2019ve only known you for a day so you fit the category.\u201d Said the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense. Just at least let me do this.\u201d you said then materialized clothes and outfits that they had in the back of their minds so they were clothed, well accept the predators. They didn\u2019t seem to have any clothes in mind. You wondered if all predators were like that. But that would also make sense. Not a lot of people could make a shirt for a 100 foot tall naga that could withstand a life in the jungle, much less a wardrobe of them with other human coverings. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you would like traveling through the jungle in nothing, especially the humans, elves, nekos, and children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what about us? You said we couldn\u2019t eat them until we were all free.\u201d Carol asked as she looked down at the group of people. The group got nervous set of expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least let them have a decent head start. I mean if they were going to be eaten anyway I would\u2019ve just waited to free us until they were all eaten in there.\u201d You replied as you nodded to the complex you all just escaped. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take them anywhere but\u2026 what would be a fair time to wait?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few days I suppose.\u201d Rudy said as she thought with her hand under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill that work?\u201d you asked the small group. Your direct attention was a little unnerving for them but most nodded dumbly. \u201cOk then, I won\u2019t hunt you but they will wait for 2 days while you get to whatever safety you can find or whatever. Not sure if there is any places like that around here though\u2026 guess that is the point of exploring.\u201d With that you backed up a little then exploded to turn back to human form. You used some chakra to clear the smoke and debris away so they didn\u2019t have to look away except as a reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you change to human?\u201d asked Rudy as she looked and didn\u2019t see even your dragon parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for starters I\u2019m hungry and I need less food in human form. That and I can sneak around easier like this and I don\u2019t lose any power in this form so I thought it would be an interesting point of view so I can see what this world is like. If I am a huge dragon then things that most people know about will avoid me. I should really check out what this world is like before I debate staying here or not. Got any suggestions on things I should see as a tourist?\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 well you could always check out the human settlements. Negav would be the best if you\u2019re going for maximum human exposure and they may have some maps for you to look at. But\u2026 predators can\u2019t go in there because of the magic that keeps us away. Another option is looking but Vivian. She has a good knowledge of things\u2026 but not usually sought out by human sized people.\u201d Rudy answered as she seemed the only one able to speak at the moment. But she seemed to be nervously trying to get you away from her, despite her towering over you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, which is the closest?\u201d You asked, using that as an indicator to where to start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The answer Rudy gave was not one the rest of the human sized people liked to hear. Apparently you were very close to some place called, \u2018Chordoni Waterfall\u2019, which was the home of Vivian more or less. You could actually hear the Waterfall from where you originally which was proof on how large it was. With a final warning about Vivan and the nature of Felarya the said goodbye to you and you walked off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you were almost eaten a few times by the plants and what not. Even the group had a mouth, which was weird as you wondered how a mouth in the ground had such white teeth. Was there a ground dentist or something? You decided to save that bad joke for later. Perhaps it was the naturally rich and life filled aura of the place but everything that wasn\u2019t being eaten was in almost perfect health. No cancer, not even that many scars or blemishes. Understandably they were also extremely fit, as running for your life every day would probably keep a person, human or otherwise, in shape. Even though it bothered you about the eating other people you didn\u2019t interfere when you saw it. You on the other hand found some tree bark and some kind of deer looking thing that you ate to replenish your strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d you said when you finally got there. You were perched on a high tree that looked over the area in front of the Waterfall but not the colossal sight itself. It was as if the water came from nowhere and just magically fell down over the beautiful scenery of the falls themselves. The light that came over the mist couldn\u2019t just create one rainbow so it looked as if a rainbow had a kid and it was the area over and immediately around the falls. Subtle enough to not notice without looking but enough to look for it. You had seen many things in the worlds you visited and from every angle but this was the most beautiful sight you had ever seen. You simply couldn\u2019t stop staring at the sight for a period of a day. It worked out because no one was there at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you changed to what you were now referring to as your half-breed form and entered the area, thinking that this \u2018Vivian\u2019 person could be anywhere or hiding. Not that many things could hide from your gaze as a dragon but still you didn\u2019t want to intrude on her home while she was taking a shower or something equally as awkward. You walked around for a bit then laid on a small incline that faced the Falls so you could be surrounded but the mist that was coming off. Not much of a mist at that distance but it felt good against the slightly humid environment of the jungle. You had watched the Waterfalls all day and night so you slowly fell asleep to the sounds of the running water and the pleasant aura that was currently around you. You had never before been so surrounded by life. The very ground under you seemed to be generating life in a way you had never felt. To the point where you had to check where you walked. You were afraid that some part of the ground would be alive as well and you didn\u2019t want to harm it if that was the case. For the first time you slept and didn\u2019t have a nightmare. You were completely at peace with your tail swaying and wings flexing as you left them stretched out to absorb both the rich ground under you and the rich sensations from around you from being in the mist and pleasant air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a pleasant surprise.\u201d Said a singsong voice that woke you from a pleasant bliss. You didn\u2019t have a dream but rather just a feeling of utter belonging as you floated in your dream state, like floating in a sea of pleasant emotions. The voice wasn\u2019t an unpleasant one so you simply opened your dragon eyes and looked at a face that was looking down at you from behind, making her face inverted while you lay on the ground, inverted but giant like Carol\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, ditto.\u201d You replied up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDitto?\u201d she asked as she didn\u2019t understand the term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, It was a creature on a world I went to that could replicate any person or animal no matter the size or detail, even abilities to a certain level. So it became a word to describe a like sentiment or description that was being returned so someone didn\u2019t have to repeat the same thing to the person that said it to them.\u201d You explained to which she looked to be taking in the new information then seductively smiled. Rudy was right, she did like to be sensual in her persona. Most people were subtle about such things. She just dove right into it. \u201cYou\u2019re face wasn\u2019t the worst way to wake up nor was it unpleasant to fall asleep to the one already provided. My name is Max by the way. I\u2019m going to assume you are the infamous Vivian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m infamous?\u201d she asked in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve only been in this world for a few days and everyone seems to know you. I escaped mercenary research lab with a Giant Naga and Giant Dridder and they both suggested I come here if I want answers on this world rather than blindly exploring.\u201d You responded then decided it was a bad idea to continue the conversation in a reclined position so you sprung up then turned to more formally address her as you flexed your wings and let your tail do as it willed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you know about me, isn\u2019t fair for me to know about you?\u201d she asked in a suggestive manner. You could feel magic in the air trying to do something to you. You couldn\u2019t tell what it was, it was a very complex spell that you didn\u2019t know what to do with so you just repelled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I suppose I should start out with information if I wish to gain any.\u201d You agreed. \u201cI am known as a half-breed. One half is obviously human while the other is dragon. I\u2019m also a fully trained ninja and know a little magic.\u201d You rattled off. Usually saying such things made you feel sorrowful but something about this place just didn\u2019t let you feel bad in that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon, that is one I haven\u2019t seen a lot of. I dare say I haven\u2019t seen a bite sized dragon before, half-breed aside. And it seems you are repelling my charm spell. What an intriguing little snack you are.\u201d She stated as she laid down on her side so her tail was curled around the area in front of her with you in it as well as her chest and front toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess everyone on this world likes eating people my size, well accept other people my size or smaller. But I really don\u2019t want to transform to stop you. Hmm\u2026\u201d You stated as she smiled. You couldn\u2019t tell if she was smiling to seduce you or because you would be a tasty and lively snack, if you let her eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTransforming? You may be more entertaining than I thought. Can you show me? Please? I really want to see.\u201d She almost begged/pouted but in an almost sexual way to use her feminine charm to coax you to do as she willed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you can see, I can just dragon parts in human form and don\u2019t lose any of my power in either form. Useful since a dragon body isn\u2019t really good at using spells and other things like that and as  human I can do stuff like this.\u201d you explained then turned and breathed a huge amount of fire that blasted a 600 foot pillar into the sky before dissipating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that little Max?\u201d Vivian asked in her sensual attitude. You wondered as she traced her finger along you\u2019re body and tail  then wings if she was scared or hiding it really well. She was visually curious but otherwise not effected by the display of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlame breath, basic stuff for a dragon really. Actually that was about at a light sneeze level. Not very powerful but enough to scare the crap out of a tree lady that tried to eat me.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou used flames on a Dryad?\u201d she asked in a suddenly more stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe flames didn\u2019t touch her. She was just too persistent after I warned her what I could do. So I used and illusion and my flame breath to give her a good scare. Amazing what a presumed near death experience can do for the learning process. But she is fine, a little shaken, but fine with not even a burn on her lovely branches.\u201d You replied, noticing that once you said it she came back to a more playful and cheery persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. So why don\u2019t you want to go to full dragon?\u201d she asked to which you retracted your dragon parts just too keep her eyes sparkling. You didn\u2019t know why but you loved to see that in the predators around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is insanely painful. I have been through a lot in my life. Most of which I don\u2019t wish to repeat. But nothing even comes close to the physical pain I go through when I transform from dragon to human or the other way around. I have to go from this to a 500 foot tall dragon. That means my body has to literally rip itself apart to do it. I don\u2019t know if you have ever felt such a thing as your stomach being ruptured but it isn\u2019t fun. Nor is it enjoyable growing lungs, a new heart, scales, and not to mention the size difference.\u201d You tried to explain to which you shook your body in a massive shiver from the memory. Then you\u2019re eyes lit up as you remembered your duel disk. \u201cHey, I can show you what I look like though, without transforming if you want.\u201d You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Vivian asked, now really interested. She seemed to have been hit by her own past memories when you said as much about yours. She was now more sympathetic looking towards you. And it seemed like she knew exactly what you were talking about in regards to a stomach rupture. You didn\u2019t know if you should be sad for her or glad she was so accepting and civil\u2026 for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, on the last world I was on. They played this card game that brought monsters to life through playing cards. Their essence was connected to them but were otherwise just holograms; holograms being illusions of things using technology instead of magic. Anyway, as a\u2026 well dragon, they made a whole series on me. Most of them are just holograms now, as they are another world away, but I can still show you the one they made of me. That way you can see what I look like without me transforming.\u201d You explained as she listened to you. It almost seemed like she wasn\u2019t listening and just looking with a\u2026 well the best way to describe it was a caring lust. But you could tell she was overly curious at this point. Wither he outward demeanor would admit it or not, she loved knowing stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, it may be entertaining. You are certainly starting to be more interesting by the minute. I don\u2019t think I can eat you\u2026 but maybe later.\u201d She said with a suggestive wink as she laid her head on her hands to watch you more closely. She was obviously expecting something small. Her eyes brightened when you protruded your duel disk and drew your card. You were about to put the card down but then hesitated. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you might want to back up a little bit. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t run.\u201d You revealed. She humored you with a eyebrow raise as she put her tail behind her and backed up a little. Then rested her head on her hands as it was being propped up by her elbows. You then placed the card on the disk. Immediately you could feel a resonance with the card as it activated. Artificial and real clouds began forming overhead then a loud roar came from them as your dragon hologram came out of them and landed behind you, towering over both you and her. She fell back as your hologram landed and roared again then flexed your wings in a highly intimidating stance before you took control over the normal card functions and had your hologram sit properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 that is you?\u201d Vivian asked to which you nodded. She was on edge but not as much as you would expect. Just to be sure you brought your dragon parts out again. She could definitely see the resemblance of the tail, wings, and eyes. Eyes were the big one. Hard to miss large glowing red dragon eyes. \u201cThis is that hologram thing you were saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, although it has part of my essence in it so I can control it. Otherwise the game has him\u2026 me\u2026 or however you want to call him, snarling and all that. Just theatrics to make the game more entertaining.\u201d You brought the holograms head down and waved your hand through it to show her. \u201cSee, just a hologram. It can do little more than cause a little wind. Or distraction. I did bring out a giant a day ago to scare a few wolves off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust an illusion\u2026 I mean hologram?\u201d She asked as she got up and cautiously approached, towering over your real body then waving a hand through the image. She then got playful and kissed the hologram on the snout to which you got a little bashful, in both forms. \u201cThen how does he react to me?\u201d she asked, seeing your shy reaction to her advance, despite not feeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already said.\u201d You said through the hologram this time which got her to reel back a little before remembering it couldn\u2019t hurt her. \u201cMy essence is linked to this card. I can see through his eyes and control his actions. Otherwise this is what the game does when I release control.\u201d You answered as the image huffed, shook its head, then started to creep and snarl at her. She was visually scared of the image as it did look very real. When it roared again at her she shook a little, whimpering to which you turned your duel disk off and put it and the card away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can that be a game?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, usually it is played with two people that have the monsters fight each other and all that. But can you really not think of anyone that you wouldn\u2019t mind seeing scared for fun. They do look rather real so a dragon even a fifth that size roaring at someone could get them to fall over as a prank.\u201d You suggested to which she grinned at the thought as she seemed to be coming up with a list as you spoke. You retracted your dragon parts again to which came over and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was relatively hard to balance without your tail out but it seemed she was rather experienced at dealing with smaller beings. You didn\u2019t need to be told where most of those smaller ones went. She brought you to her face level so she could more easily observe you with her curious and almost naturally erotic gaze. As if she was just born to be sexually suggestive looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what do you think. It is ok if you are scared and want me to leave. I am use to it.\u201d You said as you sat down with a plop, looking down and away from her gaze. After all, Carol was a Naga just as big as Vivian and she didn\u2019t want anything to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I wanted to eat you?\u201d she asked, as if asking if you wanted such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I would have to run again. Either that, or my instinct would take over and start trying to burn or slash my way out. I\u2019ve been eaten a few times, even as a child, ah\u2026 what a mess. I smelled like the insides of the things I killed for months. I just used my tail and\u2026\u201d you answered as you brought it out flattened it to show her how sharp it was, then retracted it. \u201cWell you get the idea. But as far as just playing around\u2026 I\u2019m just not ready for that yet. As a large dragon I\u2026 I just have bad memories on both sides of that situation that I would rather not revisit. At least no right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you crying?\u201d she asked. Obviously she didn\u2019t get that too often. She probably either got moans or giggles, judging from her personality. But sorrowful crying like you were doing was probably not a regularly seen thing. You weren\u2019t crying much but a few tears did drop on her hand. Honestly you were surprised she could feel them as your face was downcast so she wouldn\u2019t be able to see them. You wiped your eyes to pathetically hide your tears from her. \u201cI was only trying to change the mood. If it really bothers you that much I won\u2019t suggest it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 thanks.\u201d You replied, still too afraid of rejection to look her in the eyes. She wasn\u2019t having any of that as she used a single finger to raise your head to meet her gaze. She made you keep the gaze up until your head wasn\u2019t falling down on its own anymore. She had a concerned and caring look on her face and in her eyes for a while until she changed back to her usual self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is just one thing though.\u201d She said as she brought up her fingers for you to rest your back against. \u201cYou do know what this world is like, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you mean about the prey/predator system.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. I promise not to ask to eat you or you to eat someone else until you say you are ready. However, that is the way it works here and most will live by that. It is a eat or be eaten world and everyone thinks they shouldn\u2019t be eaten. Do you understand?\u201d She asked you as she gazed down at you and you up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may not like it. But, I\u2019ll accept it. I won\u2019t push my views on you or the others and I\u2019ll let you know if someone is off limits as family or something. The worlds I just came from\u2026 well let\u2019s just say they have ways of finding me. So if my adopted human family comes in here to find me and gets eaten, that could be a problem. Here, I\u2019ll even transform into them for you so you know what they look like.\u201d You replied. She looked at you with confusion as you stood and transformed into every person you knew from the other realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to remember all of them.\u201d she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it was just a reference so if something stands out to you than just ask before eating. The headband symbol or the funny outfits. Some have monster cards and some are just weird and you\u2019d know them when you saw them. Most of the ones that could make it here could fight you off if push came to shove. Might be distracted but could, especially the guys. You are rather beautiful you know.\u201d You complimented at the end to which she blushed a little but otherwise put on a \u2018I know\u2019 face with a pleasant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I can\u2019t wait to show you to the others.\u201d She said as she brought you close after you sat back down and gave you a kiss. The kiss almost covered your whole body but you didn\u2019t mind. As a dragon it bridged the awkward meter as far as her sexual acts were concerned but your human half still understood so you blushed a little. It wasn\u2019t every day you get kissed by a Giant beauty like Vivan. Although, you suspected it would happen a lot more if you hung out with her from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll love them. Maybe I can get you to scare some of them with that toy of yours.\u201d She suggested to which she giggled as you smirked an \u2018I told you so\u2019 look to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slept in a curled up position in dragon form near the Falls. Originally you wanted to remain as a human but Vivian had explained that, unless you were ok with random predators eating you while you slept, that it was a bad idea. It became evident when a Harpy snatched you up. The winged beauty didn\u2019t get very far before you used a substitution jutsu but it got the point across. So you remained in Dragon form. It wasn\u2019t all bad. You got to hunt and the jungle was more your size anyway. It took a while for Vivian to get use to you but she used sexual situations to test and get closer to you. Eventually, within a week or so she was generally ok with having you around. In that week you built another vault. But with her help, you made the door a magic one. Basically you used the portal and dimension magic/jutsu to make the vault door accessible anywhere you summoned it. You still had to materialize the structure and power source but it was done and stocked with things to help you train or store your ninja and dueling gear. It was also a great place to research the portal jutsu and set up an anchor point to teleport to. You were beginning to like it here, a lot. For the sake of argument you had tried sleeping elsewhere in Felarya but you were plunged back into your usual nightmares. So the spot right next to the falls was the spot that you migrated to. It was the one place you could get a good sleep and rest. As of this moment, physically, you\u2019ve never felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026 time to wake up sleepy head.\u201d Said the unmistakable voice of Vivian as you were pulled from your pleasant dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a pressure on your body as she attempted to lay on top of you. This was her usual wake up call. She would either attempt to coil around you or just lay on top of you in a highly suggestive manner. She would then lay her head on yours and hug into your neck. At first you were worried about your spikes on her soft skin. But then you realized that while the predators, such as her, looked dainty, beautiful, and tender\u2026 they were called predators for a reason. The land of Felarya and being able to survive in it didn\u2019t allow for one\u2019s body to become a weak or frail shell. They were tuff and deceptively dangerous, especially to prey, hunting and surviving in Felarya for hundreds of years does wonders for their disposition. However, despite the danger of both the world and them in it, they remained innocent and mostly kind. Sure each predator had their own personality but there were not many that were evil. Sure they ate humans or other sentient stuff, but nothing like the dragons you hated so much on your home world. It was simply a way of life in this world, not one you shared but one you tolerated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Vivian.\u201d You said without even opening your eyes. You felt her hug increase as he coils cycled on top of your body and around your wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have someone I\u2019d like you to meet, a friend of mine.\u201d She said in gentle voice as she laid her head on yours. But as she felt you begin to move she draped off and slithered away slightly. You stretched out after she got off. Your wings flexed and let out an enormous yawn before shaking any sleep out of you. It felt good to be fully rested. You finally opened your eyes and looked around as you laid down in a relaxed but proper position, more of a seating position but without standing on your front legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeek!\u201d exclaimed a light voice as you looked over at Vivian and another Naga she had by her side. Her coils were primarily teal with yellow underbelly. Fair skin, blonde hair, bluish teal eyes and a very innocent look on her face. But one look at her and you could tell that she was a very established hunter and by the scent she loved eating humans as much as or probably more than Vivian. As was the case in most of Felarya, the more beautiful they are the more deadly and dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, you\u2019re scaring her.\u201d Vivian scolded to which you ducked your head like a puppy would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. I just look scary.\u201d You replied with your head lower to the ground and not showing your teeth as you talked. You found that hadn\u2019t changed. Even Vivian was slightly unnerved by the large deadly teeth in your jaws. It got worse if she had just seen you eat. She knew that you tended to use those teeth rather than her way of swallowing things whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry Max. I like the way you look.\u201d Vivian said as she came closer and put a hand on your snout. Unlike the people you use to know that would do such a thing, her hand could cover the tip of your snout. You were so use to humans doing it that it took some getting used to. But in the end you liked that you didn\u2019t have to worry about hurting her when she did something like that. You raised your head and nuzzled her a little. She giggled before waving her friend over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice draggie\u2026\u201d she cooed in a childish way that added to her innocent looking demeanor. She had a hand out like a child inching her way to pet you. Eventually her hand made contact to which Vivian helped her get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Crisis. She is a good friend of mine, really good.\u201d She said the last part had a little extra suggestive tone to it. You could guess that they did more than just talk when they hung out. Vivian had a way of bringing someone out of their shell in a sensual manner, usually for a time of pleasure but she wasn\u2019t as shallow as to limit a visit to only a pleasure visit. However her persona did give that vibe out. They had stopped petting you so you could talk properly but were still pretty close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrisis? That is a very interesting name. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll remember it. And a friend of Vivian\u2019s, no wonder why you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d You complimented, making her blush in a cute fashion. \u201cI\u2019m Max, and as you can see, I\u2019m a dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, you look really cool.\u201d She said with a large smile as she tried to maintain her composure but was obviously bad at keeping her emotions a secret.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWould it help if I were a human?\u201d you asked to which she got a both excited and confused face to replace her blushed one. This was no act, she truly was an innocent, childlike, and very beautiful person. All her little attitudes matched her person very well. It masked her dangerous side and food preference nicely and probably contributed to many meals, similar to Vivian\u2019s hunting method but without the spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can be a human?!\u201d Crisis asked excitedly. You couldn\u2019t figure out what she liked more, that you could do something like that, or the tasty human part. But with the faint movements and yelling coming from her mid section you hoped that the hunger part would wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I thought you didn\u2019t want to transform. That it hurt too much.\u201d Vivian asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt hurts?\u201d asked Crisis, obviously not liking the idea from that point of view. Despite her food choices, she didn\u2019t appear to like being the cause of harm to others. Felarya was definitely a weird place. In your home, if someone ate a human than they were evil. But here they could be as innocent as a baby and still eat someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does hurt a lot. But if it makes it easier than\u2026 I can. I have rested more than enough to change a few times. And as long as you don\u2019t plan on eating me, I won\u2019t mind being a human for a while.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how can you be a human when you\u2019re a big dragon?\u201d asked Crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m like you. A Naga is like a half snake, half human. Well I\u2019m a half dragon, half human. But I can go from full dragon to full human instead of trapped in between like you are.\u201d You tried to explain, in terms she may understand. See seemed to get it\u2026 mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why would you want to be a tasty human instead of a big dragon. You\u2019d get eaten easier as a human.\u201d Crisis asked, still confused how or why you can/would do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause sometimes it helps. I get all my power as a dragon when I go to human. I can even grow wings to fly and eyes to see better. I\u2019m just as strong. It is also fun to pull pranks on other predators as a human. They think I\u2019m a helpless human then I can do all kinds of fun stuff.\u201d You explained. She seemed to chime in on the prank part but still was slightly confused by the whole thing. Vivian gave a signal to you that said it was all she was going to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we skip to the fun part.\u201d Vivian suggested to which you smiled and Crisis cocked her head in confusion. You found everything Crisis did to be cute. But then again, that was becoming an overly used description of the way most looked around Felarya, well at least the innocent looking predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun part?\u201d asked Crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just show you?\u201d You suggested as you walked over to Vivian then laid down so she could climb on your back. You secured her with spikes in well practiced places so she was secured and comfortable. The first could times you both had found out what worked and what didn\u2019t. Leaving her tail wonder only invited a possible constriction on exciting parts of flight. There were a few other things but now you had got it down rather nicely without her crowding your wings. You stood with her then spread your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what we do if I can get Max to do it.\u201d Said Vivian with a smile. Crisis just watched with eager expectation. You then took off, causing a rather large wind to whip around the area. It wasn\u2019t as easy taking off with a full grown Naga on your back. It wasn\u2019t the heaviest thing you\u2019ve ever carried but it did require a certain amount of force to remain in the air, or to get up at all. You soared at a low height so Crisis could see what you were doing as you spun and banked with Vivian giggling and cheering for you to go faster. You did, as you could hardly tell her no. However when her excitement calmed down and you felt she was tuckering out you landed in the area designated as such then walked over to a very excited and shocked Crisis. \u201cOk, now your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can fly to?\u201d she asked you as you laid down and let Vivian off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. It isn\u2019t every day I have enough energy to do this, plus it\u2019s really fun to fly. Hop on.\u201d You answered and waited as she almost did hop on. Normally that wouldn\u2019t be a surprising sight but as she had a rather long tail it was more of a rarity among her kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d Crisis asked as you secured her wiggling tail and body with spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are so you don\u2019t fall off. We\u2019ll be moving really fast you know.\u201d You answered with a grin and she could barely contain her excitement. It was obvious that people her size, unless they were Harpies, would never be able to fly. So giving her this treat was no small thing to her, especially her. \u201cHold on.\u201d You said at last as you stood up and walked a little away from the tired and spent Vivian. Then when Crisis was about to say something you took off, higher in the air than with Vivian until you were just below the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeek!\u201d she squeaked as the sudden increase in speed surprised her, like being on a very fast rollercoaster for your first rollercoaster ever. But you leveled off and soared in the air so she could recover.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The extra wind resistance didn\u2019t help on your end but her joy in flying made it more than enjoyable. \u201cAre we really high?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know that giant tree? The one you live on. Vivian was telling the truth when she said you lived there right?\u201d You asked to which she wrapped her arms around the top of your neck and put her head just to the side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I life at the Giant Tree, the really big one.\u201d She clarified to which you soared in the direction. Vivian had shown you a few sights as you took her flying a few times. At the very least, you had a general map knowledge of where the major sights were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s right there.\u201d You said as you pointed with a one of your front claws as she looked over your shoulder to the ground to see where you were pointing. She could see the large green structure but you were more than a few hundred miles above it so it looked small in comparison the vast landscape. You could almost feel her eyes widen at the realization of how high she was. \u201cDo you like it up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, this is fun. Can we go faster?\u201d she asked with an excited voice, and what you would assume to carry over to her other features that you couldn\u2019t see at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on tight.\u201d You instructed and when you felt her hug around you increase you took off. Again, through experimentation with Vivian, you had determined what felt good and what was a little too rough. You sped, weaved, banked, and twirled. At one point you dove right toward the a lake of some kind. She shrieked as she thought you were going to crash, until you pulled up mere feet from the surface then headed back up above the clouds and among them. Eventually you both got tired and you decided to land as gently as you could and let her off near Vivian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d Vivian asked Crisis as she came to the almost limp Crisis as you put her down gently on the ground. She was concerned for a moment but when she saw a wondered gaze on her face, similar to the one she had on her first flight, she lightened up. She knew you wouldn\u2019t harm them but the thoughts did creep into her mind from time to time. You were a dragon and you could easily eat her if you wanted. A thought that she was usually on the opposite end of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much fun. We were so high, then we Whoosh! And then we did Whir! Then Wee! Flying is so fun. Those Harpies are so lucky.\u201d Crisis answered as she mixed in audible sounds to explain what Vivian already knew. It was a cute gesture as she also tried using her tired body to simulate your wings and motions you took when you flew with her. You smile at her as she spoke and laid there in utter sensory bliss, far different from a sensual bliss Vivian would\u2019ve brought out. It brightened your day to have brought such happiness to her. You felt strange when around Crisis, a lot like the way you use to feel around Sarah. You simply wanted to see her smile like she was doing now. Although it didn\u2019t seem like a hard task to get her to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you two something to eat? I got some delicious nekos and humans while you were gone.\u201d Vivian offered but the topic instantly brought your mood down as you shook your head and looked away as she held the captive meals. Why did she have to offer you things she knew you had a moral bias against eating. You looked away when she ate them from time to time but she almost always offered you one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNekos!\u201d Crisis Cheered and within moments you heard a few screams and a few gulping and slurping noises. You didn\u2019t want your view of the two to be hindered so you didn\u2019t look at them while they ate. After a while they noticed your stoic and avoiding behavior. \u201cMax, are you sure you don\u2019t want a\u2026\u201d Crisis started but was stopped before she finished, probably from Vivian. You hear a few more gulps then they came over to the side your head was facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell me now?\u201d asked Vivian with a pouting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what, tell you what?\u201d asked Crisis, excited to hear a secret or story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax doesn\u2019t like eating humans or anything that can talk. As a human he doesn\u2019t like being swallowed or tasted either. He said something bad happened in his past but won\u2019t tell me.\u201d Vivian answered, giving Crisis a sad face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell us? We can listen really good.\u201d Crisis asked as she put her head on the ground sideways so she was looking into one of your eyes in a cute innocent way. Like a child asking their parent to share something with them. You lifted your head, looked away then back at them. Leaning over and rolling you exposed the ever present scars that decorated your body. You heard a gasp from them both. Even though you had let Vivian pretty much climb all over you, you had yet to show her the horrendous sight. After a moment you turned and positioned yourself so you could address them. As with most you explained this to, you would have to separate the stories and what each scar was from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, what or who did that to you?\u201d Vivian asked as Crisis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d You started then proceeded to show them where each of the scars were and told them were they came from. You turned over once that was done so you could finish the story. They both listened like little school girls. You had told your story enough times to be able to answer questions within the story before they were asked. Finally you were done and explained why you liked the spot of peace you had found and how Crisis seemed to be giving off the same feeling, plus that of what you felt with Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t like eating humans or people because\u2026?\u201d Vivian asked as she verified your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor one, I am half human so it is like asking Crisis to eat a baby Naga. I do remember you saying that you would never eat one but some of your friends, even other giant naga, do without a care. The second reason, and why I don\u2019t swallow people to my second stomach to heal, is because of that ninja business. I can\u2019t get a human anywhere near my mouth without thinking about it. No, I won\u2019t eat another human unless they are evil or really bad and threatening people I care about. But not as food and never friends, no matter how hurt or badly they plead.\u201d You answered. The statement about Crisis eating other Naga got her to understand more than your other one. But in combination with your story, they both understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why you don\u2019t like being eaten or tasted?\u201d Asked Vivian. She was obviously talking about from a play or sensual aspect. She licked you a few times and wondered what you would taste like or feel like going down. Since she wouldn\u2019t digest you she asked you about it but you had not talked to her for a while after she asked. She didn\u2019t like how it made you sad and angry at her for even suggesting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time I see someone try to eat me, I think of my mother. It was the first thing I saw so I won\u2019t forget it. I think that the person eating me hates me just like she did. I think they don\u2019t care and, at best, just wants me for a meal. I know that you don\u2019t but\u2026 I can\u2019t help it. It is part of me now. And being eaten a few times as a child doesn\u2019t help either.\u201d You answered, shuddering as you curled your body into a tight ball as you thought about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since we could easily fit in that list I don\u2019t think we will be too eager to break that bit of self control you have. And I think we would both much rather have you as a friend then a snack.\u201d Vivian stated as she looked over at Crisis as if to ask if she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 what if I find some bad humans or nekos? Will you eat them?\u201d Crisis asked, trying to figure you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess so. But don\u2019t push it. I can sense if they are evil or not. One evil act doesn\u2019t mean they are all evil. Please don\u2019t tempt me. I don\u2019t want to eat people, period. I won\u2019t try to stop you so please don\u2019t force me to eat any. I can find and hunt animals in the forest just as easy as I can catch humans or nekos.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to make me stop eating tasty humans?\u201d asked Crisis asked, strangely concerned. It was obviously something she didn\u2019t want to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, as long as you don\u2019t eat a friend of mine. Vivian told me about your human friend back at your home. If someone ate Lea, I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t like that, would you?\u201d you asked and almost immediately got a hostile face. A strange sight on the usually innocent and joyous face of Crisis. \u201cThat is how I would feel if someone I know was eaten. So if I ask you to not eat someone, please don\u2019t eat them. They could be my family or really good friend. Other than that, I won\u2019t stop you from eating others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Crisis stated in an attempt to think on the subject, not really her style so she wasn\u2019t getting very far in that pursuit. \u201cOk, no eating your friends. Got it!\u201d she decided with a cheery voice, mainly because you didn\u2019t try to change her eating style. Humans and like creatures were obviously a main part of her diet. Both Vivian and Crisis also seemed to have an understanding that you, as a human, were off limits. But perhaps you could grow a little in that tolerance as well as eating others, given enough time and judging by the company you were keeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 it might be easier to be a human now.\u201d Vivian stated in thought. \u201cIf for no other reason than to show Crisis what you look like. But if you intend on going with her, she will need to show you the way. That and\u2026 you would scare off all our\u2026 food if you walked around the jungle like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I wouldn\u2019t need to eat as much as a human. Ok, here goes nothing.\u201d You said as you stood and leapt into the sky. You got to a minimal safe distance then exploded into your Half-breed form so you could glide down to where you were previously. Crisis\u2019 eyes seemed to be bugging out when she saw this. You didn\u2019t notice until you had retracted your dragon parts and saw her staring at you and Vivian laughing at her stunned reaction. \u201cWhat? Did I miss something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re so cool!\u201d Crisis cheered as she looked down at you like a child at their first magic show. Her face was mere feet away from you. A sight that you assumed would scare others to death. Not that her face was frightening but what it usually meant when one got that close is what concerned most people. You then caught something Vivian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVivian, did you say that I would be going with Crisis?\u201d you asked. You had thought about it but didn\u2019t plan on acting on it. You had said you would stay there and she like your\u2026 uniqueness. You were also probably the only person that she couldn\u2019t push around if it came down to it. And you didn\u2019t respond to her advances like most males of any species did. You were a rare find for her so her comment about you going with Crisis didn\u2019t fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, don\u2019t you want to?\u201d Crisis asked as she moved back and looked at you with a pouting face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I feel very calm and content when you\u2019re around. Like being here and with Sarah at the same time. It is just that I told Vivian I would stay here as long as she wanted me to. I am someone that keeps my word so I can\u2019t leave unless she releases me.\u201d You answered Crisis then looked at Vivian as she looked contently at you. \u201cDo you really want me to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoy your company, you know that. But I\u2019m not use to having someone higher than me around here. In small doses you are wonderful and I would love to remain your friend. But I do have a life to live. One that you\u2026 wouldn\u2019t approve of. Doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t mind a visit from time to time. I\u2019ll even look out for the people you mentioned to me.\u201d Vivian answered, being suggestive at times while concerned and caring at others. She reached down and picked you up. Her grip was well practiced, as was many predators, but she had a natural softness to her touch that couldn\u2019t be replicated. Probably had something to do with the way she attracted her\u2026 prey. \u201cPromise me this though. When you finally start allowing yourself to be tasted, you let me give you a nice long tongue session.\u201d She finished as she kissed you then pulled you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I decide to start jumping in people\u2019s mouths, you\u2019ll be one of the first to know. Crisis probably at first, situation pending.\u201d You agreed as you stroked a finger that she used to stroke your side. Funny, even in human form, you didn\u2019t mind being pet like the animal you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Vivian handed you to Crisis, who cupped you carefully in her giant hands until you settled onto one of her palms with perfect balance. Your use of chakra and a tail sprouting from your back with the rest of your dragon parts helped in this regard. Crisis looked excitedly at you in her hand. You saw a small glint in her eye that you knew as a predatory sign. You were the only Half-breed in existence so it was understandable. But her ties to friends obviously overshot her predatory instincts by a huge margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ll live with me now?\u201d Crisis asked as she held you at a comfortable level to talk and observe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll have me, I would love to live with you.\u201d You answered to which she brought you in a quick motion to her cheek. She seemed to be hugging you, albeit tightly but still in a warm and excepting manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re so cute, and cool, and cool. Of course you can.\u201d She answered in her cute fashion. Vivian seemed to like this aspect of Crisis as well. Not that she didn\u2019t like the rest of her but Crisis seemed to have a calming and cheerful effect on you and Vivian as well. Although you suspected that her feeding habits and innocent style probably rubbed some the wrong way, mostly her meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you should go introduce him to Lea and Anna. He has some things that they may find interesting.\u201d Vivian advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does? You do?\u201d Crisis asked, first to Vivian then to you. You extended your arm and sprang out the duel disk then retracted it. It was a small device for her to see but it didn\u2019t dampen her enthralled fixation on the strange object. \u201cYeah! Off to home!\u201d she exclaimed and raced off with you and her lack of grammar structure to her home. You wondered what the other predators would think of you. Lea wasn\u2019t one but this Anna person might think of you as a snack. Not to mention, Crisis looked to be quite popular. She probably had multiple people she saw and those that saw her. You didn\u2019t want to harm them. It was clear that you would have to hold back at times until things were explained. Well, this was going to be fun and you couldn\u2019t wait.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey Anna!\u201d Crisis greeted as she came into a sort of work room inside the Giant tree. The thing definitely lived up to its name. You had seen it before as you flew over but from so high it barely did it justice. You saw a pink haired naga turn to Crisis\u2019 greeting with not a very hospitable face. You also saw a human on the table that this \u2018Anna\u2019 person was in front of. Judging from the size of the tools, this new Naga was probably a fan of technology and working on stuff. That meant that she had a escalated mind, which would make sense why someone with Crisis\u2019 mindset would annoy her. Like a little kid, Crisis probably broke/played with more than one of the Naga\u2019s inventions or projects. \u201cOh, hi Lea\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything, don\u2019t even look at anything. You know how long it took for me to clean up this place and get replacement parts after the last time?\u201d The Naga asked in a fiery mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, ha, ha,\u2026 a long time?\u201d Crisis asked in response, missing that it was a rhetorical question. \u201cOh, I have to introduce you to someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked the human, that you assumed was named Lea. This question cause Crisis to bring you between them and place you on the table. You flapped your wings to balance a little as she was too excited to do so as soft as Vivian had done with you thus far. \u201cHe is like the coolest\u2026 what are you again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA half-breed.\u201d You answered, slightly embarrassed as your tail twitched behind you and your wings clung to your back. You would\u2019ve brought them in but you were unsure how that would affect things. They were probably use to seeing things with all kinds of appendages, from tails to wings it probably wasn\u2019t something they had seen for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, you\u2019re that dragon that has been flying around. Vivian couldn\u2019t shut up about you when she came over last. Aren\u2019t you suppose to be big and scary looking?\u201d asked Anna in a skeptical look as she looked down at you. Her gaze wasn\u2019t predatory like you had feared but it was highly confrontational. She obviously had a problem with her emotions to go from content to hostile so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 well Vivian said that I should remain as a human unless I have to\u2026 or at least human like. Something about freaking people out and scaring the food sources away if I wondered around as a full grown dragon. I guess it makes sense, to a point.\u201d You responded, trying not to offend the heated beauty above you. Why did all these predators have to look like high profile fashion models? That made it really unfair to guys. I mean it would take a couple seconds for any guy to look away from giant models and all their\u2026 glory. Probably why they were a main food source. The animals were too dumb to be affected like guys, mostly humans, would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a human either.\u201d A very sweet sounding voice said from Lea. You looked over at her then started retracting your dragon parts until you were in full human form. \u201cNever mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is awesome. Before he changed to human he took me flying. He is so big he had me on his back and was flying around like\u2026 really fast! And we did that\u2026 and zoom\u2026 and it was awesome.\u201d Crisis exclaimed as she tried to almost act out the motions of you flying. You scratched your head nervously as she spoke. You were not use to all this praise. Sure people sometimes praised you before, but never as openly before and rarely if ever about your dragon half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you brought him here because\u2026?\u201d Anna asked rather unceremoniously and right over your head, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be staying with me.\u201d Crisis said rather bluntly but with her natural innocent charm. This got both of them to stop and think for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Another man eating freak around here.\u201d Anna burst out in a temper driven fit of rage. This brought your mood down. You weren\u2019t even in your dragon from and someone was calling you such things. And it was a giant predator no less. If a predator her size thought you as such\u2026 you were just having betrayal or torture scenarios from the past running through your mind. You definitely weren\u2019t liking the hostility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d You said as you jumped off the table all the way to the entrance then leapt again out of their view. You heard a few yelling matches as you left. You just needed a little air. Maybe it was because things were so peaceful and not\u2026 like that, but that little outburst really affected you. You just needed to take a breath so you leapt to the edge of the surface before a drop that looked over the forest. You sat with your legs draped over the side and trying to overlay what she said with the beauty of the place. But all those memories and a new person that thought it of you wasn\u2019t easy to just burry, especially because you weren\u2019t expecting it and therefore weren\u2019t emotionally guarding against such sentiments. That meant that they hit you with full force.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave?\u201d asked a voice as you heard the other two voices in the background. Crisis and Anna were going at it in a rather strange way as Crisis couldn\u2019t recite why what she said was a bad thing and Anna took anything she said the wrong way. You had tuned them out but now this new voice was From Lea, as she sat next to you. She was rather direct with her question so there wasn\u2019t a lot of room for misreading what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a while since someone said that to my face. Usually people wait at least until they think I can\u2019t hear them to start such talk. Doesn\u2019t seem to matter if I\u2019m in human form or dragon form, I\u2019ll always be considered that way.\u201d You said with a sigh as you didn\u2019t even bother looking over at her. You just swayed your legs as you looked over the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you eat people?\u201d She asked, again, rather directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I have, before. Not by choice though. I\u2019ve never eaten someone for food. It is complicated where I\u2026 use to live. I jumped to a few different worlds because I wasn\u2019t wanted in any of them\u2026 well except the last one. That one sent me hear randomly, which I guess happens around here every once in a while. Anyway, on my world people come to kill me. Dragons in general are worthy of such action so I guess it is understandable why they don\u2019t believe me when I say I\u2019m different. Some times there are bad people that try to harm people I have grown to love or care for. So I deal with them. I also have a second stomach to heal people but\u2026 well I don\u2019t do that anymore either.\u201d You tried to explain but wasn\u2019t really doing a good job of it. You paused before continuing, collecting your thoughts to bring it across a little better. \u201cBut no, I don\u2019t eat people unless I have to and never for food. I have starved for over a year before and never ate someone to satiate the hunger. So when someone says something like that it does two things off the top. It make me feel like no matter what I do I\u2019ll always be considered that way. And it brings back all the memories of people thinking of me that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like you said, it is understandable. I saw you flying a few times already. I know you are big enough to eat even giant sized prey if you wanted and those teeth of yours didn\u2019t do any image favors. You can\u2019t expect us to just let down our guard that easily. This is Felarya you know. The moment you let down your guard you get eaten.\u201d Lea said after a long pause. It was long enough to notice that two more people had joined the conversation. It was unclear how much the two had heard but it didn\u2019t matter to you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I hear you have something cool that I might like.\u201d Anna said to break the ice again. She was obviously not expecting anything and wasn\u2019t really looking to apologize but you assumed Crisis had her ways of forcing her to do so. You didn\u2019t bother turning. You just extended your arm to the side so she could see your dual disk form and start a small tutorial of what duel monsters was and what the duel disk\u2019s function in the game entailed. When the show was over you retracted it and let your arm fall down to your side. The whole time not addressing them while they observed the holographic show. At times they tested it by waving a hand through the image. Crisis seemed put out that she couldn\u2019t eat the person that had appeared to explain it to them. She didn\u2019t get most of the stuff that the other did. But she got that the image wasn\u2019t real and you could make other stuff appear like the man that was there talking, the man she couldn\u2019t grab, hold, or eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that from the other world you were on?\u201d Lea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Believe it or not. There was no war or anything close to predators and prey on that world. Everyone just concentrated on playing that game. It was a very\u2026 uneventful world. No real danger at all. But, for people like us, it was kind of boring.\u201d You answered, still not looking at them. You just sat there, swinging your legs over the edge of the little place you all were occupying. But that stopped when two large fingers picked you up and placed you on a hand. A hand belonging to Anna. She looked at you with a slightly determined and slightly embarrassed face. She obviously wasn\u2019t accustomed to apologizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook\u2026 Ok, I\u2019m sorry. You happy?\u201d she stated with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You replied, obviously not but you said it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. You don\u2019t look like it.\u201d Crisis said, stating the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m not but I accept the apology\u201d You confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d raved Anna as she put her other hand to her head. She obviously wasn\u2019t in this position enough times to know how to handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your apology but I am far from emotionally recovered from it. I work hard to be as gentle and kind as possible. I don\u2019t eat people and I try to help when I can. When someone just doesn\u2019t care and assumes I will never be anything else than what I\u2019ve worked so hard not to become. It doesn\u2019t make me feel like what I chose meant anything. People beg to see my other form then try to kill me or betray me when given the chance. It has happened so often that I am waiting for you to make a move to do so. It would certainly not be the first time and I fear it won\u2019t be the last. So as much as you don\u2019t like me, I equally or more don\u2019t trust you.\u201d You responded. The words seemed to slap her in the face. It was then you realized that she probably didn\u2019t like eating people either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Anna wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Lea said as she was being held by Crisis so she could be in the conversation more formally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said she would.\u201d You stated to her then looked back to Anna. \u201cI simple implied that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she did. I let my emotional guard down to meet her and this is what happens. She acts just like the people that betrayed me before. On top of that she is larger and more dangerous than anyone else that fit the bill. Lea, you just explained it to me from your end but it works both ways. I have no reason to trust her at the moment. Crisis seems deathly loyal, you don\u2019t say anything you don't mean so I can trust what you say. But Anna here is the wild card. The person that I can\u2019t vouch for one way or the other. All I know is that, so far, she has no intention of having me around.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a decent amount of time for you and Anna to see eye to eye. But when you did you all started to get along. You saw the strange but loyal relationship between them. Anna really started to like you when you showed her your vault that you made. A vault with every tool and resource she could possible need. You thought it best that she browse and come back though. For the sake of Felarya in general it wouldn\u2019t be fair to have people in a enclosed space, safe from harm or predators. You soon found that Felarya was so peaceful because of how that system worked. There was no war because everyone was so concentrated on not getting eaten. Idiots that would build or plan such activities in secret were found by hunting predators and\u2026 dealt with. The people learned to live in this world and those that didn\u2019t or that were too arrogant ended up as someone\u2019s meal. Even safe places had their dangers. Ironically the safest place to be was on the shoulder of a giant predator. If someone could befriend the gigantic beauties than they had an infinitely better but not flawless chance of living longer. Of course staying with a predator that could easily swallow you whole and desired to had its own risks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also took them flying on occasion when they weren\u2019t doing anything too pressing and was now comfortable watching Crisis eat. The way you saw it, it was making her happy and it was the way nature was around here. Even if you didn\u2019t eat them yourself you knew that there was a reason why this world wasn\u2019t infested with skyscrapers and exhaust fumes and it had something to do with the way the food chain worked. You preferred a few people getting eaten then millions dying in a war. Plus, there were worse ways to go then to feed a beautiful giant woman, tail aside. Their last sights weren\u2019t so bad if they thought about it. Granted in Felarya the people were more or less immortal if not killed or eaten. But you had seen people die of starvation, plague, disease, cancer, flesh eating virus, and many other things that your genetic knowledge showed you. That didn\u2019t happen in Felarya. The worst way to die was in the stomach of a predator according to most. So, in a way, this way of life was significantly better than the other worlds. Harder for human sized creatures to survive but not worse because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let me down you monster!\u201d hollered a man that Crisis was playing with as she slithered through the jungle with you on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved being with her. Something about her you never could explain just adored her. You slept with her and had no nightmares, you hardly ever got angry when she was near. You didn\u2019t even hate dragons as much when she was around. You even let her lick you a few times but that was as far as you had made it to letting her taste you. She was an excellent hunter and as you were with her a lot you saw her hunt and eat many things, not all human or like species. While she didn\u2019t have the smarts to compete with Anna she had more than enough instinct to make up for it. Plus her almost cluelessly cheerful nature made her always accepting of you no matter what you did, told her, or looked like. And that was perhaps the thing you liked most about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want him?\u201d Crisis asked in her usual fashion. You just shook your head and she just smiled and licked her lips cutely as she was ready to finish off her morning snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou traitor. How can you just watch while she devours people? You are\u2026\u201d he started but you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would highly advise you not to finish that statement.\u201d You said as you flashed your dragon eyes at him. \u201cThe last person that insulted her and me in the same sentence went to my stomach\u2026 in pieces. Wouldn\u2019t you prefer to go into a beautiful young Naga like Crisis in peace, over an angry dragon half-breed in pieces?\u201d You asked with a glare that shut him up rather nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean you want to be eaten by Max? I\u2019ve been trying to get him to eat some more meat but he just won\u2019t eat you little guys.\u201d Crisis asked the man as she held him in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!... uh, no. I think I would rather you eat me.\u201d The man said as you continued to glare at him. Even with him not looking at you he could tell you were doing it. Your eyes were very unnerving when used this way. Even Crisis got the shivers when you glared occasionally at her. It was hard to do but she did do things every once in a while that rubbed you the wrong way to an extent that had to be corrected. The man took this opportunity to look at his captor. You saw his eyes wonder to her body and her bare chest. He allowed himself to find this erotic before either of them continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, down you go.\u201d Crisis said cheerfully as she popped him in her mouth, savored him, then swallowed with a content gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time you had your eyes back to human eyes and looking ahead where you were going. Or more accurately where Crisis was going. She wouldn\u2019t tell you what she was doing or where she was going today. She only said that she was taking you to meet someone. Well you only knew a few of her friends including Vivian and only the other three well enough to call each other friends. Fairies came by every once in a while but rarely long enough for them to get to know you or you them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are going to meet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crisis slithered along and caught a few wondering humans on her way. But she wasn\u2019t going out of her way to do so. You wondered how dumb those that were caught had to be. When Crisis was hunting even you had a hard time finding her. But the way she was moving now was far from stealthy. So to not see or hear her coming was very idiotic of them. Even the \u2018I wasn\u2019t paying attention\u2019 excuse wasn\u2019t valid. That was one thing you didn\u2019t do in Felarya\u2026 will if you wanted to live that is. But finally you saw a sort of house or hut to which you were both moving towards. Strange as you had yet to see a dwelling like that for any of the other predators. Sure Crisis, Anna, Lea, and you had the Giant Tree and others had lakes or whatever but nothing like a material house or in this case a hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2026 Anybody here?\u201d Crisis called but was, for some reason, being extremely careful where she slithered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrisis? Come on in.\u201d came a voice from the hut. This caused Crisis to speed into the hut, still watching where she went more than usual but also with her aura of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your tail, wings, and eyes out so you didn\u2019t have to explain as much but still. As she came into the hut you saw a few things. The strangest thing was the decline in sizes. There was two giant sized people, one Naga and one Giantess. Then there was two human males and a few in a hanging cage but it also had a few nekos in it. Finally there was some of the little beings known as Tomthumbs in various places. Some seemed to be in places where they could have conversations with not only the humans but the giant sized people as well. The size difference was staggering, even if you dealt with if from time to time this was on a whole new level. You could feel hundreds if not thousands of them under her little hut. But were they pests or people, relatively speaking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJissy, you\u2019re here to? And you have your humans.\u201d Crisis said and for once she didn\u2019t lick her lips at the sight of humans, that was until she saw the cage. \u201cOh! Can I have some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilly!\u201d one of the humans exclaimed as he seemed rather flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a friend. It would be rude of me not to share a few snacks.\u201d The Giantess, whom you heard called Milly, replied in a slightly stubborn tone as if she was wrapping up an argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrisis, do you think you can lay off just for a bit. If you keep eating you are going to be too full to fly later.\u201d You stated, which snapped her out of the idea remarkably fast. It was true, she had eaten too much one time and puked all over a square mile when you took her flying right afterwards. Not just any puke either. Half digested nekos, humans, and other things she found with all their blood and her acid spewed over the area. It not only was a very unpleasant experience but it interfered with her hunting for a few weeks afterward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d She answered with a cheerful smile that got the other two to stop arguing to see the rare event of Crisis letting the thought of a wiggling meal go. She was rather famous for her appetite for humans and like creatures. Even famous among other predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d the human asked as he seemed to be the first to speak as the others stared at you. With that Crisis held out her hand and you jumped onto it, flexing your wings and tail as you balanced and she presented you to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Max, he is really a dragon. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d Crisis blurted out in her normal fashion, missing over half the concept of introducing someone. But they seemed to know and recognize this as you bowed to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet all of you.\u201d You recited then straightened for them to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you are the dragon that has been flying around?\u201d Asked the Naga. You flexed your wings and nodded in a sense of supreme recognition and acknowledgement. \u201cBut you are so\u2026 small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But Crisis said that it would be better not to be in dragon form. Something about small people I could accidentally squish. Now that I am here I can see what she meant. My claws alone would dig in and destroy some of their tunnels.\u201d You defended in a slightly apologetic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s rather considerate of you. We were just expecting someone more\u2026 intimidating I guess. That and I wasn\u2019t expecting Crisis to bring you around here.\u201d Milly replied. The Naga seemed to be shying away after her question as the first one was more to do with protection but now was slightly embarrassed and shy about her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, might I have the privilege of knowing all your names?\u201d You asked, Crisis giggling at your polite way of addressing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh how rude of us. Here you are being all polite and introducing yourself and we are leaving you with nothing.\u201d Milly stated then stood more formally beside the Naga. \u201cI am Milly and this is my home. The people underneath are the Tomthumb tribe under my protection, the Alsumi. Of course this is Isham.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jissy and this is Roshan.\u201d The Naga said as each of them gestured to a human on the table. You took note of them all as they were introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that one?\u201d you asked as you pointed to a small figure scurrying off the table. The figure froze as she was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you saw me?\u201d she asked as if trying to get out of a dangerous position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a dragon. My eyes are extremely keen no matter my size. I can even see the little bit of dirt you have in your fingernails.\u201d You answered but friendly enough to appear nonthreatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Tina and she is a very close friend of mine.\u201d Milly said in a protective and threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean anything predatory by it. I just wanted to say hi. I don\u2019t eat people, no matter how small they are.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can show an image via hologram to show a life sized image of me, without me actually having to change.\u201d You quickly added that got them to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes. Do the magic trick!\u201d cheered Crisis as that was what she referred to your Duel disk as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the growing tensions in the air she took you outside and was soon joined by the other five as they got in a small circle so they could talk outside and you could show them. You jumped in front of the little half circle and away from the two Naga tails. Then you activated your duel disk and summoned your hologram. You immediately took control of it so it didn\u2019t scare them and had it land so they could see it. The sight made them cover their humans in a protective manner and Isham covered Tina in the same way in his hands as he was in Milly\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. Just a hologram.\u201d You said as you waved your hand through your hologram\u2019s head as you brought it down. \u201cSee, all it can do is show you an image, realistic and fun to scare the crap out of other people but nothing more than that. This one was made to be an exact duplicate of me by a human in another world. I am greatly thankful so that I don\u2019t have to change every time. But this more than proves my point doesn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour point being?\u201d asked Isham, after he took his turn waving his hand through the image, while being held securely by Milly and he holding Tina just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am more than capable of eating people. Actually I prefer other dragons as they are\u2026 well where I come from they are mostly all evil as far as I am concerned. So the giant predators are in more danger of me eating them than anyone else as I like\u2026 using my teeth in my meals. But, like I said, I don\u2019t eat people.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never eaten someone?\u201d Roshan asked, looking as if he was asking for Jissy\u2019s sake as she and Milly looked fearfully up at the dragon figure as it stood above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. I said I don\u2019t, not that I haven\u2019t.\u201d You replied but saw that it required some more explaining. \u201cI have come from worlds that are in constant war and evil beings roam the world including but not limited to dragons, giant snakes, giant frogs, humans, giantesses, serpents, and werewolves to name a few. In a feral and waring world it only makes sense to eat evil things rather than just kill them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does that make sense?\u201d Isham burst out in a moral sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, most humans that come to me are there to slay the big bad dragon. If they are good they see that I am good and I even fly them back home. If they are evil they are the kind of person that would slaughter their own loving Mothers to get a better shot at me, some do right in front of me. In those cases when I am backed into a corner and they are giving me no other choice I have to act. Just killing them only brings dragons or other heartless beasts around so the only way to get rid of their scent is to eat them. It is likewise for dragons and other things that usually visit me. But the bigger they are the more potential meat they have. So if they are evil and I have to kill them then it would be wasteful to just toss the meat. Not to mention the others of their kind will seek revenge on nearby human villages for slaying the beast, even if I did it.\u201d You explained and they were coming down from their heightened alertness. \u201cSo to answer your question, yes I do eat people. But I don\u2019t enjoy it and I never eat good people\u2026 well not anymore at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore?\u201d asked Roshan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, shouldn\u2019t have said that. Now I have to explain.\u201d You said in a sad tone that Crisis knew. It had taken her a while but you were finally able to explain your past to her so she was protective of you emotionally when it came to such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it again.\u201d Crisis stated then looked up. \u201cIt is a really sad story and it makes Max really sad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Crisis, but I have to know when he will eat us, if he has a reason to do it.\u201d Milly responded then looked with the others toward you and Crisis came around and tried to be there for you as you got ready to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two stomachs. One is the obvious digestion one and one is like a storage one. I can use it to store anything, from extra food and armor to people for transportation. Because it surrounds the person inside in my living flesh it makes it the perfect place to heal people and do healing spells. I eventually got so good that I could heal someone\u2019s leg after it was cut off completely. Or even grow a new one if needed. But I do have to eat the person to get them into the stomach. That use to be the only time I ate friends of good people.\u201d You revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so you can do heal people. That\u2019s a little better.\u201d Isham stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening. He said he doesn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d Roshan interjected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at you to continue and you told them the story and showed them on your hologram where the scars were. Of course that spawned a story about your whole past. It was well into the afternoon by the time you were done and in Crisis\u2019s hand as she comforted you. Her presence prevented you from being too emotional but it was obvious that the story and memories were true and they greatly bothered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you don\u2019t eat anyone and obviously don\u2019t let anyone eat you because of that? Sorry we made you relive such horrid experiences just to quell our concerns.\u201d Milly stated. Luckily Tina had stuck around so you hoped she would spread it around so you didn\u2019t have to repeat it in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is one thing I don\u2019t get.\u201d Isham stated. \u201cWhy are you ok with predators here eating people if you feel so strongly against doing it yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you had seen what I\u2019ve seen you would to. It is amazing here. Sure a few hundred people die every month in this world by being eaten. From the places I\u2019ve been a few thousand, in some cases a few million people die in a day from war, disease, murder, plague, and other things that humans do to each other just for the sadistic fun of it. I\u2019ve seen two million people die in a battle where the whole thing was about a single acre of land where a gold mine was. Here, there is no such wars. Because everyone is so worried about being eaten. There is no sense in starting a war when the predators would eat all your gathered and marching soldiers. No one burns down the woods for fun because they are likely to be eaten by the trees themselves. This place is so peaceful by comparison. So to me, unless I know the person personally then I let Crisis or any of them do their thing. Because I would rather see Crisis happy and full than the casualty of war and dead, along with millions of other people for just some stupid gold.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be ok with it.\u201d Isham said and gave Milly a glare. \u201cBut I can see why you are\u2026 I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I have saved a few from my lovely friend here. Sometime she just loves to eat. And honestly I like seeing her eat because if makes her happy.\u201d You started as you rubbed a cheek Crisis brought you to in order to give you a small comforting hug. She smiled and giggled at this. \u201cBut sometimes she overindulges and doesn\u2019t need to. So I explain it to her in a way she understands. You see, she loves when I take her flying. But she\u2019ll puke if she had too much to eat. So\u2026 she doesn\u2019t overeat in hopes I\u2019ll take her flying. I admit it isn\u2019t much but sensing as I am a predator higher than she is\u2026 it is better than nothing. Besides, if I\u2019m not there watching her eat and enjoy herself than I can\u2019t be there to save anyone, now can I?\u201d You more stated. You used to many words for Crisis to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be ok with people eating other people.\u201d Isham said. You wondered at his one track mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. As annoying as it is to us predators that you push that idea on us wither we agree or not is what makes you\u2026 you. Obviously Milly thought of you as worthy of not eating or you wouldn\u2019t be here. And that includes your moral stubbornness as well.\u201d You complimented, which got the two to smile at each other for the first time since you\u2019d been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, You are a strange one.\u201d Roshan stated and you looked over at him. \u201cI never thought I would here someone both condemn and condone eating people in the same conversation and make it morally believable\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have one weakness though, in the regard of eating people.\u201d You confessed. This got their attention but Crisis already knew what it was so it didn\u2019t really peak her interest. \u201cDragons. I\u2019ve told you my past and what they are like on my world. So it is a permanent part of who I am. If I see a dragon, especially one that is attacking or eating others. I kill it and eat it. I don\u2019t wait for it to make up any number of excuses it may have. If I see it, he or she doesn\u2019t matter, it is dead. Not a lot of people can convince me otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJudging from your past, I\u2019m not surprised. I suppose if a dragon was trying to eat me I wouldn\u2019t want you to hesitate it your resolve. And I\u2019m glad you seem to like my kind.\u201d Jissy stated as she noticed your comfort and contentment with Crisis. Them both being Naga made her feel more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? Every predator I\u2019ve met so far is too damn good looking even for me being a dragon to eat. With Crisis, I just feel compelled to see her happy.\u201d You answered back to which they three giant women blushed deeply but then they all froze to an unmistakable sound of a stomach growling. \u201cSorry, that is me. Uh\u2026 do you mind terribly if I go hunting? No off limits spots or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine what you are going to find. But go ahead. It is good I don\u2019t have to tell you to not eat people or Jade would be cross with me with letting you roam around free.\u201d Milly responded. You nodded then exploded into your dragon from as you leapt to a clear spot. You had gotten better with the jutsu and barely caused any burn damage when doing so anymore. \u201cIs this your hologram?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo this is me. You can touch if you want.\u201d You said as you stretched out a little but careful not to walk on top of the underground Aslumi tunnels but then lowered your head and let them approach so they could touch you. But the calm was interrupted by Crisis jumping on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we fly, can we fly?\u201d Crisis repeated a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I get something to eat and on our way back to the Giant tree. How about while I\u2019m out that you figure out who wants to fly. And yours will be the longest and last one of the day.\u201d You suggested and her eyes lit up at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Go hunting and I\u2019ll get them ready. Oh! This is so much fun. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d She finished and you smiled at the others as if to communicate that her joyful and happy response was what you were talking about. They seemed to enjoy this as well then let you creep into the jungle as you went hunting for food. Immediately you caught the scent of a few things that were on your menu and headed off as silent as the approaching night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan\u2019t you go a little slower\u2026!\u201d asked and exclaimed Roshan as you banked and spun to Jissy\u2019s delight. Despite his old man persona of this experience, he was having a good enough time. If nothing else he was enjoying how thrilled Jissy was as you took her higher than even the Harpies could go and at speeds she only dreamed of going. Being do big she couldn\u2019t just ask a fairy or Harpy to take her flying and if she was small enough to do so than she would be worried of them gulping her down. So she was having the time of her life at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, we\u2019re going to crash!\u201d Exclaimed Jissy as she held almost deathly tight onto your neck and shoulders as you dove from a very high altitude to a small lake, well small from the height but was large enough for several giant sized predators to call it home. It was a good thing you secured her tail as she would\u2019ve squeezed the life out of you if it was free to roam around your body. At the last moment as she squealed you pulled up and a pleasant mist graced the two that were riding you at the moment before you took off toward the sky again. However flying Crisis, Milly, Isham, Tina, and now Jissy and Roshan; the whole accumulated task was making you understandably tired. But then again you rarely got a good workout in dragon form and you were far from an unpleasant level of fatigue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is certainly something.\u201d Roshan said as you leveled off and soared. He was strapped on your head as there was little room on your back because of Jissy. Either way you had to look up at him if you wanted to see him, rather than looking back like you use to do. \u201cIt is also a great way to get over our fear of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026 I think.\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying yourself back there?\u201d asked Roshan as he addressed Jissy while she was sitting up and spreading her arms. It was a constant thing for people on calm moments to do so. To feel the air run through their body as if they were the ones flying. The lack of effort and the escalated breeze that they couldn\u2019t feel anywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Crisis was right. Definitely worth not eating those last nekos. Thank you Max, this is wonderful. I can\u2019t believe how high we are. I wish I could stay up here forever.\u201d She said as she hugged back into your shoulders and neck, laying her head down on your neck and watching the scenery from so high up with a content smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI owe you a big one for this.\u201d Roshan said as he looked back at her gleaming happy face. \u201cYou\u2019re right, seeing that look on their faces is more than its own reward. Jissy has been through so much that I am filled with joy whenever she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It is just as much a pleasure for me to create these happy memories as it is to see them. The only thing I ask is that you give me the benefit of the doubt. I don\u2019t think it will be too long before some kind of drama hits and makes people question me. I am a dragon after all, and more than capable of doing a lot of people a lot of damage. But I would never do it. If you can trust that and help others do the same then consider all debts paid.\u201d You said than looked back at Jissy as she was almost sleeping or dreamily gazing at the approaching jungle as you descended. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could take it too well if those joy filled faces turned like so many others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider it done. If I have anything to say about it, she will listen before judging you.\u201d Roshan agreed and got a content purr from you that was easily recognized as such<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were in sight of the others and landed as lightly as you could but was more than happy to lay down and take a rest yourself to let them off. Not that most of the others were in any kind of condition to help them. So Jissy just slithered over your body and retrieved Roshan from your head then went over by the relaxing and content beauties, along with their perspective humans. With a final little bit of effort you exploded into your human form again. You were close enough to Crisis to come over and pick you up before reclining with the others. But you simply laid in her hand as she carried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you ok Max?\u201d asked Crisis as she brought you to her face to observe anything that could be considered the opposite of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just tired. I think I\u2019ll let you carry me for a bit, while I take a nap.\u201d You replied as you stroked a nearby finger to which she smiled. As observed before, she wasn\u2019t really smart in the book sense but her instinct was rarely matched. She couldn\u2019t understand the complicated reason why you were tired but just knew that you were running low on energy and just accepted that she was going to be taking care of you until you woke. She didn\u2019t mind as she liked being able to protect you when she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, have a nice rest!\u201d she said cheerily and it was a pleasant sight of her bright and shining face of joy that you fell asleep to. Once again, the feeling she gave off lulled you to be completely calm and content and another sleep void of nightmares approached to which you embraced.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Such as not protruding your wings and curling up into a ball of sorts to brace for the impact that you shortly felt. You barely was left awake by the impact as you were hurdled so hard against the ground that you actually bounced and came out of the thick forest you had landed in. You barely could keep your eyes open as you saw you were headed to a small clearing and vaguely saw an old looking man with a beard and staff that was around a fire at the moment. Your dragon instinct almost required you to make note of everything you saw in such situation. But that came to an end as you hit the ground again and skidded both to a stop and into unconsciousness. It was a good thing you were still suffering the effects of that damned egg. Otherwise your body might\u2019ve sprouted your dragon parts and that would be insanely hard to explain to a stranger. As it stood, you would have to explain how you could survive such a fall. Hopefully the man you had saw when you landed would be understanding and somewhere near kind. But you would see, as you awoke with the biggest headache you\u2019d ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, what a pain,\u201d You said as you bolted up from the laying down position before you could stop yourself. But the sudden action only brought more pain to your head as you smacked your hands to it in order to nurse the throbbing headache. As your body was rather good at healing, it didn\u2019t take long but long enough for the man from before to notice your sudden movement and address it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I would have a throbbing head to, if I had hit the ground like you did. Scratch that, I would be dead, so I am most intrigued how you survived with only a headache to show for it,\u201d The old man stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I would like to save the question game until I know you better than a few words,\u201d you suggested as you got up and stretched. The old man seemed unnervingly calm for what apparently just happened in front of him. Most humans would be running or putting you in shackles as a freak or something. He seemed to be sitting there without a care in the world. You felt a little ping as you looked back at him as if his presence was in your mind as well as in front of you. The feeling was strange so you blocked it off of reflex alone. Soon you sat down on a log on the opposite side of the fire than him. It wasn\u2019t a large fire, so there was more than enough sightline to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, young man, how about we start with introductions. I am Brom, the\u2026 storyteller,\u201d he said, although the designation was a little off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what it was about this guy but you felt both angry and happy with him. Your instinct seemed to trust him but the scent of him threw you off. Then it came to you. He had the very faint scent of dragon on him. Like the dragon riders from Base Realm. You had only met one and it was one you almost killed. But he had been more sensible and decided to \u2018let you go\u2019. It was closer to the other way around but still, it was the one dragon, other than Kara, that had not attacked you. But the scent was not a welcome one to you. You had to suppress an urge to find and destroy the dragon you smelt from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Max,\u201d you greeted simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, do you have parents?\u201d Brom asked just as simply but saw an instant change in your mood to which he apparently knew the cause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I pry too much. However, a young man like yourself falling out of the sky in the middle of the field does rise some questions. If I were your father, I would want to know you were at least alive. So I don\u2019t mean to be intrusive into painful memories but I do need to know if I should be taking you somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 my parents are\u2026 gone,\u201d You said, trying to answer the question without giving too much away. You looked over your body and did give him the benefit of the doubt. You looked only like a 13 year old kid. Large for your age, certainly, but as a responsible adult he was doing right by asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I may not know what or who they are but I understand the loss of a loved one. Are you hungry? I got some stew that I was about to indulge in,\u201d he offered. You were surprised at the end of personal questions that most people would\u2019ve bombarded you. You took a whiff of the stew that was on the fire. It was like the stew Sarah had made on occasion with the deer you brought back. Oddly enough, you\u2019d never tried it. Usually you preferred the raw meat of what was left over and allowed her to cook her own meal as such. But in human form your stomach growled at the sight of food. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a bowl and another human utensil that you had seen others use. One thing you prided yourself on was the ability to learn quickly. Things that Sarah or others practiced you could duplicate when you went to human form. Sure, some things required more practice but basically you could replicate it. So you graciously took the bowl of freshly poured stew and the utensil and ate as \u2018politely\u2019 as you could. It took a good amount of effort to not just wolf the surprisingly good food down. Brom seamed surprised as you polished off the whole pot of stew after he had his share. But surprised or not, he just kept pouring and you kept eating. He washed the items and put them away after the meal as you licked your lips. He seemed to notice this with a certain fondness that you had to assume reminded him of whatever dragon he was attached to. But since you were in no hurry to meet such a beast you didn\u2019t ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Lord Brom, for the wonderful meal.\u201d You complimented. You had only been around humans in pleasant company for a short time. Sarah was like your sister and all the others had titles to come before their name. So you used the most esteemed one you could think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019lord?\u2019 No, just Brom is fine. I have no attachment to royalty or status like that. But a very polite boy for you to treat your elders so well. I am flattered,\u201d he returned to which you nodded in understanding of his lighthearted instruction. \u201cNow, we do need to discuss something.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDiscuss something?\u201d You asked as you tried to ascertain what he was talking about. You felt the presence again in your mind and easily blocked it. This seemed to get a gleam in his eye but nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you have no family or person to take you to I have to make sure a young boy like yourself is at least taken care of. I can\u2019t, with good conscious, just leave you out in the wilderness near the Spine on your own now can I?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I guess not. What is the Spine?\u201d You asked as you didn\u2019t know if it was some kind of dragon nest or something. The way he said it, it appeared it was avoided for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, you must really be from far away indeed if you haven\u2019t even heard of the Spine. I suppose all you need to know about it is that it is a dangerous and chaotic place that is as uncertain as the wind as far as magical and predatory worth is concerned. There are stories of groups of men going mad after coming back from the Spine, or not coming back at all. Not a place for a young boy like yourself,\u201d Brom explained. He seemed to be evaluating just who and what you were. The thought that you were unfamiliar with the landmarks as known as this \u2018Spine\u2019 was not unheard in the old man\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where am I going to live?\u201d You asked. This old man wasn\u2019t just going to walk away and let you choose for yourself. In a way it was comforting to have someone put some worth on you again. Even a stranger, you were taking the situation with some salt in seeing that of all the people that could\u2019ve found you, Brom was at least nice on the surface. If any person could handle you in the future it would be this man. Sure the dragon scent on him was a little infuriating but it also provided you with necessary acceptance at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really do this all the time but\u2026 I suppose  you can stay with me. I have a feeling that no one would leave you alone if they found out how you ended up here, from wherever you are from. What am I suppose to tell people? Hey, adopt this kid. He fell from the sky so hard that it made the ground shake then landed in front of me. I might be able to handle it, but others will not. That being said, I would keep that to yourself as will I,\u201d Brom advised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thank you for your kindness, and wisdom\u2026 Brom,\u201d you thanked. You didn\u2019t know how long you would stay but you did know that you were lucky to find someone so accepting right off the bat. You didn\u2019t know what his intention was but you could handle it if he ended up hiding some deep and dark secret. Couldn\u2019t be worse than anything you already experienced. Or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain with the polite talk. It\u2019s enough to make an old man like me blush,\u201d he joked as he smiled and reddened a little. Wither it was real or an act was still up in the air. But for now you took his word. He had earned that much from you in the short time you both had over the meal. Not only that but he was going to take you in for assumedly free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent wondering back to a village called \u2018Carvahall\u2019. Both of you were like a sponge, soaking up anything  you could learn from the other through seemingly idle conversation. But both of you were equally evasive about certain topics. Background and history of one\u2019s self being chief among them. It was well into the night or early morning by the time you and Brom had made it back to the town. You took in everything. You had never been in a town like this with the intent to stay for a while as a resident. So you took in the layout rather quickly. At least you wouldn\u2019t get lost, well for the most part. You still had no idea what humans did with some of the things you saw. Why did humans need shops to sell meat when they could just go out and hunt themselves? Why were little shiny trinkets apparently so valuable? That, and you never got why they needed so many layers or sets of clothes. You only wore your made up clothes to blend in. Why they NEEDED them was still a mystery to you. That, and why do humans need those things on their feet then complain they\u2019re feet hurt when walking around without them? Humans were sure strange creatures and always hiding something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Brom stated as he ushered you into a relatively small house. You looked around but didn\u2019t touch anything. You had learned from Sarah, long ago, that human stuff was usually brittle and private. Since you didn\u2019t need such things you didn\u2019t see the point in potentially breaking things just to sate your curiosity. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 fine, it looks like a fine dwelling\u2026 house\u2026 it looks like a fine house,\u201d You stumbled, aware that dwelling was not something humans said about their residence too often. Usually it was something like \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018farm\u2019 for those that grew plants to eat. Brom seemed to catch this but, with everything else you said strangely, he put it in an internal archive of knowledge he was accumulating about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is your house now as well. Let me show you to a room you can sleep in,\u201d Brom suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe showed you around the house. You were assigned to a smaller room in the \u2018house\u2019 and was shown certain things. As you thought, there were a few items like these things called \u2018scrolls\u2019, that were very brittle. You told him you couldn\u2019t read and he was surprised. You really didn\u2019t have the need to read before. You had genetic knowledge and no practical need to do so before. You both sighed, as it would take a considerable amount of effort for you to fit in. Not to mention, this \u2018reading\u2019 would be the only way you could find out information about how the portals worked. That more than anything spurred you on to learn. Over the next week or so, Brom ascertained multiple areas that you didn\u2019t know much on. Ironically, fighting was already in your mind. So when he tested you, you thoroughly beat him in very few moves. Most of them you had seen Sarah, Nick, or any of the solders and assassins practice. However, most of the other things that needed to be learned as a human were sorely lacking. You decided to learn as much as you could about everything you could. You even got a job, hunting for meat and making leather on top of everything else you were volunteered for by Brom. That paid the bills nicely and gave you some pride that Brom wasn\u2019t doing this for nothing. Hunting, as Brom found out, was just another of the things you needed NO help in. So it began, your life in Carvahall with Brom the Storyteller.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMax!\u201d Brom called to which you came over to him from a rare bit of relaxing you were doing. You came into the house to meet a young boy you had seen around. He was a few years older than you were but you both shared one thing, a thirst of Brom\u2019s stories. \u201cThought you would like to know Eragon is here, again, and hear some more stories and questions that he is always full of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Eragon, how\u2019s it going?\u201d You asked politely with a short bow. You had been doing that to show respect to elders. Eragon seemed younger than his age the way he acted at times but he was still older than you so you paid him the respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed how quickly a simple human bow would bring someone\u2019s opinion of you. It was like a switch to their internal pride and emotion based acceptance. You didn\u2019t really need another reason to do it. Although it was harder to do to some, like when you sold meat to Slone. No matter how good of price you gave him or how polite you were, somehow he always seemed to have a stick up his butt. Always crabbing about one thing or another. The only good feature about him was his dedication to his daughter. The way he adorned her was probably the only thing that kept people around him. Thinking that he MIGHT be halfway decent under his rough exterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough. I royally failed in hunting today and almost got nothing from Sloan as well. You seem to be the only one that can catch anything of value around here. I have to go way out to the Spine to hunt,\u201d Eragon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the Spine? You must be either insanely brave or stupid to go into there,\u201d you said in a clear compliment. He smiled at the statement as he normally did when you embellished him. He seemed to be upbeat when someone acknowledged his skill in anything, regardless how low it may be in the area. With your mastery of so many of the town\u2019s professions it was compliment when you gave it to him that he was not shy in receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok, now let\u2019s get going on this session. You\u2019re uncle will have my hide if I keep you too long,\u201d Brom said with a fanned bit of impatience that you both knew was false. He may have complained every once in a while from the constant questions but he was far from not wanting to give the answers, or at least an answer. Sometimes you didn\u2019t think it was quite true. You had heard a story then read one from one of his scrolls with a vague but distinct difference in what he had said. Not enough to be inherently false but not then ENTIRE truth either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, you wish to know about dragons and their riders, again?\u201d he asked as Eragon nodded. This was one subject that you didn\u2019t really care for at first but was growing in intrigue. It appeared that Dragons were at least halfway honorable in this realm, even by your standards. You learned a lot, even when Brom only talked to you about and things he didn\u2019t tell Eragon, that made your hatred of dragons become less prominent in this realm at least. You got the fact that some were still evil but there were so few and the others that would otherwise be good had dampened your bloodlust for them. If you slaughtered the wrong one, you could effectively destroy the mystical and good force of this realm and world. Something you weren\u2019t willing to do. Didn\u2019t mean you were going to accept one, even them being good, with open arms either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Brom told the two of you about the history of riders and how they came into being. It was apparently a rarely told story, as the king had an active bias against anything that would threaten his rule. Saying that he betrayed anyone and the evil persona that he got from such a historical story was not one he would like to be repeated. So you listened intently at every detail. By the end of it you had a major question in your mind, as did Brom. The question to each other was relatively the same on both sides and growing with anticipation for the answer as you got to know each other. Your rapid ability to pick up things and you insane amount of ability in anything you mastered turned more than his head, regardless how well you hid it. On his end, he knew things that wasn\u2019t in any of his books and seemed to have intimate knowledge of things he spoke of. Things that couldn\u2019t be known unless he was there. That would make him insanely old by the timeframe he had set in his stories. Not to mention, his scent and the weird words he said every once in a while when he did things you knew were not anything but magic. You also saw, even through his glove, an insignia that he NEVER revealed to anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question to each other was simple; \u201cWho and what are you?\u201d Both of you wanted to know this about the other. But neither wanted to sacrifice what you had both gained over the months of living together. But as time went by, it became increasingly hard to bare not asking it. One of you were going to break at some point, but who?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Brom asked as he caught up with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been talking with him then all of a sudden you smelled a very strong scent of a dragon. It didn\u2019t take you too long to find the source, a small \u2018stone\u2019 that Eragon had in his pack. The stone was obviously a dragon egg, well obvious to you at least. Either way, you had to leave the town to keep from smashing it. The sudden change in behavior had not gone unnoticed. What usually was a pretty calm day and final lesson on writing was now a very stress filled day. You just needed to blow off some steam but you couldn\u2019t with Brom here. It was hard to control it but you managed as he got closer. Despite the dragon scent on him, the rest of him was rather soothingly calm. Not like Sarah\u2019s scent but he definitely allowed you to feel relatively at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d you answered as you turned away. You stopped walking as you were about to go into the Spine. Not that you were afraid of it but it was one of the things you didn\u2019t do in order to remain inconspicuous. So you just stared into it, not wanting to give anything away to the keen eyes of Brom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing? Sorry son, but that won\u2019t cut it this time. I know we\u2019ve been mysterious to each other while still becoming close. But this was the last straw. Not in a bad sense but I can\u2019t justly NOT ask you about it now that an instance of you running off is so fresh in my mind. You don\u2019t have to relive your past right now. But I will require you to explain the things you can do and have done. Put it to you this way, no HUMAN can do the things I\u2019ve seen you do. You hide it rather well, but I\u2019ve seen you do things that defy my knowledge, which is extensive. So start explaining. I don\u2019t care how much, but something has to give at this point,\u201d Brom demanded, although he did so in a voice that you wondered about. It was as if he had a power to guilt, calm, advise, consult, inspire, and convince someone all in one. This geezer was too wise for his own good. You had 2 options in front of you. You could start talking or find a way not to. You couldn\u2019t imagine killing him to keep your secret and you had grown to attached to him to run away. Not only that but the guy was insanely good at finding you. Sometimes you sensed his eyes on you, even when he wasn\u2019t within miles of where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou to,\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Brom asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like both of us have questions and concerns about the other. I admit that you have seen things I didn\u2019t intend to show you, at least for a while. But it works both ways. I\u2019ve seen you do things that\u2026 well are impossible underneath a certain light. Definitely not in the light of a common story teller,\u201d you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, if I go first, will you follow in revealing things about yourself as well?\u201d he asked, getting back to a more sensible request then a simple command for you to do as he told you. This was actually the first time outside educational and story based questions that you defied his command. You had done what he said without question while learning the things you needed to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I will.\u201d You conceded, obviously not liking the idea but was willing to trust him. He seemed to understand this, somehow, and went on with an agreeable nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I can do magic. That is the first one. What about you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if we are going to go this slow we will be here all day. Why don\u2019t you just come out and say it? You are a dragon rider, right?\u201d You asked, obviously not in a mood to beat around the bush when you had to give such a secret about youself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d He asked, as if some big secret was being revealed that he did not intend and wondered if you were some kind of spy all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause I\u2019m a dragon.\u201d You said simply but with a glare that revealed that you weren\u2019t kidding or joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d He asked, convinced he misunderstood you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 AM\u2026 A\u2026 DRAGON\u2026\u201d you said slowly and as clear as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 well you don\u2019t look like\u2026\u201d he started but you had no intention of staying on this point for an extended amount of time. So you interrupted him by springing your severely cramped wings and tail out. He fell backward at the sudden action before getting up in a ready position but straightened then circled you as he saw the lack of aggression as you let him do so. \u201cSo\u2026 you are a dragon, and that is how you knew I was a dragon rider?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and no. You aren\u2019t as subtle as you think when hiding things. Starting a fire with a single word. The light that glows when you do so from the symbol on your hand, and the books that explained what a Gedwey Insignia was. Not to mention your very scent has some traces of dragon in it. And about me being a dragon\u2026 that is true, and it isn\u2019t. I am both human and dragon,\u201d You explained as simply as possible so he could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be both?\u201d he asked, obviously never hearing of such a thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am what is known as a \u2018half-breed\u2019. I can go from completely human to completely dragon. As you can see, I can stop in the middle to some extent and lose none of my power in either,\u201d you explained as you moved your tail in an obvious demonstration of what your half and half form looked like, or mostly looked like. You left only your wings and tail out. Somehow you didn\u2019t thing that the whole glowing red eyes was a good starting point with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Brom started and you braced for one of 2 things. He was either going to condemn you like everyone else at first glance or he was going to accept you. He seemed very open to the dragon part, almost longing for it. But he was also unnerved by this whole thing, understandably so. So you waited for him to react. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sighed, as that was about as good as you were expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was going to condemn you he would\u2019ve attacked then fled like so many others over the years. You rushed forward and caught him before his body hit the ground. Lifting him up, you rushed off into the Spine and into a place you knew no one would follow and a place you had made just for this occasion. You could transform and not be seen, even by the air. There was only one way in and it was hard enough for you to get through. There was no way anyone else could without some serious effort and notice from all sides. But you didn\u2019t transform right away. You just started a fire and waited. For him to wake up. You placed him in a comfortable spot among some blankets you materialized. The ground was cold just before winter. So you didn\u2019t want him, the only person who you intimately knew, to die of cold. So you waited with your wings and tail still out. Finally he got up, he looked around to get his bearings then his eyes fell on you as you were just looking into the fire, obviously avoiding eye contact but also deep in thought. You were thinking of all the ways it could go wrong and also nervous about the one human in this realm that you liked more than any other. You\u2019d never had a father figure before so you didn\u2019t know what it felt like. But if you had to guess, it would be what you were feeling about Brom. Combined with your dragon loyalty and emotional attachment, you were insanely nervous of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked to break the silence and bring your concentration to him. You hesitantly looked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a hidden area in the Spine. I found this place for when I eventually tell someone about myself so I could show them without prying eyes,\u201d you revealed then looked back at the fire. It was getting low so you put some more logs on it and blew some light flames to it in order to keep the temperature to a comfortable level. This seemed to get Brom\u2019s attention if you hadn\u2019t already had it with your wings and tail flexing nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said all of a sudden as he took a spot surprisingly right next to you. You almost bolted from the log you had set up for seating. But his hand on your leg kept you there. Not by physical force obviously but definitely out of concern that moving against it might hurt him, one way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d you asked as you looked into his eyes. He did the same so you let your dragon eyes go and he was strangely delighted at this. He was so entranced by your sudden features that he almost forgot to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn old dragon rider gets to meet another dragon and all I can do is faint. That paints a wonderful picture of me doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked sarcastically. He took one hand and draped it against your wings in amazement then looked back at you. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would go all the way to dragon form would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can, but\u2026\u201d you started but stopped, looking away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d he asked, probably wondering if he had done something wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, it hurts a lot to go all the way. Growing wings and stuff, that\u2019s easy. But going from all human to all dragon, is a way bigger change\u2026 obviously. So my body literally has to rip itself apart to do it. As you can imagine, it isn\u2019t something I enjoy doing multiple times if at all. Usually I like staying in one or the other,\u201d you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would it hurt if it is something you were made to do?\u201d he asked back in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought on it. The only thing I can come up with is so that it makes it fair if I was to infiltrate a human village then transform into a dragon. I would be too tired and in pain to consider to go on a rampage. I suppose it is a way to keep me in check,\u201d you answered. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do it for you, if you really want to see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d He asked hopefully but he also didn\u2019t want to cause you any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then got up. He was going to follow but you shook you head and had him sit down then went over to the open spot. You started it for the first time since you had done so in relation to the egg Kara\u2019s parents had used on you. It hurt just as much as you remembered. You tried your best to keep from making too much of a fuss for Brom\u2019s sake but it wasn\u2019t easy and it was impossible to do completely. In the end you were growling and snarling just like normal. He stood and backed up until he hit the tree line. With nowhere to go he was forced to watch as you changed and convulsed. Finally you were done and panting on the ground. It felt good to be back in dragon form again, but the pain was still not something you looked forward to. As you recovered you heard his steps as he came forward. He stopped when you moved to a more approachable position. But doing so required you to rake you huge and deadly claws in the dirt, alongside the trenches you already made from the change in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can approach, I won\u2019t bite,\u201d You said softly and as nonthreatening as you could without showing teeth and ALL the tricks you learned to make it so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk, in the human tongue, without using your mind?\u201d he asked with astonishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It took some doing, but like I said, I lose none of my abilities as dragon or human, talking included,\u201d you answered. \u201cAh, it feels good to stretch out. I haven\u2019t been able to do this for months. My wings were so cramped I was afraid they would have age cracks in them,\u201d you said as you stretched them out broadly before folding them back against your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine that isn\u2019t the only thing you miss. If I miss flying in the sky as a human, dragon rider aside, I can\u2019t imagine how it must be for you,\u201d Brom said as he openly gawked at you and your body. Every move you made was like a treasure to him, from the look of it. He was actually on the verge of tears for multiple reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s obvious isn\u2019t it?\u201d You asked rhetorically. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You showed him your scares and your hatred of dragons despite being one yourself. He understood but obviously didn\u2019t approve. For a people the revered dragons so much, he was probably incapable of hating dragons. He asked if he could touch you more informally and you agreed as you answered his questions. As it stood you needed some time to rest from transforming so after a little Q&amp;A you fell asleep and let him do as he willed around you. When you woke you found him laying on your snout, just listening to your body with an ear to your scales. With him there you didn\u2019t think it wise to talk out loud so you spoke to him in his head. <i>\u201cYou still there Brom?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOf course I am. Since my dear Saphira died I have missed being with a dragon. I can\u2019t seem to get enough. I know it might\u2019ve been intrusive to explore your body as you slept but I assure you it was not by any means immoral in the intension or execution. I would ask to go flying with you but at your size I would say that it isn\u2019t really possible without showing yourself to the world. That would be a bad move until we can make it safe for you to do so. I assume that a bunch of people running in horror isn\u2019t something you want\u201d.</i> He thought back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, as usual. Although, if it is ok with you, I wouldn\u2019t mind flying at night in human form?\u201d</i> You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI think that would be ok. As long as you\u2019re careful. I suppose I should start teaching you dragon and dragon rider things when I get the time. You said you didn\u2019t know any structured magic beyond materializing and things your \u2018Genetic Knowledge\u2019 has taught you. Some of those things are beyond anything any of us can ever do. I doubt you can read the Ancient language and words of power that the Elves use if you couldn\u2019t read and write normally.\u201d</i> Brom answered and offered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat would be wonderful. I would love to know more things. Even if I plan to stay here for a while, it would be nice to be able to learn how to get back eventually. Learning as much as I can is the best way and I couldn\u2019t think of a better teacher. That and I don\u2019t have to tiptoe around this side anymore when you wonder how and why I can pick stuff up so fast.\u201d</i> You replied with a great amount of excitement. Brom could feel this and got off your snout so you could move more freely without worrying about accidentally hurting him. You liked that he had enough experience to know what to do and when to do it, relatively speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there buddy. One thing at a time. I promise to teach you everything I can while I can as long as you promise me one thing,\u201d Brom said to which you leveled your head that you had sprung up when he got off. It was a mode of high concentration that left your head inches away from him. Obviously you were taking whatever he said seriously and with high attention so he continued as it was more than enough to guess you agreed with the condition. \u201cThere are very few dragons in this world. I want you to promise that you will not slay, eat, kill, or slaughter any of them unless you are absolutely sure they are evil. An attitude much like the one you have towards close friends. I know you will be on edge and that is ok, as long as you keep your head and think very carefully and long before tearing into one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a big favor to ask,\u201d you almost growled at your obvious displeasure at his terms. You had already decided to think hard on it before killing the dragons of this realm. But the level he was implying was more so. To think of them as friends until proven otherwise, that was something you were very reluctant to do. \u201cVery well, I will hold off my wrath on the dragons of this realm until they prove themselves a legitimate threat to those I have come to love, like, and protect. No instant killing or eating them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough,\u201d Brom agreed as he put a hand on your snout to which you exhaled through your nose to plow some wind at him. Just enough to get him to know that it wasn\u2019t your preferred way of dealing with things but was willing to trust him on it. \u201cOk big guy, as much as I would love to keep you company in this form, we should head back as soon as we can. So you should probably change back. I surely hope the occasion is warranted for you to stay as a dragon in the very near future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs do I,\u201d you agreed then backed off a little then started the hard and painful process of turning to human again. When it was done you were helped by Brom to the fire bit. He didn\u2019t say anything about the dragon parts you left out. He probably didn\u2019t want to be rid of them any more than you did. Now that he knew about you, he was obviously planning on having much more deep of a relationship with you. A rider and his/her dragon were very close. While it could turn slightly romantic on an impractical level it usually was just a very deep friendship that went deeper than family. So having anything near that level was probably a plus for him. You didn\u2019t mind letting him get close to you. But you hoped it wouldn\u2019t backfire if he was taken from you. You would use all your strength to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThat is just amazing.\u201d Brom said as he tried teaching you magic and the ancient language. Apparently you already knew how to speak it as naturally as you could dragon tongue. In a way it made sense. If you had all the genetic knowledge including genetic ANCIENT knowledge of words before dragon tongue than you would know this \u2018Ancient Language\u2019 somewhere in your mind. You had rarely used it because no one could understand it and you couldn\u2019t lie. Not that you did that much but it was a spoken trap if you agreed to something before you understood fully. But you had spoke simply with animals and such. Most didn\u2019t have much to say on an intellectual level but they did have simple things like \u201cok\u201d or \u201cPrey\u201d. Things that an instinctual side would use. However, while you understood the language and now understood how to access your magic through it, you were far from able to write it or read it. So that is what he taught you. But now you both were on a different topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you should have a firm grasp on weapons,\u201d Brom stated as he held up a bow and arrow to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, the question was why?\u201d you asked yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, wise guy, what are you going to do when you have to hide and fight at the same time? Fighting at a believable level or as one like you were when that egg effected you. You can\u2019t just use your tail, as sharp as it may be. You know the sword from watching people but you are far from talented as you could be. Not to mention you break every bow you put your hands on. Not only that, but magic will scare people away just as much as your dragon abilities will. You need to learn these things. Besides, you\u2019ve learned everything else I can teach you. Might as well be well versed in combat,\u201d Brom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but what good is a bow going to be against a dragon or something as heavily armored?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is one of the reasons why we should make you YOUR bow. A bow and arrow that could penetrate a dragon\u2019s hide would only be able to be pulled by a master inhumanly strong\u2026 like you. Naturally the bow that could do that could also be very strong and able to fire a very long distance. So\u2026 got any ideas?\u201d Brom asked finally getting your imagination working. He was good with words and knew just what to get you interested. A bow strong enough to penetrate a dragon\u2019s hide was just up your alley of impossible feats that had a worthy goal, in your mind at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the winter came you spent an ungodly amount of time in the blacksmith shop working on your bow and arrows. Most of you experiments were in failure. A wood bow was too weak, no matter how well it was made. A metal bow would crack under the pressure and was too loud. So you mixed things with magic and everything you could think of to solve the riddle. Finally you got what you needed. It was hard to make but you got an idea from the Zar\u2019roc. It was obviously stronger and more well made than anything you\u2019ve ever seen. So you used a bit of magic and your own hottest flames to create a metal that was so hard that you had a hard time breaking it even with all your might but was as quiet as you were, no creaking or cracking at strain not to mention its sharp edge could be used for a blade. Connecting the two ends was a wire of the same metal but in ultra thin strands so it had the durability of the rest of the bow but the flexibility of a thread. Because it was metal it was not easy for even you to pull back once you strung the bow. With the bow you had to make and be able to materialize arrows of the same metal. But augmented them to disappear after they stopped moving for over an hour after being fired from your bow. You didn\u2019t need some idiot copying your material to use it against you. When you were done you showed it to Brom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 is crazy,\u201d He remarked as he could no sooner pull the bow back than he could bend a sword in half. He settled with running his hands along its sleek black design, as it had your magic in its make, it was the same color. He remarked the sharp edges of both the bow but also the arrows. It wouldn\u2019t do to have traditional feathers as they could support the velocity or weight. So you had thin membrane metal feathers that handled it well enough. But anyone but you could cut themselves badly by running their fingers over the metal feathers as Brom found out. \u201cCan you even fire this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch. You challenge me to make a bow that could kill a dragon. You shouldn\u2019t have said it if you weren\u2019t serious,\u201d you stated as you pulled back the bow with a materialize arrow that got him to look on in wonder. You both had moved to the Spine to try it out. You pointed the deadly end at a series of boulders that you had moved in line. You let the arrow fly and shattered all 400 feet of them before lodging in the last boulder with a noticeable indent from its impact. The boulders before that shattered to the speed and force of the arrow as it had passed through them. Brom coughed wildly for a moment at the sight. \u201cI made this strong enough to get through MY scales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel sorry for whomever you point that thing at. You\u2019ve just made something that combines a blade, bow, and siege machine in one. Forget the armor if you got that thing,\u201d Brom complimented. You didn\u2019t really notice it the way he said it at the time. But now that you looked at it he was right. You could fight melee battles with it and long ranged, EXTREME long ranged. You had been so excited in creating it you didn\u2019t realize the implications of it. To top it off, you could dematerialize it along with the arrows to keep it safe. Not like someone could crush it without a considerable amount of force and magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I did go a little overboard,\u201d you stated as you scratched the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance. If anybody is at fault is I. I got that large brain of yours thinking and am solely responsible for egging you on to create it. The peaceful side of me asks you never to use that thing, but the pride side of me can\u2019t keep from grinning at your accomplishment,\u201d he stated as he didn\u2019t hide the grin he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it is a better way that changing to dragon form to deal with quality opponents. With this thing, people will concentrate on the bow instead of me if I ever have to use it. Not that they could pull it back even if they could steal it,\u201d you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Why don\u2019t you carry it around as a deterrent?\u201d Brom suggested. \u201cIt looks mean enough by itself. Perhaps the mere sight of it will prevent you from having to use it. That and it is rising suspicion that you don\u2019t go hunting with a bow like the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking. I guess being old has its perks,\u201d you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Laugh it up you oversized rat,\u201d he teased back as you sheathed your new bow on your back with the arrows in the case you made for it. You were both thoroughly proud and afraid of the new weapon you just created. Silently, even as you both laughed, you both wished you would never have to legitimately use it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had told him about the new dragon you had caught the scent of. For that reason, you had kept your distance from the Spine where it dwelled most of the time. But you had not revealed who the rider was. He finally found out and was readying for a trip. He packed Zar\u2019roc as well all his money and supplies. \u201cIn case you are wondering, he doesn\u2019t know I know. I found out the same way I knew you were one, by his scent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s just peachy. I suppose you want to come with me then?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Staying in a small town when you go out having all the fun isn\u2019t my idea of a good time,\u201d You answered. Brom would\u2019ve said how dangerous it was but he had to constantly remind himself he wasn\u2019t dealing with any kid when dealing with you. If there was one person he didn\u2019t have to worry about in terms of safety, it was you, well not your safety at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, get your bow and let\u2019s go. We probably won\u2019t be coming back here again,\u201d he instructed to which you did so. It didn\u2019t take long as your bow was the only thing you commonly kept out of your materializing library of stuff. When one has all their belongings always with them it saves on packing time. You both arrived at a spot where there was a cash of leather and shortly after saw Eragon coming. You could hear two conversations as Brom talked with him and he talked with someone called Saphira. You had to assume it was his dragon. You took in his scent and almost growled at the scent of blood. You knew the cause as you were a dragon. If you didn\u2019t make a saddle from your protruding bone than your scales would shred the comparatively weak skin of a human in minutes flat. This wasn\u2019t giving you to good of a picture of this dragon you were about to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, Max, I suppose you know about my dragon as well?\u201d Eragon asked as they talked about things and was convinced to let Brom join him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. No offense, but it is hard to hid a dragon. Even if she steps light, a dragon\u2019s presence is not hard to spot\u2026 well most of the time,\u201d You said with a smirk that Brom returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just great. Am I the only one that is in the dark here?\u201d Eragon asked in exasperation. To be fair, he had just been through a lot, especially for a boy of his temperament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much, but it is you that chose to keep your eyes closed right? How are we suppose to tell you anything if you won\u2019t listen?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am listening!\u201d He exclaimed to which Brom just put a hand up to stop an argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk while we walk. We still have to get going. That is unless you want the whole town knowing your plans,\u201d Brom stated to Eragon to which he reluctantly lead the way to his farm. He seemed to be thinking heavily on what was going on and what he was going to do. To be fair you were as well. Your very bones were creaking in anticipation of a dragon you had promised not to kill. You secretly hoped that she would make an off move so you could take her out. Besides, you were so missing dragon meat. Once you all made it to the farm it wasn\u2019t long before the dragon in question landed. Eragon seemed to take her well enough. But Brom could see every muscle in your body strain with restraint to pull out your bow and kill her. He could almost taste the hostility and hatred you had for her as a dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou promised, remember?\u201d he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it,\u201d you almost growled back. He gave your shoulder a strong pat as he moved forward to introduce himself with a round of pleasantries both out loud and in their minds, both you could hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, are you going to flatter your way into her graces to?\u201d asked Eragon before he noticed the deathly glare you were giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHe looks as if he would like nothing more than to see me dead.\u201d</i> Saphira shuddered. Your glare was so intense, even without your dragon eyes showing, that she backed down. Unlike most humans, there was no fear of her what so ever. Brom went forward to diffuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a very accurate assumption. Max here has a very deep hatred for dragons. When he was an infant he was nearly killed by one and has seen nothing but the ugly side ever since. Under those circumstances it is understandable that he hates dragons just as much as you hate those who killed your uncle,\u201d Brom revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why bring him along?\u201d Eragon asked as he noticed your eyes were not even blinking in your intense glare at Saphira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is\u2026 all alone. I took up raising him when we found him remember? I figured that with all his talents that Saphira can be the example that not all dragons are evil. But it would be like convincing you that those of the same company of people that killed your uncle are worthy of putting your life in their hands. Either way, he hates one thing over dragons and that is evil. I can\u2019t just leave him and he can more than help, you know he can,\u201d Brom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Eragon stated as he went over to you. \u201cCan you stand to travel with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you keep\u2026 HER\u2026 away from me.\u201d You said than softened your eyes before you looked to Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, she\u2019s not that bad. I trust her well enough.\u201d Eragon stated as Saphira walked around but kept her distance from you as you glanced at her then back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo says you. If you\u2019d seen what I\u2019ve seen you wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near her unless you had a sword in your hand. I promised to try to make this work. I will\u2026TRY to. But if she so much as twitches at Brom or you the wrong way, I won\u2019t think twice about\u2026 dealing with her.\u201d You said in a deathly serious tone that got all of them to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments you all were off, with a good distance between you and Saphira. You took a back position so you could watch her every move. Brom was stuck, for the moment, playing peace keeper. But when Saphira looked back even slightly at you she shivered. She obviously didn\u2019t know why your gaze effected her so. But you didn\u2019t care at the moment. Sure she looked a lot like Kara, but she also by default looked like Kara\u2019s arrogant parents that got you to leave Base Realm in the first place. Perhaps that was what made you extra hostile toward her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But for now she lay down on the opposite side of the fire than you as you both watched Brom instruct Eragon in sword fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t need it. I already passed Brom\u2019s level of skill in sword fighting. Plus I\u2019m use to killing dragons, even at my age,\u201d you answered with a quick glare at Saphira before continuing. The first few times you said like things Eragon got rather defensive on her behalf. But now he knew you wouldn\u2019t do anything because he trusted Saphira wouldn\u2019t do anything that would make you attack her. However, only Brom knew you could more than slaughter her if you so wished. \u201cCompared to a dragon, humans are easy to defeat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you need practice?\u201d Eragon asked as he tried to solidify his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d you answered bluntly. Again, he didn\u2019t know why but Brom smirked at your answer. Saphira seemed to notice this and took note of Brom\u2019s lack of instruction on your part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to prove it?\u201d Eragon asked as he might\u2019ve thought you were bluffing and he could more easily win against you rather than Brom. \u201cYou are a few years younger than I. If you think you don\u2019t need to than prove it to me and I\u2019ll never bother you about it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d you agreed as you grabbed 2 practice sticks. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ll keep to that agreement unless I really prove it so I\u2019ll take you both on at once. Don\u2019t worry Brom, I\u2019ll only leave lumps on Eragon\u2019s all wise head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I get roped into fighting you?\u201d Brom asked himself as he readied his stance alongside Eragon. It was a more serious stance than what he was using against Eragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Eragon said as he charged foolishly before Brom could stop him. He slashed at you but you easily sidestepped him and brought an elbow across his face to drive him back to Brom\u2019s side easily but without too much damage. You had enough to deal with without dealing with the aftermath of breaking Eragon\u2019s nose. \u201cYou just got lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d you said as you playfully rotated your sword in circles in your hand before they both nodded to each other and attacked as a unit. It wasn\u2019t that effective with Eragon\u2019s lack of skill but Brom more than made up for the holes in Eragon\u2019s defenses. But it took all of a few seconds for you to parry a slash from both of them by sailing over the top in a flip of sorts so you could whack their arms with your practice swords, making Eragon drop his and Brom to get stunned for a second so you could land and face them on the other side. \u201cYes, lucky indeed. Never would\u2019ve seen that coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind slowing down so I can teach him at least something?\u201d Brom asked as he looked at you as if to say \u2018take it easy already\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to which they tried again. You let them come at you to which you blocked slower and attacked in speeds that they could block and dodge. More often Eragon would drop his sword from a hard hit or something and you were stuck fighting Brom until rejoined. This continued till Eragon got a few lumps and Brom was tired enough to call it off. Eragon could barely hold his stick and you were just standing there as if you were just starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad enough, wonder boy?\u201d You asked as you twirled the two sticks playfully, indicating you were more than ready for another round or to answer any doubts about his previous assumptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you haven\u2019t than I have. Have fun kid.\u201d Brom stated as he plopped down by the fire to get some rest and stoke his pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I admit that you\u2019re good. Happy?\u201d Eragon asked as he pouted while slumping on a bedroll against Saphira while you went to the opposite side of the fire, as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite. You would be to if you had been on the winning side. Do you want to try again tomorrow or would you prefer Brom\u2019s teaching?\u201d You asked in a way that indicated you were up for it if he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!... uh no. I think Brom would be a good enough teacher, goodnight.\u201d He said as he curled up with his fatigue and bumps to keep him company with Saphira. Soon he rolled again after she laughed at him as well. This light interaction didn\u2019t go unnoticed as you observed them. Brom noticed this and nodded for you to get some rest. You hesitated while Saphira was around but he insisted, saying that he would wake you if anything arose. You trusted him and got your first night\u2019s sleep in the time you had been traveling with her. But as usual, your night was not accompanied by good dreams and you were reminded why keeping an eye on Saphira was a good idea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as you would soon see, there would be a slight problem other than the bridge idiot that made your little group pay to cross. You almost fell over laughing when you and Brom both had the same idea as you both paid him but \u2018accidentally\u2019 bumped into him to more than make up your money you lost. Either way, you all made it to the stable to get the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, take good care of them,\u201d The man selling the horses said to which Brom and Eragon led them away before addressing the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are we going to do about this?\u201d asked Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, we needed 3 horses but only got 2,\u201d Brom agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of you could always ride on me,\u201d Saphira offered into all your minds. The only reason you left that door open to her was so that she could speak on occasion. But she didn\u2019t really speak to you that often at the current time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d you snuffed at the idea. You knew that the only one that WOULD ride her at the moment was Brom and he wouldn\u2019t for some reason. Maybe he was saving his riding for doing it with you. \u201cI\u2019ll just run. It won\u2019t be that hard to keep the horses\u2019 pace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou crazy? You can\u2019t run as fast as a horse!\u201d Eragon exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can think what you want,\u201d you said then looked at Brom as he knew you could handle it. But he was the one you entrusted with the planning. You had told him that you would tell them about you when he thought it was the right time or if it was unavoidable for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax has been training to slay dragons and as such can run as fast as a horse. If nothing else this might give him a workout while we ride,\u201d Brom agreed. What he said was technically true but also it wasn\u2019t the whole truth. But it seemed to convince the other two to which you all were off and they saw first hand that you could keep up with them rather well. Brom was right on the other end as well. It was more of a work out that you were used to. They talked about what the schedule was going to be as you all traveled. Saphira was ether too far away or just patient in letting them decide. By the time night came you all slept while you took watch, again. Saphira would blink her eyes open every one in a while but see you glaring at her and go back to sleep. She was beginning to believe the unlikely fact that you were actually capable and experienced in slaying dragons, probably more impressive than herself. Your running all day at the speed of at least horses was not something that was now taken lightly by her and rose a few questions that she was beginning to be too afraid to voice a concern about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during one of the last days across a long valley like place that a huge storm was upon all of you. You had thought Saphira would have some sense in getting out of the sky beforehand but apparently not as Eragon told her to get land. She was too late however and the strong gusts took her by the wings and were effectively throwing her around. Eragon looked to be moving to help but the wind was too strong so you reluctantly came to her aid. You ran to one side of her than dove with a considerable amount of force when she was rolling and her other wing was almost retracted but the other was out all the way. This forced the extended one to fold into place as you collided with her it made the other one hit the ground and closed it as well. She seemed to be having trouble keeping them closed so you reached out and held them to her side tightly so she could move more freely. This lasted a considerable amount of time as they all traveled and you could\u2019ve sworn you saw a smile on Brom\u2019s face at what you were doing. It almost made you let go and just let her weather this storm by herself. But you had started it so you were going to finish it. Finally the storm relented and you lay exhausted on her as you all stopped for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him thank you.\u201d You heard from Saphira as you jumped off her and went to your normal spot but almost fell to sleep as soon as you were sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaphira said \u2018thank you\u2019,\u201d Eragon relayed as he was also thankful you helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well don\u2019t expect it all the time. She should\u2019ve known better than to stay up in the air as long as she did. You being surprised in the air is one thing. She shouldn\u2019t as a FLYING dragon,\u201d you said back but paused between as she just sighed at your constant attitude. \u201cStill, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. Maybe she isn\u2019t like the other dragons I\u2019ve seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see your bow?\u201d Eragon asked, changing the subject with an item you had that he was curious about for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you answered as you pulled it out of its sheath and handed it to him. Brom almost had a fit but remembered that even if he held it he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it. Only you had the strength to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, how do you pull this thing back? It feels like solid metal.\u201d Eragon asked as he tried but was unsuccessful, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this,\u201d you answered as you pulled it back a few times for show than handed it back to him to gawk at. \u201cIt is a dragon slayer bow, more or less. That is what I made it for. Basically it is strong enough to send an arrow through the hardest dragon scales. Brom can testify that it would be more than efficient to do so. Since it has blades on the shaft, it can double as a deadly melee weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must really hate Dragons.\u201d Saphira said to Eragon. You felt like yelling at them that you could hear them but you didn\u2019t want to ruin their little bit of privacy they thought they had. Eragon hesitantly looked at the weapon made to kill dragons then gave it back to you. You soon went to bed and left them with that thought as you got some much needed rest, however you would get as much rest as you usually got when sleeping, not much. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You all slowly made your way toward Yazuac. After they told Saphira to wait a safe distance away the 3 of you went to the village. At the first house you all stopped and you took an involuntary step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Brom at first as you spun around and did so as if searching for something but was highly agitated. Then he saw anger creep into your face to which he nudged closer before asking again. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeath, and lots of it. I don\u2019t like this place.\u201d You almost growled out. He could see the hair on your neck stand on end to which he took a moment to talk it over with Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need provisions, so we\u2019ll proceed carefully. We still need to at least see what happened here.\u201d Brom decided so you all eased into the village. As you all got deeper it made each of you draw your weapon. Brom took it more seriously when he saw you do the same. You two had already talked about the use of that weapon. It should be done sparingly if not never. \u201cgods above\u201d he shuttered out as you three settled briefly at a literal mound of bodies that had been stacked as if a trophy to the carnage. But if it had been just soldiers that it would\u2019ve been understandable, still disturbing at the sheer amount but understandable none the less. But no, the vast majority of them were women and children. As if to prove this there was an infant impaled at the top of the large mound that Eragon shot an arrow at a crow to protect the child even in death. \u201cThis is Urgal work.\u201d He said at one point as Brom evaluated the scene and kept doing so to gain needed clues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgals,\u201d you clearly growled to which Brom looked at you. Sure he\u2019d seen you give deathly glares at Saphira for your hatred of dragons but this was on a whole other level. You were in a raged bloodlust at this point. It looked like he was going to try to calm you down but was unable to as a battle began. Unlike what would\u2019ve happened you had all got there earlier due to your helping Saphira in the storm and her in turn helping the others. There were an entire company of them. Not the main force but you counted at least 20 as your senses opened up and your eyes changed. You didn\u2019t care that Eragon saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehind you!\u201d Eragon exclaimed as an Urgal came up with a swing at you. You were in no mood\u2026 or to be more accurate you were in a very dangerous mood. With a quick turn you blocked his blade with your bow and punched him so hard he went through the wall and splattered inside the house with such velocity that the blood splashed out of the openings in the house. The move shocked those who saw it but Brom got Eragon going into a run to get out of the village. He seemed to notice that your mind was clouded at the moment with rage and with a target to point it all at there was little he could or would do to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strung an arrow then fired it near Brom and Eragon as a line of Urgals came to intercept them. The arrow struck the first in the chest, went through him and carried on to the next until 5 lay dead and being flown from the high speed impact. Regardless how sleek the arrow was it had a certain effect from traveling so fast. On something hard it blew it to pieces but something soft like flesh or Urgals it went through and took its target for part of the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the follow through you sliced the head off of another then ruthlessly slaughtered every single Urgal in the village. Sometimes you shot into a wall to get the ones hiding behind it. In a flash you saw a fire magic from an alley then saw Eragon stumble out of it with 2 dead Urgals to his credit. He looked at you then ran to Brom as he looked at you in partial horror for 3 reasons. 1) your eyes were showing 2) you had just turned to literally rip the head off an attacking Urgal with your bare hands as you didn\u2019t need the bow at this point 3) you were covered in blood from your fighting, including the flowing blood from the Urgals you were killing just then. Regardless how tired he was from using magic he ran to get Brom. However you were too blood lusted to stop until you found the last one and ripped him in half the long way so his inside spilled all over the place. You heard a yell as Eragon saw Brom\u2019s injured condition followed by a thud you knew as Saphira as you stood among the dead you had killed, looking at the pile of dead they had killed. You were panting more from the attempt to gain some monocle of calmness, your back toward the others as you didn\u2019t want them to see you until you were composed. But glaring at the heap of dead bodies in front of you didn\u2019t do you any favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the ones who did this? I will tear them apart!\u201d Saphira thought to Eragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will do little good. They are already dead.\u201d Eragon replied as he pointed at the bodies he had killed and the others you had with you still in the center of it all, not moving but covered in blood from the fight and actually steaming as you body helped cope with your mental state by heating and by default evaporating the blood on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to take their mind off of it as you heard a gasp from her as she saw the aftermath and you condition. They wrapped Brom\u2019s wound then put him on Saphira and when ready to go they were hesitant but came to you as you were done steaming, half because you were calming down and half because there was no more blood to burn off your body. They flinched as a growl from you rumbled the ground. They didn\u2019t know how you could do such a thing but at the moment they just needed to get you going with them so they could get out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, are you ok?\u201d Eragon asked, half for your feelings and half for their safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even dragons where I lived did things like this. The rare one would destroy an entire village but they saw no sport in slaughtering infants and their mothers in such bulk. There was no honor in this,\u201d you replied as you glared at the pile of bodies. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, before I do something foolish.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way out and at a safe camp spot you all walked in relative silence. There were a few more Urgals around and only one was acting as a scout but it didn\u2019t matter. As soon as they were visible they died from your bow. The scout that was running away was a couple hundred yards away but you still nailed him in the head. Because of this, no one spoke as they were all either too tired or too scared to do so. You were distant to say the least. You didn\u2019t even glare at Saphira when she came by or look even faintly at the magic conversation they were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax!\u201d Brom called for probably a final time after a few others. This time it snapped you out of your staring at the flames of the fire. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t fine,\u201d Saphira thought to the other two. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t glared at me since we got back. Usually he at least puts in a death threat or something by this time. Whatever made him snap in the village was enough to change something in him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Brom said to which you looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve said you trust me and that we are as family, and I believe you. But part of a family is sharing our pains and\u2026 our secrets with each other. I think it is about time you did both. After all, I wasn\u2019t the one that told you to show part of yourself in that fight. Fact, in this case, is more acceptable than speculation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t feel good right now,\u201d you said, trying to make a good excuse why you could avoid the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is why it must be said. How can we help you if you don\u2019t let us?\u201d Brom asked to which he put a hand on your shoulder and gripping it firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could they live with doing something like that?\u201d You asked as you turned your gaze back into the fire. \u201cBattle is one thing, or even a dragon\u2019s hunger is another. Even if I hate dragons, where I come from, for doing so it is still understandable. But this\u2026 how can the taking of life that was so innocent be ok with anyone? What threat or reason is there for taking pride in taking so much pure and innocent life. I could see it in them, they were not only proud for what they did but also comically reciting it. What the hell is so funny about it?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are young, Max. There are forces at work that make that seem tame. I have only one answer for you in that regard. Those that take such delight in such a thing are more than deserving of the title \u2018EVIL\u2019. I am guessing you know that, or you wouldn\u2019t have slaughtered them so mercilessly. Be just and pure Max, don\u2019t let this evil form your life. Learn from it and move on. Not all Urgals are capable of such evil, just like the same for humans or dragons,\u201d Brom answered. You didn\u2019t like it and it would still be on your mind for a considerable amount of time but you understood what he was saying. \u201cFor what its worth, I\u2019m glad you feel so strongly AGAINST such evil behavior. It says volumes about where your morality lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I think,\u201d you answered then looked over at the other 2, who were still concerned about your previous mood set, along with what you did with it. \u201cYou really think I should tell them, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can handle anything you trust us with,\u201d Eragon replied. For some reason he had a habit of keeping secrets but felt entitled to other people\u2019s secrets. It was an annoying standpoint but in this case he was correct. It had long passed been the time to tell them. You had given the reigns over to Brom for that kind of talk so you were being sure. You looked at Brom and he nodded then moved slightly away, giving you some room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will hold you to that Eragon, and Saphira,\u201d you said. Then, with a long pause between, you let your eyes shine out again. They both seemed to react to it but not as much as when you suddenly sprung your wings and tail from your back to flex outward. Eragon would\u2019ve fell over backwards if he wasn\u2019t already leaning against Saphira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! What are you?\u201d Eragon almost demanded but with an aura of fear as well. Saphira acted similar but since she was already laying down she didn\u2019t do the whole falling over thing. The only thing that was keeping them from acting out against you or away from you was that Brom seemed to be watching the conversation unfold with an entertained grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Here\u2019s another clue,\u201d you stated as you breathed in then let out some flame breath into the air long enough to be considered flame breath. \u201cCome on; scales, slitted eyes, wings, a tail, and can breathe fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way.\u201d You heard Saphira state then seemed to realize that if you were a dragon that you would be able to here her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been able to hear me this entire time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am a dragon after all.\u201d You started then the conversation progressed quickly to one about your history. You reluctantly told them, again. The scene unfolded with more calm and collected understanding with Brom there to help. After a few lasting questions you got up and walked away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Eragon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChanging to a full dragon. You have no idea how cramped it can be, hiding out in human form all the time. Plus, I would love to get some flying in tonight, after the sun goes down,\u201d you answered then walked a little bit further. When you got far enough away you started the process. Thankfully you were both far enough away and had Brom to keep them from \u2018coming to your aid\u2019. Eventually they stopped arguing as your cries of pain became snarls and growls. You must\u2019ve been getting used to it or the running endurance was helping you with your endurance with this as well. Because as soon as you were all done you were actually able to move and walk. Sure it still hurt like no other but you weren\u2019t limp by any means.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you finally made it back to the fire and looked at them Saphira was halfway between trying to protect Eragon while he hid behind her and cowering below you. Until this moment, she was the strongest person in the group, that they knew of. Now that a 500 foot tall, and never mind how long, dragon was looming over head it was a sudden realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill isn\u2019t any easier?\u201d Brom asked, trying to strike up more of a subtle conversation in order to bring everyone around to a common ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all that running made the endurance easier. Otherwise I\u2019d be bed ridden for a few hours,\u201d you answered as you laid down next to him then lowered your head so you were in the circled of people around the small fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how can you speak out loud?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you that. I can speak for two reasons. First, ALL my human abilities transfer over to my dragon side as do they the other way around. Second, I trained a lot to do so. A dragon\u2019s speech usually isn\u2019t tuned to human or human like speech. It is hard to learn, but possible,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 you\u2019re not going to\u2026 uh???\u201d Eragon started to ask but wasn\u2019t sure how to ask if you were going to kill/eat Saphira. It was clear now that you could do as you wished in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie, she does smell very appeasing and I can imagine what she tastes like. But I\u2019ve made a promise to Brom. Because this realm only has a few dragons left, I have to at least give each dragon a chance to prove themselves. If the dragon in question isn\u2019t EVIL, then I won\u2019t kill and/or eat them. That includes the King\u2019s dragon and Saphira. While I still have my eye on her\u2026\u201d you answered than paused to look straight at her to which she quivered under your gaze. \u201c\u2026 she seems to be at least halfway decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Saphira thought to you as she whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, enough scaring them to death,\u201d Brom interrupted to which you came back to your new position around the fire. \u201cMax, I\u2019ve been thinking. I think it might be better if you stay in dragon form. As useful as it is to have you disguised it also dampens Eragon\u2019s ability to learn when you do everything for us. So, at least until it is very necessary, will you be ok with staying as a dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t mind in the least,\u201d you answered simply but with a content smile that he knew all too well. Brom knew how sky sick you were. You longed to go soaring through the sky as a full dragon and now you would be able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Does this mean you\u2019re HIS dragon?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Like I explained, from my realm there are all kinds of dragons around. Only a small section of them are like the ones here that need riders. That and I am a half-breed. So, in a sense, I am my own rider. But I don\u2019t mind having unofficial riders like that Sarah girl or Brom. Although\u2026\u201d You answered then paused to look right at Brom to which he returned a curious glance. \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t let Brom ride me yet. Well to be more accurate we haven\u2019t had the time to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can make a saddle for you. No offense, but you are HUGE,\u201d Brom replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need one. My retractable spikes can make one for you to use. Come on, I\u2019m not taking no for an answer,\u201d you stated as you made a seat for him then grabbed him with your teeth on the back of his clothes, then deposited him onto the seat then took off all before he could do much about it. For a second it looked like you were snapping him up for a different reason. But as you flew with him secured to your back the feeling of danger was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a little dramatic,\u201d Brom stated after he got his breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured that there would be a hundred reasons why you wouldn\u2019t and only one reason why you wanted to and I couldn\u2019t say it in front of them. Come on, you\u2019re as sky sick as I am,\u201d you replied back with a quick glance back at him before you leveled off and soared high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps but\u2026\u201d Brom started then looked around as he realized you were more than right about it. He could see your relief at flying mix with his own. \u201c\u2026 I suppose one flight won\u2019t hurt. But this can\u2019t happen often so let\u2019s get it out of our system. Or at least my system, you\u2019ll be flying with Saphira while we travel. So let\u2019s GO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you banked sharply and went into a bunch of desirable maneuvers that you both were missing and some that made him laugh openly at the feeling. Other times he was crying at the riding another dragon. His thoughts went back to his own dragon so many years ago. But after a moment for sentimentality you didn\u2019t let him dwell in sadness. To that effect you would pull something off to get his mind off of things. Diving, banking, twirling, dropping him then catching him in multiple ways were just some of the things you did, making him feel like a true dragon rider again and you his dragon, at least for the duration of this experience.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Traveling with the group as a dragon was a different experience. Because of your size, you had to hide in the clouds with Saphira. On completely clear days you had to wait for night then catch up with them, which wasn\u2019t hard. You also made it a point to cover your tracks, or at the very least make it seam like you were smaller than your actual size. Hunting wasn\u2019t really that much of a challenge so you took it easy at times. Suffice to say, you had a lot more time to get to know Saphira as you both flew in the sky. It took a little while before she broke the silence that her fear had caused. Wither she thought you would\u2019ve already killed her if that was what you wanted or that you were starting to like her, either way, she started trying to talk with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, is it ok if we talk?\u201d Saphira asked. There was a wider range of how she could talk with you. Thanks to your genetic knowledge, you could pretty much speak any language without realizing it and naturally you could hear each one as well. But for the sake of others, you all decided that dragons should be restricted to thought speech unless something warranted a more feral approach. It also cut down on people knowing about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA month ago I might\u2019ve snapped your head off for doing so. But now\u2026 I suppose I can\u2019t really hate you. I still hate dragons but you as a person are ok. I suppose you would have to be to put up with Eragon. As pure hearted as he is, he requires a considerable amount of patience that speaks a lot about you,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thank you for that. If you don\u2019t mind me saying so, you\u2019re huge. I mean, Dragons in general are big but you\u2026 It looks like you could take on anything and still laugh about it,\u201d Saphira stated. You weren\u2019t really sure if it was a question or compliment. You were pretty sure she wasn\u2019t confident enough to insult you, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack on Base Realm, Dark Hunters are greatly feared as I have said. I am a great deal larger than most Dark Hunters in general but even one of your size fighting another type of dragon of my size, the Dark Hunter would still easily win. It would only make sense that a Dark Hunter King like me, born with all the genetic knowledge, would be more\u2026 impressive than the others. However, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m any harder to kill if hit in the right spot. Cut my heart out or lop off my head, and I die just like any other creature would. Having me let someone do that is another story,\u201d you answered as you soared through a tight cloud formation with her. It was tight enough for the two of you to brush against each other before widening out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 how many dragons have you eaten?\u201d She asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably about as many deer you have, times the amount of years I\u2019ve been living in Base Realm,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d She replied back in a quivering tone that you knew you would have to fix. You didn\u2019t need her being wrongly scared of you. Respect you, yes but not blindly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you need to understand about that is that there are very few dragons that put any value on humans where I come from, well nothing above food or sadistic entertainment. Those that are the normal measure in the hundreds of thousands. So to protect humans, even ones that hunt me in return, I have to take down a lot of them. Going out hunting after taking down a large dragon just isn\u2019t considerate to anyone with all that meat there. So I eat the dragons I kill, more specifically the ones that threaten my territory, those that I am protecting, or me. It also scares the crap out of any foolish enough to try,\u201d you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about humans? With us probably going to war, I will probably have to kill some and I probably will eat a few as well. It would be foolish to do so if you are\u2026 very opposed to it.\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust that you won\u2019t take it too far. I\u2019ve ate/killed my share of humans as well. However, not for being rude or some other small blunder. Dragons are the ones that earned the spot of blind rage on my part. I usually always give them a way out. If they are evil or don\u2019t take it, even after some aggressive negotiating, than I do what I have to. Like my thoughts on dragons, no point wasting the meat. But for me to be ok with someone else doing it I have to trust them. You are at that level. Not blind trust, but enough for me to know you won\u2019t try to eat innocent people,\u201d you answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d Saphira exclaimed when the thought was brought up. The recent slaughter of innocents by the Urgals might\u2019ve spawned the high distaste for the sight. \u201cWhat is \u2018aggressive negotiating\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is when I let my body do the talking. Kind of like snarling at someone, it just scares them with minimal to no damage. In my case, the roughest I get is drawing a little blood or swallowing them whole,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwallowing them whole?!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You see, I have a second stomach for storage. But not a lot of people know that. So when I swallow them they are completely safe. I can even heal people considerably well while inside with magic and other means. But too someone that is on the receiving end, it can be a very frightening experience. Frightening enough to help them realize their mistake. I release them as good as new, minus some soiled pants from the scare. But, let\u2019s keep that ability between you and me. I don\u2019t need people asking to be eaten then others freaking out,\u201d you requested. The way you explained it stimulated areas of her head that made her not only understand but agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She agreed. The group had already decided to almost forget that you could change back to human form. If hiding Saphira\u2019s status was hard, try keeping a lid on a transforming half-breed. So you were to be taken as just another dragon. That meant no talking out loud on your part. Not a problem, since you could interact with minds and such like the others. You didn\u2019t need to do more than growl to ignorant fools anyway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome on, you to,\u201d you stated as Brom was having Saphira go flying with Eragon. Didn\u2019t take much convincing on her part, but on Eragon\u2019s it was harder. All he remembered was the feeling of his raw thighs afterward. But as soon as you turned the tables on Brom Eragon seemed more up to it. If for no other reason than to be better than Brom at something. Whining about it would only serve to show his weakness. Brom on the other hand saw what you were doing and its effect, as did Saphira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Brom said in a mock tone. He secured the horses then got onto a spot on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, got a taste of your own medicine you old\u2026\u201d Eragon started but Saphira took a leap then took off into the air before he could finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids.\u201d Brom stated to which you took off as well. The speed you were traveling made him smile in both memory and deed. You both saw Eragon almost freaking out when Saphira did something too radical. \u201cShould we show the kids how it\u2019s done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, just don\u2019t fall off\u2026 come to think of it, don\u2019t worry about it. If you fall, I\u2019ll catch you and make it seem like you planned it,\u201d you agreed then banked to soar closer to Eragon as he got done surviving a barrel roll from Saphira. You and Brom seemed to have the same idea. So while he was complaining, you flipped so your back was facing down and soared that way, just above the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d Eragon exclaimed. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m going to fall off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter kid, can\u2019t handle a little air superiority?\u201d Brom asked to which both of them looked up to see you and Brom not more than a few feet above them. For an old man, his legs were really strong. They held him while his hands were free to give Eragon a pat on the back without even looking like he was working at staying in his current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you really think Saphira would let you fall all the way to your death?\u201d You asked as you flipped over and soared beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to be good at the whole flying and support thing. You want to see what happens when a rider is separated mid flight from their dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for his response you turned to which Brom let go and began to fall. You banked at an insane speed as Eragon yelled out of instinct of the event. You passed Brom a few times for good measure then caught him gently on your head a mere 50 feet from the ground. You kept your head so level he didn\u2019t have to adjust his balance as you rose again to meet up with an awestruck Saphira and Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you dropped him, on purpose!\u201d Eragon accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically he let go,\u201d you play argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you even risk that?\u201d asked Saphira, equally appalled why both of you would take such an insane risk. \u201cYou could\u2019ve caught him sooner even and you decided to play with his life like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an easy question to answer,\u201d Brom stated. It was a good thing you all could speak in each other\u2019s minds. With the speed and distance, neither of you could project your voice to be heard in any form of speaking normally. But either way, they both looked at Brom to continue. \u201cI trust him with everything I have. I\u2019m not even his rider and I trust that his experience and choices will not do me harm while my life is entrusted to him. Eragon and Saphira, you both are connected more deeply than Max and I will ever be and yet you can\u2019t trust each other in something so basic. If Saphira wants to drop you for a second there shouldn\u2019t be the slightest bit of worry that she will catch you. Sure some practice couldn\u2019t hurt but trust should be a constant. Eragon, so what if you fall off? You really think Saphira would let you die if she could do anything about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I get it. Next question, how do you fly like that?!\u201d Asked Eragon as the unique position was now addressed. You did have Brom on your head rather than on your back or in a saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I got no clue. Max?\u201d Brom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I thought you would like not being strapped in a saddle for a while. I can use magic to keep you there, so there isn\u2019t any problem as far as hanging on. That and it doesn\u2019t seem like you mind at all,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuppose so,\u201d Brom agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can use magic too?\u201d asked Eragon in a tone that was clear that he was understanding just how out classed he was at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, I am a dragon with the abilities of both human and dragon. Why is it so surprising? You didn\u2019t seem to mind when I had the strength of this form in my human one. It shouldn\u2019t be too much of a stretch to believe that all the magic a normal dragon has could be exerted at my will,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you can breathe fire already as well?\u201d Saphira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve been alive for near 16 years so, yeah. You would be able to as well if you had that much time,\u201d you answered so that she didn\u2019t feel too bad about it. But it was hard not to feel outclassed on her side as well. You were not only huge size wise but also strong in multiple areas that she hadn\u2019t even touched yet. \u201cWell, you two won\u2019t get any better or stronger just talking about me. So go at it and have fun. I know that is what we plan on doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you four all played in the air for a bit. It was some time before you all had your fill and had filled the entire day with the joyous experiences of flying with a rider or dragon, depending who was thinking about it. You all got closer as a result and it was a necessary motivation boost to show the two young ones what was ahead for them as far as skill and whatnot.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I look like a side show freak.\u201d You asked in frustration as you sat near Saphira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrom had asked you to change do in no small part to your massive size. However he still wanted you to be as different as possible for them to get use to you. That meant flying in your \u2018Draconic human\u2019 form, as they liked to call any form that had both characteristics. Most of the time he had you protrude every last bit of dragon as you could. You now looked like you were a 7 foot tall dragon that had a crude humanoid form mixed in. Your scales completely covered you, your claws and talons were protruded along with your teeth and a few spikes, your tail and wings of course, and also eyes and no hair. You looked very threatening but not unappealing. It was strange as Saphira still seemed relatively distracted by this perverse form you were asked to be in. Sure you could come out when other people were around but you still felt very uncomfortable as were they, which is perhaps one of the reasons why he required it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look more than presentable and Eragon said you looked \u2018cool\u2019. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that means as a dragon you are naturally hot but I assume that it means that you look most presentable and pleasing to both human and dragon alike,\u201d Saphira answered nervously. She wasn\u2019t nervous about you killing and/or eating her anymore. You all had gone far past that at this point. No, you suspected that her nervousness came from a much more primal reaction to you as a dragon, a male dragon to be more precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. I just get a little self conscious when like\u2026 this,\u201d you paused as you gestured to yourself as you got up and was able to thoughtlessly skewer a rabbit and eat it as if an afterthought and fast enough to not miss a beat in the conversation. \u201cI mean, this is why I was exiled from my realm in the first place. At least in all dragon or all human form people know what to expect. When they know that I am both and neither they don\u2019t know what to do, either side. Thus I\u2019m not too comfortable parading this out in the open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t. We all said that it is better to only tell a selected amount of people and those a very limited amount. You can hide well enough to scare me and can pass as a human well enough. But then again, in a world like this, where magic is coveted and different species are just as much so, it can work in your favor. NO ONE will be like you so you don\u2019t have to worry about it like Eragon and I do of another rider or the King. You get the best of both worlds, I would be proud of it but then again I am only half of what you are\u2026 kind of,\u201d Saphira tried to answer. She may have been young but she knew more than she ought at such an age. You enjoyed listening to her, despite her being a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaphira, you may be right about that. I only need to satisfy a few people. It isn\u2019t like they can just get rid of me and find another of my kind to fit their definition of what is proper and such. How about this, I will link my decision making roughly to yours. When you are revealed to others than I will be more outspoken. That way, my allies will be the same\u2026 hopefully. Does that make sense?\u201d You asked, actually taking stock in her opinion. You knew that seeing her would cushion your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does in fact. But I do have to say, you are no fair,\u201d she answered then teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, NO FAIR. You get all this power and skill and we have to do things the long way. How in the world are we suppose to compete with that?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery carefully,\u201d you teased back. \u201cYou two are young, and Eragon VERY young. I\u2019m sure you two will grow. I will say that I\u2019ll help when you two get good enough to spar more openly with me. I would start now but I think having an open dragon battle may not fit Brom\u2019s image of keeping a low profile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that,\u201d Saphira chuckled in a dragon fashion. If she was having a hard enough time hiding without you adding to the mix. \u201cCome and get some sleep. It is late and we should close to keep from being spotted as easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, thanks for listening and talking with me Saphira,\u201d you said back as you walked over to her side then laid down like you would as a dragon in a curled up position with your wings confined. She mimicked you but also spread a wing over you like a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u2026\u201d she started then added a last part that she thought you couldn\u2019t sense from deeper in her thought but you let it go. \u201c\u2026 little dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were angered by it. But you soon took it as a more possessive tense of the phrase. You had never had a mother and Brom was like your father. Even if Saphira was lower than you in most senses you liked that she treated you as something precious. As precious as a mother would a baby, or perhaps a dragon would to a mate. But you either way, you took it as pleasantly as possible. The feeling you got with her and Brom was very pleasant\u2026 and even Eragon. If all of them were there it was almost enough to negate the nightmares you had. Even with just her it helps a great deal. So you closed your red dragon eyes and slept. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Eragon came to visit a good number of times it was still you and Saphira for a majority of the time. Suffice to say, you were both happy to get back moving when it was time. Hiding in such a fashion was not either of your preference. It was a little further and during one of Eragon\u2019s flying that Urgals were perusing and had caught Eragon\u2019s eye. You were zipping through the air too far away to stop him before he went to them then attacked with magic. Of course he passed out from the exhaustion just as you got there. You were just in time to smack an incoming Urgal that was trying to attack Saphira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice timing,\u201d Brom said as he got there as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very nice,\u201d Saphira agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you are fast enough to get the rest of them?\u201d Brom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would my pleasure,\u201d you answered in perhaps too eager of a tone then was off hunting all the Urgals that were in the area. They all knew that out of all them, you were the most against Urgals because of the village from before that was wiped out. With your Draconic Form you tore through them easily. You got to taste them a little this time and ironically they weren\u2019t that bad. Sure they were a little off but the taste and texture was far from unpleasant. You actually took a few bites of one that you killed at the end. You made a mental note to try it again when you were full dragon again. It was a while, even at your speed, to track down all of them. As you got back, Eragon was awake and being drilled for his actions. \u201cSo, the wise spell caster has awoken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m already getting grilled about it,\u201d Eragon said but it didn\u2019t stop you from slugging him over the head hard enough to get his attention. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see; almost killing yourself, revealing Saphira, revealing me, and making me clean up your mess. It was hard enough normally, not to mention you giving them a head start by throwing them so far,\u201d you answered before sitting down by the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you got them all?\u201d Brom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well at least all the Urgals. I couldn\u2019t tell if there was any other forces in the area. From what I sensed from them, they were commanded by a shade. He could be spying on them all the while in which case it was pointless. But yeah, I did get all the ones that were here,\u201d you answered as you wiped some of the blood off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, not bad,\u201d Saphira commented as she helped you clean your body with her tongue. Naturally she was careful about your wings and being too forward but a tongue bath was well within her rights as a fellow dragon you trusted and cared for at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy thoughts exactly. If they ever make the mistake of attacking while I\u2019m full dragon I think I will have a feast,\u201d you agreed to which she gave you another lick than you responded by stroking her eye ridge a few times as she relaxed by you, Eragon on the other side of her head. As his dragon, she was closer to him but still liked your presence as another dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would eat them?\u201d Eragon asked, more than a bit grossed out. Brom was, as usual, just observing and smirking at dragon behavior that he knew all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. What would it be like for you??? I suppose it would be like a cooked rabbit trying to attack you. Sure you could kill the thing, but you could just as easily eat it. I know it isn\u2019t exactly the same but pretty close. If some enemy is stupid enough to attack us and is good tasting then they are fair game and they should know that as well. Seriously, who is dumb enough to attack a dragon and think there will be no fallout?\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, whatever you say dragon boy,\u201d Eragon scoffed. You didn\u2019t take too much offense to it as he was still young and dealing with dragon related stuff. With that he leaned against Saphira and went to sleep and left you to think with the other two and think you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you Max?\u201d asked Brom, seeing you thinking deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing that another friend of mine hasn\u2019t already helped me with,\u201d you revealed then gave Saphira a final stroke before curling up to sleep yourself. You could feel her smile at the credit you gave her. She also was a little anxious as she knew you were still bothered by not only your current appearance but also the memories and emotions attached to it. You went to sleep and could\u2019ve sworn you heard her explaining it to Brom but was too tired to care at the moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dras-Leona was the next stop of notice on your group\u2019s journey to find the Ra\u2019zac. To be honest, you didn\u2019t really care if you found them or not. They hadn\u2019t openly threatened anyone you knew or cared about, well accept Slone in which case you would actually want to thank them. But either way, that would change soon. As usual, Eragon and Brom went in and you were stuck outside the city for long periods of time. But just like before, they got into some trouble and barely made it out. Brom restricted you from using your flame breath to deal with the city and you waited for their explanation but something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Saphira to which Brom noticed your behavior as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can sense something in the air. I can\u2019t remember what it is but it is bad,\u201d you answered as you rose to your feet and sniffed around. Your anthro looking snout and features were tuned toward the strange scent instead of the enemy you should\u2019ve been focusing on. But you were so engrossed you didn\u2019t realize it till it was too late and you just fell over like a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax! What is wrong?!\u201d Saphira exclaimed loud enough in your mind for the others to hear. You now knew exactly what was wrong. There was the same gas from the egg that Kara\u2019s parent\u2019s used. But since you were in the direct center of both forms it didn\u2019t change you. That was all the luck you had in this situation. Because the paralyzing and knock out effects were still in play, as well as the limiting of your abilities to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did they know\u2026?\u201d was all you could say before everything went dark and fuzzy until you were trapped in your nightmares till the drug wore off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it did you tried getting up but couldn\u2019t. You tried to move other parts of your body but that didn\u2019t work either. The only part you could move was your head, and just enough to look around as soon as your eyes would allow it. What you saw was not very welcome. You saw everyone restrained with you and Saphira more heavily so. You tried using your tail as soon as you could but it was like every inch of you was stapled to the wall with iron shackles. They would\u2019ve been a piece of cake to break if that damn poison didn\u2019t sap your strength. You estimated you only had enough energy to use a single long gust of flame breath. Maybe enough to burn Brom\u2019s or Eragon\u2019s ropes off, if you didn\u2019t burn them to a crisp with the ropes. But there was another problem, the Ra\u2019zac were walking around the room threatening each of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d asked one of them as he looked at your new movement and your swiveling head. Your head snapped to him as he spoke and only answered with a snarl. You weren\u2019t about to show you could speak to this idiot. You tried talking with the others but your mind speech didn\u2019t work either. You guessed they were trying and hoping yours would work but they soon realized it wasn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we kill this one?\u201d asked the other Ra\u2019zac as he looked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he might be some kind of dragon and if that isss the casssse than the King would want to get hissss handsss on him,\u201d the other answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d asked the other again as he gestured to Brom. He had already asked but obviously it was the only one out of your group he would be able to do so. You made a lunging bite for the nearest one but only got part of his cloak before he pulled away then buried his foot in your gut. A blow you just shook off in the adrenaline but actually did some damage in your weakened state. Being that this was your second time under this drug, you body was working very hard on building an immunity to it. But it would take a generous amount of time. Time that Brom didn\u2019t have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, do it!\u201d the other said to both of their delight. You really began to struggle to get at them at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed to revel at this but that soon turned to a scream as arrows pierced the darkness and into them. A quick series of events played as a small battle was waged but the end was something you\u2019d never forget. The arrows drove them back and at a last effort they threw a knife at Eragon. Why he was expendable at this point and not before was not clear to you. What was clear was Brom jumping in the path of the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Eragon yelled before he was rendered unconscious from old and new wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you lost all control as you saw Brom slumping, apparently dead, to the ground. You glared at the Ra\u2019zac and let out all the flames you could at them. They fled faster than you could attack but the intensity was not a small matter. With your remaining strength you tried to break your binds but it just made darkness come upon you quicker. Your energy spent, you could do nothing but go into your nightmares again, with a new one that haunted you worse than the others. Brom was in no small manner your adoptive father now. You knew that without you there he would die. You knew that even with you there it was pretty sure he would die. Worse of all, you knew your binds were too tough to break for them to get you out, whomever came to your rescue. You would never be able to say goodbye to Brom, your father. And so your hatred of the Ra\u2019zac finally matched Eragon\u2019s. If you ever saw them again, you wouldn\u2019t care what was at stake, you would make sure they were no longer in this world. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn\u2019t wake for a very long time. That was torture for you as you were forced to relive your new darkest memory over and over in your usually line up of nightmares. No wonder why you hated dragons so much and why you were very quickly hating the Ra\u2019zac equally for how many times their ending of Brom\u2019s life was replayed. You were relieved when you finally woke up but only to be placed back in the land of confusion. The only perk was you had movement. You quickly got up but realized it was only a limited movement. Your tail, wrists, waist, and feet were all latched to chains so you couldn\u2019t easily break them\u2026 well while under that damned drug/poison. You could feel your body almost had the immunity worked out. They seemed to have given you an extra strong dose because your fire lung didn\u2019t work either this time. You thrashed and but finally sat on the floor facing the door with the sun coming in your window. At last some luck. You gained energy from the sun to use when the drug was rendered useless. You couldn\u2019t wait for that. This was the second time that damned drug/poison had messed with your life, there would not be a third. There was one thing you could do though. With a large breath you roared as loud and as ferocious as you could. The roar shook your cell and you hoped the entire place to illustrate how very angry you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours after that you heard your door starting to open to which you got to your feet and stood as intimidating as you could, glaring at the door. You soon saw a very\u2026 odd looking person walk in that actually got you to shiver slightly. You just didn\u2019t like the feel of him. You really didn\u2019t care what he looked like but your instinct was saying that he was not to be trusted in any fashion. When he came in the shut the door you tried to grab him with anything you could but the chains were holding you stead. Eventually you stopped snapping your jaws in attempts to bite his head off and just glared at him, growling and snarling when you got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you the unique\u2026 whatever you are. I suppose I should be lucky the drug is working. I have a feeling that those chains wouldn\u2019t hold you otherwise. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ve made too good of an impression have I?\u201d the red haired man asked. You simply snarled as your answer but not enough to be overly redundant. You both knew you currently couldn\u2019t do anything unless he came closer. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that you are at least part dragon. Wither you are that way because you\u2019ve willing changed your bodies like the Elves is still the question. But I would put money on the fact that you can definitely understand what I\u2019m telling you\u2026 and that you could respond if motivated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he did something and the door opened to which a guard pushed a cart of fresh meat on it to you. you spread your wings and snarled at him to which he jumped and looked to make sure your chains were still holding you back. With a jerk of his head, the red haired man dismissed the guard, who was all too eager to put the CLOSED door between him and you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is what I propose. I give you meals like this and you at least have to speak to me. I don\u2019t care if you just curse me to death, as long as you forgo this childish silent game you have going. Touching the food will be accepting my offer,\u201d he said as he used some kind of magic to push the cart of meat and water to your reach and you backed away, not sure if you should eat it. You knew it would be laced with the same drugs but that wasn\u2019t that bad. Your body needed more of it to help make your body immune to it. The problem was accepting anything from this man. With a little growl you gorged on the food and water till nothing was left but a slightly destroyed food cart which he disposed of through the door before continuing his talking. \u201cGood, now you\u2019ll talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen well human, I agreed to talk not to spare your life if you come within reach,\u201d you snarled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough. Perhaps introductions then. I am Durza and what name are you known by?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about your other name?\u201d he asked to which you intensified your glare. Brom had told you about someone\u2019s \u2018real name\u2019. A name someone could use to control someone just as you did magic when using their style. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t ready to give that one. How about WHAT you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have eyes to see,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you won\u2019t give up such information willingly.\u201d Durza stated in an almost threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat wisdom is there in revealing all my secrets at a first meeting?\u201d You asked, sarcastically appealing to his sense of reason. Asking such a question made him chose, either he admit he is ignorant and untrustworthy enough to receive your information or concede to your thought and try again later at a slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I will come back later. Although I warn you, Max, that you would much rather deal with me than the King. He will not be as hospitable as I am. I would reach your decision soon, before he gets here,\u201d Durza said in an attempt to get things to swing his way later. Most people would be swayed by such a revelation. No one like the king enough to trust their lives and freedom to his hands. So a apparent stranger was much more appealing than such a well known tyrant and power in the lands, not known for his kind heart. However you knew all you needed to know about this \u2018Durza\u2019. You could smell he was the Shade Eragon mentioned. If that was the case than he was in control of the Urgals and the Ra\u2019zac to have brought you here like they must\u2019ve done. Any affiliation with those two vile creatures made you instantly hate this Shade. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spent your time meditating so your body could make a sizable dent in the immunity to the drug. You also took some pleasure in scaring the guards that were servicing you when they did. Each one of them ran from the room by the time you were done with your meal and threw the cart back at them. Your senses started coming back and so was your mind speech, along with magic and all that. But you noticed, from the mind of the guards, that the chains you were restrained by were made to restrain Durza. Must\u2019ve been when he was captured and/or recruited, probably in the same fashion they were trying on you. But you didn\u2019t let that stop you. It just took a different approach. You needed time for your body to work on the immunity and energy. They fed you, so that took care of the energy, and you had more than enough time. Every once in a while you would roar in frustration. You wanted to fly as you had done with Saphira and the others. Not to mention the emotion of knowing Brom died was wearing on your mood as well. However, as you got better you got a response from inside your mind from someone you didn\u2019t expect\u2026 well you should\u2019ve but didn\u2019t think they would be dumb enough to come for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, is that you?\u201d asked a well known voice from in your head. It was Eragon, and he seemed very close from the clarity and volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEragon? Where are you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume in the same jail or prison you are in,\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You mean you are captured? I thought you were all getting away. I understood my bindings were too tough to break but I thought at least you, Saphira, and Brom would make it out,\u201d you hollered mentally at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I did\u2026 we did. A guy named Murtagh helped us escape. That is another story for when we get out of here. Anyway, I got captured by the shade and ended up in here. We are actually escaping right now. We can talk about the other stuff later. Where are you, so we can come get you?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m in a cell of some kind. They got me drugged up pretty good and restrained with chains designed to hold a shade. I can bust out but I haven\u2019t the slightest idea what to do after that. I just got enough strength back to do that,\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You are still eating the drugged food?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I need energy and my body needs to make an immunity to this drug. I\u2019m sick of getting trapped by it all the time\u2026 but that explanation is for later. Point is, I can get out and have a considerable amount of power now, thus me speaking with you. However I am nowhere near even half strength and I don\u2019t know what to do or where to go. If I just start blasting then I could hurt you or the others you have with you along with everything else. Are you capable of coming and getting me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, send me some mental pictures of where you are. I\u2019ll come and get you then we have to save the elf,\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElf? Oh, you mean the woman of your dreams,\u201d you teased as you did as he asked, relaying as much as you knew about where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, laugh it up scaly,\u201d Eragon replied back as he looked for you. He had said about the woman he had been dreaming about. You all determined she was real but that didn\u2019t stop you from teasing him from it. She was literally someone that was the \u2018woman of his dreams\u2019 and you used that line more than often enough to be annoying to him, not to mention making him blush and Saphira to laugh. \u201cOk, we\u2019re here but this door isn\u2019t opening with magic or keys. The shad must have the key. You think you can open it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d you asked as you smelled an unfamiliar scent. At first you hoped it was Brom but you knew that was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s Murtagh, he helped us escape and came to rescue us with Saphira after I got captured. We\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d Eragon answered, showing you mentally what he looked like so you knew the difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Stand back.\u201d You said and when you sensed them do so you loosed a flame so explosive that it both melted and forced the door open and into the adjacent wall in a red heap. They came in with the apparent \u2018Murtagh\u2019 freezing with the sight of you chained in the back of the room while Eragon rushed to the chains. \u201cJust get my tail free, I can handle the rest after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, guess you owe us one now.\u201d Eragon said comically as you used your tail to flatten then slice the other chains to ribbons. You shook and stretched at your new freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. As for you\u2026\u201d you started as you looked over to Murtagh. He flinched as you moved toward him. He must\u2019ve been told about you a little to not brandish his sword at you but he was still as scared as the guards. You stopped when he backed against the wall at you approaching but you stayed slightly at a distance to address him. \u201c\u2026 I thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019re w-welcome,\u201d he stuttered then his attention was shifted to sounds from the hall. \u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLead the way,\u201d you replied to which he was all too eager to do so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You returned to him and Murtagh carrying her out with some difficulty. Apparently Eragon was really weak and they both were considerably tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, give her to me,\u201d you instructed but they hesitated. Murtagh you could understand. His eyes seemed glued to different moving parts of your anthro body and was nervous about all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, are you really going to argue about who can carry the most weight? Even under half strength and a girl on my back I could still outrun you and Saphira and you know it,\u201d you asked and stated sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just be careful. I doubt she has had a decent time here by the look of her.\u201d Eragon relented as they handed her over to which you picked her up with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, where to now?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Murtagh answered as he led the group. He led you all to a room and despite your thirst for action, you had to hide until the room was clear. \u201cNow we wait for Saphira.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor her to do what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis.\u201d came yet another voice but this one exclusively from Saphira and in your head as you heard her roar and attack the top of whatever building you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to be quick. The shade will be here any minute,\u201d Eragon revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Shade?\u201d Murtagh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he came by me too,\u201d you said outloud then looked up to Saphira and spoke to her with your mind but so the others could hear as well. \u201cSaphira, it is good to hear your voice but I need you to be straight with me. Where is Brom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 the wound the Ra\u2019zac inflicted was a fatal one. I\u2019m sorry but he died. We did bury him and I made a tomb of diamond so you can visit his grave and see him in his eternal and peaceful sleep,\u201d Saphira answered, parts in a softer tone despite the roaring she was doing while attacking the top of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I know he was as close to you as he was to me, closer even. He said to tell you that he was proud to know you as long as he did and to be merciful. He wanted me to make sure you knew that he didn\u2019t want his death to spawn more death, to leave vengeance aside. I personally think it is a load of crap but I can\u2019t and won\u2019t alter his last words to you,\u201d Eragon stated out loud but also in his head so the conversation included Saphira as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but the Ra\u2019zac just made a very angry enemy,\u201d you growled out and ended in a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose they did,\u201d came a voice to which half the room froze as they saw Durza in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better be here in good spirit or you are about to have a really bad day. I am in no mood to entertain you Durza,\u201d you growled at him while still holding the woman in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad day you say? Let\u2019s see who has the bad day.\u201d Durza challenge back as he drew his sword and attacked with unnatural speed. Unnatural for others but slow to you. As the sword slashed in front of your body and the woman you carried, you grabbed his arm and hand with your clawed hand that was not holding the elf woman. In your grip he couldn\u2019t get away, release the blade, or do anything but grimness in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a warning Durza. I know you Shades are a pain to get rid of. But next time you pick a fight with me, THIS\u2026\u201d you said as you brought your tail forward and flattened it so he could see how deadly it was before continuing on your threat. \u201c\u2026 is going into your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said and his eyes telling you he understood, you stabbed it through his head then threw his body across the room where it turned to a mist or smoke of some kind. It was just in time for Saphira to get about halfway done with ripping off the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaphira, move please,\u201d you asked comically. It took her a second to understand but then flew out of the way as you charged another flame breath with enough pressure to blow the top off the tower you were all in. And blow off it did. You let go a mighty flame that left only charred remains on the sides of the walls. As Saphira came in they all looked at you as if they weren\u2019t used to that kind of thing from you by now. \u201cAs you can tell, I really don\u2019t like this place and I\u2019m in a terrible mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me never to get on your bad side then.\u201d Murtagh stated in an attempt at humor. You politely nodded as you walked over to the landed Saphira and she brought her head down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d she said to you as she nuzzled you and you did back with your little anthro snout, both careful of the Elf you were carrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you as well,\u201d you said then looked at an awkwardly standing Eragon. \u201cOf course you to Eragon. But seeing as you\u2019re a guy and not a dragon\u2026 well you understand right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, let\u2019s just get out of here before more soldiers come by,\u201d Eragon answered to which he and Murtagh got on Saphira and you flew out with the Elf woman in your arms, leaving the castle/prison behind you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't with great joy or conviction that you were about to wander into the little elf's mind. No, it was out of necessity and annoyance. Eragon didn't know too much of magic and even if you could heal the elf's wounds, the ones Eragon couldn't, as well as keep her healthy, the contant drain on the group an Eragon's choice of conversation was beginning to get to you. Of course Saphira was a little more sensitive about such things, but she still was his rider and shared many of the same thought processes, at least the ones that her dragon instincts didn't overule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of all that, you were all traveling toward the Varden, or where you all believed the Varden to be. Murtagh knew suprising too much on some topics but you didn't press him any further. He seemed to like you though, deathly careful no to desplease you in any way, but still liked you... 'maybe it was the eyes' you would say and he would just chuckle a little bit and point out that the teeth, tail, wings, and claws helped as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" you asked Eragon. You had expressed your concern for entering an elf's mind before and that was why you all had waited as long as you did. Beyond the obvious privacy issue that Sarah had taught you, there was also the unknown. Your genetic knowledge had taught you that Elves were not a species that would prove to be pushovers. They were deadly to dragons and others in a different but by no means smaller sense than most other dragons were. Coupled witht the fact that this realm was their home and would have the advantage in that regard upped the danger meter significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is in obvious trouble and you said even you can't heal her poisoning. Why was that again?\" He asked as if to stengthen his stance and decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is something that I have no knowledge. It would take weaks for me to figure out how to treat it. I don't think she has that kind of time. But I suppose she, as you pointed out, may be the only one among us that actually knows where the Varden are hiding,\" You replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can withstand the mind of an elf?\" Murtagh asked then, seeing your gaze quickly explained his fear. \"Not that I question your strength, but I have heard many tales of people going mad at best from even attempting to enter an elf's mind. If she is hostile and attacks, thinking perhaps that you are Durza or the King, will you be able to withstand her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your concern, Murtagh, but I am more than capable. How do you think I was able to beat other dragons when I was a mere foot long as a child? It is one of very few nice things I can say I gained from my early years and battles. Learning to fight with body and mind was a difficult but well learned exercise\" you answered, trying to portray that you didn't take offense to what he said, but the flapping snout of teeth was probably hindering that attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You want me to accompany you?</i> Saphira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Sure I will be far from helpless but it wouldn't hurt having a dragon watching our bodies while we speak with her,\" you answered and she seamed proud that you picked her to watch over you when you were otherwise occupied and needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I? Chopped liver?\" Murtagh asked sarcastically before he could stop himself. In hindsight he hoped that it didn't mean he would join such a dish in a meal of the dragons he just spoke to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About as big,\" you answered in a joke but then headed his rapidly panicking state before it surfaced. \"Of course I am thankful of your help as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks,\" He replied, glad that it was a compliment and not something like he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Are you ready or what?\" asked Eragon as he was a little anxious to get started. \"Her position is no more safe with us blabbering about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure that the fact she is an extremely attractive elf, of which you have never seen the like before, has no bearing on you wanting to help her,\" you teased, and not for the first time. You had done so, to his annoyance and Saphira's confused ammusement, a few times. \"A woman or your dreams is under youf complete control and needs your help, Hero. That is the start of every sappy love story I know of, and that's a lot of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you cut that out?!\" Eragon exasperated. Saphira tried to be supportive but she chuckled involuntarily before doing so. This made Eragon wisen up and get back on topic, but first put in a jab of his own. \"It was a vision, not a dream, in any case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's go then,\" you agreed and he was thankful that you didn't stretch out such teasing and that you were ready to embark on the mental journey he was yearning to start. Regardless of where his... manhood would take him, you all knew he was actually pretty honorable. </span></div></div>",

Even if Elves were more competent than most with their minds, having a dragon rip through one's mind is not healthy not matter who the person may be, even elves and other dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why can't we go faster?</i> asked Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could... if you wanted me to tear her mind in half. The gentle approach is not one I have had much use for. Either an enemy was deadly enough for me to enter their minds or an ally was not worth being rude to intrude into their minds. Either way, I have not had much practice with the gentle approach.<i> you answered as you both made steady progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you both made it to her mind, enough for which she noticed you and, at your slight intrusion, attacked with a furry that suprised you. It was more intense than most dragons you encountered. Even Dark Hunters were generally no this skilled. Then again, in your realm, they didn't need to be. Their mental defense was strong enough to hold things at bay while they ate/killed their physically inferior enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am a rider and a friend<i> Eragon said, in the ancient language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew very little but he knew some. His execution of the language was usually abstract or jumbled at best, compared to the completel knowledge you knew. Sometimes you had to use the name of the language itself to undo some of his errors. But for the most part you let him do as he willed as part of a learning experience. He would learn eventually... you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who are you<i> she asked after Eragon and her exchanged names. You could tell that she was running on very little energy and needed most of her remaining thought to contain the poison she outlined to Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be at peace, Arya, I am known as Max. I am a... I suppose you could say I am a dragon, in a manner of speaking.<i> you answered. Your speach was in the ancient language so your statement was all the more confusing to her, for she knew you couldn't be lying. But she had niether the strength nor time to figure it out. She would need to trust in what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you his dragon?<i> she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I am a friend of Brom. I don't mean to be rude but we should save such talk for later. We have little time, and you less than we to to linger. We need the location of the Varden so we can get there, and get you healed. Saphira and Eragon may be Dragon and Rider, but they could do with some advise from and aged race such as yours, and for different reasons, I could as well.<i> You replied, also in the ancient language. Eragon, you could feel, was getting a little annoyed at his lack of involvement in the conversation. He did perk up when he heard his name, and Saphira's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she briefly described how to get there and accompanied it with flashes from her memory. Eragon was utterely lost in the see of information that was hardly worth a footnote of difficulty to you. You wondered if Saphira would've benefitted from taking a part in this conversation as well. Soon, both you and Eragon opened your eyes and looked at each other as if to soldify that this was real and you both were not in the Elf's... Arya's mind, anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you understand that?\" Eragon asked, as if grateful he could speak to you outloud again... as well as hoping you gleaned more from Arya's information that ne did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I know where the Varden are now... at least the enterance she revealed to us, along with the password. Did you at least hear that part?\" You asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just had a hard time putting together the other things she communicated. What were you two talking about in there in, what I assume, was the ancient language?\" He asked. At this point Murtagh and Saphira were listening and trying to get what they could from your conversation before asking questions later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was just curious about who and what I was. We didn't have time to explain so we left most of it for later. But she did need to make sure that I was trustworthy to recieve the information we needed.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you just take it if she didn't?\" Murtagh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but she was suprisingly talented and powerful, as far as minds of little things are concerned. I would've have to tear her mind in half to get at the information she had suprisingly well buried. I have yet to meet with the elves formally. I don't wish to make an enemy of them to simply learn something she would've thought us worthy to tell us anyway.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smart move, as always.<i> Saphira complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok. We can talk about this as we travel. Can we get going please?\" Eragon asked, probably in relation to helping Arya. The strength she had shown, and compliments from you, only made her more appeasing to him. You had to admit that, for a humanoid creature, you saw the attraction. You were half human after all. However, Eragon's desire spawned more than just infactuation. Yet another one of may attributes of his that you found oddly comforting. Despite him being near your age, you found that you resecting him a great deal. Perhaps because he was Brom's actual sone... oops, wasn't suppose to think that. You knew, along with Saphira, but was more or less sworn to keep your mind off it until Eragon was fit to know as well. It was an on going struggle with Brom's death so fresh in your minds. But, as it was his wish, you both carried that information in a very safe spot, surrounded by oaths made in the ancient language as well... just to be safe from temptation of accidental conversation slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You agreed, to which you all started out again. You told them the general direction as you all traveled so you didn't have to do the whole 'right here, left here' thing. No specific but enough for you to get some rest in that regard.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up was interesting to say the least. You were fairly groggy from your first trip through the portal. It wasn\u2019t that it was that difficult, it was just that it was sudden high speed jerks that was hard to deal with if you didn\u2019t know where they were coming from. You had little doubt that you could anticipate them if you ever got the chance to go through one again, hopefully on your way home. For now you were both sickened and confused. The sickened part was the infuriating stench of dragon around you. As your senses started to come back more keenly, starting with smell, you found that it wasn\u2019t that there was one near you. It was more like a constant hint of dragon in the wind and more ominous than anything but still there like the smell of someone unknown stepping in dog crap. You don\u2019t know who or where but you can smell the scent, even indirectly it was not a good constant scent for your preference. As your other senses came back online you heard people talking and felt the slightly cool air breeze over you and whistle through a window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s coming around.\u201d Said a man\u2019s voice, steady and firm yet playful in a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks fit, he might make a good soldier.\u201d Said an arrogant sounding male voice in response. As your eyes fluttered open you took in the figures still talking. The man that just spoke was a soldier of some kind and it sounded like most able bodied men were soldiers. Good thing you had learned blacksmithing as a trade to cover your obvious muscle mass but you were also young, even if you didn\u2019t look it, well not your body definition anyway. Your overall size did betray your youth so it was believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, hold on. Don\u2019t rush it.\u201d Said the man with the steady voice as you tried to rise quickly at their presence and was rewarded with a headache as you scooted back, with his help against the headboard. After nursing your head you slowly looked up to them with uncertain eyes. You had always been subconsciously afraid of humans for one reason or another. As a dragon you feared them attacking because it usually meant you had to kill them. On the other hand as a human it was more of a vulnerable thing, even if you were vastly more powerful than they were you were still a now 13 year old boy and acted likewise, minus the ignorance because of your genetic knowledge and dragon instincts. \u201cWho are you little boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax\u2026 You aren\u2019t going to hurt me are you?\u201d you asked as you looked at the soldiers and their drawn swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee I told you he was just a boy.\u201d he said back to them as they seemed to gain the same conclusion from your speech and behavioral patterns. You also entered their minds to help things along but not by much. They said a few insults then knocked over the man\u2019s stool then left. You gathered the soldiers in this land you were in weren\u2019t too friendly. Once they were gone and he was sitting by you again he continued. \u201cSo where do you come from, and where are your parents?\u201d he asked. You might have taken offense to the question since your father was either dead or a breeding slave while your mother\u2026 anyway he didn\u2019t know any of that and he was probably talking about a human family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I only have a sister. I was exiled through some kind of portal thing from\u2026 very far away.\u201d You said in a clear indication that you couldn\u2019t return. Combined with your age and apparent helplessness you were quite believable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you catch me at a rather rough time. In the middle of me searching for\u2026 well I found you and you don\u2019t have anyone to look after you.\u201d he said as he thought on what to do with you. You could tell he was a good and honorable man despite the fact that he wreaked of dragon. It was as if there was some dragon in him, not like you but more like a binding contract of dragon riders like home but more powerful. However that was the only scent of dragon he had, no actual contact for at least a while. You were lucky to be found by such a man but didn\u2019t want to be a burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to leave me too?\u201d you asked as you verified his intensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I had planned to leave you with your parents if I could locate them. But as you said you don\u2019t have any that means I am responsible for you. I would try to find you a new family but there is something about you that is preventing me from doing that. It just feels like\u2026 well a presence or feeling I haven\u2019t had in a long time.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t be a burden. I promise I will be good.\u201d You said as you understood his position. Although you didn\u2019t understand why or how he was able to sense your dragon half, there was a deep sadness in his eyes at the apparent thought of that \u2018feeling\u2019 instead of your anger or fear that most felt near dragons. Maybe you would tell him later without so many people around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is a pickle. I should find a safe place for you to grow up. But I wish to look after you for some reason that is conflicting with the common sense option. The mission I\u2019m about to go on is very dangerous and to take you along would only put you in danger.\u201d He said as he looked you in the eye to give you his answer. It was strange but you felt you could trust this man well enough for now and your dragon instincts agreed for once with your human emotions on this point. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you rode with the man that now was known to you as Brom he told you a combination of stories and history about dragons, dragon riders, magic, and the empire. You quickly realized that Dragons here were not like they were at home, except one breed that was prized among royal families for their loyalty. You were both burdened and glad that a dragon dies if their rider is killed so they can\u2019t really kill their masters. However humans can be more evil than dragons but thankfully lack the means to do much about it, giving them a dragon to command changes that. You still hated dragons in general but you would have to make allowances in this world for them and now that you and Brom had stopped for the night you were ready to tell him about you. He had asked multiple times but you had insisted that you weren\u2019t ready yet. At that point you were still gaining information if it would be wise to say anything at all but also if he asked for you transform it would hurt a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m ready now\u201d you said as he was once again pestering you about sharing your past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow that no matter what I will not leave you.\u201d he said as he seemed to catch on that it was a sore spot for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, the reason why I was exiled was because I am what is known as a half-breed. I am not from a distant place in this world, I am from a completely different world and was dumped here for their safety and law. My world is\u2026 let\u2019s just say that seeing a dragon is a common thing and not a very good experience for most which is one of many reasons I hate them.\u201d you started and his eyes jumped to a surprised and intense setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that is how you know of dragons. I wondered how a boy like you could know so much about them. So dragons and their riders are not useful like they are here?\u201d he asked as he tried to understand why you hated them. \u201cAnd what does half-breed mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means that I am only half human and half\u2026 something else.\u201d You said than looked down as if trying to find a way to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your other half?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon.\u201d You said simply to his amazement but his expression changed to one of disbelief. Coming from a 13 year old boy it did sound more like a children\u2019s game or imagination. It was clear that you would have to show him certain things but hopefully you wouldn\u2019t have to go all out. \u201cI know it is hard to believe but maybe this will help.\u201d You said then let your eyes glow and turn to your obvious dragon eye, you also grew wings and a tail out of your back then flexed them and returned them to your human body, leaving a very speechless Brom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 How\u2026 I\u2026 So you can grow dragon parts as a\u2026 halfbreed?\u201d he asked to clarify what you just showed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can actually go full dragon but that form is extremely large for such a small area and it hurts like hell to change from full dragon to full human. But I lose none of my strength as a human or dragon.\u201d You said as you let your eye continue glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you are the dragon we are searching for.\u201d He stated to which you shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what you said the sound of the dragon appearing is only when a dragon meets and is bound to his/her rider. I don\u2019t have one so it isn\u2019t me. Plus not all dragons from my world are like the ones from here. Some are but most aren\u2019t.\u201d you explained. \u201cBut I have been smelling a dragon for as long as I have been here and\u2026 you smell like you have been touched by one. Are you a dragon rider?\u201d you asked as you now knew that was pretty much the only thing in this world that could make a human smell like he does.\u201d He then nodded and proceeded to tell you about his dragon and that it was now dead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have imposed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, you are quite a refreshing person to be around. I wondered why I was drawn to you since I met you. I have no doubt that you are what you say you are. But I must ask, if you are a dragon than why do you hate them?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it all starts with the day I was born.\u201d You started than gave him your back story and he began to understand your point of view and agreed to keep it a secret as well as you doing the same for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand now, but this dragon and its rider that we are searching for is one of the Vardan\u2019s only hope, along with you at this point. So please don\u2019t be too negative around them when we find them.\u201d Brom requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best but the dragon will not be safe until it proves that it can be trusted. I\u2019m not about to let a dragon do what it wishes and potentially lose a good friend to its whim.\u201d You said in a clear sense that he was that friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint taken and I thank you. It is good to feel that from a dragon again. Perhaps when we find them you can fly with it and be more open about your other side.\u201d he offered as he had seen your longing gaze at the sky. One that he had seen before on grounded dragons and one he had more than often. You wanted to fly and cut through the clouds again. So you made a mental note to try and get along with this dragon he was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would very much like that. But I get to eat the King\u2019s dragon right?\u201d you asked and he just laughed a little at the apparent superiority you had over most dragons and the ease it might take you to do so. He nodded and you both continued to track after your rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brom had you wait in the forest while he searched a small farm that the Ra\u2019zac had attacked. If the rider was anywhere than they would be after him. So anywhere that they attacked was a possible location for the dragon rider he was searching for. But as you waited you didn\u2019t need to be there to smell a dragon and observe as one passed above a few times. You almost growled at the sight of here except she looked a lot like Kara, smaller, but still quite similar. After a bit Brom appeared with another horse in addition to the one he left on. Yours had gotten used to you and soon after a brief but hurried introduction you all were on your way. You all rode for a while without too many words, as it appeared the boy Brom had brought back had lost someone very close. Finally you all stopped and the horse you were on was more than happy to get you off of its back. You gave it a pat then let it walk over to the others. You didn\u2019t ride with a saddle as you didn\u2019t need one so it was already set for Brom to handle and had less work involved. Then the moment you were not happy about came. Brom told Eragon to call his dragon to which you heard him call her as well as her answer. It wasn\u2019t like reading a mind, rather it was being projected as speech and sense you were a dragon as well, you could hear it. From this you were able to ascertain her name, Saphira. She landed to which you were beginning to growl a little but a firm but calm hand on your shoulder calmed you as Brom remembered your feelings on dragons. You heard a round of apologize from Eragon for something he apparently said to her. Her demeanor was refreshingly like Kara if slightly different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who are they?\u201d you heard her say/think to Eragon as she looked your way, she had to notice a slight glare from you as you seemed more likely to attack than run or quiver in any type of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Brom, he knows about dragons.\u201d Eragon introduced. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure who the little boy is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE knows about dragons? I\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d She said as she gave him a playful roar that got Brom to jump but you didn\u2019t bat an eye at her comparatively weak roar, especially compared to yours or Kara\u2019s. \u201cWhat is up with this kid?\u201d she asked as she was expecting you to react to her more than Brom. Brom seemed to guess where they were going with their silent discussion, to him, and moved to introductions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Max, he is a rather special boy that I think would be of great help.\u201d He said as he saw the questioning eyes of the two before him. \u201cHe is very knowledgeable about dragons and such for a good reason but also has a rather one sided and negative history with them, leaving him scarred in more ways than one. But he has something that I believe we all need to see.\u201d He said then turned to you. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want. I know you said it hurts you a lot and I don\u2019t want to see you in pain. But things might be easier if you remain in your other form.\u201d He said as he gave you an option to back out if it was to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Eragon asked for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt may be hard to believe but Max is from a different world. He is also half human and half dragon and can turn into either form at will, but apparently it hurts a lot to do. I only met him about a week ago but I have seen more than enough proof for me to believe him.\u201d Brom explained then they both looked down and over at you as you thought about what you should do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess if I don\u2019t have to change back it will be ok.\u201d you said to which Brom nodded and you walked over to a more open area. They all gathered around you but you held out a hand for them to stop. \u201cNo, I need some room and not to be disturbed while I do it. It hurts a lot but it won\u2019t kill me but I might accidently harm someone if they get to close.\u201d You explained and each obeyed with different fashions. Brom was excited but the other two were bouncing back theories of what they thought of this, most being that you were about to perform a trick of some kind. You then dropped to the ground and started bracing and bunching the ground as the transformation started. Your body burned and every punch to the ground rumbled it like a mini earth tremor then your body began changing as you grunted and sometimes yelled in pain. Soon they became snarls and growls until you were lying exhausted in full dragon form, breathing heavily from the effort and when you had enough strength from the sun you got up and looked over at them but you just stumbled as you tried to walk over to them but failed miserably, just accepting that this was all you were going to move for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is he looking that way at us?\u201d Saphira asked Eragon as she noticed your glowing red eyes glaring intently at her in particular. Despite your current exhaustion you were much bigger than she was so she wasn\u2019t going to take any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear you.\u201d you said out loud so Brom could hear at least half the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you can use the human tongue?\u201d she asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can, all dragons can if they train hard enough. You just\u2026\u201d you started but growled as pain shot through you and you grasped part of your head than eased it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you hated dragons?\u201d Brom asked as he was not expecting you to be so civil to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that other one I am ok with named Kara. She looks just like her, a little bigger and older but still they look a lot alike. But I still am holding in the urge to bite off her head.\u201d You said with an intensity that made Saphira cower and Eragon get between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will do no such thing.\u201d He stated to which you almost burst out laughing. \u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d he asked, slightly offeneded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are. Do you really think that you could stop me barehanded if I really wanted to attack her? You would be a bug that could be easily or accidently squashed as we fought. Next time grab a sword or something that might make your stand more believable.\u201d You advised. \u201cAs for you little girl, it appears you are a good dragon from what I have witnessed thus far. But if I see you raise a single threatening claw at Brom, Eragon, or any I care for I\u2019ll slaughter you.\u201d you growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would never harm Eragon.\u201d She insisted as she heard his name with the others. \u201cOr others that are good.\u201d She quickly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it looks like we will get along just fine.\u201d You said to Brom, who flinched at you speacking directly to him. Granted not as much as most people but still flinching as you answered his question from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I?\u201d he asked as he approached with his hand out. You brought your head down and lay it on the ground so he could pet/ touch you.  A few moments went by as he walked forward then started to place his hand on you as if touching something fragile and precious. You saw him smile and observed some of your body\u2019s movements for a while then went back so you both could talk. \u201cAre you still in pain?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little, I won\u2019t be able to travel for the rest of the day. Transforming takes a lot out of me\u201d You informed as you eyes looked to be quite heavy as your head rested on the ground in prime position for you to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Why don\u2019t you get some rest. I\u2019ll have Saphira wake you if we need to move while you\u2019re asleep. Otherwise I have some things to discuss with him.\u201d He instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I won\u2019t complain.\u201d You said as your eyes darted to Saphira than hesitantly shut and you were off to sleep. It had been a little while sense you got any sleep, which usually didn\u2019t matter. But with your fatigue from transforming combined with that was more than enough to snap you into a deep sleep to recover your strength as the sun still shown and projected its strength into you. You hoped you could sleep soundly but the way things were going you might be woken up before you were completely rested.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You began feeling a nudge as you dreamed your usual nightmare or the things from the past that scared you. The most prominent was your mother but it rarely was shown on the outside, or if it did Sarah never mentioned anything. The nudge just so happen to come at a very bad time in your dream so when you woke and saw a dragon prodding you awake you lashed out and pinned her under your claws with lightning quick reflexes then with your hold secure you got your bearings. It wasn\u2019t long before you remembered the more recent events along with who Saphira was. Perhaps her scent was still new to you but as soon as you realized she wasn\u2019t a threat you immediately got off her and backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Brom demanded. \u201cI thought we had an understanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not used to her scent.\u201d You said but saw that they needed a little more as Saphira got up and shook it off. She looked at you as if betrayed, as did the others. \u201cI\u2026 when I dream I only have nightmares. I relive the events of my passed that have scarred me in different ways. Everything between my Mother\u2019s\u2026 welcome to crying babies from my mere presence. The only time I have been able to dream differently is around Sarah. So when a new dragon was prodding me awake I\u2026 I have not reacted as quickly in the past and it has resulted badly. Sorry if I hurt you.\u201d you said a little worried that they wouldn\u2019t accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you move that fast?\u201d asked Eragon. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize it until you were on top of her, and I was watching you the entire time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere I\u2019m from the weak and the slow are killed by the strong and the quick. So naturally I had to become pretty quick and strong to survive in a world where dragons and humans are abundant and always trying to kill me.\u201d You said to looks that were both understanding and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad that was all it was. We let you sleep for an entire day, but I thought you should be up for the telling of your story, just in case I miss something.\u201d Brom stated then when you all gathered around the fire and Saphira surprisingly close to you, he started your story. You had to correct him on a few points but in the end he had the basic body of the story down pretty well, not that it made it any easier to hear or think about again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why you don\u2019t have a rider?\u201d Saphira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah was the closest thing to a rider in my world but not like here. If she were to die I would still live on, though she does have some power over me. Something about her just makes me calm and I have never been able to figure out why. Her scent all the way to her voice, the mere sight of her makes me feel better.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way but how do we know it is true?\u201d Eragon asked and got looks from both Saphira and Brom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I get that a lot, especially about my mother.\u201d You said than leaned over to the side and rose your wing so they could see the scars underneath then after you heard them all react to them you sat back down properly. \u201cThose are the scares from when she\u2026 well they are the only proof I can give. You already saw me change from a human to a dragon.\u201d Eragon felt a little guilty, now that he had seen them, for doubting such a painful part of your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I look a lot like this \u2018Kara\u2019 dragon you used to know?\u201d Saphira asked and you almost chuckled at the sight of Brom trying to piece together the conversation from only one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is almost scary. You\u2019re a little smaller and have less prominent scale concentration but other than that you look just like her. And no offense but she was quite a bit stronger than you are. Probably from Sparring with me for a few months in near death matches.\u201d You returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid dragons really eat humans?\u201d she asked in an indirect concern about you eating her or the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know because you have yet to try it. Not that I condone the behavior but I have had to eat a fair amount of humans that came to slay me or was threatening Sarah. However most dragons find humans to be a very high delicacy and beyond the incredible taste, one human can fill up a dragon of my size to the same amount as 2 full size dairy cows. Something about the flesh to soul ratio, not really sure why it works out like that. But most dragons on my world indulge in a few humans a month. Some actually accept sacrifices to keep towns safe from other dragons. One of many reasons I hate dragons, well most dragons. Most I have seen are rude, arrogant, self centered, treat humans little better than meat, and a host of other things I can\u2019t stand.\u201d You ended with a slight growl but this one was slightly comforting as it just drove your stance on such behavior further in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that we know you better, maybe we can get going. Can you travel now?\u201d Brom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should be able to. The rest did me some good. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting up in the sky again, stretch my wings and such. Although I\u2019ll be more noticeable than Saphira unless I travel at night. My body will stick out in the day time.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they will probably see you eventually either way so don\u2019t worry about it. But try to stay out of sight as much as you can.\u201d Brom instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll just follow you then. Just yell if you need my help. I\u2019ll hunt later tonight, unless we run into those ra\u2019zac or Urgals. Can\u2019t say they will taste to good but I haven\u2019t eaten in a few weeks so they\u2019ll do.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you haven\u2019t eaten in weeks?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy body can absorb the sun for nourishment so I don\u2019t NEED to eat as much as normal dragons do. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get hungry though. Let\u2019s just say that my belly won\u2019t complain if it gets a meal.\u201d You said and you could tell he was glad he wasn\u2019t on your menu, as was Brom and Saphira. You had made it quite clear that you ate dragons as well as humans in the story. With a little stretch of your wings you pumped them and took off into the air. Feeling the wind and open sky again felt really good. So good that you almost forgot to remain in the clouds to hide your presence. You also had to make sure that your flying didn\u2019t blow away those clouds. Soon after they were on their way and Saphira joined you in the sky.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You did just enough but Brom insisted, after seeing your single gust of flame disintegrating both Urgal and building alike, that you not go so far in such public places. You had done so without thinking that even though no innocents were killed with your flames, the kings rule and the use of slaves to rebuild the village would take a few. So now you flew and watched as Eragon rode Saphira for the second time and learned the basics. You had offered to carry Brom but he declined, for now. But shortly after traveling a little bit you all became aware of Ra\u2019zac closing in on Brom. Without thinking Eragon and Saphira rushed in despite your or Brom\u2019s advice to the contrary. You heard a thud and a boom as Saphira crashed while a Ra\u2019zac grabbed Eragon off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice but to go in after them, which would result in many destroyed trees. With a roar, that stopped an attacking Ra\u2019zac, you broke through the trees like twigs and landed with one claw over Eragon so it protected him from falling debris and with a snap grabbed one that was jumping for him midair. You immediately regretted it as the taste was horrible, but you gulped it down anyway and allowed for it to be quickly digested rather than enjoy something in your belly. The second tried attacking Saphira which you flattened your tail and sliced it twice, once in half and another that cut off its head. The final one was going for the now present Brom but a small but intense fireball turned it to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEragon!\u201d Saphira cried as she saw the debris around your entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, he\u2019s right here.\u201d You said as you moved a few full sized trees off to the side then lifted your claw so he could get up. From the logs and branches that fell off as you did so indicated to all why you pinned him like that. Eragon moved to her while Brom searched the area for more. \u201cThere was only three.\u201d You stated and he nodded and instructed for you all to move to a less, destroyed and \u2018hot\u2019 area. He was about to tend to Saphira\u2019s wing when you moved forward. \u201cLet me see.\u201d You more asked than commanded. However, since she would have to stretch it out for either of you to treat it she saw no harm and did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did the Ra\u2019zac taste?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHorrible, like a decaying and rotting corpse.\u201d You said and shook your head to get the taste out. \u201cNow hold still. I\u2019ve only tried this once on Kara so I don\u2019t know if it will work. I\u2019m going to let my saliva heal it, sense it is a minor injury. That means it will be kind of awkward.\u201d You said in a way to ask if you could continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d She said and extended her wing more so you could get your jaws around the area. You did so and sealed only your lips around the section of wing in question, careful to keep your teeth as far away from her as you could in this position. You then started to lather the wound with saliva and felt with your tongue as it began to heal. She winced at first but was also feeling the healing start to work and soon you let go after wiping the last of your saliva off. Her wing was completely healed as she flexed it to make sure nothing else was the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d he asked and looked to Eragon for the translation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike nothing was wrong.\u201d He said for her. With that done he lecture him on responsibility and in turn got a lecture on truth, which ended in him telling them he was once a dragon rider and his back story or at least the part applicable to them. \u201cYou knew this?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did. Even if he didn\u2019t tell me it would only make sense that someone from this world would have to be a dragon rider to know the things he does. Did you think normal humans run around with dragon saddles?\u201d you asked in a way the indicated that he should\u2019ve figured it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I need to ask a favor of you.\u201d Brom stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d You replied as you had already made it clear that he could more than ask for favors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to change back into a human again.\u201d He said and the others looked at him confused. \u201cYou were right, you stand out to much as a dragon and this little incident only proved it. Plus it would be better if the enemy thinks we only have one dragon for now, not a massively larger one in addition to the one they are expecting.\u201d He reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense. I got my flying in so I guess I\u2019m ok with it.\u201d You answered than got up and walked away a little than started the painful process of transforming and afterward warily made your way back to where they were all sitting. You let your eyes remain their usual glowing set as you caught your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you missed a spot.\u201d Brom said as he saw a set of wings still protruding from your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is all the same to you I would like to stretch them when it is just us. My dragon parts get cramped if they are hidden all the time.\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d Eragon asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lose none of my power by being human and that includes growing dragon parts when desired.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t they hurt as well?\u201d Saphira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Growing individual parts is comparatively easy. What hurts is the changing of my size and overall differences from dragon to human, or the other way around. Dragons are as different on the inside than they are on the outside. So growing or taking away organs or scales is what really hurts the most. Ever tried growing or ripping your own stomach apart?\u201d you asked to further illustrate the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you do magic?\u201d Eragon asked, as he was slightly new to that part of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like you can. I learned magic by my genetic knowledge and instinct. So yes I can but I probably can\u2019t teach you. I barely know why it works myself, only that it does. That and I still have all my natural dragon abilities to draw from; retractable spikes, flight, increased perception, speed, and strength, and fire breathing to name a few. Now that you have seen through dragon eyes you can appreciate that they are quite useful, except mine are more impressive and can see many more things than Saphira\u2019s are able to.\u201d You explained as he seemed mystified and agreed to your last comment about the eyes being useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I make a request to?\u201d Saphira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure go ahead.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you leave your scent as a dragon, just enough for me to smell?\u201d she asked and you did so as you knew, from talking with Kara, that your dragon scent was very appeasing, frightening at first but still a very good scent to have around. She sniffed you a little then smiled at the change. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess as long as no one is here I can let it go like this. But I think my human scent would be better when others are around. I don\u2019t need any undue attention.\u201d You offered and she agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding right? There\u2019s no way that\u2026\u201d you said as you got back from a resupply errand Brom asked you to go on. You were so quick that most of the time, if you didn\u2019t force yourself to relax, looked like they were in slow motion, really slow motion. So when they ran out of a few supplies he asked you to run/fly to the nearest town. However, while you were away Eragon went on a mission to save Arya, the elf he was indirectly connected to. She was apparently the one that sent Saphira\u2019s egg to him. She didn\u2019t know at the time as she was just getting it away from Durza but it was her and he felt a bond to her. It could have also been something to do with him being attracted to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe died protecting me.\u201d Eragon said as he felt a combination of guilt and sorrow. It was tempered by Brom\u2019s last words but he still felt it, therefore Saphira felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho killed him?\u201d you asked after dropping the pack of supplies and pacing for a while to cool off and think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDurza, the shade that sent the urgals and Ra\u2019zac after us.\u201d Eragon stated and with that your eyes flared and started to glow at the thought. Your wings broke out of your back as did your tail and claws to help deal with your anger. Arya was instantly captivated by this as you had seen her and purposefully hid your dragon parts when you came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? What are you?\u201d asked Arya. The question snapped you out of the growing bloodlust that you were in. As a dragon you were defensive of people close to you and felt driven to teach this \u2018Durza\u2019 how much of a mistake it was to take one of them away from you. But for now your mind settled on what Brom was doing and meant for you to do. Going after the shade would only put Eragon and Saphira in danger before they reached the Varden. You would carry out Brom\u2019s last mission for him, after that all bets were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe name is Max and I\u2019m a half breed, one half human and the other half\u2026 I think you can guess.\u201d You said as you flapped your distinctively dragon wings before starting to retract them till you were in full human form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf dragon?\u201d she asked, half to the others and half out of obvious disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has already shown us his full dragon form. It hurts too much for him to do it again as a parlor trick and it would waste valuable time while he recovers from the fatigue.\u201d Eragon stated or more recited since they were Brom\u2019s words, not his. He had a comparatively infantile knowledge of dragons and what it was you were capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you later, after we reach the Varden. Brom was bringing him there and I will carry out his final mission until it is completed. Plus we all agreed that it was better that the enemy know of only one dragon, for the moment.\u201d You explained. Arya was about to say something in return but her body lurked in pain as she grabbed her chest and fell over. You moved quickly and caught her before her head could slam into the hard rock ground. It was the weirdest thing you ever saw. You had not smelled anything wrong with her before and now it was like her body was surrounded in an aura of poison. Such a transformation in such a small amount of time that it seemed instantaneous baffled you enough to look at the now kneeling form of Eragon as he moved to take the brunt of her weight, and Saphira for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was poisoned, by the shade.\u201d She informed which made you growl at yet another that was victim of this \u2018Durza\u2019s\u2019 meddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you heal her like you did with Saphira?\u201d Eragon asked in a little more desperate tone than was necessary. You moved your hand to pull back the clothes covering the wound. At first Arya pushed your hand away, but Eragon held her other one to which she relented and you took a look at the nasty infection that was spreading over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my saliva would only heal the punctured skin and seal the poison inside. For this I would have to do something a little more dangerous and potentially problematic.\u201d You said as you looked at him and Saphira and was pleasantly surprised to see concern for you in their faces, despite the circumstances. \u201cI have a magic, or not really magic but that is the closest description, that would heal her easily. I take her injuries and aliments into my body thereby fully purging it from her\u2019s.\u201d you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that just trade one poisoned person for another?\u201d Saphira asked to which her expression was wrecked with worry. Despite the slightly escalated tension between you two, you were the only honorable dragon in the area and more powerful than any she would ever meet. So she had taken a silent and usually very hidden liking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would have to be carried while you all travel until my body deals with the poison. My body has a better immune system than most, even other dragons, because of the whole transforming thing. It has to or the infection from my body ripping apart would kill me in minutes. Not to mention the poison was designed for her not me. So it\u2019s effectiveness will be less. So if you are willing to carry me I can do this right now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it.\u201d Eragon said after silently conversing with Sahpira. You nodded and with that done you put one hand on her wound and the other on her forehead. Your eyes began to glow in concentration, which scared the trembling Arya enough for her to start whimpering. Then a light passed through you and into her from the hand on her wound and looked to be weaving itself through her veins than it all retracted into your other hand until it was all absorbed into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intensity of both the transference and the poison paralyzed you and caused you to fall over the top of Arya. She on the other hand was instantly full of energy and rose, forcing the fall to land your head in her lap. She instinctually pushed you over so your head wasn\u2019t face down in her crotch but as you rolled over and away they all noticed the lack of glowing eyes and the far away look that replaced it. It was clear that you were out, not unconscious but just as helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a unique opportunity for them. On one hand you were a valuable resource and growing friend. But on the other you were a very large, even giant by dragon standards, dragon that if left unchecked could be a problem. So it was up to them to deal with your helpless but noticeably still conscious body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched and was glad that your fear was unfounded. You had feared that they would use this rare opportunity to eliminate you in some way. Although they did have a slight discussion about it but as they traveled it was settled that you were not just an asset but a friend and betraying you would only prove them no better than the people responsible for Brom\u2019s death. Your group was also joined by a boy named Murtagn. Apparently he saved them when they rescued Arya but most of them didn\u2019t trust him as they traveled. Saphira was kind enough to carry you as they traveled to the Varden and as your condition was getting better but not very quickly they made it there and dove under a waterfall. Shortly after you heard Eragon\u2019s voice and although the poison was muffling your senses you deciphered the meaning as Saphira went inside the mountain and soon you were being treated for the poison. It was remarkably quick once your body was steered in the right direction to heal its self so you were up and being escorted to a general council with Arya, Eragon, Saphira, and the leaders of the Varden. They picked a spot that was more or less open so you could transform, or that was your guess, since such meetings are usually done inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, how are you feeling?\u201d Arya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough, the healers pointed my body\u2019s immune system in the right direction. The poison should be completely gone in an hour or so.\u201d You responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you were specifically hard to heal. Your body has a different feeling to it.\u201d One of the members you didn\u2019t recognize said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich only makes what Eragon told me of you more believable.\u201d Arya stated and it was clear the rest had heard it as well, from the lack of \u2018what are you talking about?\u2019 faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean I can relax?\u201d You asked and Saphira was the first to nod as she was the more eager to smell you again. The rest were slightly hesitant about what they had heard, both on believing it and seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually they were hoping to have another dragon in the pending battle.\u201d Eragon revealed you nodded in a way that both agreed and understood. You could smell the urgals and thousands of men and heard their pounding at the entrances, breaching them one after another. They were still at least a day from getting through the last one but still. You walked to an open area then turned to them. You then collapsed into your usual fit of pain and as Saphira got between those that wished to \u2018help\u2019 and your unstable transformation, but not enough so they couldn\u2019t see what was happening. You then laid down but still your head toward above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d Said the one addressed as the leader of the Varden. You could see that the only one that was glad to see you was Saphira but still hesitated before moving next to you. It was clear that her body still remembered your rather threatening position you placed her in before and flinched at your movement from time to time. The others were understandable afraid but some were also happy that a dragon of your size was going to help them in their fight. Things were looking better for them with two dragons on their side. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll fight with us?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about it. Although I have one demand for doing so.\u201d You said to which Eragon and Saphira looked a little quizzically at you. \u201cI get the shade.\u201d You stated with an underlining growl that shook the ground around you for a good distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we can all agree to that.\u201d Said the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, that won\u2019t work.\u201d Eragon said which got you to look over to his direction. \u201cBrom said that a Shade has to be stabbed through the heart. Your smallest tooth would only impale him and he would just escape to tell the king.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, you can have him. But if you die I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d you said and almost got a growl from Saphira before she caught the joke in the statement. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just take care of everything else.\u201d You said or more asked to which the other leaders nodded their approval, not that they would refuse your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you require armor? We are working hard to make a set for The rider\u2019s dragon but we can try making you a set as well.\u201d another man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother, it would actually be weaker than my natural scales. So it would just get in the way. Save your effort for the battle. Just because I\u2019m going to help you doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m perfect or the enemy won\u2019t get through. There is bound to be some to keep you all busy. Luckily for me I can hide in the night sky rather well so that takes care of my protection just fine.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it be ok it someone would be your rider?\u201d said a voice which was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t know what it was about this guy, but you didn\u2019t like him. He had that arrogant look about him, as if everyone should be catering to him and letting him do as he pleased. His nose was up in a very stuck up pose that you felt like slapping from him. Given that your slap would probably kill him, it wasn\u2019t exactly the thing you wanted to think about with thousands of soldiers to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201d You answered as looked over at him and shook slightly as if you were just ruffling your scales or something but you were really shivering the feeling of having that man order you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I can\u2019t keep up with you?\u201d he argued. You sighed then brought your head down to him. He flinched at this but you just started sniffing him to see if you were right. Not only were you right but you doubted if they guy could swing a wooden sword much more a steel one. You brought your head back before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to keep up with a child. But perhaps that is too insulting a way to answer this. I am not like Saphira in that I need a rider. I need two things to let someone ride me in such a manner; trust and respect. You don\u2019t have either with me. I would have to spend half the fight protecting you and the other half taking your short sighted orders. In either sense I would lose a high majority of my combat readiness and ability.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is ridiculous. I am a strong warrior. Stronger than most.\u201d He said in an arrogant attitude that was really getting on not only your nerves but others as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I wish I didn\u2019t have to speak.\u201d You said to Saphira as she laughed at you more silently while Eragon did so out loud. \u201cSuch things could be so much easier by just snarling at him. Why don\u2019t you be a \u2018strong warrior\u2019 somewhere else.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, you will live to regret this!\u201d Said the man as he bounded off with thick strides to pronounce whatever station he was. By the looks of the others, it looked like they were going to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know who that was?\u201d Asked a dark skinned man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn arrogant Idiot that wanted to hide on my back during the battle?\u201d you asked comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is Harold, a major influence among our people.\u201d He revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose he wanted to get some glory in battle while not actually doing anything. Not interested. He should be with the rest of us, not hiding behind the biggest thing he can find.\u201d You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, we should be focused on the battle. We can worry about political stuff afterwards.\u201d He finished then led Eragon off to somewhere inside. You were now outside with Saphira so you took off and she followed you to a ledge that was connected to the inside structure but looked over the whole camp. People looked at you two as you flew and it did feel a little good to be inspiring awe rather than horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was\u2026 interesting.\u201d Saphira thought to you. She would\u2019ve spoke in dragon tongue but a bunch of growls, snarls, and other dragon noises would not be productive for troop morale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d You thought back as you both laid down and looked over the people getting ready. It was slightly refreshing to communicate like this. That way people weren\u2019t staring and fearing your jaws and more specifically the teeth inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you agree with the others?\u201d She asked to which you looked at her in a confused look, telling her to continue. \u201cI mean about expecting Eragon to be\u2026 more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is none of my business who you chose to be your rider. All that SHOULD matter to them is that you DID choose HIM. As for what I was expecting. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything. So I guess that is a no. I wasn\u2019t expecting \u2018more\u2019, as the others say. Seeing as the last enemy to say so received an arrow in the head. I can\u2019t exactly say that he isn\u2019t qualified. If that is the way Dragons and Riders operate here than he fits perfectly. Personally I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand a rider in the sense you all seem to do. To much of a leash and I would be worried for the person too much to do any real fighting. Although\u2026 Sarah was a person I wouldn\u2019t have minded being my Rider so\u2026 I guess it could work.\u201d You responded, thinking as you did so in order to better explain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is a unique way to look at it.\u201d She replied. \u201cSo how far are you going to go? In the battle I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you two can have some fun. Then I suppose when you start fighting the shade I\u2019ll start on everyone else. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll need help before that. They are just humans and\u2026 whatever those others are called. I sure hope I don\u2019t have to taste any of those Ra\u2019zac again. Yuck!\u201d You replied and stuck out your tongue in a comical reference to your displeasure of the memory and taste.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo\u2026 what are you going to do after this?\u201d She asked after a short silence came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really sure. I was following Brom when I got here. Then I took over his last mission. Now I\u2019m going to roast a bunch of invading soldiers, or eat them, or whatever. But either way, I can\u2019t imagine what is going to happen after that. I definitely didn\u2019t expect to be having a conversation with a dragon I just met.\u201d You answered, now thinking about that aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that bad to speak with me, or dragons rather?\u201d she asked in an almost sorrowful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends who I\u2019m talking to. In my realm there is a whole 1 other dragon other than me that is halfway decent. All the others are\u2026 well the exact way that humans think of us as. They are arrogant, self centered, vicious, sadistic, and the list goes on. You\u2019re the second dragon that hasn\u2019t met me with the intent to kill me for some reason or another. So for all my life I was use to slaughtering every dragon I see and them wishing the same on me and on the innocent humans I was trying to save. I even saw one take an infant hostage and when I complied to a demand of letting his brother go he chewed the baby up and spat it on the mother.\u201d You revealed, obviously getting you heated as you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is horrible. Dragons in your world actually do that?\u201d She asked in aghast to the situation you were retelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse, that was a light story. Needless to say\u2026 I haven\u2019t had many good experiences with dragons. So to prevent bad experiences for me and those around I tend to slaughter dragons before they can do such horrendous acts. It also doesn\u2019t help that even my Mother wanted me dead.\u201d You ended as you laid your head down to rest and observe the humans and other like beings below as they readied for their battle. \u201cHumans and that kind are much better, in my experience. Maybe it is because they are so weak that they can\u2019t do anything but cater to us until they see that we are worth keeping around. Maybe they are just naturally more moral than dragons. Maybe that is why this world requires Dragons to have Riders. It is hard to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I have it easy then. When we are done here, I just have to follow Eragon wherever he decides to go. But you don\u2019t have a Human to lead you. In a sense, you are your own Rider. I can\u2019t imagine that man that wanted to ride you will let you stay among him and others under him after he gets done using you or us. No way he\u2019ll keep you around to jeopardize his rule.\u201d Saphira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what you meant by \u2018after this\u2019. I admit, it is a probably going to end up with me leaving this realm. Not that I mind. No offense, but even the scent of another dragon makes my blood boil. Even if your scent is ok, now, there are a few others in the air and variations of the scent saturated everywhere. But you never know, I could end up staying.\u201d You answered back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I hope you do stay. There is no way I am going to mate with the King\u2019s dragon. It would be a pain if he was the only other dragon in this world. Not to mention I would be back to only talking with Eragon.\u201d She recited, as if giving you a list of things to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think on it. While I attempt to get some rest would you mind doing something for me?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She perked up as she was eager to help you out in any way she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I slept with someone. The last person that slept by my side was Sarah and I\u2026 well she isn\u2019t here at the moment. So I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind a little more contact. Just to know you\u2019re there.\u201d You asked, fully expecting her to say no. You knew that she was still a little weary of what happened the last time she woke you up and what might happen if your nightmares came and had you do something to her, a dragon, while she was so close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She said simply and guided your head into her front lap just below her head then draped her head and neck over yours. It wasn\u2019t much with the size difference. From a distance it could look like a kitten and a Large dog sleeping together. But it felt actually\u2026 quite good with her a friend\u2019s heartbeat so close to you and harmonizing with yours to lull you asleep. You hoped the enemy would take a while to attack so that you could rest a while like this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were rudely interrupted from the first good rest you\u2019d had since you left your home. Even though your dreams weren\u2019t completely without malice, they still were significantly weaker in potency. You growled as you heard the sound of approaching horns that signaled the approach of enemy forces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax, I have to go and get my armor on.\u201d Saphira said as you woke to which she had uncoiled her limited body from your head and neck. Her wings had covered your eyes to help keep the late sun out of your sleep. But now that it was dark, she didn\u2019t need to. You raised you head and let out a massive yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the bad guys ever be late? They always know the most inconvenient timing and nail it perfectly without trying.\u201d You complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they are the bad side. So I suppose it would only make sense that they rub us the wrong way.\u201d She said as she got up then looked at you. She left to some of the soldier\u2019s calling to get her armor on. You rested your eyes as you listened to the things happening and guessed on the attack timing. If you came in too early than that Shade would just run. If you did it too late than Saphira and Eragon could end up as one or both of the casualties. That Shade had already taken one of your friends. You would be damned if he did likewise to any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d said a male voice to which your eyes shot open to see Eragon looking at you. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see you until I ran into your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to think of it, I did feel a little presence just now.\u201d You joked as you ripped on his presumed accident not even registering as a problem to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ha, ha. You\u2019re a riot, you know that?\u201d Eragon said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d said an internal voice as you both saw Saphira come and you felt her walk into your side. \u201cI can understand why he can\u2019t see you but why can\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy. Dark hunters in general are most dangerous at night because we blend in with the darkness and even our heat signatures are erased on default. If I don\u2019t make an effort to be noticed than you wouldn\u2019t be able to find me. It is, in a sense, my element.\u201d You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we don\u2019t want them to see you until we are ready. It would be a shame if that Shade left here without my sword buried in his heart because you scared the crap out of him.\u201d Eragon surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, you\u2019re thinking like a dragon already, little guy.\u201d You said. \u201cI agree. You two take out as many as you want. But save your strength for the shade. When he gets sick of you two interfering then he\u2019ll come for you. Then I\u2019ll show myself. He won\u2019t leave this place once inside. I\u2019ll see to that. You just see that he receives a sword in the heart. If you need help, I\u2019ll be the one torching the rest of the invading army.\u201d You complimented then all three of you were drawn to a pounding on the main gate as the attack begun. Eragon asked Saphira a few meaning of life questions but then roared and took off as soon as they were ready to deliver their wrath on the field. Good thing Saphira had learned her flame breath. However it hardly seemed fair to the human forces being torched by her flames.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched as Saphira and Eragon did their thing. It was laughable how many she took out in relation to him. She would swoop down low for him to take a few but in the recoil or on the journey she would take out a hundred or so. You watched the show for a bit but stayed out of sight of the approaching Shade. You let out a subconscious growl that shook the area but not enough to cause suspicion of anything outside the battle or the already present dragon. However, finally, the shade conjured some kind of dark magic beast and went after them. This was your Queue to which you stood and looked over the battlefield and gave a deathly vicious roar then took off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were definitely using the darkness to hide you as you flew around. For how big you were it was slightly comical that they couldn\u2019t see you as you passed feet from them. But finally you revealed yourself as you spewed a wall of flames the dwarfed Saphira\u2019s by a wide margin. But you soon realized that such an attack was only good if they were all in groups. Not for the fighting soldiers. So you segmented and aimed a version of flames that were like solid needles of fire. They COULD be deathly accurate. So you flew over and riddled the field with them. You concentrated hard in not missing so that you didn\u2019t hit allied forces that were sometimes inches away from the targets. From a distance it looked like a flamethrower and a machine gun had a kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times you got tired and needed some energy. Good thing there was a fresh and flooding supply of \u2018bad\u2019 humans to pick from. So you would snag a few dozen in a pass to gulp down and digest to fuel your efforts. They tried shooting at you but they were lucky to catch the flash of you flying by and equally lucky to see you before they died when you attacked. If Saphira taking part in the battle was unfair, this surely wasn\u2019t in the least. Finally however you got all that were in the camp and were just flaming the ones coming out of the entrance they made. So you landed in front of it, causing the incoming army to panic, with good reason. You then just blew your flames into the entrance so they flowed through the passages and incinerated all those inside. You could hear and see your flames exiting in weak points in the wall of the mountain and in the exit. There were a few that survived behind you. They tried to sneak up on you as the thought you were distracted. But you just weaved your tail behind you with the end flattened, slicing the incoming enemy units in half or, at the very least, in pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moment or reprieve from them panicking into a retreat was cut short by a scream of Saphira. Your head snapped to the sound to find Saphira\u2019s Neck in the mouth of the dark magic beast that the Shade was flying. You snarled at the sight then took off with another roar that solidified any enemy units that were debating staying around. With that you went straight for the beast and zoomed past with your tail draping to slice the mouth that had her clamped in half. On your return trip you slowed down just enough for the Shade to see you glaring and snarling at him before you vanished into the darkness of the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome get me you vile beast!\u201d came the unwise words of the Shade as he switched from his intended target to you. You didn\u2019t know what was more comical about this; that he thought he could defeat you or that he called YOU the \u2018vile beast\u2019. Did he even own a mirror?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaphira, Eragon,\u2026 are you two OK?\u201d you asked in their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaphira is hurt bad. We are better when we saw you taking the Shade on. Can you help her?\u201d Eragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Eragon. Provided that I can end this little game of cat and mouse quickly, I am not sure I can. I can heal normal wounds. But if that has any augmentation in it than I might not be able to. I\u2019m sorry but you are both going to have to finish this. You\u2019re right Eragon. I can\u2019t nail his heart. You two need to be the heroes. I\u2019ll take care of his little flying machine afterwards but he needs that sword in through the heart like we planned. I\u2019ll keep his attention while you two figure something clever out.\u201d You said then made another pass so the Shade knew where you were for a second. He fired some magic at you but missed horribly. You kept him steady and saw as Saphira didn\u2019t have Eragon on her saddle then you saw an awesome move as she flicked her tail and Eragon was shot like an arrow straight at the Shade. He was so distracted that nailing his heart was easy. You finished the flying thing by catching Saphira before she collided with it, incinerating what was left of it with some impossibly strong black flames, then racing to catch the falling Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEragon!\u201d called Saphira, trying to squirm out of your grasp and getting her wound to spray blood all over your underside. She was obviously in panic from watching her rider plummet to the ground below. You felt touched that she would think of a human so highly, even outside the fact that if he died so would she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop Squirming. It is hard enough to fly and catch him without you thrashing.\u201d You scolded to which she whimpered and watched as you zoomed toward Eragon. \u201cOK, this is going to get a little awkward. My claws are occupied with Saphira so I have to catch you in my mouth. I promise you will be fine so don\u2019t panic.\u201d You communicated to both of them. They barely had time to think on it as you caught Eragon mere feet from the ground in your jaws, wrapping your tongue around him like an airbag as your speed and angle made it impossible to not hit the ground. The last thing you could do was turn so Saphira wasn\u2019t crushed by the fall. But you on the other hand had collided with the ground at near full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you could do, as you were close to passing out, was release Eragon and place him, with your tongue, next to Saphira. She was bleeding pretty bad while laying on your stomach, being protected by your wings that you had retracted now that you were on the ground and they were broken for the moment. With that done you passed out from the pain and probably concussion that was a understandable result of colliding with the ground. You were strong, but you were no match for a planet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHold on Max, don\u2019t move around.\u201d Came the inward voice of Saphira as you woke and started to do just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped doing so at her request but opened your eyes to see why. But you didn\u2019t really have to, as your wings and other parts of your body gave you enough reason why by themselves and the pain you were in. Looking off to each side, while blinking your eyes awake, you saw your wings were bend and bandaged. You assumed that you had a few internal injuries as well. Things that would take about a day to heal. You couldn\u2019t complain as it would take months for someone else to recover enough to move properly and even longer to be in fighting shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d you asked without moving too much but still out load so the others could hear at least your side of the talk. They assumed that Saphira got the message across to not move as you weren\u2019t getting up. But of course they couldn\u2019t hear her say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver a week. I can\u2019t imagine anyone being alive after landing as hard as you did. You left a sizable crater in the ground.\u201d Eragon answered, again, out loud for the same reason you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I thought you were bleeding out.\u201d You asked as you looked at the form of Saphira come to rest near your head so you could easily see her. \u201cNot that I mind you being\u2026 well, alive. But one tends to miss the amount of blood you lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEragon healed me with Magic. By all rights, we both should be dead from the spell he used. But he was able to pull it off and here we both are to tell you about it.\u201d Saphira responded and the limited humans around that were tending to damage and your injuries just accepted that the silence was her \u2018talking\u2019 with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you were right to pick him for your Rider than.\u201d You complimented but could only look over at the smiling Eragon then back at Saphira. \u201cDoubt anyone else would be foolish enough to attempt such a move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d She agreed and gave Eragon a light nuzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how bad is it?\u201d you asked, glancing at your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we were able to move you barely thanks to Saphira. She insisted in cleaning her blood off you herself.\u201d Eragon started to which you could of sworn you saw her blush, even beyond her blue scales. \u201cBut your wing bones were shattered and so was a few of your inside bones. I remember you saying that you could heal most injuries by yourself. But we weren\u2019t sure when you would be up. So we set your wings and they are almost healed. I would say another week should be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I suppose I could do for a little R&amp;R.\u201d You agreed. However your stomach growled loudly that got the humans around you nervous. They probably saw you gulp down soldiers in the battle and, as your whole body was clean, they probably cleaned some human blood from your jaws at some point. So their nervousness was understandable. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would be willing to hunt for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for this week I suppose I could bring you your meals.\u201d Saphira offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we feed you some of the enemy that are sticking around do you? We have tried to get them out, but there are still a few of them that are around. You said yourself that a human could last you longer than a considerable amount of other meat.\u201d Asked Eragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are OK with watching me eat other humans, evil or not?\u201d You asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, but I\u2019ll probably not watch. I just asked as it would be better for\u2026 ah\u2026 Saphira to feed you the ones she catches, rather than having them be hanged or executed. At least this way we don\u2019t have to deal with the clean up and we are feeding a friend.\u201d Eragon stated, looking to Saphira to make sure it was ok to volunteer her for such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll trust that the ones she brings me are ok to eat. I am not too thrilled about eating humans in general. But I guess with her bringing my food, I can\u2019t be too picky.\u201d You agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the record, I hope I don\u2019t have to feed you any. I think you are rubbing off on me. I don\u2019t want to eat humans either. But I see the point. No reason to waste fresh meat.\u201d Saphira added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that settles that. Why don\u2019t you rest and we\u2019ll bring you a cow or something in a little bit.\u201d Eragon stated and it seemed the other humans were glad that at least your current meal wasn\u2019t one of them or even close. They could only guess what was on the dragon side of the conversation. All they knew was that you three had been discussing food and filling the complaining stomach that gave them pause when it was audible. You couldn\u2019t imagine that the rumors that were spread because of the conversation would be very good. But you hoped they wouldn\u2019t affect you or your status in this world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In human form you were eight feet tall and extremely muscular, however you were fast for someone of such size and power. In dragon form you were fully grown. As a dragon you stood over 500 feet and knew how to hunt to the point that no other dragon could stand up to you. The prey you were chasing was a warlord. Upon growing up you offered yourself to clients as a mercenary. You had little care for socializing due to your hatred towards your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon growing up you learned that she was queen of the Dark Hunters. It made sense why she tossed you aside. The last thing she wanted was her own child to usurp her reign over the Dark Hunters. As you were chasing the warlord you leap high into the air. You then land in front of his carriage. The horse panic as you unsheathe your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you! You're Havorok Huntfire!\" the warlord gasped as he looked into your blood red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have to say? Pathetic. You'll die like the cowering worm that you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick thrust you pierce the warlord through the heart. As you pull out your sword the warlord falls to the ground. You then proceed to take any valuables he has as a bonus to the payment that your client will give you. You then spot a woman tied up in the back. Your job also required you to rescue this damsel. The damsel was a noblewoman around your age and by the looks of it she must be skilled at fighting. She was also tall for a woman. By your guess she had to be a foot shorter than yourself. You cut her bindings with your sword. She then wakes up. Upon waking her white blond hair briefly covers her emerald eyes. She then notices you looming over her. Unlike other humans she doesn't cower in fear. Once on her feet she continues to look into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're ready we have to leave. Your father is paying me to bring you back safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods in understanding. You can tell that she was recovering from the trauma of being kidnapped. You then transform into your dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on. I have to take this gold and other things to my place. It shouldn't be too far from town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods and climbs on your back. You then take off and carry the carriage, horses and all to your estate. For a mercenary the extra wealth you've gathered has allowed you to buy a castle of your own. Once there you are greeted by your servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings master. What would you like us to do?\" A maid said as she curtsied before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the treasure in the vault and take the horses to the stables. If the horses give you any trouble kill them and put them in my private chamber. I have some work I need to finish. Once I return make preparations for my meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish master.\" The maid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants then do as you commanded. You then transform into your human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll walk to town. The last thing I need is for your father's men to attack me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods in agreement. You and the noblewoman then walk into town. As you walk you see many people socilize. You sigh knowing that for someone like yourself socializing was not possible. You were too fixated on exacting revenge on your mother to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Lord Huntfire. I just noticed that you seem lonely. Don't you have someone you care about?\" the woman spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore the woman for the time being. You then run your fingers through your short beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a no. I'm thankful that you saved me. If you would like maybe we can be friends. As a princess I barely have time for friends. Everyday my father has me studying a book or practicing my swordplay. It also doesn't help that I'm heir to his throne either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your brow in response. No one in your life has wanted to be your friend before. You have servants that's for sure, but no one you could call a friend. But you knew that if you did make a friend your diabolical mother would send one of your sisters to kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be silent during the whole way back? I understand that you didn't achieve your title through birth or had any comrades to help you, but please don't shut me out. You may chose to live a lonely life built on your terrible upbringing, but deep inside your intentions are justified. Deep down inside you want to do the best to end your suffering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only obligation is my job. If you would like to chat with me go ahead. Whether I chose to answer is up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it part of your job to talk to me? You really don't want the Dark Hunter queen to exploit feelings of friendship for weakness. That's total bull crap! I've heard the stories of her tossing you over a cliff and leaving you for dead. Friendship isn't a weakness. It's strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin in amusement. You knew from her thoughts that she was going to say what she said, but you never thought she would be so outspoken. Somehow something was unique about this princess. You couldn't put your finger on it but there's something more to her. Yet Princess Clarina Bruskolov did come from an intriguging bloodline. The knowledge from past Kings tell you that her family has a connection with dragons, but how much wasn't clear yet. After walking for fifteen minutes you arrive at the castle. You then spot the king waiting at the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lord Huntfire for rescuing my daughter. Here's 100,000 gold for your troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bag of gold and tie it to your belt. \"Thank you your majesty.\" You then prepare to leave until the king calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Huntfire, I have another job for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of job is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This job is more of an expedition. I'm sure you know about the ill-fated Light Knight Dragons of long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of them. They're the polar opposite of Dark Hunters who vanished long ago. In the past they were evenly matched. Some rumors say that they went extinct, yet others say that they were cursed to take on human forms until they can access the legendary temple. If said temple is found it is said that a Light Knight Queen will restore the race's ability to shift from human to dragon form.\" You said as knowledge from one of the previous Kings came to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive Lord Huntfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do we start this expedition your majesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll set out a few days from now. Like last time I'll pay you after the the job is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walk back to your estate.</span></div></div>",

During the day if in town you usually hear people gossip about you. It wasn't out of the ordinary, but most people described you as a dark knight or a heartless monster. Yet that didn't phase you. Ever since you were twelve you started you career as a mercenary and killed people with bounties without regret. You even torched a band of pirates because it was the job you were hired to do. Sometimes though people respect your work. Life as a mercenary isn't pleasing to people, but in a way it did help you gain wealth and a fearsome reputation. The people who respected you often called you the lord of dragons or the lone hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sun went down a gentle breeze blew through your jet black hair. You then examined the bag containing the 100,000 gold. In the land in which you live one gold bar equals at least 20,000 gold coins. With five gold bars in the sack you were carrying you have enough gold to add another expansion to your own castle outside of town. You then stop walking as your ears detect light footsteps. Your nose picks up the scent of thieves. They would be fools to attack a dragon like yourself. It wouldn't even be worth transforming into a dragon to put those lowlifes out of their pathetic existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out cowards! You picked the wrong guy to mug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear one thief run towards you. On instinct you leap into the air and kick the thief. The thief is sent hurling into a wall. The impact from the blow broke his neck leaving him dead. You sense fear among the other thieves hiding in the shadows. Three more thieves come rushing at you from three different directions. You unsheathe your sword and quickly slice the thieves in two. You then spot two thieves cowering before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hav... Have mercy on us Lord Havorok Huntfire!\" A female thief cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I consider sparing your lives after you attacked me?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do anything!\" the other thief said as sweat rolled down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want to make it up to me then pledge your allegiance to me. You'll be hired as my servants and be my guards. If I need information for a job such as the layout for a town you two will find out all you can. Failure to do that will result in consequences. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and your newly acquired servants head back to your castle. You then eat a feast made for a king. Normally eating this much would be bad for a human, but given that you are a dragon meals as large as this were required to keep yourself in tiptop shape. Also with your proficiency in magic you could easily replenish your own food supply in months of famine. Of course if such was the case you would sell your food to the townspeople. You can't afford to let them die of starvation or you wouldn't have clients to hire you for your services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating your fill your servants eat the small portion that you left for them. You then head to your bathing chamber. There you take off your tunic, gloves, and pants. You then use your fire breath to heat the water the maids have prepared while you were out. You then step into the pool of water and relax. You look at your body and remember how you were nearly killed twenty years ago. It's a surprise that the scars you received long ago were completely gone from both of your forms. As you grew older the scars slowly faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you were twelve that they were completely gone. Now every time you get cut or scratched the wound instantly heals. You relax for thirty minutes before you hear a knock on the door. You then slip on your pants and answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's someone here to see you m'lord.\" A butler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right out. I just need to put on my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll let your visitor know that you'll be ready soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping on a shirt you go out to the throne room to meet your guest. The guess you meet must have a reason for wanting to meet with you this late at night. Upon entering the throne room you see your visitor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a close inspection you identify the visitor to be Princess Clarina Bruskolov herself. She was wearing the same white armor as before, however this time she had a sword on her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Lord Huntfire. I do not mean to intrude, but I thought it would be best to thank you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this isn't an attempt to buddy up with me because you think I'm lonely?\" You asked as you saw through her greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if it is. We're that different in some aspects of our upbringing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though I have a father he never spent any time with me. He's always spending time with my cousins or his personal guards. His glowing purple eyes always look on with disapproval. If he does want to spend time with me it's usually to extort me for my natural abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a king and your a princess. He's only doing what's in your best interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you explain the fact that he left me all alone in the forest when I was five. I was lucky to find my way back. That fraud of a king was too busy pleasuring his concubines. Have you ever seen him at least embrace me in a hug? No, he didn't even do that. All my life I've been alone. It was nothing but reading, swordplay, and magic, but without the embrace of the man who should always be there it felt like I was being trained as a weapon.\" Clarina said as she tried holding back her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin feeling sorry for her. It didn't occur to you that the king just saw his daughter as just a mere flower to be tossed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had it worse as you've heard. As soon as I was born my mother chewed on my body with her teeth, threw me off a cliff, and left me to die. Upon growing up I learned to trust no one. People were always trying to kill me or sometimes exploit me. Yet in the end...\", You feel yourself at a loss for words as your own loneliness took over. You haven't cried since you were twelve but you felt the strange desire to let it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try holding back your own tears, but find yourself unable to. Were you and the princess who stood before you no different? You then notice Clarina besides you. How she approached you so quickly surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Havorok. Just left it all out. As your friend I'll always be there till the very end. That's what friends do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Clarina's gesture. In all your life you haven't known what kindness was. None of the prior Dark Hunter Kings even knew the concept, yet they should have. Instead they lived the similar lifestyle you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recently I've been looking more into my family history and the Light Knight Dragons that once lived among your kind. I've found some information that explains my father's motivations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What info is that? I may already know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point Havorok, but did you know that all men in my family have purple eyes while the women have yellow eyes. I also found out that Light Knight Queens are the only ones of that race of dragon to have green eyes. Given this info then the rumors about my family once being able to turn into dragons at will must be true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Wouldn't that mean you would have draconic powers. If I remember the legends correctly the Light Knight Queen always maintained these powers in her human form unlike the other Light Knight Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct, but Light Knight Queens don't possess genetic memory. The only thing passed down from previous Queens are adaptability, intellect, and the ability to copy any skill they see, except shapeshifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true then you have to go to the temple to have your shapeshifting ability restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. It was a pleasure talking to you. If you need to talk before we meet for the expedition then I'm available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarina then waves her hand and she disappears before your eyes. So that's how she made it in. For once you actually felt happy. Maybe after the expedition and the rumors are true you might even wed this princess, but before thinking about that you'll fix the wrongdoings of your mother. Surely her reign over the Dark Hunters must come to an end and the era of Dark Hunter Kings to begin. Deep inside you knew that if male Dark Hunters weren't malnourished that they can match a female in size and power. Deep inside you wanted a Dark Hunter society where both male and female were capable of standing on their own and proving their worth. Yet it is that reason you spare a few people during your quests; for some reason you always saw a person's true potential.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you wake up in your bedchambers, a massive room fully capable of fitting a 500' 2\" dragon such as yourself. Your bedchambers had a reflective roof that allowed sunlight to fill the room so you could feed off the sun's energy. Once you were done stretching your limbs you transform into your human form. You then proceed to the bathhouse in the adjoining room. Like your bedchambers the roof also allowed sunlight to filter in. Despite the roof's transparent nature from the inside it was made of a special mineral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mineral was known as Dragonstone, a mineral made through alchemy and whose properties gave it a sturdy and reflective texture. During your travels as a boy you were working in Salchemgic, the magic and science capital of the Base Realm. You were hired by an alchemist as a bodyguard despite being twelve, but it was during that time you had access to the skills of the previous Kings. You were only 300 feet tall back then in dragon form, but taller than any grown man in your human form standing at 6'1\". It was by that time you had no scars left on your body for they slowly disappeared as you matured. It was there you mastered your client's craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays you can successfully create servants out of the raw materials that made up their composition and through necromancy to create artificial souls. That's why most of your servants showed their loyalty to you since they were merely empty dolls with with fake souls. You take your time relaxing in the hot water as you recollect the first time you began your job as a mercenary. It didn't give you the trust of the people, but it did create a fearsome reputation that makes people cower before the name that you had given yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish bathing you change into your armor, which is as black as your hair. You the use your powers to fly. After leaping into the air your wings sprout from your back. You fly to the meeting place and wait for the king and his men to arrive. As you wait you eat the meal that your homunculus servants have made. Once finished you teleport the waste back to the castle kitchens to be cleaned. You then lay on your back and take in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later you hear the sound of marching soldiers and horses galloping. You quickly rise to your feet and brush yourself off. You see the king riding on horseback. His purple eyes shone in the distance. Behind him Princess Clarina was walking on foot. You found it odd that she wouldn't be on a horse and that she's tagging along, but you're certain it has to deal with the expedition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Lord Huntfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Your Majesty.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your ready for the expedition to the Light Knight Temple. Where we are going will be dangerous. This time of year the Dark Hunter Queen is mating. All her daughters will be out and about once the sun goes down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you hired me. Just to fend off dragon attacks knowing very well of the dragon you spoke of also tried to kill me when I was born. I can easily take out one or two, but I wouldn't be able to take on an entire army without an army myself. It would take five or more of them together to take me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I brought my other insurance policy. My daughter is very capable of killing a dragon all by herself. My army could also kill two dragons at their current level of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you no concern for your flesh and blood. She's your heir, not some weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I use my daughter is no concern of yours. I need her to stay alive so we can get to the temple. If she dies I'm certain you can just resurrect her anyway.\" The king said in an arrogant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then sigh seeing that arguing with your client would get you nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'll charge you extra for any resurrections, got it King Sycamore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand clearly Lord Havorok Huntfire, but if you even dare disrespect me again I will make sure the Queen of the Dark Hunters destroys everything you hold dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, now let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the king's men then walk towards Salchemgic to pick up supplies. As you were walking Clarina approaches you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for standing up to my father for me. I would have done it myself, but I couldn't do it without the urge to end his life.\" Clarina whispered into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. I've worked with less savory employers before. It takes patience and control not to lash out.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but my father is the type of man who wouldn't bat an eye if his flesh and blood were slaughtered before his eyes. Whatever he has planned is definitely evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be the case milady, but if the king gets out of line you have the power to take over. All you need is trusted advisers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately my father bribes them with gold. I have no one I can trust, but I do have hope that someday things can change for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're optimistic. I just do what's necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Huntfire, that's good and all, but you need friends. Without them life is a dull existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coming from a sheltered woman who only knows what she's read or the art of swordplay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I'm right milord. You just don't want to admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin appears on your face. Clarina's straightforwardness was admirable for a human woman. While male Dark Hunters are treated as toys for the Queen in human society women seemed to face similar troubles, but definitely better off than your own brothers. A few hours later you arrive in Salchemgic. From there you are briefed on what to expect.</span></div></div>",

You nuzzled into the feeling but felt no body to nuzzle other than underneath you. So you stayed there as you felt an unnatural amount of warmth that you thought was your mother. You were wishing that the horrid events that plagued your dreams were just a nightmare and that she really did love and care about you. All that was dashed when you tried to move and found a harsh shot of pain reel through your body from the places you remember being chewed on. To the pain and memory you started to whimper as you were too weak to cry but not too weak to open your eyes and see where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGramps, you got to do something. Can\u2019t you see he\u2019s in pain!\u201d said the face that was just above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsu look!\u201d interrupted a voice coming from a blue flying cat. \u201cHe\u2019s waking up.\u201d The boy looked at you as you looked at him. You had stopped whimpering for a moments to observe the apparent human that held you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was intense yet innocent looking and with a strange familiarity to it with black eyes and rose colored hair. Besides the clothes he had on you could smell his scent. It almost smelled like he was part dragon, almost. Lastly you noticed flames coming from around you. Not able to move, you looked with your eye that was still on the side that was lying on his hand to see the flames were coming from his skin. You didn\u2019t know how a human could do this and every part of your mind was wondering why as well but you took it as a sign that you were in good hands, both figuratively and literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello little guy, are you feeling ok?\u201d asked the human, that was called by the others, \u2018Natsu\u2019. You answered by nuzzling into his hand and whining some more. Your wounds had healed enough to not be a bother as far as bleeding but the pain was still very real as well as your hunger and sadness. But this \u2018Natsu\u2019 guy seemed nice and more importantly to your current situation, warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Natsu, it looks like you were right for once.\u201d Said another voice but you didn\u2019t look as you were whimpering and whining into his hands as if they would provide more comfort than they were already giving. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought that dousing the poor thing in flames would help heal the little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Natsu seems strangely equipped to take care of the young dragon.\u201d Said yet another voice, this one more aged and masculine than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what do I do? He\u2019s gotta eat something. I can hear his stomach growl from here.\u201d Natsu asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do dragons eat?\u201d Asked one of the other voices you heard before. But you couldn\u2019t really pay attention at this point as you drifted off to sleep again. You were glad that you had been found by someone nice and at least partially a dragon, from the smell of him. You weren\u2019t too sure about them being human and stuff like that but your thoughts were interrupted by another onslaught of nightmares as you slept, hoping for a relief soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You opened your eyes to see the Natsu human looking down at you intently. This time when you moved it barely hurt at all. You stumbled to your feet and it was then that the relative silence broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d Natsu yelled to which you cringed down into a fearful position. The noise was obviously not welcomed and he seemed to get it right away as you looked around to see more than a few human faces looking at you as you spun to look at them. You went in circles on his hands for a while as you looked and sniffed around. It smelt chaotic to you. So many smells and most of them you didn\u2019t have the slightest clue what or who they were. You stretched your wings and took to the air. \u201cHey, come back.\u201d Said the human but you didn\u2019t really understand him, yet. You were learning quickly and by the tone of his voice and his body movement you could guess what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on their Natsu. Just looks like he\u2019s getting a good look around.\u201d Said the old voice from before. You took to soaring after you discovered a hard surface above a certain point. Around and around in circles you went as you gazed down at the humans watching you, taking in every little detail. But the more that you did so the more you were getting confused. They were so weird and well different then the memories that flooded your head. You quickly noticed that you wouldn\u2019t be gaining any considerable knowledge like that but just as you figured that out your still partially damaged wing gave out and you began to fall to the ground. But it didn\u2019t last long as a familiar pair of hands caught you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be careful. You\u2019re still weak from whatever happened.\u201d Said Natsu and again you couldn\u2019t figure out what he was saying but got the gist of it as his concerned face and trembling hands told the story all too well. You rolled over and stood again, flexing your wings and looking at the injured one. You licked at it but realized that it was still too damaged to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the poor thing\u2019s wing is still to hurt to fly.\u201d Said a female voice that you tracked to a young looking girl with blonde hair and brown eyes. You then felt a sneeze coming but not knowing what that was yet you just let it fly. As you did a massive amount of flames went out and took out part of a stone wall and sent you back into Natsu from the propulsion. You shook your head then continued to explored up Natsu\u2019s body until you came to rest on his shoulders and in a small whitish looking clothe that was around his neck and was for some reason really comfortable to you. So you snuggled into it and his neck then looked back out to the humans as Natsu stood and looked at you the best he could. They were all slightly shocked at what just your sneeze did which was followed shortly by Natsu laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, he found someone just as destructive as he is.\u201d The blonde haired girl said, slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right. What a sneeze wouldn\u2019t you say Natsu?\u201d asked the blue flying cat as he tried to land next to you but you sent a growl over and although weak the little blue cat listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, be nice to Happy Max.\u201d instructed Natsu. You were slowly getting the hang of their language and understood him, mostly. Understood enough to know that he had named your Max and didn\u2019t growl as the cat sat on the shoulder next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax? Is that what you\u2019re going to name him?\u201d asked the little blue cat as he reached over and started petting you. At first you had to stiffen a snarl but then you got to liking what the little blue fur ball was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe likes it, right Max?\u201d asked Natsu to which you raised your head and licked his neck then laid it back down on the cloth apparently called a scarf. As you relaxed your genetic knowledge began coming to you and filling in the blanks. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Natsu, it seems you have yourself a pet dragon.\u201d Said someone else in the room to which you growled at the words. The act got him and the others around him to flinch as they didn\u2019t want to cause another sneeze in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax is not a pet! He\u2019s going to be my partner, right next to Happy.\u201d Natsu said as if getting ready for a fight. Well that was until you nipped at his ear. \u201cOw! What was that for?\u201d he yelped to which you chirped back at him. \u201cHuh?\u201d he asked, still not understanding until he and the rest of them heard your stomach growl. \u201cOh! You\u2019re hungry, that\u2019s it isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked to which you licked him and chirped an affirmative sounding response. You didn\u2019t have the vocals to mimic human speech yet so you just had to make do until you grew a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Natsu, let\u2019s get him something to eat.\u201d The blue cat said, which immediately sent away any feelings of distrust from the little fur ball. \u201cHope you like fish.\u201d Happy said to which you just cocked your head and chirped in a way that got across that you were confused. \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve never had fish before? Well you\u2019re in for a treat then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter be careful Happy or he might eat you when he gets big enough.\u201d Said another human in the room. You growled at him but he didn\u2019t back down like the others. \u201cWhat are you going to do little fire breather\u201d he taunted to which you blew a hefty amount of light flames at him, charring his clothes and hair and leaving him stunned and coughing up a little smoke from the experience. \u201cRight\u2026 you\u2019ll breathe fire.\u201d he said then passed out, causing a round of laughter. You were slightly worried that you went to far but with that reaction you were really liking this place and it almost got you to forget why you were there in the first place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had been growing at an accelerated rate because of being a Dark Hunter King and going through the portal a mere couple hours after birth. In that week you had already grown to a horse\u2019 size and quickly found out how to go from human to dragon and back. Although currently your human form was still an infant size so you just stayed as a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hurt you did I?\u201d you apologized. You used extra care as you got bigger not to bite to hard but he had pretty tough skin for a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t worry about it, it just surprised me sometimes. Which reminds me\u2026 were getting a team together, do you want to join?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t I already with you Natsu?\u201d you asked. It was true and your received a guild seal on both your dragon form and human form. In your human form it was on your arm like Natsu\u2019s but black. In dragon form it was put on your side and as you grew it did as well. \u201cI mean you\u2019re like my family so\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, we\u2019re all a big family in Fairy Tail and it\u2019s awesome hanging out with you and stuff but we still have to go on missions and for that we should put together a team so other people don\u2019t think they can grab you.\u201d he said just in time for one of the other members to come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Max, why don\u2019t you join up with a real man?\u201d said Elfman and you got a look from happy as if to say \u2018see what he means\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, I asked him first!\u201d Natsu yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d Elfman hollard back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2026\u201d you started but they weren\u2019t listening anymore as they started fighting, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey never change do they?\u201d came Lucy\u2019s voice from the same table. They were about to go on a job and was about to form a new team so they naturally thought of you. You and Natsu were pretty close as he was like a father to you, kind of. He was the second person you saw so he was held in high station by instinct if nothing else. But that feeling slowly passed through to the rest of the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s never boring.\u201d You agreed. While your genetic memory gave you wisdom beyond your years and understanding far beyond normal people or even other dragons you still had only been alive for a little more than a week. So you watched a lot of what went on and experienced a lot of everything to add to your own personal experience of things. \u201cSo you three want me in your\u2026?\u201d you asked, not remembering the word Natsu used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026team? Yes we do. Just as long as you don\u2019t eat me or any of my spirits again.\u201d She said as a half joke and half warning. A few days ago when you were going through one of your growing spurts you had an instant increase in appetite. In that state you clamped down on one of her spirits and swallowed it down on pure instinct. She tried to stop you but it only ended in swallowing her half down as well. Luckily you caught yourself and spit them out. She wasn\u2019t really mad at you but she was more careful around you from then on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 you don\u2019t have to worry about that. I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d You said as you looked down and away from her. It was obvious that you felt really bad about it and she was kind of sore about the incident as well but she knew you were still really young so she had forgiven you quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know Max. But I got to know, did I taste good?\u201d she asked in a weird sense of fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, don\u2019t really know\u2026 you had too much clothes on to get a good taste and that little plush toy thing didn\u2019t taste that good. Lucy, you got to know that I would never hurt you.\u201d you said as you were worried that she thought you would really eat her in the future and it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa Max, I already know that. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think that you would.\u201d Lucy said as she waved her hands in both your and her defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to join our team or what?\u201d Happy asked as he flew and landed on your head. Despite almost eating him a few times, Happy was very relaxed around you and it meant a lot that he didn\u2019t even bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think I will.\u201d You answered after thinking about it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! You hear that Elfman? I win!\u201d Natsu said but was soon in another \u2018manly\u2019 fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll be leaving on our first mission after he gets done.\u201d You said as you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, we all know each other so well already.\u201d Lucy said as she seemed to be more fascinated by you then Natsu but was overall still star struck from being and equally new member as you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spread your small wings in this place, glad that there appear no predators here to worry you at your small size, and soak up the sunlight, feeling yourself banish more hunger further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later you realize you have, drifted would be the best word. You weren't asleep  quite, but didn't truly feel the passage of time till just now... when noises brought you to full awareness.

Somehow you feel that, even with your injuries, you should be better than this right now. Should have healed faster, have more acute senses, be faster. Something is wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the shapes move by above and to the side of you you focus on yourself, your simple mind struggling to grasp what your Inherited memories tell you. As young as you are it takes a long time for you to get it, but you finally understand the gist. This world is limited. Something in it stops magic. Normal magical beings can not exist here and spells fizzle almost totally. A normal dragon would survive, but would be weakened and a pitiful thing, certainly not able to fly, or flame, and a lot of other abilities would be impossible. However, you... ah, that is different. This place will limit you, but still you will be strong here... given time. You might not be as powerful as you might be else where, but you will still be vastly greater than anything living in this realm, and more than any normal dragon would be in a more normal realm! Growing to that size and power however will take some considerable effort and time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think on this it's almost as if there are two voices in your head, your own simple attempt to grasp this, and the memories of the previous Dark Hunter Kings and their understanding. You don't have their personalities, but something of them does survive within you somehow. Perhaps it is just when you are young, to help you survive? You don't know. If you're lucky it will stay with you. You hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blurs surrounding you become clearer as the day wears on, though they become somehow different. Different shapes maybe? Further through the day you feel the sun helping a great deal to heal and still your hunger, but it does not... The concept is tricky, but you think there is a difference in you between feeding hunger and feeding growth. For the latter you will need actual food, but to just survive, the sun will do. It certainly feels good to just lay here in the tall grass and soak it in!</span></div></div>",

\", asked Jack, by this time you add heard their names, the gray haired man was Jack and the leader, the glass man was Daniel, the female was Carter and the bald man was Teal\u00b4c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes but i don\u00b4t think it runned from us, since even when we pulled our weapons it did not run, wich means it never saw humans before and did not fear us ! \", said Daniel, \" Yes i also been feeling some presence from the moment we left the Stargate ! \", said Teal\u00b4c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That would be me ! \", you said outloud, they raised their so called weapons at the same time they whent back to back, \" Who\u00b4s there !, identify yourself ! \", asked Jack while pointing his weapon around, \" When you ask me to identify myself, are refereng to my name ? \", you asked back, they looked at each other with quizzicall looks, \" Yeah that would help ! \", he answered, \" In that case i can\u00b4t do it, since i have no name ! \", you said in a sad voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other again and asked, \" Can you atleast reveal yourself ? \", asked Carter, you pondered for a few seconds in as you searched in your genetic memory how humans normaly reacted to Dragon\u00b4s, \" I can !, but only if you promise not to run or attack ! \", you said, they lowered their weapons and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you revealed yourself they raised them again, but true to their word they didn\u00b4t attack, \" Carter, are you seeing what i am seing ? \", asked Jack like trying to confirm what he was looking at, \" If you are talking about the 50 foot tall dragon with red eyes, then yes ! \", she said, you stoud there for a minute, you waited for them to lower their weapons, \" Thank you ! \", you said, after liting a fire in wich they sit around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" For what ? \", asked Daniel as he sit down on a tree stump, \" For staying to talk, you see i\u00b4m the only sentient creature around, atleast as far as i know, it very lonely ! \", you answered, they all looked at each other, \" Aren\u00b4t there others like you ? \", asked Carter that seemed very curious about you, shaking your head you added, \" Originaly i ain\u00b4t even from this realm, i came from another were Dragon\u00b4s are comum place, or atleast his what my genetic memory tell\u00b4s me \", you answered, \" Genetic memory ? \", asked Jack, \" I\u00b4m know as a half-breed, a creature that his half-dragon and half-human, we have the ability to inherit the knowledge of former half-breeds of our kind, so despise being young i have millenia of knowledge in me ! \", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed to explain how you came here, they seemed to understand it quiet well, expecially after a little magick show in wich Carter was sceptical, \" But why don\u00b4t you have a name ?, didn\u00b4t your parents gave you one ? \", asked Jack, you looked at the distance and said, \" I never knew my father !, and my mother... well let me show you something ! \", you said and getting up wich seemed to scare them, you turned to the side and lifted your wing showing them your scars, there were some curses from them as they saw them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not a minute after being born she did this !, only sometime afterwards did i understoud why ! \", you said as you returned to your place, \" Within dragon\u00b4s the females are bigger and stronger in most cases, they are the queens, the only exception are the half-breeds, we get stronger and bigger then they could ever hope, so naturally we are killed the minute we are born ! \", you explained to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as they assimilated your words and them Jack said, \" No offence, but your mother is quite the whore ! \", said Jack with clear disdain, \" None taken ! \", you answered althought you never heard that word before, \" Well we have to call you something since we are going to stay her for sometime ! \", said Teal\u00b4c, \" I know !,  how about Max ? \", said Daniel, you liked the sound of it, it was easy to remenber and sounded good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I like it !, yes from this day on my name his Max ! \", you said as you got up and gave a hear shatering roar, \" What the bloody hell was that for ? \", asked Jack that add covered his hears, \" We dragon\u00b4s tend to express ourself\u00b4s with a roar, either with happines or rage ! \", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Next time warn us before you do ! \", said daniel as he shoke his head.</span></div></div>",

This is going to be a plot based fantasy interactive with a solid main character. Because I would like to establish this interactive as such there are a few more rules than I usually put forward. I retain the right to delete or edit any entry that doesn\u2019t follow these rules if I desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Keep it accurate ----- I don\u2019t care if you make the character any way you want, gay stuff included. However if a specific storyline has him, for example, Straight and you suddenly change him to be Gay, that is not ok. If you want to establish something about him that is contradicted earlier than add before that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Keep grammar a priority ----- I am not going to delete an entry if it has some miss spellings or one large paragraph but if it gets to ridiculous than I will delete it and notify you if you wish to resubmit. It just isn\u2019t cool if no one can understand someone\u2019s lack of education or proficiency and over use of things like (lol, WTF, OMG, or otherwise text language) this is not your phone and other people want to read chapters without decoding it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Keep it interesting ----- This will be a little more strict this time around. I WILL NOT be accepting any one line or word entries. ALL entries must be over a paragraph, and if you have to ask if it is too short than it probably is. Suddent dead ends are also going to be delete as well as chapters that are to me only. If you want to ask me to put an option in than send me a private message and I will accommodate as best I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) This is NOT a fetish based interactive ----- I have one other interactive that you can go all out on if you wish to do so. If you want to add something with a fetish attached to it than it must have some other purpose to it. For example: if you have someone eat someone else you could be transporting them somewhere. Or if you want someone unbirthed than maybe it was so that they come back as an anthro or full on animal. But do NOT dedicate a chapter or storyline to fetish or erotic based themes. You can use them but not as the main plot point of your addition. This is once again a PLOT based interactive and I have one other interactive if you want to expand on the Fetishes or Erotic preferences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Lastly, don\u2019t rip on anyone\u2019s writing style ----- If it really is bad enough to the point I don\u2019t like it I will delete it. If something is inaccurate to a realm or other pet peeve of yours than you either need to write some and get it back on track or just read and enjoy their creativity<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026 if you wish to add please do so and have fun regardless. I would love some feedback eventually if you like this. Can\u2019t tell you how far a little positive encouragement goes as far as fuel to keep going. <br>\r\n</td>",
