Good natured, a little silly, constently trying, and failing, to loose weight. Is obsessed with French Fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroeda - A dark elf and manager of a convenience store. She's sassy, flirty and sharp as a knife, Elfuda's polar opposite. Plagued by a huge ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusohanada - A dryad that runs a flower shop. She's very relaxed and plesant. Suffers from a severe lack of screen time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMero - A spritely Mermaid Fisherwoman. She loves swimming and seafood. Also doesn't get a lot of screen time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf those don't grab you, we always have group B and C (Yes, there are a ton of characters)</span></div></div>",

One month jump at most)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to keep chapters interesting and fair length, no excessively long or short. Around a paragraph is fair enough.
