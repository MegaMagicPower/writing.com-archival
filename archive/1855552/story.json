In addition to that you also still have an array of magical abilities.  You know spells that have long been lost and the combination of lethal magic and dangerous fighting skills makes you arguably the most competent fighter on the planet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do an incredible amount of good with your powers but you had stayed on the sidelines studying more and more mystical lore.  Something strange perked your interest however.  Two slayers in the existence of the world.  The concept of having two supernaturally strong women fighting against vampires intrigued you.  What if more than 2 could exist simultaneously.  You bent your mind to research and then the 2nd slayer died.  You were deeply curious to learn if the slayer would pass along again - and it did.  To a young beautiful woman by the name of Faith.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did a little bit more research and used your magic to scry on her.  When you did so you felt your knees tremble.  This woman was a picture of perfection.  Her looks, her attitude her very nature made you yearn to fall to your knees in worshipful supplication.  But how to approach her?  From your observations from afar she was an angry young woman.  She had defied the Watchers and had harmed the other slayer's friends.  Do this wrong and she might despise you forever... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking though one of the many Sunnydale cemeteries, consumed in your thoughts about the powerful, beautiful Faith, you almost let out a yelp of surprise when in the distance you saw a dark haired woman locked in combat with a couple of vampires. Surely it couldn't be...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdging closer towards the ruckus, using a tombstone to obscure yourself behind, you felt your heart racing uncontrollably as you got a proper view. It was  her! Her unmistakeably lithe, athletic figure, along with her combative grunts...it was definitely the slayer alright! Well, one of them - the one you had lusted after!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you vamps really got a death wish, huh?\" The gorgeous brunette stated, while performing an impressive spin kick on one of the her opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other glared at her, \"Slayer! We're gonna grind you into paste, pull out a ribcage and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wear it like a hat? Yeah, yeah - heard 'em all before!\" Faith laughed disdainfully as she planted a crisp kick to the vamp's chest, then followed it with an impressive-looking uppercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are frickin' stupid! The pair of you! You know I work for Wilkins, right?\" The slayer explained, pulling out a stake, toying with it as she passed it from hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilkins...who the hell?\" Muttered one of the vamps, gingerly nursing the point where he had been hit, but his eyes fixed warily on his foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to contain a frustrated sigh of your own. Did these vamps know nothing about Mayor Richard Wilkins (the third)? Since you had been around Sunnydale for a few weeks or so now, it was obvious - to those in the supernatural know at least - that he was the big cheese, the man with the power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith's disdain clearly echoed your thoughts. \"Don't even know Wilkins...\" She chuckled as she casually dusted the vamp who had just spoke. A groaning, crumbling sound reverberated around you as you watched the vampire perish. You had done a fair few yourself, but boy was that impressive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other vampire seemed to think so too. \"Look, we're like, obviously on the same side here. I thought \"slayer\" - goody-goody, wants to kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that little miss Buffy is NOTHIN' like me - ya hear?\" Faith shouted out angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm sorry, I mean,\" the vampire said, sounding more than flustered. \"Just let me go and we're...all good here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Well that sounds <i>five by five</i> to me...\" Faith smiled before snapping an axe kick forcefully down onto her foe's unsuspecting head. He let out a groan as he crumpled to the dirty ground. In the blink of an eye, she used her leather boot to pin his squirming body firmly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanna live, huh?\" Faith chuckled nastily at her beaten opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...yes!\" Cried out the vamp, clearly desperate to live, such was his lack of fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can live...if you kiss my boot.\" Faith winked and grinned as she lowered her other boot so it was positioned just over his face. You couldn't see the sole of the boot from where you were, but you imagined clumps of earth and tufts of grass adorning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" The vampire groaned. However, his voice was meek, indicating that he probably had little pride left. This proved true as he pushed his mouth against her boot, choking a little on what was presumably dirt that had fallen down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee...thanks!\" Faith giggled. Just as the vampire let out a sigh of relief, with lightning speed, she suddenly drew a stake and dusted him rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth hung open as you witnessed this dominance. From the vamp kissing her boot to staking him...you could not help but feel completely besotted with this goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later suckers!\" Faith chuckled to herself as she picked up her stake and began stalking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" You cried as another vampire dashed at her from behind. Racing over, you quickly muttered the incantation for a pyro-creating spell to completely inflame the vamp. Staggering around, he screamed in agony but was dust in just a few seconds. Faith watched open-eyed at first the pile of dust that could have killed her, then at you, standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you said, a touch awkwardly, being rather starstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she replied, her expression unreadable...</span></div></div>",

And why you, like, gettin' in my way?\" She said challengingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a mixture of arousal and frustration. Having potentially just saved this girl's life, her menacing tone and raised stake seemed rather unnecessary! Still, any act of aggression or combativeness from her made you undeniably in awe of this beauty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a warlock. I didn't mean to get in your way - I was only trying to help,\" you stated reasonably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warlock, huh? You into all that magic and shit? One of B's little geek pals is into that stuff. Total loser!\" Faith snickered, though you were sure you detected a slightly resentful look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Faith-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just call me?\" Her tone was soft but dangerous as she interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I mean...you see, I, er...\" You babbled as she shook her head at you in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, like, stalkin' me? Hey - I know everyone's gonna get their kicks an' all. But, that's kinda weird, <i>warlock</i>.\" She emphasised this last word with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even reply, Faith suddenly launched a barrage of punches and kicks at you. Being a supremely proficient fighter, you were able to block and parry each blow with relative ease, though you had to admit that your reflexes had never quite been tested like this before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" you said firmly, grabbing both of her hands and twisting them behind her back so they were locked together. \"I'm not here to fight you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, goody for you. But, I am...\" Faith panted as she somehow performed a back flip, wrenching free from you, then extended one leg fully to kick you sharply in the ribs. \"What can I say? I just love a good fight! You got some mad skills. Show me some more!\" Faith grinned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to continue this fight; it was certainly erotic exchanging blows and making physical contact with this powerful slayer. But was it time to make your intentions clear and kneel before her? There was also a chance that your instincts could take over and cause you to lose your temper...the idea of hurting or damaging this goddess was a no no!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless you would be cautious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful what you wish for Faith.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith grins and launches another swift kick at you.  This time you were ready and instead of blocking you put a bit of magic into the palm of your hand and released compressed air toward the charging Slayer.  The air hit her and launched her back 10 feet.  Faith landed beautifully and rolled back up to her feet and dashed toward you with surprising speed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charge another blast of air that she slides under it unexpectedly.  Rising up to her knees her fist races up toward your unprotected manhood and you hastily twist your leg into the path and take the punch on the thigh.  It stings but it isn't disastrous.  You counter with a hip check that knocks the slayer onto her back.  She flip kicks back to her feet into a fighting stance and you circle her warily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long have you been stalkin' me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question catches you off guard and the wily girl uses the time you were taking to come up with a response to hurl a stake at you.  You deflect it out of the air and she launches a swift jump kick toward you.  You spin to the side with just enough time, her boot was a centimeter from connecting with you.  Backing away from her you bring more magic into play and roots erupt from the ground attempting to grapple the girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dodges one but another manages to snag her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck off of me!\"  She yells and uses her free boot to break the root.  She snarls at you and races toward you.  With your ability to use magic she needed to get in close quickly.  She was no novice to battle and clearly saw that her only chance was to get into hand to hand combat with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to meet her charge hoping to surprise her.  You lash out with your magic attempting to shove her legs out from under her but with startling agility she sees your hand and twists in mid air avoiding the compressed air. She lands right next to you and a sharp elbow comes straight for your face.  You block the elbow but her superior strength causes you to stumble back awkwardly.  She presses her advantage with a vicious punch to your chest.  Off balance you still mange to block her attack successfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows is a rapid close quarters martial arts duel.  You can't get the breathing room needed to channel your magic and she isn't letting up.  Her stamina was amazing and despite the excellent shape you were in clearly superior to yours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had some spells that could put the hurt on her but you would never want to inflict such damage on the object of your affection.  On the other hand if this kept you might actually lose.  And Faith may do you in like she did the vamp.  Suddenly and without mercy!  </span></div></div>",

Always do in the end!\" She smirked as she slapped your face so hard, following it up immediately with a backfist to your nose - so hard that you nearly felt it break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling before this gorgeous woman, pain ricocheting through most of your body, any fight seemed to evaporate away, especially after she kicked you viciously twice in the ribs, you were sure at least one broke!

Your arms limply hanging at your sides, your will to fight back completely gone, you cringed but secretly felt more aroused than ever. Images of the vampire Faith had forced to kiss her boot just a few minutes ago entered your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss it,\" she ordered with authority, confirming your dark prediction of a fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitement pulsed through your veins; now she was exerting your dominance on you, you felt like a piece of putty in her hands. You could even feel a bit of wood forming in your pants, despite the throbbing pain still there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou puckered your lips to kiss at the sole of her boot, tasting dirt and other unpleasant aromas from the ground. Humiliation built inside you, especially with her scornful laughter, but you could not deny this dangerous beauty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, loser,\" She laughed nastily before retracting her dirty boot from your mouth. \"Now, how best to put you out of your misery...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up into her dark, wild eyes, you considered your options.

Yeah you're right,\" she quickly moved on...\"I AM a goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just let me serve you - I'll do anything you want me to!

Buffy Summers on the other hand was a snarky kind-hearted warrior of the light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to try the same thing you did with  Faith.  You would follow Buffy until she encountered some vampires and the you would spring out and help her deal with the trash.  This time you should be able to give a good impression and then you'll be in.  You cast a spell that made you blend in with your surroundings and a second one to quiet any slight noises you made while you stalked the young Slayer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to wait long.  This close to the Hell Mouth meant that vampires were drawn to it like moths to a flame.  Sure enough you saw a trio of vampires rush toward the blonde slayer.  Buffy instantly turned and staked one like it was nothing.  You quickly sprang into action - you had to be quick or she would take them all out!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire a blast of compressed air at one of the vampire's legs and he stumbles down hard.  In an instant you are there and are driving a stake into his back quickly dusting him.  You turn and see Buffy duel the other vampire who quickly goes down a stomp to his foot followed by a one two punch combination that ends with Buffy staking the vampire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at you warily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou incline your head slightly.  \"I'm a friend.  There is a prophecy that you must listen to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prophecy?  Does that make you a prophet?  Because you look a bit too modern to be some crazy bearded guy in furs like they normally are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile wryly you liked the girl.  It wouldn't save her but you would feel regret when Faith had you murder her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I then speak to thee like thus?  Ye will fine it tiresome.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god no, go back, go back!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Listen well Slayer.\"  You were lying through your teeth of course.  There was no prophecy this was all just a ploy to get in close with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of what should be one will emerge to fight the immortal.  Strength is not enough.  Magic will show the way for two to be one again.  If the Slayer heeds not the words the pit that never closes will vomit forth the dead un-ending.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked at you.  \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \"Prophecies are vague but I believe I know some of it.  You must heed my words and I will bring the magic that will show the way.  The pit that never closes is probably the Hell Mouth.  That's all I know.\"  You shrug, \"Prophecies sure can be annoying huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you had the Slayer fooled but did you?  </span></div></div>",

You felt confident; although you had allowed Faith to get the better of you, a mere vampire would offer little fight surely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Came a deep voice from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning round, you stared at the tall, dark and admittedly handsome man. With his carefully gelled hair and deep set eyes, this was him alright: Angel - the vampire with a soul!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angel. The vampire who lost his fangs,\" you replied smirking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who I am. And by the way, I can still bite...\" Angel used his super strength to grasp you by your coat, attempting to throw you against the wall. \"I said: who the hell are you?\" He repeated, his handsome face morphing into that of an evil, hideous-looking creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you - I'm you, well I will be soon...\" You said ominously before ducking down and sweeping Angel's legs so he tumbled to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt refreshing to battle with an opponent without fear of hurting them, or pissing them off. As Angel struggled to his feet, you unleashed a brutal array of punches, expertly directed at his mid section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarling, the vampire backed quickly away to recover. \"Look, I don't know what your problem is, but this isn't a fight you wanna be in, boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling you 'boy' was a mistake on his part; lunging forward you planted a swift kick to his thigh, followed by a sharp jab to his forehead, knocking him back to the ground. To your surprise, he managed to roll out of the way of your descending knee, quickly punching you in the chin and ribs in quick succession. Still, it didn't deter you for long; parrying another one of his blows, you kneed him hard in the gut, forcing him to stagger back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith says hi, by the way.\" You grin at him before smashing him sharply in the face, rendering him unconsious. You felt a surge of pride at mentioning your beloved's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, you dragged Angel's body into position, closed the entrance, then began setting about your work. The form-adoption spell was a complex one. Quickly laying out all the ingredients and potions, you muttered all of the incantations and began to feel yourself shudder a little. It was working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued....were you able to complete the spell successfully or did something go wrong?</span></div></div>",

All went dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later - it was hard to tell how long exactly - you awoke on the hard ground, feeling strangely different. Glancing around, the first thing you noticed was your own body lying opposite you. What the...?! Of course! You had swapped bodies with Angel! Rising to your feet you quickly began looking for a mirror. Not being able to find one, you used your phone to hold the camera lens in front of you. When you saw nothing other than Angel's crypt on the screen, you first thought you had turned invisible! Then it hit you - vampires don't have a reflection! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your hands to feel your clothes, carefully gelled hair and face, you reasoned that the change had been successful. Concentrating hard on showing your \"vamp face\" enabled you to run a finger gingerly along your fangs and feel the bumpy forehead and other facial distortions, which came with vampire transformation. It had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully moving your actual body (which must now inhabit an unconscious Angel), you performed a series of simple spells - charms, and protections to wrap the body tightly in chains, seal it over firmly over with various layers, then stow it away safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your work, you ventured out of the crypt and towards Buffy's house. As you got there, it was clear that no one was in - no lights on, not even a car there.

That should be easily enough time to pass on information to Faith, before striking at the right time to kill this seemingly innocent woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" She sighed. Giles has had enough of Wes and has headed home, that doofus is out with Cordy somewhere. Willow and Oz are at her place...not sure about Xander. So yeah, we're alone,\" she smiled before pulling you in for another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this undercover mission had a few perks after all! You allowed Buffy's gentle, yet firm tongue push and swirl around your mouth; you felt her heart beat increase as she snuggled into your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her head back and gave you a slight frown. \"But I'm guessing you're here for business...\" She rolled her eyes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.\" You decided it best to get straight to your mission.

Man was she cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nothing new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she sighed. \"I mean, it was only the other day that Wilkins got his hands on the box of Gavron...Gabrok...uh, whatever. It's like, the ascension can't be too far away, Prom is only around the corner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forgot how young and immature she was at heart. Not much more than a kid, yet so much more! Like Faith, being a slayer seemed to have embedded an intangible sexiness and grace about her. It was helped that like Faith she was smoking hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no news then?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at you, this time more seriously. 'Yeah. I told you that.

You weren't quite at the physical level of your original body, but not far off at all! Would you have bloodlust? Would you need blood or could you eat food? As soon as the sun had set, you tested this - eating food did nothing for you at all.

They would have to back off with other people around! Then again, you may have given up your powers, but you still knew some moves.

I was unable to defeat them and they turned me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh that bites for you.  Heh, get it?  Well I do have to stake you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Goddess please!  I still want to serve you and I need to warn you that my sires are going to be coming after you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed which caused her breasts to do very interesting things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think some vamp bitches scare me?  Do you know how jazzed I am on your magic right now?  I could take down hundreds without breaking a sweat!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably true.  She already had great fighting skills, Slayer strength, Slayer speed and Slayer stamina.  Add your magic to it and she was probably one of the deadliest fighters on the planet.  Combined with her natural beauty and confidence she truly was a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I understand Goddess.  I still wish to serve you in any capacity you want me to.  I know I'm a vampire and I no longer have magic but I would love to be at your beck and call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are a freaky one.  Hmm a Slayer having a vampire minion around.  Interesting concept.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour undead eyes shone with hope...  </span></div></div>",

How abouts I'm the person who you need to totally get away from before she hurts you. As from now,\" she said firmly, a look of resoluteness about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel gennuinely in awe of his confident young woman.

Rolling to the side, you grabbed a jagged looking branch and threw it at her. Parrying this easily, the girl leapt in the air, somersaulting as she landed behind you.

Yes you didn't have magic anymore but on the other hand you were now gifted with faster reflexes, more stamina and greater strength.  You had been off your game ever since losing your magic and yet you were still supremely skilled in combat.  The problem had been confidence and that realization made you find your center and put up your guard in a classical judo stance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy dusted herself off.  \"Bad move vamp.  I don't know how to deal with Faith right now but I'm sure my friends will have an idea.  In the mean time I got to make sure you don't warn her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed toward you and lashed out with a punch.  You popped your hand up to block and then grab the sleeve of her jacket.  You twist and push into her guard and use her own forward motion against her to send her spinning away from you.  You return to your stance as Buffy leaps back to her feet and comes at you with a barrage of kicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back from one and dodge to the side for another.  She lashes out with a back-fist that  you duck and send your own strike toward her.  She moves to block and you let her so that you can grab her arm.  You pull her towards you and she tries to hit you with her other arm but you were already moving underneath and to the side while rotating her arm.  In a flash she flips head first and slams into the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeating her wasn't that easy however.  Even though she had just taken a heavy slam she was still the Slayer.  Without missing a beat she flips back to her feet and comes at you again.  You duck a punch, flip her again and then get forced to accept a bruising kick to your arm that you couldn't quite get away from.  Her speed was killer and her strength was greater than your own despite being a vampire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does look a bit more worried though as the fight drags on.  You snarl at her displaying your fangs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Slayer don't tell me one lone vampire has you worried?

A split second later, Kaitlin's sharp fingernails clawed and lashed out against your cheeks, lacerating your flesh and causing blood to spill onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying in pain, you dropped face-first to the ground, your lower lip cracking as it connected with the rough, stony surface, hard. Despite the pain, you accepted this beating; you had been fool enough to let your lust for Faith get the better of you. Now you were paying the price!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding pain shot through your spine as Emily walked on your back, taking care to tread firmly onto it with her boots. She repeated this, leaving you scrabbling around, face down on the ground, in too much agony to wrench yourself up. A pool of blood from your face and mouth swirled a little around you...yet you didn't feel any more dropping from your face. Of course - as a vampire you had healing properties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain in your side interrupted your thoughts as you let out another agonised cry. The two sexy, deadly vampires took it in turns to aim vicious kicks at your sides, your legs, your shoulders...until you were nothing more than a whimpering wreck, snivelling on the floor, clutching at one of their boots in an attempt to end the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please,\" you murmured. \"I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you truly were - they were your sires: your superiors...from now on you wouldn't dare disobey them, even if it involved Faith! The physical punishment stopped from several seconds, allowing your automatic healing properties to slowly start taking effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok dog. You've had your punishment...and now...\" Emily paused, deliberately, as if for dramatic effect...</span></div></div>",

You stuck out your tongue and took your first lick of sweaty foot.  Your tongue recoils from the taste.

Don't by shy lick like you mean it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper, sounding much like a dog and try to resist the command.  This was disgusting, vile and repulsive.

You're ours - mine and Kaitlin's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply couldn't help it.

What the hell you doin' here witch boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down quickly before her, you held out the beautiful toe ring in your hand. Its diamond caused her to gasp involuntarily as you kept your head bowed in clear submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess Faith - please accept my humble offering. This toe ring allows a barrier to form around and protect you. I have chosen a toe ring as it is symbolic - it shows that I am beneath you, metaphorically and literally as a mere servant. I want to serve you, worship you and grovel before you.\" And with that you leaned forward and planted several meek kisses onto her boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I was like, totally not expecting that. I knew you were freakin' weird...but yeah.\" Faith seemed a little lost for words, not something either of you were accustomed to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please just accept my gift. I will show you how it works.\"'with some effort you lifted your head back and positioned the ring carefully in your thumb and forefinger. \"May I...?\" You asked more than a touch nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Whatever.\" Faith slipped off a boot flicked a bare foot back slightly so the toes were off the ground. The smell of damp leather mixed in with her foot sweat made you even more humble than before.  Noticing that she was clearly interested in seeing the effect of your offering, you ploughed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She suddenly snapped at you. Manoeuvring her jagged, brutal knife, she aimed it directly at your head. \"One false move and I drop this through your brains.\" She said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping a little, you carefully slipped the ring on to the toe adjacent to the big one. A slightly damp sweatiness nestled on to you hand, making you feel admittedly aroused. Once it was pushed firmly on (you were mightily relieved it fit!) you explained how to activate it, with a chosen word (Kakistos was her puzzling choice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wicked cool! Man this is gonna come in handy.\" She grinned, twirling around a little to admire both the ring and the protective bubble that emanated from it on your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" you breathed, still on your knees. Stopping her movements she paused, considering you for a moment. What would the beatiful dark-eyed slayer decide to do with you now?</span></div></div>",

Frankly until you saw Faith you had never wanted to submit yourself to someone else.  Sure role-playing every now and then for fun was a diversion but primarily your sexual history involved regular sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh well Goddess Faith I'm aware of it but I haven't done much.  No one has ever been as worthy as you to be worshiped and obeyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn witch boy you do have it bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a smirk.  \"All right you seem useful and I'm diggin the magical ring so I'll let you get your rocks off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart hammered in your chest.

You kissed her slightly slick feet, not caring at all that they were sweaty.  This was your Goddess's scent, this was your Master's scent.  You rained down kisses on her pale gorgeous feet.  You caressed her soles with your tongue and gently sucked on each succulent toe.  You took extra time on the toe that held your gift, marveling at the dichotomy in tastes between metal, diamond and sweet flesh.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith looked down and snickered, \"You look so pathetic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and praise her some more.  \"All look pathetic compared to you Goddess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barked out a laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou uneasily asked, \"If it makes you uncomfortable I can stop Goddess.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah its Five by Five.  It actually feels nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joyfully continue your worshipful adoration of your Goddess's feet.  You cannot remember ever being happier.  Not only did your Goddess accept you and appreciate your gift she enjoyed the touch of your mouth on her feet.  This was a very promising start to your relationship as Faith's slave!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to lick her perfect feet, cleansing them all of sweat.  You must have planted thousands of kisses before Faith finally says, \"All right that's enough witch boy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly stop and look up.  Does your Goddess have another command for you?  </span></div></div>",

In a blink of an eye, she roughly shoved you to the floor, causing you to slide along the wooden tiles until your head crashed into the wall. Despite the pain, you didn't show an ounce of defiance, such was your eagerness to please your goddess. She could do whatever she wanted to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping down onto the floor, Faith sat down so she was directly opposite you. Extending her sexy legs out, she hovered both bare soles over your face before slowly pushing them forward. You winced a little but merely grunted: it was an honour to be used in this foot-stool like manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...Goddess...I'm glad my face is of...good use!\" You said in a raspy voice, your breathing more than a tad compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith laughed evilly. \"So pathetic! And yeah it is of good use thanks. It would be of better use if you just shut the fuck up already.\" Exerting more pressure with her bare feet, you felt your nose being squashed, her strong, heady foot scent seeping into your brain. Your lip split under the strength of her feet, forcing you to taste the coppery tinged blood that dribbled into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your face is just made for my feet; this feels wicked good!\" Faith chuckled. The fact that she was clearly enjoying herself made you feel a strange swelling of pride. But you remembered not to say anything - you just grunted in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pain receded a touch as Faith pulled her feet back. You literally had a couple of seconds to gasp in some oxygen, before the dark-haired beauty smashed her soles into your face so hard that you nearly felt your jaw dislocate itself. Such was her strength that your body slid down to the point that you were practically lying down. Only your head was at a slight right angle. You may have had magical skills and fighting abilities, but these were not helping you in the slightest right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for some more, foot boy?\" Faith grinned as she retracted her feet, hovering her soles near your fave again, while you nodded weakly. This time however, she didn't thrust both feet forward. Instead, she used one bare foot to slap hard against your right cheek, sending a stinging pain richochet throughout your face. A similar slap to your left cheek to her other foot made you groan in pain. Faith repeated this several times over, until your face felt raw and bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What d'ya say, loser? Are my feet too strong for you - have you had enough already?\" She stared challenging at you, her bright eyes dancing with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is a test; you have to prove your worth...</i> You told yourself, trying your hardest to ignore the pain cascading throughout you. You felt so disorientated, to the point that you considered casting a subtle healing spell. But would Faith notice this; was it worth risking it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision became almost fully obscured as both sexy, silky smooth soles were forced once more into your whining face, the toes practically digging into your eyes. This pain was getting too much for you - would you withstand it or cast the spell instead?</span></div></div>",

Instead you would try a minor healing spell - it wouldn't be much but it might save your face from caving in from her relentless barrage!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your will as her toe pokes you in the eye and a flash of green flares up as your magic swirls out of control.

Then again, that was her prerogative; she was in charge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith had some definite ideas... She lifted up one long leg, twisting it in mid air before pushing firmly forward so that her bare foot was forced against your neck. You winced as your hand automatically began to move towards her foot, before remembering that any sign of defiance would only infuriate her further. Instead you stayed slumped against the tombstone, your face shaking from the pressure that the dark-haired slayer was exerting upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, witch boy - let my foot choke you out! Take it like a man!\" She sniggered as she scrunched her toes sharply into your skin, causing several splurts of blood to gus out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were becoming increasingly oxygen-deprived. Feeling your heart pounding with irregularity in your chest, you found yourself gasping and practically pleading with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...goddess...please!\" You mewled up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, wimp. I've only just started...\" With that, the beautiful, deadly girl removed her foot suddenly, before smashing it with tremendous force against your trembling face. To most men, this would have either killed or rendered them immediately unconsious. Luckily you were no ordinary man; then again, perhaps being knocked out would be preferable to this abuse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet you couldn't deny how much you enjoyed being at her mercy, even if it meant experiencing intense pain! As her foot forced its way squarely against your nose, you felt it break instantly, hot blood dribbling out of it, into your mouth. Whimpering, you managed to stay awake, just!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I just love the sound of bones breaking under my feet! I'll give you this witch-boy, you got some wicked stamina. Let's see if you can take this...\" She said in an ominous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling back several steps, you found it difficult to breathe at all, considering your nose was broken. Spluttering and choking with haziness clouding your vision, you could still make out your goddess moving with rapidity towards you, a leg curled back before shooting it forward so that her bare foot hooked upwards. It was as if she was punting a football out of the park; grunting with her effort at you, your quivering face absorbed the blow with so much force that it snapped back, shattering the tombstone behind you as the stone crumbled into smaller pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlat on your back now, bits of debris all over you, you felt such sheer pain practically shaking your face. You coughed up blood and moaned in absolute agony; it was a miracle that your head was still attached to your neck, given how powerful her punt kick was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering over to you, her countenance showed no concern or remorse - there was only triumph there. As you stared bleakly up at you, she placed one foot on your chest in a victory pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow - you're still awake! I once like decapitated-or-whatever a vamp with that move!\" She scrunched her toes against your trembling pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even form any words at this stage; a darkness was circling over you, making you so groggy that passing out from the pain you were in was becoming rather imminent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with her sole placed on your chest, her hands on her hips with a smirk on her face, your divine but dangerous goddess let out a giggle, as though she had just thought of what to do with you next...</span></div></div>",

I can still get some use out of you before it's lights out! And let's face it, this is totally gonna seem like a reward to a freak like you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping down to the ground, so that she was sitting around your crotch and belly area, your dark goddess pushed her legs forward until both bare soles were hovering over your weary face. It was hard to focus clearly, given your exhaustion, yet you could make out how slender and sexy her powerful soles appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to lick my feet clean!\" She laughed at you, her nose wrinkling in such a cute way. \"You've made me work out wicked hard...I've got shit loads of dirt, grass, mud...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking groggily, your wooziness started to subside a little, enough for you to properly focus on bare soles that were dominating your view. You gulped; they looked completely filthy! Still, the idea of getting to serve your incredibly hot, deadly mistress was so tempting, so appealing to you that you found your tongue pop out. The fact that they were dirty was not an issue to you - if anything, it made you feel even more pathetic and subservient to this wonderful woman. If it empowered her in any way, then you would be more than willing to provide this service for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your tongue at the bottom of her heel, you dragged your tongue up, colliding with bits of dirt and earth, which caused you to gag involuntarily. Quickly ignoring this, in case your spluttering displeased her, you swallowed the mud and proceeded to sliding your tongue up meekly, soaking up her foot sweat amongst the other unpleasant things clinging to her foot. Gazing up at your goddess, you felt so grateful to be licking her gorgeous soles: all of the foot slapping to the face, your nose being broken, the blood spilled from you...it was all infinitely worth it to be in this position!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a bad foot licker, witch-boy!\" Faith chuckled. \"Maybe after fights I can get you to lick my boots or my feet clean...y'know what would be wicked cool: I could fight barefoot every time from now on, knowing that you will lick all the dirt and crap off 'em. How does that sound to you, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart almost erupted with joy; she had called you \"slave\"! This was your aim, your goal...she seemed to finally accept you as being a worthy slave...the idea of worshipping this beautiful dark-eyed goddess on a regular basis, you actually felt a swelling in your pants, despite the loss of blood you had suffered tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I take that as a yes!\" She giggled, pressing her feet lightly against your face as if to remind you to continue your licking. You did of course, lapping away with vigour and enthusiasm, spurred on by the fact that you had been referred to as her slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing tufts of grass as well as clods of dirt, you were not deterred as your tongue raced up and down, sideways, diagonally, such was your eagerness to soak up every conceivable thing from her bare feet. Still, you could see an imprint of dirt etched on her left foot; you made a particular effort to scrape and swoosh your tongue on this particular section, loving every moment of this task - no matter how demeaning - was just so intensely arousing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I could get used to this,\" Faith sighed. \"My feet feel totally fresh...you ain't bad at all witch-boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you murmured up at her, finally a bit more awake. Licking her feet seemed to be rejuvenate you! As you kept licking away, Faith suddenly hopped up to her feet, one foot on the ground, while the other rested over your nose and mouth. It was more awkward to lick away from this position, but you were able to still poke and prod meekly up with your grateful tongue...what did your goddess have in store for you next?  </span></div></div>",

As your goddess kicked her boots off and slinked over to the leather couch, you gulped, feeling like a teenage kid on his first date with the girl of his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked cool here, huh? Wilkins really hooked me up good - you shoulda seen the last shithole I was livin' in!\" She snorted a little, as if to indicate that she had moved on well from this. \"Anyway, c'mere slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped to your knees and begin to crawl, almost gliding along the oak panelled-floor. Man you were so lucky to be in this position: your true place as Faith's devoted slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am yours to command, oh divine goddess!\" You breathed lustfully up at her. Your face throbbed with pain; the beating Faith had inflicted upon you was still very much with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you, like, always had the hots for powerful women?\" She asked you, a curious expression on her gorgeous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No - no!\" You gasped. \"Only you! The moment I saw you, I just knew I had to serve and dedicate my life to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me crack up!\" She giggled, using a sexy bare foot to ruffle your hair, almost with affection. Her demeanour changed suddenly, as her toes began to scrunch sharply into your head, forcing you to lower your head to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a slave - my slave. I call the shots. When I need ya, you come a runnin'. Do exactly what I tell you and I will reward you. In fact, I might just give you a lil treat for taking all my blows tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the hot brunette lifted her legs up and deftly wriggled her black leather pants off, revealing her black, lacy panties. Such a glorious sight made you whimper like a puppy dog, presented with a particularly juicy bone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Thought you would like that!\" She smirked, before swivelling around so that her rear was just in front of your whining face. Jesus Christ! Her ass was so damn perfect... So flawless as she wiggled it in your face, her butt cheeks revealed just enough under the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...goddess...!\" You sighed as you ploughed your nose into it, soaking in the fragrant, yet sweaty aroma that emanated from her bottom. You were immediately admonished with a hard slap to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - don't get greedy!\" She said disapprovingly, before turning again to give you the full face view of her ass. After several seconds of you licking your lips and gazing lovingly at her behind, she continued. \"Now you may kiss my ass, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even hesitate as you leaned forwards, puckering up with passion. Kissing her ass felt so good - not just because it was so sexy and perfect but because this was symbolic: kissing her ass to cement your status as a lowly slave, completely beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...thank you, g-goddess!\" You moaned out in ecstasy in between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an ass-kisser!\" She chuckled. \"Ok, that's enough for now,\" she said in a satisfied tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whined but knew far better than to even consider complaining to your mistress, your superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know what slave...it's kinda hot in here, doncha think?\" Not trying hard to suppress a mocking grin, she stared at you. \"Go on then - take 'em off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compiled immediately, stripping to your boxers, while Faith observed you with amusement on her beautiful face, still in her tight white vest top and panties. When you were done, she chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better - any slave of mine shouldn't need to wear more than his underwear!\" Faith was loving this surge of power she was feeling with every domiinant act over you.

Buffy's face is full of righteous indignation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gone too far Faith.  How could you side with Mayor Wilkins?  You've betrayed everyone and for what?  Money?  A nice apartment?  You make me sick!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh B you just made a big mistake,\" Faith snarls as she flips back to her feet.

You watched the fight with mixed emotions.  On the one hand you were worried for your Goddess but on the other hand you were excited to watch her in action!  Her movements were incredibly fluid.  She was wild and difficult to predict as she lashed out with surprise attacks that soon had the older Slayer on the defensive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gave a cry of alarm as a vicious kick from Faith slammed her against the wall.  Faith came in to finish it but Buffy hadn't survived for three years as a Slayer for nothing.  She caught Faith's arm and twisted it to the side while hammering her elbow into her face.  Faith went sprawling to the ground.  Buffy didn't press the advantage though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a Slayer!  How could you turn bad?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith got up and snarled.  \"You don't know what it is like working with the Watchers.

Fuck you B, you're fucking dead!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith and Buffy continued their clash.  If Faith won - wonderful!

With a flurry of fists, Buffy rammed and thumped with so much force against Faith's face, forcing a yelp of pain to escape her lips. Lashing out again, the blonde Slayer swivelled before pulling of an impressive roundhouse kick, connecting with back of her rival's head; your goddess slumped down to the apartment floor, clutching her head and moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do something! Launching forward, your instincts took over as you unleashed a ball of energy directly at Buffy's chest, sending her shooting backwards, taking out a mirror on the wall in the process and shattering it to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..? Who the hell are you?\" Buffy glared up at you, the wind knocked out of her sails somewhat. There was a mixture of confusion and anger on her face - the former most likely due to the fact that you were in nothing but your boxers still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off, Slayer - agree to leave Faith alone and leave her apartment. Then I'll have no other reason to hurt you,\" you stated calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly the wrong thing to say; Buffy practically snarled as she performed a neat kip up. Rushing over to you, she snapped a kick across Faith's face, sending her crashing to the ground once more. As she readied an attack, you shot another ball of energy at her, however, the speed at which this Slayer was moving negated your attack. She prowled through it, then kicked you in the ribs, winding you, before punching you straight in your already-broken nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood gushed out of you as you cried out in agony and dropped to your knees. Taking advantage of this, Buffy swiped your cheek with her boot, knocking you firmly down to the ground. In a blink of an eye, Faith was on her, locking her fingers around Buffy's slender waist, then slamming her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking idiot, B. Never turn your back on your enemy!\" She  said in raspy voice, clearly still a bit winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an idiot, really? Would an idiot do...<i>this</i>?\" Buffy retorted as she flipped Faith over, sending her sprawling across the wooden floor until her head made contact with the wall with a resounding crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're this lunatic's plaything, huh?\" Buffy called across at you, as she held a stake just over your goddess' chest. \"You better get ready to say goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" You gasped, wrenching yourself to your feet and moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there. One more move and I'll totally slay her!\" The blonde girl had a look of absolute resoluteness on her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's bl-bluffing!\" Faith murmured weakly, though even she didn't sound entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" you said desperately, holding your hands up to indicate surrender. \"Just let her go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, when you lie face down on the floor and let me take her out of here. I'll let her go when she's either at the police station or with the Watcher's Council!\" She said firmly. \"Oh and don't try one of your little spells - the moment I see something coming towards me, will be the very second that my hand drives this stake into your lover's heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lover?\" Faith spat. \"Gimme a break, B. You're full of shit. You ain't killin' no one...\" She was remonstrated with a backhand fist from Buffy, making her groan out in obvious pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever the hell you are - turn around, lie down with your face on the floor and wait for us to go. Do it quickly or my hand might start getting a little slippy!\" Buffy shouted at you, becoming clearly impatient now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on your knees, you knew that you had to be extremely careful here - if Buffy wasn't bluffing and ended up killing your goddess, your life would be pointless, futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of your eye, you saw the shattered fragments of Faith's mirror on the floor. As these were not in the blonde slayer's direct field of vision, you could perform a subtle object manipulation spell...if she didn't see it coming, it would hit her directly as she was blocking Faith from that angle. It could even kill her! Was that a bit too risky? After a few more seconds of deliberating, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

You aim the shards so they strike her stake arm causing her to lose her grip on it.  The force the mirror slashing into her arm causes Buffy to flinch away from Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take no chances you summon a ball of fire to your hand and send it streaking toward Buffy.  Buffy, wounded, surprised and bleeding was still able to contort her body to the side.  You hadn't dared use this spell against Faith but you had no such qualms about it with her rival Slayer.  You detonate the ball of fire right as it passes by Buffy, making her dodge only partially helpful.  It explodes into a fireball that expands with terrible heat and power.  Buffy's right side suffered some nasty burns and the explosion sent her sailing into the opposite wall.  She landed with an ugly crash and you could see that her left arm was probably broken from the crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a master warlock.  Your spells made you the equal of any Vampire and most of the other dangerous monsters of the world.  You had been holding back against Faith for fear of harming.  You unleash a word of power and darts of pure energy streak toward the wounded Slayer who had to desperately roll away from them.  If the darts had struck home they would have went right through her, as it was they had gone right through the floor and wall of Faith's apartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Faith no within the direct line of fire you use a modified version of your compressed air spell to hurl the coffee table, chair and desk at the blond Vampire Slayer.  Wounded as she was Buffy couldn't quite avoid the massive furniture hurled at ridiculous speeds.  The chair crashed against her leg and she went down hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith had stood up and you took in a deep breath.  You had expended quite a bit of magic here but now Buffy was down with multiple broken bones and a nasty burn.   You had not only saved your Goddess but you had brought low he rival.  You were already thinking about how Faith might reward you... </span></div></div>",

Faith leans in close and says.  \"Whatcha gonna do now B?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy tries to speak but Faith isn't in the mood.  She releases her grip and Buffy stumbles to the ground painfully.  Faith leans back and then kicks her hard across the face, shattering her nose.

Always getting in my business.  Well it ain't going to happen anymore!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith straddles the weakened Buffy and begins to slam punch after punch in her sister Slayer's face.  Buffy is crying out raggedly and tries to push her off with her hands and arms.

I'm the one who gets her kicks from beatin' up B, not you!\" She spat at you, her toes clamped tightly over your skin so you were forced to gurgle and splutter in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was only...helping...!\" You squealed up at her, feeling your face contort with the pressure she was exerting upon you. A sense of injustice intermingled with the pain you were in; if it wasn't for you, Faith could well be unconscious or even dead by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith retracted her foot, only to smash it into your mouth, chipping several teeth and making you cough up some of your own blood. \"I can handle myself,\" she raged at you. \"I don't need anyone to fight my battles. Y'hear me? You're my slave - you're supposed to serve me - do something useful and tie the blonde bitch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Goddess was clearly rattled, and you did not dare infuriate her even further. Perhaps the fact that you had achieved something which she had apparently failed to do thus far had struck a nerve. Yes, you took down Buffy - clearly and categorically! Maybe she was suspicious of how much power you possessed, as if she feared you turning on her at some point.... Or it could be that you were reading to much into this! You mused over this as you  found some unused cables, twisting them firmly together so that both of Buffy's arms and legs were bound. Wheezing, the force of her foot had made you more than a touch giddy. Not to mention your aching jaw, which felt like it was about to drop off, along with your bloody mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done yet?\" Faith barked at you, walking over and standing over with her arms crossed, a stubborn look adorning her beautiful face. She truly was a picture of perfection - standing there in her tight white vest top, panties...sexy bare legs and feet on show...it took an effort from you not to crawl over and beg to worship her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Goddess,\" you replied humbly, completing the tying up of her nemesis, who was groaning a little as she lay beaten on the apartment floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith grunted. Standing directly over her fallen foe, a sadistic smile spread over her lips. \"So here we are, B. No super friends around to save you. Just you and me. And who won, who's better? ME! I told you that you weren't in my league - it was embarrassin' that you even bothered showin' up here!\" She said gloatingly, aiming a stiff kick to Buffy's ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel under-appreciated again, yet you said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what shall we do with little miss Buffy...

It wouldn't be long until she would recover - at least there was nothing this blonde Slayer could do to hurt either of you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's your lucky day. I've got just the thing you can, which would totally, like, prove your loyalty or whatever to me.\" She smiled seductively at you, a bare foot sliding down her leg. The suspense was almost too much for you, though at the same time, an uneasy feeling had begun to spread to your gut. She was building this up into something pretty major: it was unlikely to be an easy task!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to kill Buffy for me. Then we're totally five-by-five,\" she stated calmly, though she bit her lip, as if in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill...Buffy?\" You asked her, not wanting to believe your ears. Sure you had killed before, but it had always been demons, villains - creatures that you had ridden from this world. You had never killed an innocent, a human. Plus, Buffy was helpless...it would be more than a despicable act - were you capable of something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, slave? You not ready to prove yourself?\" Faith said, rolling her eyes and flicking her dark brown hair behind her head. It settled in a tousle around her face, giving her a rather wild, almost feral look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't...you do it?\" You gulped at her, regretting such a request instantly when Faith lashed out with a slap across your cheeks. Your face stung, yet you accepted the fact that it was rather foolish to speak up to your Goddess like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell do you think you are? You're a fucking slave! Well, you say you are - I'm startin' to think that you're all talk. You ain't gonna be of any use to me if you can't follow my orders. Now bow down, kiss my foot and do what I tell you!\" She said in a thunderous tone, causing you to drop instantly to your knees in surrender. With quivering lips, you placed a meek kiss on top of her soft foot, tasting her salty sweat drop into your open mouth. Trying to steel yourself, you moved towards where Buffy is laying helplessly on the ground. This was it: your chance to prove once and for all to the gorgeous Faith that you were a worthy slave; you could even get rewarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning up your energies, you prepare to release a shard of energy, which would basically make its way towards Buffy's heart, killing her in seconds. You had used a similar variation - in wooden, splintery form to stake vampires before. You were certain it would work, just as you began to mutter a quick incantation, the blonde Slayer looked wearily up at you, a look of earnestness and innocence on her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... you're not a killer. Not like her,\" she croaked up at you, wincing with the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it slave...\" Faith said threateningly, after lashing out with a firm kick to Buffy's side. \"You've got one chance - do it now and do it right. Or that's it - you'll be the next one begin' for his pathetic life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing between the two Slayers, you knew that this was a pivotal moment in your life...what would you do?</span></div></div>",

Looking down on Buffy as though she were a cancer, a disease that simply had to be eradicated from your flawless Goddess' life, you muttered in Latin quickly, almost feverishly. Buffy's eyes widened in shock as she tried to plead futilely with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...stop! I can help you!\" She cried up at you, looking petrified beyond all reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you ploughed on, finishing the spell within a few more seconds. A ball of energy burst from your open palms, shaping and sliding itself into an elongated form, so that it moved rapidly towards Buffy's heart. Protruding into her chest. your deadly weapon caused convulsions to spread through her entire body; she shook violently as you took her life from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked cool,\" Faith stated with a gleam in her dark eyes, watching intently as Buffy let out a final gasp before going completely still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say - it was a curious mixture of feeling satisfied and guilty at the same time. Your emotions were raw and hard to make sense of; yet you knew that it was the only thing you could have realistically done in this situation to please Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dark goddess extended a foot to roll Buffy over, then rested her sole against her heart, seemingly in victory, but also to check if her heart had stopped beating. A satisfied grunt from the brunette Slayer confirmed it: you had killed Buffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you, a look of pure pleasure adorning her beautiful face. \"You did good, slave. You're like, totally desperate to please me - even kill for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knelt before her, feeling so wonderfully inferior to this gorgeous woman. \"Yes...yes Goddess: I am yours in heart, body and mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled slightly. \"Yeah you are. You're actually kinda cool too - I didn't think you had it in you to actually kill a person. You ain't bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this as a compliment. \"Thank you...Goddess...\" Finding it impossible to hold back any longer. you dropped down to the floor, your lips pushing and sliding all over the tops of her feet. You couldn't help it - you had proved yourself as her slave and you just had to worship her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, easy slave!\" Faith chuckled, using a bare foot to effortlessly force down your face firmly to the floor. \"You've got a body to get rid of now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart froze - of course! You hadn't even considered the fact that Buffy's body would need to be taken care of. A nasty slither of doubt and worry flooded into your brain - you were a murderer, a criminal...you just hoped that your obsession for Faith would override these negative emotions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - I'm not havin' a dead body rot in my apartment. You killed her slave - it's your responsibility,\" she stated firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... please Goddess...\" You found yourself whimpering, which was met with an increase of pressure from her foot onto your head, contorting your face and causing you to gurgle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't repeatin' myself.\" With that she stood off you, slinking away before casually sitting down on her couch. \"You've got two minutes to get this blonde bitch outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes?! Panic engulfed you, yet you were determined to take control of your mental facilities and make the  appropriate decision. You could carry out a decomposing spell...but you had never tried it on a whole body before. It would be hugely ambitious. The old fashioned way would be to drag her carcass out of Faith's apartment and hope that you wouldn't be seen...what should you do?</span></div></div>",

As you stood over your victim, you tried your hardest to remember the necessary incantations required to decompose Buffy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh - another spell!\" Faith called over to you excitedly. \"C'mon slave - I'm rooting for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure whether she was being sarcastic or not. Anyway, you started to murmur the first few words in Latin, using your finger tips to trace an outline of the body what you wanted to be rid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking like forever - you've only got, like, a minute left!\" Your Goddess said, a definite trace of dangerousness in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the time constraints you were under, you lowered your hands and tried to empty your mind, attempting to make it as clear and prepared for magic as possible. Feeling a blissful calm begin to soothe your aching head, you started to get into a rhythm, mixing your Latin with deft, subtle movements that began to cause Buffy's body to tremble a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Faith chuckled, almost distracting you, but you were in the zone now. Completely focused on your task in hand, you felt your hands shudder with power, the ground beginning to rumble around the area just in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty seconds!\" The dark-haired Slayer announced, though you were virtually oblivious to everything around you; your mind was almost at one with your target. You could almost feel the skin and bones from Buffy's dead body begin to melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your hands shaking vigorously. This was probably due to the fact that the amount of power you were channelling was so huge, so advanced, that it was beginning to drain away your energy, your life force. Gasping with the strenuousness of it, you dropped down to one knee, your mind frantically pushing and sliding itself against the blonde Slayer's body, feeling it dissolve and destroy it. Even though it didn't look visibly different, you knew that as soon as you'd affected her inner core. the actual decomposition of her body would only take a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet you were wobbling, struggling to remain sufficiently full of energy. Your vision began to cloud over; everything around you was suddenly hazy and incoherent. A piercing sound began to fill your ears, reverberating and echoing away until it was unbearable. It would take a tremendous amount of power, strength and intestinal fortitude to see this through. Without a doubt, this was the most complex, mind-bendingly difficult spell you had ever carried out. And you surely only had only a few seconds yet before Faith would announce your time was up; not that you'd hear her in your current state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, you knew you were mere moments away from successfully completing this massively ambitious spell. Would you be able to complete it, before the two minutes was up? Desperately willing the spell to work, you had a strange sensation grip you tightly...what if you didn't have the energy to see it through? Whichever way, you were about to find out...</span></div></div>",

Your eyes opened groggily, to see the sight that you dreaded before you: Buffy's body, dead, but not even remotely decomposed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaustion took over at that point; you felt darkness completely overwhelm you before you passed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, slave!\" A hand slapped you roughly across the cheeks, so hard that it forced a surprised yelp to emit from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...who?\" You groaned, feeling as though your entire body had just been sat upon by a small elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You useless piece of shit! You've totally failed me!\" Faith's voice became clearer as you stared up from the floor at her face: hard and beautiful at the same time. \"How the hell am I gonna trust you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I...\" You began weakly, before giving up, too exhausted to even form a sentence. Flat on your back and staring up at your Goddess, you had no energy - even keeping your eyes open required a concerted effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you gotta say to me? You're supposed to be wicked powerful and have skills. Just get up and do it already!\" She said, glaring down at you, her bare legs and feet making her look ridiculously sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...can't,\" You gasped up at her, spluttering and almost choking with the effort. The attempt of this decomposition spell had truly depleted you of everything - it was if you had no batteries left whatsoever. You wished and prayed that your Goddess would understand and appreciate the efforts you had gone to for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck! Lifting a bare foot in the air, Faith brought it down with fury onto your stomach, causing you to cry out in agony, a small amount of blood leaking out of your mouth. Before you could even begin grovelling and begging, the dark-haired Slayer repeated this action, making you double over and curl into a ball, pitiful and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you fucking hear me?! You're the most useless slave in the whole fucking world!\" She spat at you, completely livid that you were unable to fulfil her request. \"Get up now and I'll give you another chance to get rid of the body. Do it!\" She yelled at you, her voice totally demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use: you felt like a fish out of water, completely unable to do anything other than quiver and whine on the ground. Hot tears springing from your eyes, you tried to summon some sort of energy but you literally had nothing left in the tank. All you could do at this point was to roll onto your front and attempt to place meek kisses to the top of Faith's bare feet. Shaking you away, your Goddess was clearly not impressed at this attempt to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say you could kiss my feet? You're unbelievable!\" She stared coldly down at you, her harsh expression making you feel even more desperate and anxious than before. \"What the hell am I supposed to do with a slave who can't even, like, carry out my orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point, harsh as she was being. You had failed and now you were paying the price!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, there's somethin' else I could use you for...?\" Faith said thoughtfully, filling your heart with both hope and fear in equal measures. Would your incredibly sexy Goddess show some mercy on you, or use you for something  that would be unpleasant or difficult for you...?</span></div></div>",

Once the police arrived, she conveniently slipped away, leaving you to accept the full blame for Buffy's murder. That part wasn't actually that difficult; you had been the one to end her after all! So, after being handcuffed, taken away and dropped into a jail cell, you considered your options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy taking the rap for your Goddess, you had surely pleased her - this was more than a dose of comfort for you. You knew in your heart that you would do anything, no matter how degrading, extreme or apparently horrendous. Yet, Faith had not specified how long you would need to be in prison for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, you were alone in your small, claustrophobic cell. The last thing you needed was to deal with some burly meathead who would undoubtedly want to do something unpleasant to, or with you. Staring up at the ceiling above you, you saw a vent - a long way away, but definitely large enough to fit in! Deciding that the less time you spend in jail the better, you made a choice: it was time to get out of here! Waiting for the prison guard to walk by, you began concentrating on levitating yourself - slowly and subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\" A curt tone took your concentration right away. A towering guard appeared in front of you, his weather-beaten face wearing the expression of a sneer. \"You got another hour in here before you're transferred. I hope ya like some company!\" He chortled, tapping his nightstick against the metal bars of other cells, causing a clanging sound to ring out and reverberate around the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that no-one else would appear, you began to refocus on your spell. The thought of having to share your cell with others, spurred you on to get the hell out of there! So, deciding to go for broke, you launched yourself upwards, a dull hum causing your arms and legs to tremble a little. A rather glorious sensation started to spread to your belly; you were rising, with some speed - heading straight for the ceiling! As you approached, you threw your hands up, clutching on to the metal bars, so that you were swinging, a bit like a monkey from a tree. Realising that you had to get a move on from this position, you loosened one part until it dropped with a clang to the ground, then deftly propelled yourself forward until you up in the vent. Phew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying forward, you heard a surprised cry from below you (presumably the guard had heard you). As you raced along, you eventually came to an opening. Forcing it open, you could see a security fence, surrounded by guards. Shit! If you dropped down from the vent now, they would see you instantly! It could be worth trying a teleportation spell - being able to see a patch of grass in the distance would allow it to be successful enough to then flee away. However, if the spell fails, you will probably make a ruckus, which would alert the guards for sure...</span></div></div>",

Every bone, every fibre of your being not only ached, but felt completely spent. At least you were able to escape jail without too many complications! Then the thought of Faith, your Goddess, entered your mind... you should report to her, show to her how resourceful you are and plead her to allow you to worship her gloriousness once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever a nagging doubt began to spread inside of you; Faith made you go to prison - as far as she was concerned, you were out of the picture. Not only had you taken the rap for her, but now you were also a felon: a felon on the run from the law! Was it even safe being at your place? The rational side of you took over - it would only be a matter of time until you would be tracked down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind made up, you dragged your weary out of bed and mixed together a potion, one which would revive you, temporarily at least. Gulping the red, syrupy mixture down, you packed a few items, including weapons and magical supplies into a bag and headed out of the door. Realising that it was night time, you turned your collar up and tried to keep a low profile as you started searching for Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious port of call would be her flat. Just as you start heading there, you grind to a halt, remembering that was the actual crime scene, where you murdered Buffy. A horrible feeling of guilt swirled inside your belly: you were a killer, a criminal... slaughtering an innocent girl... was it all really worth it to become Faith's slave...? Attempting to shake those thoughts away for now, you resolved to find the dark-haired Slayer; you simply have to see her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the cemetery where you first uncounted her, you considered doing a locator spell but that would expend energy that you definitely do not possess.

Part of you yearned to rush out and drop down to your knees in humble servitude, but what if it was someone else?

It had been an exhausting if rewarding night.  Magic could do many things but you weren't a true healer.  While you could take away some of the pain the total amount of damage could leave scars if they weren't scene to.  Thankfully there was a solution and that was potions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take some time to make but you could create a rejuvenation potion that would greatly enhance your recovery time.

Thankfully everything went well and you quickly consumed the potion and then collapsed, dead to the world.  That night you dreamed of Faith.

Nightmares of Faith brutally destroying you over and over again.  Nightmares of her making you do things that even you would find intolerable.  You woke up screaming remembering the nightmares and shivered.  Hopefully they weren't a premonition for the future!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being that the typical Vulcan lives well over two hundred years she would be considered by human standards in her mid thirties.  Despite her relatively youth she has proven herself to be quite the dutiful second in command.  Of course, what can you expect from a race that is taught to suppress all emotion in favor of total logic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a full glance of her you notice she is attired in the standard issue federation uniform (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ts1.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4780732995929392&amp;id=8fc7aa62ef932219d4460c6f153f493f\" target=\"_blank\">http://ts1.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail....</a> ) though her rather voluptuous mounds on her chest protrude every so slightly.  If only to draw your attention away from her rather obvious pointed ears.  T\u2019Lar\u2019s long, flowing, brunette hair almost makes you weep that she is not human.  Her cold, glossy blue eyes, cat-like in shape, reminds you of this fact and adds to her people\u2019s characteristic non-emotional personality.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.elevenfreakinthousand.com/Kirk/Images/RomulanChick.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.elevenfreakinthousand.com/Kir...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding a pad over to you, \u201cAll preparations have been completed Captain.

Followed shortly thereafter by incredible shaking akin to that of an airliner of the old Earth days hitting turbulence.  Data disks fly off the desk hitting the walls and floor.  Lights blink off only to be superceded by the emergency lighting a few seconds after.  The sound of grinding metal, bubbling booms, and strange whining saturates your ear drums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it comes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear shattering alarm to Red Alert.  A call to Battle Stations.  Easier said than done.  The ship, though no longer at Warp speed still felt like it was going at super fast impulse only sideways.  Equilibrium was off.  Everything tilted to the left and down with the angle getting steeper by the second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing T\u2019Lar by the arm you get up to the door.  Pressing the Initiator Button the bulkhead door to your Ready Room, you pull T\u2019Lar through by sliding yourself against the metal wall using the rail grating as leverage.  Getting to the next bulkhead door you again push the Initiator Button.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene that opens up before you is pure chaos.  Panels, vents, lighting, even the floor itself seemed to be exploding.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec02/explosion.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec02/exp...</a>  You saw wounded and dead crew members flying every which way.

She was a woman who took no shit from no one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed at the stubble of your chin and decided to do some investigating.  It turns out she was a mob boss in the Gotham underworld and ran Mooney's Nightclub.  You decided it was time to visit the club and see if you could get into her good graces.  Because right now you wanted nothing more than to be with this woman, no for some reason you wanted more than that.  You wanted to serve her, see her dreams reach fruition and exalt her above all others.  You want this beautiful talented woman to have everything she ever wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into her nightclub with a confident smile wearing a well tailored suit.  You were poised and confident and ready to meet Mooney.  </span></div></div>",

Trying the door knob with success you sneak right in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place is unkempt and intimidating. Cautiously you enter what looks like the bedroom where the panties should be. Get in and out quick you think to yourself as you locate the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you are struck in the head from behind.

Her feet were quite big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the hell is this!?

Kevin called and told me you were coming. He sends me new toys to play with and abuse and I leave him and his friends alone, it's a little agreement we came up with \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee began to walk around you \" You are mine now the sooner you realize that the easier this will be.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK! Lee spanked your naked rear with surprising strength causing you to yelp like a hurt dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm I love when they squeal, I'm going to enjoy breaking you\" Lee came back into your sight showing you how gross she actually looks. Bewildered at the fact Kevin set you up for this nightmare you struggle to get free but to no success the ropes are too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out her manly laugh Lee meets you eye to eye \" Don't fight it... When I'm done with you you will be begging to be my slave\" She smiled showing her less than perfect teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What should we do first? We have a LOT of time to break you into my willing pet... How about...\"</span></div></div>",

Finally.  You will die for what you did to my son!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Imp laughed, \"The one crime I am innocent of sister.  The one crime I wish I had done myself.  He was a monster and the realm is better off with him a corpse.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards angrily hit the dwarf with the haft of his spear.  The queen's eyes glittered, \"I will not give you a chance to escape again.  Bring me his head Ser Meryn.\"  One of the white cloaked guardians of the King swept forward took out his blade and hacked at the dwarf.  It took two blows but then the Imp was decapitated.  Ser Meryn presented the the head to the queen who nodded and told him to dispose of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained on your knees as Queen Cersei looked to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who might you be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace, I am your humble servant.  I go by the name Jared.  I am pleased to have brought your vile brother to justice.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained kneeling and the queen approached you and motioned you to rise.  You stood up from your knees and the queen looked at you.  \"I have promised to make anyone a lord if they bring me my brother.  You have done so.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow your head again, \"My Queen, I am honored beyond words.  If you would make me a lord I would be glad to accept the honor.  However my true desire is to serve you.  I can serve as an adviser.  I can serve as a warrior, a soldier.  I will serve and be your truest servant in all the realm, be it advising, making war or cleaning the chamber pots of the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen laughed and the court joined her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pleased to find such zeal in these days of treachery.  I will honor my decree, you shall be made a lord.  And then I am sure we can find a use for such a loyal servant of the crown.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you are made a lord what does the queen have you do?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For your act of bringing the foul traitor to justice you were made a lord.  As you had no formal surname you chose \"stoneshield\" after the Queen's home of Casterly Rock.  You were given some lands and seat of power in the River Lands but that war torn area was not yet under the crowns control.  Not that you cared of course the greatest honor that was bestowed to you was being named to the Small Council. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Small Council was the collection of advisers to the queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrand Maester Pycelle was the eldest.  Ser Harys Swyft was to act as the Hand of the King.  Gyles Rosby was the treasurer and Lord Qyburn was the master of whisperers.  Rounding out the council was the Aurane Waters, the Grand Admiral.  A bastard but one that was dashing and bold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the lot of them you respected few. Qyburn was the most capable the rest... well you hoped you could provide better council.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour position was not formally listed however you were to attend the Small Council and advise the queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen came in looking brilliant as usual.  The council rose and your heart jumped into your throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lords you will forgive my lateness,\" the council readily agreed.  When they had finished their pleasantries you knelt to the ground, \"Your grace, there is naught to forgive, we serve as you see fit.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Aurane Waters rolling his eyes as your remark.  No doubt he thought your words the worst sort of fawning.  Only they were true, this is what you had longed to do.  The Queen graced you with a smile and motioned for you to rise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all know our newest member, Lord Jared Stoneshield.  He valiantly hunted my murderous kin and brought him here to face the sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other council member's nodded their heads in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the first order of business,\" the Queen asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk began about delivering the head of Gregor to Dorne and then went on to discussion on who would be the next High Septon, the head of the official faith of the kingdom.  You cared little of such matters since they were not pivotal.  Instead you took the time to weigh what each councilor said to learn how effective they were.  Your initial assessment was correct, Qyburn was really the only good fit.  The Hand was a fool.  Waters was glib but you did not trust him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was talk about the fleet which had been decimated at a recent battle.  The Grand Admiral wanted coin for ships.  You saw the Queen weigh the request when the master of coin spoke, \"There *cough* isn't *cough* any *cough* coin.\"  Lord Gyles had a chronic cough that made listening to him grating.  The Queen pursed her lips and said, \"We must have strength on the sea, I will defer payments to the Iron Bank and to the Church until our fleet is reconstructed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Harys Swyft agreed readily.  Pycelle spoke and said, \"The Iron Bank is not to be trifled with... the Iron Bank will have its due, this will cause much trouble.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen did not like the council of the old man and slammed her hand on the table.  \"The Iron Bank is remains on Braavos, it will wait on our pleasure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you uneasy.  The Iron Bank truly was a force in the world.  They could cut funding to merchants from the seven kingdoms and wreck havoc on the economy.  Furthermore they could fund rival claimants to the throne.  You saw that the Queen was fairly set in her position and unlikely to be swayed.  However you knew that this course of action could be ruinous.  Do you speak up and give good council at the risk of earning the Queen's ire?  </span></div></div>",

Should they be unable to borrow it could be disastrous for the Seven Kingdoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Harys Swyft chuckled, \"Lad just because you have been honored with a seat does not mean you know about trade.\"  His patronizing tone irritated you.  The fool was unsuited to be the Hand, you suspect the reason he was given the position was due to repaying political favors to the man's family.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be common born my Lord Hand however this does grant me a unique perspective.\"  You turn toward the queen, \"Your Majesty again I beseech thee, pay the shipwrights but not with the gold due to the Iron Bank Braavos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen did look displeased however she said, \"Very well then, where should the coin come from?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tyrells, loan money from them.  They have the wealth for it as their lands have remained virtually untouched from the rebellion.  Should they object, you can remind them that the crown needs those funds to safeguard the realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurane Waters snorted, \"And show weakness to High Garden?  Foolishness.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quickly getting tired of these pack of fools but you hold your temper.  \"Grand Admiral, how would this be weakness?  That the crown is in debt is no secret.  Moreover the Tyrells will have all that much reason to ensure King Tommen's rule if the crown was indebted to them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had argued well your point.  Most of the Councillors dismissed your reasoning simply because of their predispositions to you.  They viewed you as undeserving of a place on the council but the only one who truly mattered was the Queen Regent, Cersei the ruler of the realm and your heart.

Perhaps it had been in jest but if so it was an awfully poor one.  You approached Ser Osmund after he finished his shift of guarding the young king.  As always when coming from duty he wore the full plate of the Kingsguard.  Their glistening white garb showing the world that they were member's of the elite that had but 7 members.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund was not alone he was walking with his brother Ser Osfryd, commander of the city watch.  His clothing was dark in comparison - both brothers were tall and powerful figures in King's Landing.  Ser Osfryd wore leather armor - clearly not on duty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach you say, \"Ser Osmund, I would have a word with you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund smirks, \"What is it palace guard?\"  It was a deliberate slight.  You had been raised to nobility and given a command - a small one but it would have warranted a \"my lord\" at the very least.  Not that you cared about titles - that wasn't why you brought Tyrion to justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In private,\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund chuckles, \"Anything you have to say you can say in front of my brother.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed you went on, \"Very well.  I overheard your early conversation regarding the queen.  Comments like those could be taken the wrong way, as a knight of the Kingsguard it is your duty to protect the queen's person and <i>her </i>reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund laughed loudly.  \"I am a knight of the Kingsguard you up jumped toad.  I can speak of the queen in anyway I please, after all I can take her anyway I please as well!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw red, in a blur of motion you had backhanded the boasting fool across the face.  The blow split his lip and caused him to fall off balance, he caught himself on the wall and looked at you with murder in his eyes.  His hand darted to his blade and he drew it in one smooth motion striking out at you.  Ser Osmund wasn't a novice at the blade but he was no where near your equal.  You caught the blow with your own blade and then shouldered into Ser Osmund.  He stagged back and fell to the ground.  His brother snarled at you and launched a blistering attack.  You parried each blow with ease then pinned his blade to the wall with one hand while driving your fist into stomach.  The leather armor probably prevented him from losing his lunch but he gasped pathetically and crumpled to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund struggled to his feet in the heavy armor and called out for reinforcements.  He charged at you and you stopped his charge with pure strength.  While you did not appear to have an overly muscular frame, it was a lean strength with not an ounce of fat.  After checking his blow you launched your own combination attack that had him backing away fear glistening in his dark eyes.  Seeking to end the matter before more guards arrived you disarmed him with a trick you picked up in Lys and his sword went clattering down the hallway.  Not done with your object lesson you stomped the side of his leg near the ankle, the armor stops the blow but doesn't stop his leg from buckling and forcing him to his knee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest your blade on his neck and look directly at him. \"If I ever hear you besmirch the name our queen again with your foul slander I will cut you to pieces Kingsguard or no.  Do you understand me?\"  He nods frightfully and you re-sheath your sword just as some of the palace guard arrive.  They are actually your men so you dismiss them after informing them it was a false alarm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the two brothers without a second look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later you are summoned to Queen's chamber.  </span></div></div>",

Execute him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen looked at you and shook her head, \"Not without a trial, it would look as if we were trying to renege on our promise of land and title to my brother's killer.  It would have to be public and I weary of another spectacle.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Loras spoke up, \"Your grace, trial by combat would be fitting and quick.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund nodded, \"Yah that would be fair.  I'd be more than happy to fight on your behalf your grace.  We can do it on the morrow in front of court. Would make the other nobles understand the price of treason.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you could talk... but your queen had ordered your silence and you would rather die then disobey her.  The queen nodded, \"Very well - take him to the dungeons and tomorrow he will duel you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurning rage filled your eyes.  Ser Osmund had lied about the encounter.  The idiot wanted to duel him, fine he would destroy the ignorant dog.  Your very own guards were called in to shackle you and send you down into the dungeons.  Ser Osmund went down as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pretty quick with the blade so I'm going to make sure our little duel doesn't go awry... still shackled and unarmed he and several of the city guard set to work beating you.  They kept away from your face but they hit you hard from the neck down.  They cracked several ribs, and bruises lined your body when they were done.  Ser Osmund gave you one last vicious kick dislocated your shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No food and water, lets see how he fights with busted up ribs and no food, also wake him every hour.  No rest for the wicked!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long night.  After they left you forced your shoulder back into socket painfully.  Pain only fueled your rage.

Ser Osmund had left nothing to chance, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe court had assembled and the charge of treason was read and a plea was asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a loud clarion voice you proclaimed, \"I am innocent.

Ser Osmund launched another attack, you dodged and responded with a vicious strike to the head that he blocked with his shield.  You fought back and forth - your speed was greater even while weakened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund snarled and rushed you.  The fight had gone on long enough.  You had been holding back up until know.  Your blade darted like an adder to his face. He raised his shield to blow while trying to strike you with his own blade.  Your attack was a feint and with his vision blocked by his own shield you easily darted to his shield side.  When he lowered it he turned around in a panic but you had already brought your dull blade down with unbelievable force on the back of his leg.  It struck right where the joint was, where the plate armor was thinnest to allow for movement.  The dull blade pierced his leg and it collapsed under him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a last desperate lunge at you but you were already moving.  Your hand snaked around his helmet and you removed it.  He lashed out with his blade but now hobbled it was pathetically easy to avoid.  After removing the helmet you had easy access to his face.  His next strike you caught the blade with your own and then disarmed him.  You twisted his arm behind his back and shoved him up against a pillar.  Then you slammed his head into it three times.  Teeth and blood fell from his mouth.  You threw him back down to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO BETRAY THE QUEEN!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stalk forward and grab Ser Osmund by the throat and drag him in front of the queen.  \"Look at her, look at the one you betrayed with your LIES!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Osmund moaned pitifully and begged the queen to save him.  The queen looked away in disgust.  As soon as she looked away you snapped his neck like a twig.  You then kneel before the queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace, I have but one wish and that is to serve you.

Thinking to be polite you said, \"Your place is here but I am sure the Queen wants to use your reputation to put down the last remnants of the fighting in the Riverlands.\"  The commander of the Kingsguard shook his head, \"You are as blind as I was.  Guard the queen and her son, she is not well loved.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disagreed completely but nodded your head at the direct order.  You were excited and pleased to be fitted in the white armor of the Kingsguard.  Hopefully your position would allow you to be in constant contact with the Queen.  Your heart was filled with joy at the prospect of serving the Queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You saw a calculating look appear on the Queen's lovely face.  You kept the stoic visage of a loyal guard but inwardly you smiled at her Grace's cunning.  She was already turning disaster into an advantage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her plans unfolded.  She was refusing her daughter in law and Ser Loras Tyrell from having the fleet sail towards High Garden to protect it from the Ironborn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Stannis still a threat I dare not have the fleet sail from Kings Landing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargery nearly shrieked in anger, \"He is no longer a threat!  My home lies under peril - do something!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Cersei responded, \"Not until Dragon-stone falls - we can not take chances.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSer Loras chivalrously slammed his fist to his mailed chest and sunk to one knee, \"My Queen, allow me to personally lead the attack.  I will waste no time in tearing down the walls so the fleet can then be sent to stop the Greyjoys.\"  His sister gasped.  You were curious.  The queen did not like Ser Loras.  You wondered why - was it because she doubted his loyalty?  If so he would kill the boy himself.  You chide yourself internally letting nothing show on your face.  Yes he was young but he was a knight and quite skilled.  Not as skilled at you but truly no longer a boy.  Whatever the case may be you stood ready to serve the perfection that was Queen Cersei.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen graciously gave Ser Loras leave much to Margery's fear.  Her brother was being sent to the front lines, and doubtless she would miss him here at court.  You ponder the events as the rest of the folks left the area leaving the Queen and you alone.  You could tell that she did not want you to volunteer in place of Loras, no it was clear she wanted Loras gone.  But the attack on the holdings of High Garden... well she might wish her tentative allies to sweat a little but he doubted she wished the Ironborn to succeed in pillaging the most wealthy harbor in the realm.  And so you decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace, my place it at your side however I am no stranger to the sea.  If you command it I can take my own ship and a small group of mercenaries I know are worth their salt and harry the Ironborn.  They are used to easy victories and will not expect the turnabout knowing the King's Fleet is here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen looked startled at the suggestion.  She looked you over again - a close look.  You could tell she didn't quite trust you yet - even after slaying the treacherous knight.  You still thought it was a mistake to leave his two brothers alive and serving the queen, if one was a traitor likely all would be traitors.  You had to be honest with yourself however, they weren't truly traitors expect in the offense of speaking ill of the queen.  The knight likely would have served loyally but to speak ill of Cersei required death.  Even if the boasts of actually fornicating with the queen were unbelievable... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen was poised to make a decision.  While you hated to be apart from her gorgeous perfection - you itched to lay waste to her foes. Whatever her decision you would not argue - she was the queen and you were her utterly loyal servant.  </span></div></div>",

You looked at it with utter longing and then touched her hand with your own and brushed your lips across her fair skin.  You longed to truly kiss this perfect hand but that would be uncouth.  You controlled your foolish desire (for why would such a noble and fair creature deign to sleep with her bodyguard) and the moment passed.  You remained on your knees as the queen swept past you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed there and actually touched your lips with your own hand, your lips, her hand.  You rose to your feet unsteadily.  That had been the greatest moment of your life.  Her hand.  Your lips.  You would treasure it always.  Now you had a duty to perform and a queen to impress.  The Ironborn thought themselves masters of the sea but their arrogance would cost them.  Setting a brisk pace you made your arrangements.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew who the best mercenaries were - you had hired them frequently, hell you had <i>trained </i>a good chunk of your own men.  Two to one odds would be easy enough to win and you looked forward to winning several battles.  You also hired two merchant vessels to trail you - after you captured stolen booty and other valuables you would fill those merchant vessels to the brim and send them back to Kings Landing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your most trusted mercenary companions was also eager to join you in battle.  His name was Ulric and he was a heavily bearded mountain of man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish playing guard duty and ready to get back in the thick of it eh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled good naturally, \"An interlude my friend.  I have found my calling - the service of the most exquisite jewel in the world.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed, \"Whatever ya say lad.  She's been married already and bore children I'd be surprised if her tits didn't...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFury enveloped you and in an instant you had rammed your larger friend against the wall with your arm across his throat and your knife pressed against him ready to end him if he fought back.  You stared into your friends shocked eyes and spoke softly, \"Ulric, I will forgive this but once.  No one will besmirch the queen.  <b>NO ONE</b>.\"  You released your friend who looked at you in a new light, \"Aye well - your the boss and even if ye wasn't I have no desire to offend a friend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sudden anger evaporated and you gave him a half smile.  \"Gather the rest of the crew, I intend to waste no time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You fly merchant colors on your ship from one of the houses of Tyrosh, a tempting target for any pirate.  Soon one of the black sailed corsairs spots you and their ship heads your way.  You give your crew a wolfish smile, \"Just as we planned boys - get ready.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had 20 oarsmen, 10 sailors and 20 soldiers.  10 of those soldiers had crossbows you had purchased for them and they lay flat at the edge of the deck, when the Ironborn boarded they would stand up and kill the first wave instantly.  You gave the command to start fleeing at half speed, you didn't want them to suspect a trap.  Soon enough they got within bow range and the pirates fired a few badly aimed shots from their longbows.  Wind and sea do not make a good combination for an archer, the bow strings almost always get wet from sea spray and both ships were being rocked by the waves even in clam waters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of chase their faster ship (now that you are going at half speed) catches up and rope with hooks attached slam into your ship pulling the hulls together side by side.  As the ships clash together the men of Pyke jump over from their ship to yours.  As this happened the ten men with crossbows stand up and fire. Nine pirates die with bolts in their chest, one was clipped in the shoulder.  The second wave stumbled over their companions and you and Ulric were on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wielded a long sword and shield and wore leather armor for this battle.  You stabbed the first stumbling pirate in the guts before he could recover from the shock of seeing the first wave cut down.  Shoving the dying man backward you wrench free your blade slash another pirates face open.  The third manages to block your first strike but your shield slams into his face breaking his nose and stunning him and he is finished off quickly.  Ulric was cackling like a demon, choosing a great axe for this fight he just let the heavy blade arc.  One stupid pirate tried to block with his own shield, all that accomplished was a broken arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time your 10 men had re-loaded their crossbows and fired another salvo.  Dozens of pirates were dead and the call for retreat was issued.  Not a chance.  You, Ulric and half a dozen of your fighters followed the scurrying pirates to their ship.  Their captain bellowed out orders but it was futile.  Some of the crew jumped over board fearing death from blades and bolts.  The captain tried to put spine in his men and charged you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was marginally better then rest of his crew, which meant he stood no chance.  You parried the first blow, trapped his blade away from his body as he tried again and then ripped it across his body, disemboweling him.  After that the rest was an easy mop up.  An easy victory with only one causality.  One of the crew had been stabbed in the leg by the enemy but he would heal and that was the worst wound suffered.  Ulric bellowed in triumph.  He gave another shout of surprise when he discovered what was in storage.  This ship hadn't been full of loot but it had some fantastic items.  Red Arbor wine freshly taken from the Tyrells.  Several bundles of silk and a smell chest of gold and jewels.  It was clear the pirates had found rich targets recently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the order to divest the ship of its loot and then set fire to the Ironborn vessel.  That night you met with one of the merchant vessels and handed over the bounty and told them to make for King's Landing and provide these as a gift to the Queen from her loyal knight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was another day and as the concentration of corsairs grew larger the closer your ship got to High Garden it would become far more likely that you have to fight off more than one pirate crew at the same time.  </span></div></div>",

Your task is stealth not war, though should you find yourself in a fight you were confident in your ability to win.  As you got closer to the royal chambers the number of guards increased.  Through guile, stealth and pure deceit you crossed into the hall where the queen would be finishing supper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut stepped an angry tired looking Kevan Lannister.  He was the queen's uncle and whatever their conversation had been about had upset him.  The guards stood straighter as he walked by and as every eye turned toward him you moved quick as a cat past them.  Now only two guards stand outside the queen's chambers.  You cast a watchful eye down the hall and know you must be quick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach them confidently bearing a piece of parchment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards look at you and say, \"State your business.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a paper for the Queen...\"  you begin to say but as you move to hand it to the guard you stiffen your fingers and jam them into his throat.  You were careful not to making it a killing blow but he could make no sound as his hands grabbed his throat trying to get air.  Next you strike the temple of the 2nd guard with a palm strike, he goes down quickly.  You had just taken both guards out with almost no sound.  You prop them up carefully so they look like they are leaning against the wall.  When the next guard comes by it will be obvious but not from a distance.  You should have time to meet with the woman you would serve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door quietly and see the Queen sitting by the table holding a cup of wine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure is amazing.  Her golden hair cascades down her slender shoulders.  Her bright green eyes widen at your appearance.  She breaths in and you see her wondrous bosom swell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel before her before she can cry out.  \"Your Majesty.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, what are you doing in my chambers,\" she demands.  Her voice is sharp and yet the sound is like that of sweet birds trilling happily in the morning to your ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty, though I am not worthy of the high honor I beg of you, give me leave to serve you.

Having lived with the amongst the Dothraki, she had built up confidence and grew to become a powerful ruler. Despite her reciprocal kindness and fair treatment of her servants, the continuous exposure to war and conflict has changed her. The Queen Of Meereen has become more cruel with her perceived enemies and sometimes, even her servants, the ones she considered unsatisfactory of course. Some rumors suggest that it is the ''Targaryen madness'', but who knows? Maybe the silver-blonde beauty is tired of endless political struggle which resulted in her kindness dissipating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about Daenerys, who are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before being stripped and given a battered piece of cloth to wear and locked up in one of Meereen's underground prisons, you used to be a very well known slave master with the name of Lizdahr. You used to own hundreds of slaves and didn't miss a single thing. You had food, wine and women. The only things every poor man of Meereen dreamed of. However, all of that was at risk with the arrival of the Khaleesi. She wanted to put an end to slavery which would in turn end your affairs. Slaves were the foundation of your living. Without them, you would clearly descend to being a no one. Of course you couldn't let that happen so you joined the Sons of the Harpy, an organization that is against the rise of Daenerys in Meereen. Everyone there considered Daenerys as a threat and wanted to terminate her reign. One of your mission consisted of you, infiltrating into the crop storage chamber and setting everything on fire, as a result creating a food shortage and hopefully create an economical crisis. This was supposed to make the Mother of Dragons vulnerable and look weak in front of the population, and in the end, for her to require help from the slave masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to be careful as you knew that your mask would give you away, so you didn't wear it for the majority of walking through the desert-like city of Meereen. You reached the place and examined the entrance, which was guarded by two heavily-armored fighters of the Unsullied. You knew you couldn't take them on so you had to think of something else. The building was a barn-like hut with no windows and a single wooden door. The crop-keeping architecture was also quite tall, standing at twenty-two feet. It was surrounded by several oriental boutiques, which sold a range of goods; varying from groceries, weapons and ceramics. And then you saw it. The ceramics stand was a shed-like building with wooden beams supporting the protruding roof of the entrance. On the roof, there was an assortment of vases and pots. You thought that knocking one beam over would definitely cause the small fragment of wooden roofing to collapse and the breaking of the ceramics to make enough noise to cause a distraction of the guards at the front so that you could enter and fulfill your duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, how would you do that? Maybe throwing a rock hard would knock the beam down? You'd need a pretty big rock for that. Maybe going there and doing it yourself? That would make it too obvious. Just as you were thinking, a horse-driven ottoman-styled carriage had rode right into the beam, and a loud shattering sound was heard. The two guards hurried to the place of accident. You were astonished by your luck. Maybe it was fate you thought. But you didn't have time to think as the guards would surely return . You put your infamous Harpy mask on and rushed to the now unguarded entrance and opened it. You entered and looked around. The crops were stored in massive containers. There were over 50 of these containers, but to your luck, they were made out of wood. As the place didn't have any windows, there were torches suspended on the walls of the enclosure. You walked towards a wall and grabbed a torch with enthusiasm. You were going to put an obstacle in Daenerys' path and that made you happy. You didn't manage to turn around though, and someone tackled you to the ground, your torch dropping beside you, extinguishing.'Son of a bitch' spat the mysterious person in a Valeryian accent. And then he knocked you out by stomping on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that there was another guard inside the place. Of course. How stupid were you. How could they actually leave an important source of food unguarded just because of a road accident. Why didn't you think about that? You guessed that the sense of bitterness smothered your logical thinking. When you woke up, your mask was not on anymore and your hands were tied behind your back. You were being carried by two guards, and they told you about the Unsullied that saved the day. The hero. They carried you to an unfamiliar place. It's entrance was dark and unwelcoming, with scratched, sandstone walls and a bunch of knights guarding it. You were handed to one of them and you learned that this was Meereen's prison, which you've surprisingly never heard about before. Slaves never disobeyed before the reign of Daenerys so there was no need for a prison, or so you thought, but apparently there was. You were then carried inside and down on a set of stairs which led to a dungeon full of prison cells. The warden stopped and got a set of keys out to unlock an iron door. You were then violently thrown in and the door was locked up behind you. After about a second, the door reopened and the guard entered your cell. He didn't say a word. He just grabbed your shoulder and turned you around. He then got a dagger out and cut your restraints. He then quietly walked out and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so angry by your mistake that you smashed at the cold stone wall uncontrollably. You continued in a frenzy for about 10 minutes, until you run out of energy and breath, and so sat down on the uncomfortable ground. You felt your eyes close and slowly, you lay your head on the floor, feeling how you were falling asleep</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Jared and you are a powerful mage.  You were 53 years old however you look like you were in your late 20s.  Wizards don't age as regular folks do, the more powerful the wizard the less their age shows.  In your case you were actually quite powerful.  While you were officially part of the White Council you rarely attended any of the tedious politically oriented council meetings.  Instead you focused on your art, you were a master of magic because that is what you chose to bend your considerable intellect towards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou often pondered if you could match one of the Senior Council in terms of magical skill and power.  Their powers were impressive and you did not know the full extent of them.  However you have yet to meet your match in the battles you have fought.  You snicker as you remember the half dozen Red Court vampires who thought they could defeat you, a lone wizard far from any Wardens or other member's of the council.  You had disabused them of that notion quite effectively.  You had also used some of the new tricks you had devised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost combat wizards like to manipulate external energies, they throw blasts of flame, lighting or force at their foes.  Evocations were something you enjoyed using and were quite good with them.  But that was so... limiting in certain situations.  The greatest weakness wizards had was that their bodies were frail.  Yes they could recover from wounds that would have crippled someone but that could take months or even years depending on the type of wound.  Physical weakness such as a vampire moving twice as fast and then literally knocking your head off with sheer strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end you explored your own body.  (LOL stop thinking nasty thoughts).  You enchanted your very flesh with wards that would stop blows - by no means were you indestructible but you could take several dangerous hits that would kill a normal wizard before you suffered injury.  Bullets too because the ward was based on speed and force of enemy strikes.  Keeping your body safe was one thing but given a half dozen deadly blows would exhaust your flesh wards you also enchanted your clothing.  Now there was a long arduous process.  Week after week of layering enchantment before you were finished but now that you were finished it would stop nearly all piercing and cutting implements.  While it would not stop the *force* of the blow it would keep you safe.  An example is if a werewolf bit your arm it could not go through the cloth, however your bone may still be crushed from the supernatural power of its bite.  Well that was true for most wizards, in your case it would activate a ward on  your flesh itself that would stop it in its tracks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defense wasn't perfect - after all the wards on your flesh were finite, several bites would tear them down and leave just as vulnerable as the rest of the magical community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you sought a better way to defend yourself.  There was a branch of magic called Kinectomancy that was rarely used by the White Council.  Essentially it involved speeding up your own body to make you more deadly.  This was right up your alley so you perfected it quickly - again not a perfect defense because it did not permanently give you more speed only gave you short sharp bursts of speed.  You also decided to learn a variety of martial arts disciplines to enhance your natural reflexes.  So prepared the 6 Red Court vampires had stood little chance of defeating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Authors note - I am reserving both chapters.  Option 2 is describing the fight with the Red Court Vampires.  It doesn't have much relevance to the plot other then a cool action sequence (when I finish it).  It will also dead end as well.   The other chapter will be the continuation of the plot.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You researched the Sidhe both the Summer and Winter courts.  They were quite dangerous and you resolved to try not to get into any encounters with them.  You learned about the Fallen Angels trapped within coins - The Denarians.  Based on your research you figured you could handle the lesser ones handily.  Some of the more ancient hosts may be beyond your league - at least based on your current abilities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour researched the other courts as well.  And that was when you saw the image of the presumed head of the White Court - Laura Raith.  The White Council knew she was the power behind the White King.  **Authors Note - taking liberty here but its possible Warden Dresden leaked the info in his report or Warden Luccio did - either way I'm going with it here). ***  Like all White Court Vampires she was beautiful.  But for you it was something more.  The attraction was instant and ran deeper then just physical looks.  As you gazed upon her perfection it was like your soul had found its calling.  You yearned to be with this woman, no you yearned to <i>serve</i> this woman.  This Goddess of perfection replaced your obsession with magic instantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Here is a fan picture- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dresdenfilesrpg.angelfire.com/Lara.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://dresdenfilesrpg.angelfire.com/Lar...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greater than the sum of her parts.  Yes her black as night dark slightly curly hair was the picture of perfection.  Yes her creamy skin made silk seem rough, yes her legs seemed to travel endlessly displaying that luscious pale flesh that the White Court was known for.  Yes it was all that but it was also <b>more</b>.  Her grey eyes seem look out at you from her file.  Like she could see within your soul.  Shaking yourself you stepped away from your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a spell?  A glamour?  Was someone casting an enchantment on you?  You rechecked your wards and then did a careful sweep with your third eye.  Nothing was out of the ordinary except that your pulse pounded and you had also felt your manhood rise.  Shaking yourself you paced the room.  How could a picture have such an impact on you?  You looked at it again and felt your legs quiver.  You wanted to fall on your knees and proclaim your everlasting devotion to this Goddess.  You stared at her and something in your mind clicked.  This was why you existed.  To serve her, to be with her, to help her achieve whatever goals and dreams she desired.  You would make her priorities your own.   You would love her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to the task of researching the White Court.  You also booked a flight to America.  If you were going to be with Laura Raith- the Queen of the White Court you needed to be where she was.  And that was currently Chicago in the Raith estates that they held.   Unlike other wizards you had made an accommodation with technology.  By creating a custom ward you could actually seal your magical energies within a small bubble around you.  It did make you vulnerable because your sense couldn't quest out however it did allow to use modern devices such as computers and allow you to fly in airplanes without risking the entire flight.    As you did your research you started to plan how you should go about meeting the woman of your dreams...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You arrived in Chicago and called the Raith estate stating that you were a Wizard of the White Council wishing to speak with Ms. Raith.  You then took a cab to the estate.  It was an isolated mansion with fantastic surroundings.  The only difference was that unlike other wealthy mansions this had barbed wire, video surveillance and armed guards at the gate.  They were expecting you so they waved you through.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the cab and three men with guns approached.  They all had an aura of alertness about them, their eyes constantly scanning the area for threats.  You suspected they were former military.  They searched you for weapons and you gave them your knife and blasting rod.  \"Don't lose those,\" you tell them as they escort you into the Raith residence.  The entire place spoke of refined wealth and you were impressed by the combination of style and purpose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards took you to one of the wings of the mansion and the scenery changed from wealthy residence to an office.  There were probably a dozen cubicles and several offices and everyone seemed to be working efficiently.  The security guards walked you to Laura's office.  One opened the door and you walked on in.  The room itself was spacious and very organized.  Truth be told you couldn't remember much about the room because Laura Raith had rose to greet you as you entered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly your mouth dried up.  Your pulse raced and you felt your loins stir.  She was... perfect.  She was wearing a white office blouse unbutton just enough so a hint of her generous cleavage was showing.  Her black skirt was a couple of inches higher then normal office dress code and her heels were more appropriate for a runaway model.  Silver glinted from around her wrist, at her ears and around one delicate ankle.  She raised her hand, an obvious invitation to take it and kiss the tops of her knuckles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly shivered in ecstatic delight as you made contact with that soft creamy skin.  You felt your lips tremble as you kissed the top of her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gentleman in this day and age, a welcome change,\" her rich strong voice commented playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to speak but all you could do was make an odd sound in the back of your throat.  Words failed you, you were standing in the presence of perfection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, have a seat Jared.\"  Laura gestured to the chair across from her desk.  Unsteadily you made it to the chair and sat down.  You closed your eyes for a moment and used a mental relaxation technique to calm your jitters.  Laura took her seat and crossed her legs.  The desk hid the bottom portion of her legs but you could see the flesh of her thighs and your eyes were drawn to it like a moth to flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to my humble home?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and finished your calming mantra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I seek employment with your house.  I am a wizard and care little for the council but I do not wish to be isolated.  Alone I am potentially vulnerable but with the backing of a major power - well I gain security and you gain the resources of a skilled wizard.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and your heart thudded.  Her smile displayed the full lushness of her lips and you could see perfect white teeth behind those kissable lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  Are you being hunted? Will you bring danger to me and mine?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not,\" you quickly respond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura simply looked at you and you lowered your eyes.  Looking into her eyes could start a Soul Gaze.  And you were just not worthy of seeing into those lovely gray eyes.  Laura let the silence linger for a few moments and finally said, \"And what makes you think I need the services of a Wizard?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had done your research.  You knew the kinds of trouble that had occurred lately.  \"Your house had been assaulted twice in the last several years.  First a dark wizard summoned ghouls that murdered several of your kin.  According to the files at the White Council only the intervention of Warden Dresden prevented the estate from being overrun.  Later your home was attacked by a Skinwalker who wounded several of your house and killed several guards.  A wizard such as myself could aid you against magical threats as well as ward your home.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pursed her lips, you stared at them hungrily as she drummed her fingers on her desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose I am interested.  What do you <i>desire </i>to have as a payment?\"  You felt your skin flush.  The word desire had such emphasis, her tone was so sensual you almost creamed your pants.  All you could say in response was \"uhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed.  \"Oh you truly are easy.  You come into my home and offer yourself like a lamb to the slaughter.  You have had no dealings with my kind before have you?  Honestly you are out of your league.  I am tempted to consume you here and now for your foolishness.\"  She let the threat hang in the air as your mouth gaped open.  What?  Why was she doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't look so frightened dear mage, I have no wish to offend the White Council you are quite safe.  But someone so vulnerable is of little use to me.  You have wasted my time, I suggest you leave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame and sorrow filled your soul but also a spark of anger.  Yes you were drooling idiot right now.  Yes your first impression was one of a slack jawed incompetent.  But that was just because of <i>her</i>.  You were not a weakling and you are not a fool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test me.  You doubt my abilities so test them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at me with scorn.  \"I don't have time for this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have no wish to harm you.  There are two cousins of House Raith on the property.  Put me in room with both of them for one hour.  In that time I will be unharmed and they will be unconscious and not harmed permanently.\"  Laura looked at you and sighed, \"Hmm so persistent.  Still there are risks, a helpless mage may spark their hunger even past their control - not everyone is as careful as I am.\"  She thought for a moment and then made a decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally she said, \"No but if you wish to prove yourself then another arrangement can be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mood brightened.  Finally a chance to prove yourself to the woman of your dreams.  She picked up a manilla folder and flipped through it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this will be quite the test.  I want you to kill to someone for me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm this could be difficult.  Using magic to kill a mortal outside of self defense was against the seven laws of wizardry.  The White Council sent its Wardens after warlocks (the term for law breaking mages) and they could be quite dangerous.  You honestly thought you could take any Warden alive but they didn't like to show up one at a time.  Well maybe the Captain could prove difficult and the stories told about Warden Dresden... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not my dear - it will not be a mortal that you hunt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed your the folder and you began to look through it.  You were going to fight a scion of an elder dragon.  The elder dragon had long since been defeated in the middle ages however its spawn still lived.  This creature was half dragon and half mortal.  His natural form was probably that of a scaly large humanoid but the creature also had its father's gift for magic.  Which meant that is disguised itself as a human when it suited him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature went by the name Avaradex.   The scion was a mercenary - he \"owned\" a clan of ghouls who followed him.  He sold their services to other denizens of the magical world as cheap but plentiful muscle.  Has base of operations was in southern Mexico and his services had been in high demand after the fall of the Red Court created a power vacuum.   After reviewing the material you nod to the personification of beauty.  \"It shall be done Ms. Wraith.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved closer and stroked your cheek gently, \"I think you will fail.  But if not... we can talk of payments upon your return.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of pleasure flooded your mind.  The White Court were succubi, they fed on pleasure, sexual pleasure.  They could manipulate lust quite easy and you just had had an extremely heavy dose of it.  You swayed on your feet, fighting to stay upright.  You had embarrassed yourself with your earlier fawning and would not collapse twitching with pleasure like a helpless fool.  Laura returned to her desk - a clear dismissal and you left her office and then her estate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm kill Avaradex a half dragon 300 year old sorcerer with an army of ghouls at his beck and call.  You flashed the guard a wolfish grin as you got into the cab.  You would be back - and soon.  Laura doubted your abilities.  You were not a Warden.  No one knew of your slaughter of the Red Court Vampires who attacked you.  You were a relatively unknown wizard who had yet to make his mark on the world.  Avaradex had made his mark.  Laura expected you to die in your attempt.  This didn't bother you because you weren't going to die.  You were going to succeed.  Your only concern was how to actually do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you do it safely and effectively?  Assassinate the creature with minimal risk?  Or should you trumpet your power to the world, utterly destroy the clan of ghouls and then smash the scion to pieces in open combat.  You were cocky but you weren't stupid and the second option bordered a bit on stupid.  Then again you would risk anything to impress Laura Raith... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avaradex was a mercenary that meant people had to hire him all the time.  This was the foundation for your plan.  You made some inquires and passed the message that you wanted to meet Avaradex and discuss a possible job.  The meeting location was at an abandoned warehouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was prepared with a massive amounts of explosions.  You had carefully placed bubbles of magic around them disguising their scent and hiding them from view.  They were out of direct line of sight however who knows what kind of vision a half dragon could have.  You were also not going to meet with the creature in person, instead you were going to use astral projection to appear to be within the warehouse.  Your real self would be nearby hidden under your best veil.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvaradex arrived with a cadre of ghouls.  You smile as he sniffs the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished to meet in person for a lucrative job and then don't show up,\" he scowls at your projection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile in response, \"Lord Avaradex your strength is known throughout the world and I feared for my own safety if you disliked my terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled, \"What are your terms.  If you have wasted my time I will rend you into pieces.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour projection smiles and then the warehouse explodes.  The ghouls are instantly incinerated.   Avaradex is not so easily defeated however.  The flames tear through his clothing but do not harm his skin.  The concussive force does do extensive damage to his body.  His own magic rapidly tries to counter the damage but it is overwhelming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is thrown forcefully out of the warehouse and slams through a brill wall obliterating it.  You pounce ready to unleash deadly magics on him.  With fire not being as effective you lash out with a narrow blast of force.  It is narrow to allow for a slicing effect.  Avaradex is stunned by the explosion and attack but his innate magic conjures a shield of magic to blunt your attack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he had not had time to fully gather his energy your attack bleeds through but instead of slicing him in two it just cuts into his scaly skin a few inches.  He roars in pain and spits fire at you.  Using Kinectomancy you dodge the flames and let loose with a blast of electrical energy.  Avaradex is electrocuted, this was a lethal dosage.  It would have killed any human half a dozen times over but for someone of his power it merely stunned him.  That was fine however because that gave you all the time you needed to gather pure energy at the tip of your staff and then use Kinectomancy and magic to strengthen your arms.  Your staff smashes into his torso like a spear.  The destructive energy at the tip rips through scales like they were tissues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staff spears through his heart and black blood vomits out of his mouth.  The blood is acidic and you curse as your flesh wards dim down by a third.  The acid must have been incredibly potent to have such an effect.  Luckily for you the battle is over and Avaradex is no more.  You carefully use your magic to slice of his head and seal it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time to show your prize to the most beautiful woman in all the earth.  </span></div></div>",

You despised distractions when working and your neighbors were far from you so any magical malfunctions would not draw prying eyes.  You also never made it a secret where you lived so eventually the Red Court decided to kill you, the foolishly isolated Wizard in the back end of nowhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late and you were returning from a nocturnal walk when you first realized you were being observed.  Your otherworldly senses told you something was wrong.  It was a cold day and you a heavy coat, muttering an incantation you summoned your staff.  Your blasting rod was a small 18 inch piece of carved wood that rested easy on your belt - no need to summon it since it traveled with you wherever you go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampires realizing that you knew they were there attacked.  Two vampires rushed you.  The idiots charged straight at you.  With one smooth motion you lashed out with your blasting rod.  <i>Ogon</i> you whispered and you summoned fire into your mind.  Your magic lashed out and a horizontal, invisible beam of heat made the air blur.  The vampires had supernatural reflexes however they didn't realize what spell had been cast before they felt the heat and at that point it was far too late.  The narrow beam of fire cut them both into two.  Their forms collapsing and burning with a stench that made you think of 3 day old burnt bacon grease.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course those two were the distraction.  Two more Red Court Vampires from hiding had pulled out assault rifles and began firing at you.  Even as you were burning the two vampires charging you has already called up a shield behind you.  The bullets ricocheted off the shield impotently.   A shield is nearly impossible to breach however each impact did cost you energy so it was a poor idea just to let it sit there while they unloaded on you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaintaining the shield you smashed your staff into the ground and muttered another spell.  The ground beneath the two Red Court vampires exploded, they were both sent flying.  However they were vampires and not yet out of the fight.  Another invisible whip of fire burnt another vampire as he was still airborne.  A fourth attack went after the last one within sight however he had landed and seeing what had happened to his comrades he had already rolled away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fifth vampire jumped down onto you from a nearby tree.  You darted forward as you sensed his approach using your magic to give you a burst of speed that outmatched even a vampire. The vampire gave a startled snarl as he crashed into the ground and you cooked his ugly ass with another wave of fire.  Four of the vampire were down.  The gun toting vampire fired his gun at you again but had already darted behind the tree.  The high caliber bullets sent bark flying everywhere.  You decided it was time to test some of your abilities.  Using your blasting rod you unleashed a blast of force onto the ground in a controlled manner, this rocketed you in the air time with your own jump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis give you the momentum needed to hit a 15 foot high branch and then leap down onto the startled vampire.  Using his snake like reflexes he recovered in less than a second and aimed his gun at you.  You summoned your shield in front of you as the bullets whirled into it ricocheting everywhere, one actually hit the vampire in the foot.  The magazine clicked empty as you landed.  Activating another burst of speed you put back your blasting rod, drew a switchblade and slammed it into the vampires head.  You were a blur, if the vampire had expected such an attack he did have the reflexes to avoid it.  Your spells made you far faster then a human but only put you slightly above a Red Court for a moment or two.  However you were a damned Wizard.  They didn't rush at their enemies they fired attacks from long range.  Completely off balance and surprised your blade smashed through his skull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell energy stored in the knife did a lot of the work but the momentum from the attack didn't hurt either.  His skull essentially exploded spilling disgusting blood everywhere.  You brought up a shield around you just in case there was another Red Court Vampire hiding.  No attack came but you had read the Warden briefings, kill teams always traveled in packs of six.  You opened up your third sight and peered around the area.  Ignoring the corpses you spotted one last Vampire watching from another tree but a quarter mile away with binoculars.  Grinning with confidence you unleashed another burst of speed and started sprinting for him.  And another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had unleashed several bits of magic, you were beginning to feel tired.  Five blasts of fire.  Multiple shields, multiple speed enhancements and even some earth magic.  You were glad there was just one remaining.  This one didn't have a gun but he wasn't unarmed.  He had an actual sword.  The practically of such a weapon seemed a bit absurd but it did give him more reach.  Instead of running he waited for your approach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done human but you are lucky I had only these newborns here with me.  A proper squad would of killed you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was cultured and carried a light Spanish accent.  Ah an older specimen.  You did a quick diagnostic to make sure the blade wasn't enchanted and decided to put your defensive wards to the test.  You incant a band of force to surround your staff and give it a twirl.  You were familiar with with the use of a staff through multiple martial arts disciplines, though the idea of fighting a vampire who was stronger and faster then you was rather idiotic.  The vampire knew it too and snarled, \"Pride goeth fool,\"  and launch and vicious slash at your chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the most arrogant grin you could conjure you let the blade strike you.  It ripped through your coat and then struck the spell coated long sleeve shirt you work.  That stopped the blades edge.  Still you were being hit by force three times stronger then the best heavy league baseball hitter.  That's when your flesh ward activated, completely absorbing all of the force behind the blow.  The blow cost you about about 10% of wards in your flesh, better then you had thought.  Of course momentum works both ways so the vampire nearly dropped the blade its sudden arrested motion.  Calling upon your speed one last time you smashed your staff into the the vampires stomach.  Huge quantities of blood sprayed out but the older vampire still had fight in him and impaled himself further onto your staff clawing out for your face.  Not even using a word to channel the energies you simply let your staff radiate force in all directions.  The staff that was still inside the vampire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuck you recall thinking - while brutally effective there was no way you could avoid vampire carcass from splattering your clothes from head to toe.  Afterward you burned the bodies and whistled as your returned to your home.  You had not had a chance to test all of your combat abilities but so far you were at least the equal of the vast majority of the Wardens.  With renewed confidence in your mastery of the arcane arts you whistled all the way back home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***This is a flash back and optional chapter of the story - please go back one chapter to continue on***</span></div></div>",

You free lanced as a bounty hunter and unlike that fool Lockhart you were actually competent.  You had faced down vampires, werewolves, harpies and rogue wizards.  Despite your reputation of being skilled you actually were hiding a fair amount of power as well.  You had delved into the secrets of magic and could probably take on any wizard aside from the Headmaster himself.  You were slightly taller than average coming in just above 6 foot.  You had a lean but muscular frame and while your face would never grace the covers a fashion magazine it had a rugged charm to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were going to to be teaching at the premier institution of magical instruction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already started out eventfully.  You had to drive back Dementors on the train ride there!  It had won you several points with the students for your heroic actions.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou next settled in for the welcoming feast and that is when you saw her.  She had to be only about 13 or 14 years old but she carried herself with such haughty arrogance that you knew she was mature beyond her years.  Her skin was creamy and oh so soft looking.  Her nose which was slightly pug like (cute in your eyes) was raised in the air.  She was from the house of snakes and she walked as if the world should serve at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by God you wanted to serve at her feet.  You had yet to see them but you knew they had to be absolutely perfect!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course an adult hitting on a teenage student would be... unprofessional but you wondered if you could resist.  But weather or not you acted on any of your lusts you knew for sure that you would be gracing her with extra points for her house.  Grading all of her assignments with Os across the board and doing anything in your power to make her life easier and better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pain reached a crescendo and then Pansy lifted off of him and sat down heavily on his chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned as he sucked in deep gasps of air.  \"Did you enjoy that slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mistress.\"  He answered honestly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you aren't supposed to.

Her hair colouring thus differs from most of the House of Black, who generally have dark hair, though Narcissa does possess the arrogant good looks characteristic of her family. Despite her physical differences to her sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda, Harry Potter does describe her as resembling Bellatrix somewhat, though Narcissa was as fair as Bellatrix was dark. However, Narcissa's beauty was somewhat marred by her donning an expression that suggested that she was sniffing dung whenever she was in the company of those she considered her inferiors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen do \"you\" meet with Narcissa?

The core of the wand is dragon heart string, power would radiate from you if you weren't currently hiding it.  As you walk towards the Hogwarts Express you stop in mid stride.  Before you is a vision of perfection - a vision of beauty that leaves you stunned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was nice and slim, her long blonde hair cascaded down her backside.  You saw a sideways view and you saw her full lips speaking.  Behind their glossy shine you saw her perfectly white teeth.  Everything about her screamed poise, power and control.  She turned slightly and you saw the most enchanting blue eyes.  Like frozen sapphires they gleamed with intelligence.  Someone jostles you from behind and your snapped out of your gaze of utter devotion.  Who was this enchantress?  Who was this paragon of beauty?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently cast a disillusionment charm to hide you from eyes.  You creep closer desperate to hear part of the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this year should be very interesting,\" the man next to her drawled.  He was speaking to a boy around your age who was obviously his son.  Their features and hair made them quite similar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy responded, \"With the brooms you are purchasing for the team I'll get to join the Quidditch team and finally show Potter what it means to go up against a Malfoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh an important piece of information.  They were the Malfoy family.  You didn't pay too much attention to politics but even you know the Malfoy family was quite rich and influential.  They were also considered \"dark\" not that this distinction bothered you too much.  After all if this goddess that descended from the realms of paradise had married into this family they must be doing something right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the train was leaving soon they soon bid their son farewell.  You longed to introduce yourself to Mrs. Malfoy but you held back.  You needed to get on the train and furthermore why would she give you the time of day?  You were 12 after all.  And to top it off she was married.  You didn't care what you had to do but one day you would be with Mrs. Malfoy in some capacity.  Her husband (after you got rid of the lucky ponce who currently had her on his arm), her secret lover, her bodyguard, her servant or even her slave.  One way of the other you vowed you would be at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first - get onto the train.  Maybe you could befriend their son?  Learn more about the Goddess you desperately wished to serve.  Or perhaps you should lay back a little and say nothing - make no friends or enemies just observe the lay of the land before proceeding with a course of action.  You had heard that once you arrived that you will be \"sorted\" by a magical artifact that would put you in one of the four houses.  Young Malfoy was probably a Slytherin but that wasn't a 100% guarantee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***FROM WIKIPEDIA THE FOUR HOUSES***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gryffindor </b>values courage, bravery, nerve and chivalry. Its mascot is the lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. The Gryffindor motto is \"Their daring, nerve and chivalry set Gryffindors apart\". The Head of this house is the Transfiguration teacher and Deputy Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall, and the house ghost is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, more commonly known as Nearly Headless Nick. According to Rowling, Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire. The founder of the house is Godric Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hufflepuff </b>values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black are its colours. The Hufflepuff motto is \"Those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil\". The Head of this house is the Herbology teacher Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is The Fat Friar. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ravenclaw </b>values intelligence, creativity, learning, and wit.[HP5][HP7] The house mascot is an eagle and the house colours are blue and bronze (blue and grey in the films). The Ravenclaw motto is \"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure\". The head of this house is the Charms professor, Filius Flitwick, and the house ghost is The Grey Lady. According to Rowling, Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air. The founder of this house is Rowena Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Slytherin </b>house values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness; the Sorting Hat said in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that Slytherins will do anything to get their way. The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colours are green and silver. The Slytherin motto is \"Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness\". Salazar Slytherin founded the house. The Head of House is Severus Snape until near the end of the sixth book. Then, Horace Slughorn, the previous Head of House, comes out of retirement re-assuming authority. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody Baron.[24] According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, located under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book as having a greenish glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***End Wikipedia Copy***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what house you would probably be sorted in.  Ravenclaw made a lot of sense so you craved knowledge which brought power. Though the desiring of power was quite Slytherin so that house would also fit.  Both houses prized wit and cunning which  you had ample of. The other two houses were less likely but you suspected the sorting hat could put you in one of those houses as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHufflepuff didn't quite fit though you were hard working.  However your primary drive in life was now to serve Mrs. Malfoy.  Your loyalty was beyond fanatical you would die for her if necessary.   The last house was Gryffindor and you thought that was least likely.  While you had courage and nerve in abundance you weren't headstrong.  You were a planner.  Also while you would be chivalrous with the wondrous Lady Malfoy you didn't have such thoughts about other women.  Granted you could be polite if it gained you an advantage but that probably didn't get counted as true chivalry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts about the various houses were put on hold as you knew you had to make a decision soon about if you wanted to try to befriend the young Malfoy now or lie low.  What do you do?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crawl  underneath the table and clean my shoes mudblood.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" you reply respectfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco shot Pansy a glance and said.  \"No... wait.

I understand my place in society be it licking the shoes of my superiors or teaching them magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPansy and Draco were starring daggers at each other.

The two clearly were not skilled wizards and the entire underpinning of the social order of the Wizarding World was shown to be absurd.  Here were two pure-blood wizards who had less talent than the greenest muggle-born.  It was an exercise in patience to actually teach them anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all better than those two.  Pansy lagged behind but you suspected it was due to her anger at having to be 'taught' by you than any lack of natural skill.  Draco was the only one who actually showed a proficiency in magic.  His reflexes were good and his parents had prepared him well for Hogwarts.  He was no budding genius but you could work with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few lessons they were already demonstrably better at dueling.  You had them practice duel each other with simple Stunning Spells.  You taught them the importance of dodging and accuracy.  Soon you moved onto other basic dueling spells.  Things were going quite well, news around school was about the 'Heir' and that silliness.  In theory this 'heir of Slytherin' may target you but you were beyond confident in your ability to deal with any threat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Winter holidays were coming and that could lead to some possibilities.

You wouldn't move to save yourself.  You were broken.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she removed her shoe and you gasped and coughed for air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her wand and hammered you with a barrage of vicious stinging hexes to the chest.

Placing a hand on the back of your head she works the other hand between Bethany's ass and your face so she can pry your mouth open. \"That's it hawke kiss her ass. How's your baby sisters ass taste.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you thought this waitress may claim to not be a whore but she certainly talks like one. But then you noticed Isabela's smirk and not for the first time you found yourself lost in her hasel eyes. \"Lick her ass hawke, you can do it make me wet.\" She moaned softly into your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it you'd do anything to hear that erotic voice whisper into your ear again. Soon the misery of the world around you faded away, the humiliating stare of the watching crowd, the waitresses antagonizing chatter, the foul taste of Bethany's backside. Even the humiliating stain in your panties that showed just how much you were enjoying this faded from your mind. All that you cared about was making Isabela happy. \"Lick it, clean her asshole.\" Isabela repeated. With out thinking of what you were doing, you extended your tongue and ran it up the inside of Bethany's crack, grazing over her puckered sphincter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabela didn't need to see your tongue, the low moan from your sister told her you had done as she said. Isabela's trademark grin turned into a full smile; she had you now, body and soul. After this she would pay your sister the fifty gold for her help and keep you as a sex slave. Now to finish the job; Isabela spoke into your ear.   \"Good girl, now go deeper make...\" \"yeah tongue fuck your sisters ass\" the waitress chimed in cutting off what ever else Isabela was going to say. Isabela looked up over you at the waitress with an anoyed expression that made the offending girl avert her eyes, but then Isabela laughed. \"Your getting horny watching my pet play. Regretting not letting her kiss your bare ass now are we? tell you what If you want to feel her tongue on you. then crawl under me and start kissing my pussy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looked around at the crowded tavern, nervously eyeing them. You knew she would do it her fate was sealed the moment Isabela told her what to do. Slowly the waitress stood. Watching as you continued to rim Bethany's ass. Walking around you to Isabela's side the waitress droped to a prone position with her face up. Crawling under the pirate's Bareilly elivated ass, she was surprised to find the other woman was going commando. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabela moaned as the waitress started eating her pussy. The sound further intoxicating you. Turning her attention back to you Isabela said \"good now tongue your sister deep in her ass make her cum.\" <br>\r\nYou did, Bethany came screaming in ecstasy as your tongue snaked its way further into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another three hours the activities ended with you tongue fucking the waitress to orgasem as per Isabela's instruction. Shaking with need you beg Isabela for relief, while Bethany sits behind you with a knowing smile and a small bag of gold. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually the waitress was done with you worshiping her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I forgiven?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... you see Isabela suggested I really milk this for all it was worth and that means you're about to earn me some coin!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks... what was she going to make you do?  </span></div></div>",

It made contact with your face and a vocal fart pushed her hot gasses into your nostrils.  You gag at the wretched stench and struggle some more.  Sadly you are held tight by the crowd and your bounds and there is no where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh pardon me but this might be a big load, those that can cover your noses!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rowdy patrons cheered again, this was exciting and new.  They had seen murders in this bar, fights and even a strip show.  This would be the first time they had seen a pretty lass shit in the mouth of a beautiful woman who had humiliated them.  They were crowding around, this was would be talked about for ages.  At that moment you hated them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first piece of shit crowned the waitresses anus and you turned your head to the side, desperate to avoid it.  Rough pairs of hands straighten your face, there was no avoiding it but you would be damned if you opened your mouth for that brown turd being pushed out of another woman's ass!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foul piece of human waste touched your lips and you shuddered in disgust.  You kept your mouth closed as people screamed at you to open your mouth.  Fuck them, you weren't going to do it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella had other plans however.  You felt a dagger touch your cunt and her voice cut in.  \"Open or my blade goes in deep.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry of horror you open your mouth and accept the vile offering.  The bar explodes in cheers as the waitress shits into your open mouth.  Your tongue curdles away from the foulness but it soon completely fills your mouth.  You begin to sweat and shake as your body bucks underneath the grasping hands in an reflexive desire to escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turd broke off into your mouth, a mouth full of shit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got plenty more where that come girl better chew and swallow 'me waste now!\" The waitress laughed at the despair and revulsion in your eyes.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What followed was the longest night of your life.  You served dozens of women who had all kinds of feet.  Dwarves, elves, humans you served them all.  Some feet were clean, others were dirty and disgusting.  Some had bunions, others were beautiful.  Some were rank enough to make you gag while others seemed perfumed.  You served them all, licking, kissing, sucking, massaging and slaving away at those feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress was certainly making her money off of you!  As the hours passed you longed to take a nice hot bath.  A nice hot bath and the chance to scrub your mouth out with soap! The taste of feet seemed to be etched into the flesh of your tongue.  The verbal barbs at your status had burned for the first few hours but as you passed into the night they barely effected you, far worse was your aching knees, your tired tongue and the stench clinging to your face like cloying rot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your odious tasks were complete as the sun peaked over the horizon.  It was dawn, you had worshiped so many feet, every part of you was sore and fatigued.  The waitress came down from her room (her own rooms were at the inn).  Her purse was full of silver and she was looking refreshed, no doubt a warm meal, good drink, a soft bed and a chance to wash up had done wonders for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well did you have fun last night my little foot servant?\"  She mocked you with the casual question.  You dared not offend her so you meekly lowered your head.  \"Yes ma'am I did.  Thank you for using me and helping you make money.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and then outright laughed in your face.  \"Ya sure are hung up over that pirate wench.  Well she should be around in an hour or so and I'd like to take it easy for now so you'll do my morning work for me.  Go mop the floors while I lounge here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  You bob your head and haul your tired body up and get started on HER morning workload as a waitress.  A little surge of hate fills your heart as the waitress relaxes after her good night's sleep.  You do your duties for the next 90 minutes or so when one of the waitresses friends tells her that Isabela is on her way back.  The waitress grins, \"Well have anything else to say my little foot minion?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that it was an honor to serve you ma'am.  Thank you for letting me kiss your feet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that I beg you, please, please say that I am forgiven when you meet with Isabela.  Please, I have done everything you asked, please I'm begging you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned.  \"Continue.\"  And you continued to beg, your tired mind thinking up of new ways to plead for her forgiveness.  After another 10 minutes of pathetic pleading she tells you to stop and walks outside.  Her footwear are a pair of battered leather boots and they squish in the mud.  It looks like it had rained last night, you hadn't paid much attention as you had other things on your mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber pots had been thrown out the night before and the night soil was thick and heavy in the street.  This being the poor part of the town they weren't well maintained like Hightown.  Soon enough Isabela approached and seeing her saunter forward was a balm to your weary spirit.  Her presence would make your hardship that you had endured worth it.  She would see how loyal and obedient you were and let you be with her.  Your spirits were soaring higher and higher when Isabela smiled at the waitress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?  Do you forgive her for her rudeness?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looked to you and then back at Isabela and said... </span></div></div>",

I licked dozens of feet, I did her morning chores I didn't have a wink of sleep last night.  Please don't dismiss me, please stay with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress snorted and then laughed.  \"You'd think she would of learned her lesson the last time she was rude?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabela smirked and then looked down at you.  \"You really are a pathetic creature.  Do you have any money left?  If so give it to me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly reach into your pouch and take out the last bit of gold you had left after your earlier expenses.  You had it to her and Isabela just laughs.  \"Really Hawke you are quite the pathetic specimen.  I don't think I've ever met someone quite as hopeless as you.  I'm off to go live my life away from here I suggest you do the same you silly lesbian twat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she turns away and you catch one last glimpse of her amble and sexy ass as she walks out of your life.  The waitress laughs.  \"Oh that was priceless I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life. Since you're on the ground already why don't you come over here and lick this mud, muck and shit off my boots?\"  It was clear the waitress was having a laugh at your expense she didn't seem to think you would actually do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for some reason... for some reason you started to crawl toward her.  Why were you doing this?  This waitress wasn't ugly but she didn't hold a candle to Isabela.  This lowly serving wench had cost you the opportunity to actually be with Isabela!  You should hate her and despise her!  Why then were you crawling and approaching her filthy boots?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Andraste are you actually going to do it?  Are you going lick shit from my boots?  What is wrong with you Hawke?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears well in your eyes, \"I don't know... I don't know!  I can't seem to stop myself.\"  You answer honestly.  \"Please don't make me do this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looks at you in bewilderment.  \"You're insane but if you can't say no to me... well I think I've got plenty of use for you.  And you know what?  I was joking about licking the filthy from my boots but now you are going to do it.  Come on Hawke you crazy girl come lick 'em clean!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears run down your cheeks as you lower your face to her boots and take the first of many licks...</span></div></div>",

Now I need you to fill some forms while I get the backroom ready.  Oh and I'll need to get measurements and get a base line understanding of your parts.  We'll begin today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite fully understanding you took the form she handed you.  Several were broiler plate \"you know the consequences could be awful but you fully agree to take part in the clinical trial.\"  But others... others were odd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow often do you have sex?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow often do you masturbate?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen was the last time you ejaculated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit squeamish but ultimately you answered truthfully.  You'd had sex a few months ago, you didn't put down it was an escort but that wasn't important.  You also put down you jerk off 4-5 times a week and that you had last ejaculated two days ago.  It was deeply humiliating to know that your perspective dating partner would know all this but you knew she would be furious if you screwed up her clinical trial and that would doom any budding relationship between the two of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done?  Excellent now let's go back to the exam room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving there you were told to strip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to my boxers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all the way.  Try to stay flaccid I'll be measuring your cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"  You were caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now chop chop my little guinea pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing you stripped off and exposed your cock.  She quickly took out a measuring tape and measured the length, width and circumference.  Her hands were a bit cool to the touch but even so your manhood began to rise as she touched your member with her fingers and the tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Dr. Takemi, I'm not sure I can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a sigh of frustration.  \"Very well I got most of them before you lost control.  Now let's measure you at full mast.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand began to jerk your cock slowly and then with more speed as you looked at her in shock.  This was surprising but also incredibly arousing.  Soon you were standing at attention just under 6 inches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Average size, not bad.  All right stay there and I'll get some ice to bring it back down.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh could you... you know... bring it down some other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Not only will that not work for the experiment I'll be running but you aren't here to get your rocks off.  I'm going to go on a date with you but I'm not whoring myself out to you.  I'm disgusted you even asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Dr. Takemi.\"  You look down, flushing a bit in the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned and had you press an ice pack to your achingly hard cock to have it shrink back down.  Then she brought a metal contraption out.  What in the world... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity, I had actually hoped you would recognize what a chastity device is.  But I guess you aren't into that scene.  Nonetheless this little device will be placed around your penis.  It will prevent you from hardening which is of critical importance for this test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted.

The fear came after Piper had released a torrent of diarrhea into your mouth. Cait was having Curie lick the piss from her cunt as a sign of submission, since she had fallen out of favor when Piper started crapping in you almost twice daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know Curie\" Cait inquired \"i can't help but notice you only ever pee in Nora's mouth. you're not still harboring feelings for a toilet are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurie looks up from her duties a little bit of Cait's piss soaked pubic hair tickling nose as she does so. \"No mistress, im just saving up for a large load.\" she coily implies with a shake of her hips. her words catch Piper's attention as she deposits another can of Longneck Lukowski's potted meat into your mouth; spraying flecks of shit into your eyes and up your nose as the brown stream of goop pours out her ass.<br>\r\nCait smiles wickedly down at the synth girl. \"how long has it been since you last shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"about three weeks\" Curie answers an impish smile on her face as she looks back at you and Piper. <br>\r\nPiper listens intently to their conversation reaching between her legs and playing with her self while farting in your face.<br>\r\ntaking notice of Piper's arousal Cait pulls Curie up from between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what a blumpkin is right?\" Cait whispers in her ear.<br>\r\n\"the performance of oral sex on a person while they shit.\" Curie answers clinically not quite catching on.<br>\r\n\"good go give Piper one, and tell Nora just what exactly you're brewing in your stomach for her while your there.\" Cait responds her voice having lost it's commanding tone making the order sound more like an suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurie stands up fully and walks over to Piper. Piper having heard what Cait told her to do opens her legs and smiles. \"don't spare her any details.\" she says as Curie drops to her knees and straddles your chest. soon the abundance of light is replaced by Curie's smiling face, you whimper at the sight of her. <br>\r\n\"Hello toilet.\" she chides you. \"don't mind me it's just your not allowed to taste this sweet pussy juice.\" she says as she extends her tongue into the pussy above you. her exaggerated licks cause Piper to moan while another fart blasts your face filling the bowl with foul gas. Piper begins playing with her nipples giving Cait a show while she begins leaking more shit into your hole. Curie pauses her licking and watches intently as poop fills your mouth. smiling Curie says.\"im going to enjoy doing that to you.\"<br>\r\nYour eyes lock on hers fearing what she is telling you.<br>\r\n\"I've been holding it in for some time now.\" Curie explains. resuming her tongues exploration of Piper's vaginal canal.<br>\r\nAnother fart causes a torrent of diarrhea to fill your mouth. Giggling Curie leans back avoiding the splash of overflowing shit. <br>\r\nPiper rests a hand on the back of Curies head pulling her back into the shitting woman's core. Curie looks up into Pipers eyes questioningly.<br>\r\n\"Please me.\" Piper orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurie smiles before moving her tongue in long wide strokes across Pipers lips. she pushes her tongue in and out of Piper's entrance as a grumble of movement comes from the reporters intestines. you groan as the previous burst of diarrhea drains into your stomach the feeling of overeating making you nauseous.<br>\r\n\"what's wrong toilet? is seeing me eating out your ex-girlfriend making you jealous or are you more concerned with how much more shit she's able to feed you?\" Curie taunts as she extends her tongue to tickle Piper's asshole. Piper moans at the sensation, closing her eyes as a log of solid poop starts moving down to her ass. Curie continues massaging Pipers asshole with her tongue, softening the ring of muscle. anticipating whats to come Cait stands up and walks over to the trio. when Piper opens her eyes again Cait is holding one of her nipples up to Piper's face. Piper takes the nub of flesh between her teeth and suckles it. while Curie moves back to licking her pussy leaving her to shit unobstructed into your waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou start crying of shame as the corn riddled poop extends from Piper's hole down to you. seeing the obscene log enter your mouth Curie nibbles at Piper's clit causing the girl to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nstanding up shakily, Piper smiles at Curie \"You're turn.\"<br>\r\nCurie smiles back as Cait walks Piper over to a nearby seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back into the box hands on her hips Curie watches as you wretch on the crap still left in your mouth. unable to speak or beg you stare at Curie pleadingly hoping she'll be merciful. <br>\r\nCurie watches your hands for a moment then leans in. \"hope you saved room for dessert.\" she says. your heart sinks as you hear three weeks of built up shit begin to move within her. \"I've been waiting ages to have you sample my chocolate mousse.\" Curie giggles evilly as she settles her off white butt over you. you whimper and cry as Curie's ass winks open at you. she farts blowing chunks into your face. hearing the loud expulsion of gas Cait laughs commenting to Piper \"god i can smell that from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper nods her head and watches the scene intently. Curie keeps farting blowing more chunks across your face. she then starts peeing. a horrid smelling yellow liquid spills out of her, cleaning the remnants of your last meal from your mouth. as her stream slows to an end, you see her ass open wide revealing the crown of a monster. the bulbous head of shit breaks off landing in your mouth just past your teeth you know you can't swallow this thing. and that you'll have to let it dissolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurie grunts again as another fart escapes. Cait stands up and walks over, peeking between Curie's spread legs she smiles at you; a wicked gleam in her eye as you both notice the ram rod of shit beginning to creep out of Curie's back side. she stradles Curie's hips pressing their breasts together in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"spread your legs a little more, i need to pee.\" she says. Curie shifts around some taking hold of Cait's butt to hold her up while the Irish girl empties her bladder onto your face. Piper continues watching as Curie and Cait start to make out above you. frantically you lick away at the crap already in your mouth hoping to clear room for the piece slowly descending towards you. pee from Caits bladder splashes down on the crap in your mouth dissolving it faster and for the first time your thankful for Cait using your mouth as a piss pot. Curie's hard crap pushes into your mouth forcing itself down. you try to relax your throat muscles but it doesn't help your long dead gag reflex kicks back into life and you start to choke. your sputtering and twitching getting the attention of the girls above you. they look down between themselves and watch you struggle to consume the shit still exiting from Curie.</span></div></div>",

This meant that you didn't use your blades together with your ninjutsu very often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't do much with genjutsu however you were well versed in how to break out of it.

Unfortunately being from such a small town you aren't given a starter Pokemon rather you are left to catch your first one alone. Heading south you come to a trail leading into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with only food and poke balls you're senses heighten trying to listen or see any good Pokemon. Suddenly you hear rustling and catch a glimpse of a Meowth running off the path into thicker woods. It being the first Pokemon you have seen today you chase after the noises in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowing down you begin to hear voices \" But Jessie our mugshots are everywhere we can't get close enough in town to steal his Pikachu!\" A male voice exclaimed. Pushing thru the brush you see the Meowth next to a blue haired man dressed in a standard Team Rocket uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" THATS NO EXCUSE YOU PATHETIC WORM!\" Yelled a woman stepping into view. She had long red hair and a very attractive yet bitchy looking face. Her uniform was also Team Rocket but much more risque complete with a mini skirt and black thigh high boots. Her perfect tall body filled out her uniform nicely, you begin to blush slightly just noting the attributes of this seemingly very angry/evil woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught in the daze of watching both of the Rockets notice you. \"You! Boy! Surrender your pokemon to us now or face the consequences!\" The man yelled but then was quickly struck down by the gorgeous red head. \"SILENCE JAMES!\" She yelled. The man was quick to obey and fell to his knees like a broken dog. \"Yes Jessie..\" He responded quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie began to walk toward you in a sultry manner \"We may be able to use him...what's your name boy?\" She asked while raising an eyebrow.\" My...my name is Colin \" You respond still caught off guard by her good looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well Colin.. I may need your help with something. An evil young man named Ash has stolen a valuable Pikachu from our innocent organization and I can't quite make it to town to get it back do you think you could possibly get it for me? I can make sure you are well compensated for your time.\" Jessie then bit her lip and tugged slightly at the top of her shirt with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing again while she stared into your eyes you hear James and Meowth snickering, clearly she was using you the whole story was bullshit.\" I know what Team Rocket does! I won't help you steal someone's Pokemon!\" You respond with courage daring to break her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired goddess laughed in your face \"Bahahaha look at this little hero! You're quite right I may be a little more evil than I first implied....but I can see the way you look at me..\" Her tone once again turned seductive. \" I have that effect on all men, see James over there? He used to stare at me the way you do....but now he just obeys like a good little boy. Just like you will soon obey me Colin and do whatever I say..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped unable to respond as Jessie gazed into your eyes \"You will get that Pikachu for me, but first like a Pokemon you need to be trained...\"</span></div></div>",

Make me happy and you'll get to use your stick on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as she pressed her forehead against yours, she quickly grabbed your head in a rough fashion and hissed, \"But disobey me or make me angry in any way and I'll make sure you will fear me when I look the slightest bit displeased! Do you understand me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, making her calm down enough for you to attempt to escape. You ducked down ,took a few steps away, and began to turn around. A part of you wondered why she was smirking at you... until you tripped and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ekans!\" A purple snake said as it quickly coiled around your lower legs. A blue-ish green snake also appeared and began to wrap itself around your arms and torso as it cried out, \"Seviper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie began to cover her mouth and chuckle at you for a few moments before she looked down at you with a smile and said, \"I almost pity you. James, Meowth, go look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left, Jessie sat on your lower legs and began to undo your pants. \"I do hope you're a big boy where it counts. If not, then we're gonna have to work on your technique...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she undid your pants and pulled them down, she laughed, \"Briefs? How amusing, Colin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free me!\" You shouted. Jessie's response was to crawl until her pussy covered your briefs-covered erection forward. She then began to bow, making kissing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeviper moved about to let Jessie press her boobs against your chest. As expected, she began to kiss you. Mostly all over your face and avoiding your lips. She paused and said, \"Oh my... I can tell that little Colin is getting bigger!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It appeared to be metal with a red R on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this? We use this for breaking in Pokemon that don't want to obey our will.\" Jessie said as she fastened it around your neck tightly. \" Just in case you decide to try and escape or disobey tonight... get too far away or if I click this button....\" BZZZRT!!!

I only want to obey!!\" You pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you won't have to worry about being shocked now will you?\" She said playfully. Jessie then stood up and walked past her kneeling slaves. \"Both of you, take off your clothes..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and you stand up to oblige her order stripping down quickly. You then both return to your knees. You notice your penis is as hard as ever while obeying this cruel woman. Out of the corner of your eye James seemed to be having a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie approached the two of you happy with your servitude.

We need to get out of here first.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and you two continue your flight.  You hoped that you managed to knock the two members of Team Rocket out... because if you didn't they would soon sic their pokemon on you.  Even now the thought of being captured and put under Jessie's control excited you but you shake your head clearing your thoughts.  You had to get this poor woman to safety!</span></div></div>",

That was something of a joke as you were quite a bit more powerful than that.  You had a Kagune that could split into three parts.  You specialized in making them extremely solid flat surfaces, a shield in other words, that could stop the most deadly attacks.  Beyond that you were an extremely skilled marital artist and exceptional with all manner of weaponry.  You even used a quinque that you had taken off of the corpse of a CCG member.  Like all ghouls you had regenerative powers, strength and speed that was greater than a normal human.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs powerful as you were you knew you were not the top of the food chain.  There weren't many ghouls or doves that could defeat you but a few did exist and you had no desire to make a name for yourself and draw the attention of the absurdly powerful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sometimes acted a mercenary both pretending to be a human or as a ghoul.  You even robbed an armored car once.  Many ghouls were foolishly short sighted in terms of how to make money.  Auction off people?  Offer yourself as a mercenary to fight the CCG?  A good way to get yourself killed... when it was far easier just to assassinate regular humans.  Cleaning a crime scene so it didn't appear as if a ghoul had done the action was another skill you had learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we know who you, Kai the ghoul are.

Like a weird combination of 'him proving he's the strongest mate by killing a lot of gremlins' (even if that was not his intention and gremlins don't normally care about mating) and the fact that gremlins seem to hate Mogwai that refuse to change into gremlins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yes, she might decide to enslave Billy into becoming her lover/slave, simply because she might hate Gizmo that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows Greta thinks of Kate Beringer? A rival to Billy's affections? A possible slave? Or are Greta and Kate somehow in cahoots in the desire to enslave Billy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist who made the various vials of serums. Let's trim it down to one person whose very smart. That way, Greta is drawn to him because of how great his intelligence is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand how she either wants to enslave him or make herself (and any gremlins she spawns from water) into powerful gremlins that can take over the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she just wants to turn all human women into gremlins like herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember the intermission of the second movie, where the fourth wall was broken, not only in the video, but in the theater version and even the novelization?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Greta manages to escape the gremlins series and invades other worlds of fiction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her being a gremlin and their tendency for being able to hotwire any tech destruction, her invading a techno-based series would be devastating. </span></div></div>",
