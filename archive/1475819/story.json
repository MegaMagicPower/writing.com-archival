She felt pressurized pain caused by her foot stretching and lower leg shrinking simultaneously. Amber found herself now leaning against the door just to stand up as the pain in her feet stopped, her heel now halfway up her shin, giving the illusion of her having a backwards knee. She watched helplessly as her toes shortened and blonde fur grew on her feet and up her new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is this happening?\u201d She cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spine make a loud crack as it slowly bent forward. Amber leaned harder against the door, but her spine overwhelmed her and sent her falling on all fours. Amber tried desperately to rise, but between her new spine configuration and unbalanced feet, she fell time and again. Now trapped on all fours, Amber surveyed her body and realized that her limbs had been reconfigured into a canine structure. She didn\u2019t want to believe it, but she knew that she was turning into a dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stiffened as she felt something pushing out the bottom of her spinal chord. She kept her eyes forward as her tears fell to ground below her, for she did not wish to watch her own body change. She heard a loud rip as the growing lump tore through her jean shot-shorts and extended. Her elongated spinal chord then fell between her legs, pivoting back and forth. She didn\u2019t have to look back to know that she had grown a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be an animal! I\u2019m a human!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sobbed feeling the fur flood her body up to her neckline in a continuous streak of itchiness and discomfort. The fur then met with the patch traveling up her arms to cover her body from the neck down. Amber could feel her bones and organs shifting and shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that her attractive curvy feminine figure was growing smaller and filling out to a parallel state. Amber could tell that under her shorts and tank-top, dwelled the body of a dog and not the young woman that it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease\u2026 oh God make it stop! I can\u2019t be a dog! I have my whole life ahead of me! This can\u2019t happen to me!\u201d She screamed between her uncontrollable sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur started on her neck, thickening it wider as it grew. Amber shook her head desperately trying to stop the transformation. The final patch of fur then sprouted on her face neatly blending in with her human hair. She could partly see that her nose was turning black and flattening on her face as her ears grew into points and moved to the top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to scream again, but her jaw clamped shut tightly. Amber could feel her teeth growing into points as her whole face began to stretch forward. Within seconds she could plainly see the top of her nose on the end of the log furry bridge that was her new canine muzzle. Her jaw loosened as the feeling on the transformation left her body. It was over. As Amber looked back at her body, she realized she had been completely transformed into a yellow dog.  The tears fell from her eyes like a faucet now, as her mind was clouded with questions that all lead to her living the rest of her life as a common mutt. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lifts a hand and touches her ears, the right, then the left, feeling that they had become more pointed, with a light coating of fuzz now covering them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What's Happening?\" She exclaimed. \" How can\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon fur starts poking through her skin along the sides of her face and neck, a brushing feeling. A slight sting enters her eyes, very briefly, as the fur starts to cover her face. A black smudge touches her nose. She wondered where the smudge could have come from. No, Amber thought frantically, her nose was turning black! Cracks and jolts rocked her face as her mouth pushed outward into a dog\u2019s muzzle, quickly becoming covered in soft golden fur. Her teeth sharpened, into fangs, as her tongue lengthened further and further out with her muzzle. The human hair she had began to fall out, falling gradually to the floor, to be replaced by the same fur that was invading the rest of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, stop. Nogghhh.\" A lump formed in Amber\u2019s throat. Her vocal chords were changing. \" Ngghhh, Grrrrfff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shook her head, and with a huge effort, tried once more to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrfff\u2026 Grrrr\" Was the best she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber moved a, hand?, up. They weren\u2019t hands, Amber thought desperately. Not anymore. Her hands, paws, were changing, her fingers were shorter and her thumbs were now a long way up her wrist, with short black claws protruding out. Leathery pads had developed on her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-help me!\" She tried to call out, but could only make a high-pitched whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber slashed her right paw down her shirt, ripping the buttons apart, tearing the garment off her body. She was horrified to find thick golden fur covering almost all of her chest  along with two rows of 6 new nipples a piece running down her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure built up at the base of her spine, an uncomfortable pulling sensation. No, not that, she thought urgently, not a tail! She fell to the floor, crawling hysterically out of her jeans as the pressure of her changing hips and legs became too much to bear, using her newly formed forepaws to drag herself along. She watched, panting, as her new tail grew at an astonishing rate, snaking out until it lay on her backside. God, she could feel the thing sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassment flushed her mind as the fur grew across her hips. Bone cracked across her legs as they became thinner, differently jointed, suited to the rest of her body. Her feet cricked and Amber was pushed up on to her toes, on to all fours like the animal she knew she was becoming. Leathery pads invaded the bottom of her altering feet, while fur grew on the few patches of skin that still remained bare. Amber tried to stand, strained to get up, but clumsily fell back on to her four legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plethora of new smells started to invade her canine nose. The sounds became crisper, clearer, the birds around the office now seeming much closer than they ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the changes stopped. Amber looked over her golden-furred body, at her tail, her four paws, at her black nose, which was always in her vision. A golden retriever. That was what she was. Not human anymore, not physically at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out! Let me out of this, please! I don\u2019t want to be an animal!\" she tried to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Grrrr ahoooo.\" She howled, vainly attempting to call out for help. </span></div></div>",

A light dripping of saliva was dripping off her tongue as she watched, starting to turn to face the TV better, sitting on her hands and feet as she watched. </span></div></div>",

The car heard the bark and turned to see where it came from.  Immediately scared, it left the flower bed and flee from the threatening bark.  Katie stopped barking and was relieved that the cat was away.  But then she realized something, that she never barked before in her life.  That\u2019s when she remembers Lauren cursing her.  She stated on the phone that she has no idea when the changes were taking place and it could happen at random events.  So it was obvious that she got aroused when she saw dogs making out on Animal Planet and the constant barking when she saw that cat attacking her flower bed.  So she shrugged her shoulders and said to herself, \u201cWow\u2026  Guess Lauren was right about the curse.  I have to be careful on what I\u2019m going to do or people will notice something suspicious about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said that, she felt a strange feeling coming from her body but couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it.  She then felt prickles on her skin and she was itching for a bit.  Katie scratched a bit and was getting aggravated about it.  Looking down at her arm, she noticed small little hairs coming out of her skin and had a golden blond color like her hair.  She guessed that it was beginning process of her fur.  It wasn\u2019t visible yet, but it will be a matter of time before it covered her body completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her scratching, she noticed something else on her hands.  There was some fat growing on her thin and slender fingers.  She could also see her nails loosing its red nail polish color and ends were looking a little sharper.  Again, another change the Katie has to deal with, as she knew it would be a matter of time before she loose her hands completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her ears felt a little pain and were almost feel like they were moving around.  Wondering if its another one of those changes, Katie approached the mirror and checked his face.  So nothing has changed but her ears looked a little different.  The top tips of her ears looked a little pointed and they appear to be moving by a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the changes started, it immediately stopped and nothing else was different about her.  She was lucky that the changes were minimal.  But in a matter of hours, these changes would get much stronger and everyone will notice her.  Leaving that aside, she decided to do something else for her free time.  What would Katie do now?</span></div></div>",
