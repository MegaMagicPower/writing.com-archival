You freeze up, before remembering your gun and taking it out. The giantess is a young woman, probably around your age. She had tanned skin and long black hair that reached down to the middle of her back. Her azure eyes looked at you, fixated on what was probably a tiny creature to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She wore clothing that was meant to cover up rather than provide modesty, a makeshift bra and panties, indicating that she was like you, probably on the run. Though you wouldn't believe that, she was many times bigger than you and whatever scared her would probably kill you without breaking into a sweat. \" Put your gun down, I mean you no harm.\" Her voice was sweet but seemed to have a tinge of sorrow in it, in this age you wouldn't fault anyone for that though. \" Can't, you are huge and frankly, I can't take that chance. So no chance until you can convince me otherwise.\" you say to her, not wishing to fall for her traps if she had any planned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She seems hurt by this but tries again to persuade you that nothing is wrong with her, \" I can help you. I could protect you from the guerillas, we're alike you and me. We both want to survive.\" she says to you, taking a step forward. The ground shakes as she steps forward, you are under her shadow, you thought she was about 70 feet tall using nearby buildings as a comparison. \" I would love to but I can't trust strangers.\" you say, turning off the trigger. Suddenly, it occured to you that this pistol probably couldn't kill her or even inflict significant damage. \" I just want to help you, we could survive together and even be friends, you have no idea how bad it is to be alone. I don't even know how I got to be like this, just woke up and I'm a monster to everyone plus we're all at war!\" she howled, tears welling up in her eyes. </span></div></div>",

You didn't want to expend ammunition anyway. She smiles before saying, \" Thank you, you're the first one to trust me. The rest just run or even shoot me. I have some scars it.\" She turns around to reveal small scars, where the bullets had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Well you are very intimidating, even the guerillas seem friendly when I saw you.\" you tell her, she understands why but it seems to make her sad. \" Where are you heading?\" you ask her. ' I don't know, somewhere safe I guess.\" she said. \" Well I hear there is a safe place about 500 miles to the east. No guerillas, protect by government forces or whatever is left of them.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Guess that is where we are headed then.\" she says, she places her palm next to you, intending for you to get on. ' Look, I don't know how to say this but we just met and I-' She cuts you off before you can answer. \" Look, it'll be faster this way. I can cover more distance than you can. Besides, I won't bite. I just ate.\" she says, you wondered what she ate but it was best not ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Do you need supplies or anything from the supermarket?\" you ask her. She laughs at that, \" I don't know how  but I can go without food and water for days on end, I've never felt the urge to eat until after a week of being a giantess.\" she says to you. </span></div></div>",

You rummage in a box until you hear a shotgun being cocked.  Then you hear the voice of a kid of about 16 say \"Those are mine, and so is the rest of this store.\" you then see the pile of dead guerillas in the corner.  You look over at the kid.  He has cold ice blue eyes short dark brown hair.  Guns and grenades are strapped to him everywhere.  The shotgun is currently out of a holster on his back.  You put your hands up and back out of the store.  He follows until he sees Jenny.  His eyes go wide and he backs into the store.  She knocks on the roof saying \"we just want supplies, nothing else\" he is already in a back corner cowering.  \"I won't hurt you!\"  Maybe it was fate the guerillas showed up then.  A van is driven up the street a ways until 10 armed soldiers jump out.  You climb over a fallen pillar and take cover.  They all see Jenny and take aim but she is running at them full speed.  They start to run seeing a seventy foot tall lady running at them.  The van pulls away leaving the guerillas to find hiding spots.  They all escape through allies and side streets leaving you alone again.  Jenny calls into the supermarket again. \"Can we get some supplies now?\" \"Take anything, please don't hurt me!\" he eventually calls out of the store.  You fill up an old backpack with supplies before leaving.  The guerillas drive up again this time in four vans.  They all have SMGs or RPGs.  You go back to cover and Jenny ducks behind the remains of a building.  With this many both of you would be killed.  Then the kid appears on top of the store.  He throws a grenade into a van and ducks down again.  The whole van explodes leaving a good chunk of the guerillas dead.  The remaining guerillas run into the store.  The kid jumps over to the next roof and hits a hand trigger.  The entire building falls to the ground but the supplies are in the next building over.  You look over at him and Jenny pops out from behind the building.  Shots are fired at the kid and he falls behind the cover on top of the building.  You gun the last guerilla down with your pistol.  Jenny runs over to the building and looks down at him holding his stomach.  Blood begins to pool beneath him and he says to Jenny, \" There's a medkit in every crate inside.  She pulls a crate out of the building and sets it by him.  He pulls the kit out and administers himself.  \"Help yourself to a crate.  There's everything you could ever need in there.\" Jenny looks down at the poor kid, and asks \"do you want to come with us?  There's more than enough room.\"    </span></div></div>",

He looked to you, briefly with a distant look on his face. He then peered up at Jenny rather nervously, at he started to limp towards you. You can tell he is uncomfortable with the giantess, but you think he may get used to it. Jenny then reaches down and reaches for the boy. He jumps a little when her hand gets close but then tense up and holds his breathe as she wraps her figures around him. He grimaces as she lifts him up and she loosens her grip as she set him down on her open palm. She then looks to you with her sharp eyes and lowers her hand. You quickly step up onto it and she then lifts you up as well. You get a nervous sense of vertigo as she picks you up, and calmly set you next to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the three of you leave, jenny takes one of the crates and turns south.

He just gets more mad.  \"SORRY WON'T BRING BACK MY BROTHER!  SORRY WON'T SAVE MY MOTHER!  SORRY DOESN'T COUNT FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE!\" He curls up into a ball, starting to cry.  You had left home to come to this city.  Your family remained unbombed.  Jenny tries to comfort him but he continues to sob.  The guerillas had taken his life away without killing him.

You were the one person who I've  missed back home.\" Zach looks at you for a moment.  \"Home hasn't been home since you left.  War broke out.  My parents are dead.  I brought the other children out to find a place to go so we don't get killed by those merciless crusaders.  I thought they killed you too.\" he kept a look of a hardened man as he spoke.  \"I think I know a place.\" You explain the situation and.....</span></div></div>",

He doesn't answer, just stands there. After a few seconds you shout \"Tell me DAMN it!\".

It seems strange that you were afraid of her then, but not even a week later, you trust her fully.  The kid is now shielding his eyes from the lamp's light, waiting for his eyes to adjust.  He looks around, then sees you next to him.  He has long black hair, the usual pale skin, but a rare athletic build.  He looks like the average guy, except his eyes are a strange shade of purple.  He then sees Sarah coming back with a piece of cloth, plenty to cover all of his body.  \"Oh!  Your awake!\" she says down to him.  \"Where are we?\" he asks cautiously, not wanting to make her mad.  \"This is my room, you are sitting on my pillow.\" at that he blinks in surprise.  He mumbles something to himself and then looks at his leg.  Sarah had now ripped the cloth into a smaller piece.  She tells him to hold still while she puts it on.  He does as he is told.  \"You really shouldn't have been walking around like that.\" she says to scold him.  \"What does it matter?  My friends are dead or gone.  My family went missing a year ago.  Not like anyone would notice me leaving.\" he eventually says, his voice depressed.  Sarah immediately changed from scolding to pity.  \"You poor thing.  It'll be ok.\" she says to him.  \"No.  It won't be ok.  I have nothing left.  The crusaders took the last little things I had left.  If I had any less humanity, I'd kill all of them.\" Sarah was surprised at this, and didn't reply.  You just listened to them talk.  Waiting for something to happen.  He just sat there.  No tears.  No emotion left.  Everything he had, he lost.  Now it looks like he lost his emotions too.  He had been hollowed out, like a bowl.  After a little bit, Sarah broke the silence. \"You will have to sleep on a pillow on the floor, is that ok?\" she asks kindly.  \"Sure.\" came a simple reply.  \"I feel silly, I forgot to ask your name.\" Sarah said to him.  \"Seth.\" was the only thing he said in reply.  \"I'm Sarah.  And that's (your name)\" she replies to his question that wasn't asked.  \"Nice to meet you.\" you tell him.

You are unsure of what to do, so you sort of crouch down and try and lift him but he shouts in pain so you stop. Quickly looking from him, to the door, to Sarah your mind races in an attempt to come up with another idea. Then you hear something. Something that chills your blood. Something you have come to fear, greatly. You look down and see Seth looking at the doorway aswell; looking pale (either from fear or blood loss, you're not sure)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost completely silent and swift steps of massive pawed feet come down the hallway. You have seen this beast before. One of the greatest threats you have come to know, one that most all the little people are terrified of. Whereas dogs come and go, this monster tortures, destroys, waits, pounces, and preys. You quickly grab Seth's arms and start dragging him away from the door despite his screams of agony. The noise is getting closer, and as it does so you can feel the life draining from your composure. Closer, closer, and closer it comes but it is no use you are to far away. You call to Sarah, you cry for help, you try but no one is there and you feel doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen is appears. Its head poking into the doorway, with its green eyes, pointy ears, and it menacing grey color. At first the sly menace doesn't notice you, it only looks up at Sarah who still is fast asleep. It takes a few more steps so it is just within the room. Towering over you its frightful eyes come upon you. The same eyes that elders from your race make up stories about to scare little children, the same eyes which can watch you whenever, day or night. You freeze, your muscles tense up and your eyes dilate. You can feel Seth shaking, but it is no use. The beast brings one paw forward almost an inch (a normal inch so to you it's like ten feet). It lowers it head and you can feel its rank breathe envelop you. It opens its mouth and makes a loud menacing, frightful, chilling, monstrous noise which makes you feel like the whole earth is shaking. You and Seth then scream.....\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" You shut your eyes and drop Seth. Then after waiting for it to attack you open one eye and see the beast is gone. You look behind and see Sarah towering above you, a groggy look on her face, and she is holding the terror. She steps over you and drops it outside her door and then shuts it. .........</span></div></div>",

However you find it kind of humerous how such terrifying creature is wrapped in the arms of a giantess which you had befriended. She brings it over to the bed and you start to edge away, she notices and tightens her grip on the abomination. \"Its ok, he not going to hurt you, I got him,\" Sarah says in an attempt to calm you down. \"Him?\" you say in an almost mocking tone. Sarah rolls her eyes and turns her attention to her pet. She carresses \"him\" as she talks to you. \"So, Seth feeling better\" Sarah asked in an unsure voice.

She reaches down for you and snatches you up before you can even think of a response, and as she does this all the breath is knocked out of you. She rushes out the door with you and hastens down the stairs. She gets to a huge couch and sits down. She opens her hand and looks down at you, sitting there in her palm. You are quite dizzy from what had just happened so it took you a few seconds to finally realize were you were. \"I'm not so sure about him,\" Sarah whispers to you. You're not sure how to react, he is one of your own kind, will you side with a human rather than one of your own people. She right though, you think. \"I seriously think something is wrond with him, and I mean beyond losing everthing,\" Sarah said.

It wasn't great, but there was no abuse or torture.  \"He also wants to show you what they did to him during the torture.\" you nod and step onto her hand.  She goes slowly up the stairs to Seth.  You walk over to him and you see a flicker of something behind the cold, hardened stare of his eyes.  It wasn't anything huge, but hopefully a start.  He tells Sarah to look away.  He removes his shirt, showing a deep jagged scar running from his shoulder all the way down to his lower thigh.  \"Oh my god.\" you mumble as he shows you his back.  Eighteen scars from whippings.  Not to mention that he was stabbed in the leg.  \"That isn't everything.  They told me things.  Stripped away everything I respected and loved.  They left me with this shell that was my life!  Don't you understand?\" You nod, knowing that his pain was beyond anything you could comprehend.  By this time he looks almost, peaceful, as if sharing this had taken a weight off his shoulders.

You recognize this as a drastic change in his former personality, whereas before he would sit and stare at the walls. You had no idea the profound effect of his revelations. \"So..\" you say in a sort of awkward voice, \"how long,...\". He turns his head without moving his body, and his black hair seems to have almost gained color in the light streaming in from the window. \"What do you mean?\" he asks with less hostility in his voice.

You realize that you almost never look at the sky; it so, so vast. You never really seemed to notice with so many other things in the world that are bigger than you, the sky is the only one that wouldn't.....couldn't hurt you.

She is holding a strange silvery object that has what looks like numbers written on it and has various lights shining off of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sit down on the bed and you and Seth are almost thrown into the air and come rolling down into the depression in the matress that she is making. She catches site of the two of you and carefully picks you both up and apologizes. She set you both on her leg, and lifts the strange object and seems to be reading something from it. You look over to Seth and see him look back at you with a similar look of curiosity. After a few seconds she sets the object down next to her and scoops you both up and lifts you up. You roll over and sit squarly in her palm looking up at her huge face. \"Are you sure you're okay, Seth?\" she asks, and Seth just looks up and gives a sort of restless nod. She smiles, and look to you with an almost sad but questioning glance. </span></div></div>",

It seems that even though he was appeased, his sleep was not so lucky.  After Sarah leaves and sets you on the floor, he wakes with a start, cold sweat running down his back.

As they come down the hallway Seth gets even more restless and you look over at him with concern. \"Whats wrong, you don't want to meet her?\" you ask him quizzicaly. He looks up at you from were he is sitting and sort of cocks his head to the side so he is looking at the opposite wall. \"Well its not that I don't want to meet her its just that.....you see I had this nightmare last night, and it involved meeting her and well...\" Seth trailed off. You understood exactly what he meant. \"Well you can tell Sarah that and I still kinda want to...\" but you were interupted from a shout which seemed to come from outside the window. You both turned your heads and saw what looked like one of your own kind on the branch nearest to the window. You caustiously approach the window sill with Seth and see a beaten, bloodied, crusader standing there. He had lond tangled brown hair, some of which covered his cut up face. \"So, you two really have come to befriend this...this human girl\" the limping crusader said with disgust. The voice, it sounded familiar, but you can't recognize the face. Seth seems just and puzzled with this surprise visitor as you. \"Well I should have expected your clansmen to run and HIDE, while the others fulfill there (cough) their (cough, gag).\" but before he couldn't finish what he was trying to say Sarah comes in and walks over to you. You turn your attention to Sarah and the crusader charges you and tackles you to the ground. Sarah doesn't notice so when she kneels down to Seth she asked him \"Where is (your name)\" but before he could respond the crusader and you struggle to the point where you fall off the window sill. As you two tumble down he lands of a one of the branches and gets knocked out. You struggle but manage to cling on. After a while you loose your strength and slip down and as you start to fall you manage to grab onto a crack in the outer brick wall. You pull yourself up and sit in the small gap in the mortar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back up in Sarahs room Seth hadn't noticed where you went and so he couldn't respond to Sarah's question. \"What do you mean you don't know were he went!\" Sarah exclaimed in an annoyed tone. Seth was starting to get really scared, not only at your disappearance but Kylie and Sarah getting frustrated he started to rock back and forth trying to collect his thoughts. Just then Kylie came in without warning \"Who you talkin' to?\" Kylie asked as she slipped out and walks over to Sarah. Seth's eyes get wide and he nearly feints, and Sarah quickly turns to Kylie. \"Uh, kylie I need to talk to you about....\" but Sarah stopped what she was saying when she noticed Kylie get wide eyes as well. She turned to see that Kylie was staring at Seth, and Seth back up to her. \"Uhhh..\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You always thought she was...well...beautiful,  but now you're beginning to find yourself catching glimpses of her physique more and more frequently. The fact that you'd had recently been stuffed down in her cleavage didn't help much either. You shake yourself back into reality, looking back over to Sarah still laying on the bed, you get up and awkwardly walk over. You reach up and tap her hip, but she doesn't notice, you pound harder, still nothing. You run up and start trying to get her attention by tapping her side, \"UHHH HEY SARAH\" you yell. She finally stirs, shifting her body slightly causing you to fall over and faceplant into her body. \"Uhh what is it, I'm tired...\" she says in a whining sort of tone. You groan, and she evidently hears you, sighing again and throwing herself up again, looking down, seeing you face down on the side. \"Whoa!

As you tumble into her palm she lifts you up till you are level with her chest. She leaned back onto her bed so that she sat just barely on its edge with her long slender legs angled out keeping her propped up against the bed. You raised your eyes somewhat sheepishly, catching her ever so slightly exposed chest above her white shirt. Your eyes darted back down then back up to her, seeing her warm but mellow eyes rolling over you. She brushed back her hair and sighed, a look of concern coming over her face. \"There's something I do need to talk to you about....\" she began somewhat unexpectedly. You look up concerned, and begin to stutter somewhat nervously. \"Oh its nothing bad its just that...well its my senior year and that means in about three months I'll be...going\" she said, blundering into the final word with just enough misappropriated emphasis that the anxiety you felt only mounted. \"Going? going where?\" you begin. \"Oh well I mean, you could come with me...but it'll be a big change, and I don't really know how we'd....\" she stopped seeing your confusion and concern as you begin to contort into a ball without taking your eyes off her. \"We can make it work, trust me\" she said. \"But I don't understand wha-\" you began again but she interrupted you, holding her finger up to you, \"Shhh its ok, look I shouldn't really have brought it up, its complicated but when you finish school you go....somewhere else...for another school, I'll explain it all to you later its really rather boring stuff anyway...\" she said, her voice becoming more and more chipper. She stood up and lifted you up slowly to her face. \"It'll be ok don't worry about it...\" she began, a big smile drifting across her face. You remained silent but nodded in reply. \"You know I envy you,\" she chirped, before lowering you again. \"Envy me? why?\" you said, but it was obvious she didn't hear you. You repeated yourself a little louder before she replied, \"...because you're, I don't know, so free...I guess? free of responsibility, free from having to deal with...\" her voice began to falter a bit. She looked down once more and said \"because you have seen some of the best and the worst and you still seem to keep yourself together...\" she then closed  her hand around you. </span></div></div>",

Usually when she completely closed you up in her hand it made you nervous, but for some reason now it seemed peaceful. You decide to lay down and relax awaiting whatever it is she is going to do next. In a few moments she opens her hand again and you see you are downstairs in her living room. She sits down on her couch and lowers you to her lap. She tilts her hand just enough to let you slide off onto her thigh. She gives you a brief smile before turning her attention back to the strange glowing device she was playing with before. She taps away on it, completely enrapture by whatever is on it. You look up at her longingly and pound your fist on her leg, trying to get her attention. She doesn't notice. Finally you speak, \"what's that thing?\" She suddenly stopped her staring and looked down at you. \"This?\" she said pointing to the strange rectangle in her hand. You nod emphatically in reply. She giggles a little to herself and then lowers it down to your level such that it stands on her knee and leans against her open palm. \"Its called a cellphone,\" she says with a laugh, \"you use it for...well almost everything, you can talk to people, take pictures, play games, look stuff up...\" she goes on. You sit there utterly confused as to how any of this is even possible. \"Look stuff up?\" you ask. \"Haha yeah like research,\" she says. She went on and on explaining the different features and how people used them, flipped through her different apps and showed off pictures of her and her friends. You sit mouth agape, utterly amazed at all it can do. \"How do you get one?\" you finally ask. \"You pay for it, they're usually pretty expensive though\" she says, she leaned back a bit and set her cellphone aside. She look down at you again and you back up at her. \"You probably have a lot of questions about stuff around here don't you?\" she asked sweetly, \"it never occured to me that this would all be so alien to you\". You shrug a bit and adjust your sitting position. She sits back up again and leans down a bit, her golden hair cascade around you like a shimmering veil. \"Come on, ask me something, anything!\" she chimes. You have been pretty curious about some things. You sort through your thoughts about what things have been bothering you most and finally decide on one. \"Why do you always wear something different each day? You even change clothes when you sleep!\" you ask, this had always been particularly strange for you. Your people tended to only have a dozen pairs of clothes and you would wear each set as long as possible, for everything, until it became absolutely unbearable and would be washed after it rained. But she seemed to go through clothes by mood. She laughed a bit and went on to explain how certain outfits were expected for certain things and so on. You nod like you understand but fail to really see what she means. She then narrows her eyes a bit and decides to ask, \"Do you ever change your clothes?\", you give another shrug and reply: \"yeah but we wear our for a lot longer\". She then scooped you into palm once more and brought you up to her face. \"I guess I never thought about it, but how do I get you tiny clothes?\" she asked, \"I suppose we'll just have to wash them every once and a while...\" she began to trail off again. She tilted her head to one side and asked another question, \"do you guys ever bath?\" again you nod and reply, \"yes but not often its dangerous and laboursome for us to find a good place to do it.\" She perks up a bit upon hearing this, \"well come on I can help you with that, you probably feel filthy\" she stands up and heads for the stairs.</span></div></div>",

She twists about on the balls of her feet nimbly as she made her way down the hall to the first door on the left. She gently pushed the door open ajar to see if any light seeped out. Satisfied that it was empty she pushed the door aside and flipped on the lights. She brought her closed hand down to the edge of the sink and cautiously deposited you near an enormous tissue box. She quickly closed the door behind her and knelt down so that she could see you better. \"Ok well we could do one of two things, I could leave it to you...I could probably find something for you to use. Or if you'd prefer to use the shower,\" she said, pointing to a large compartment in the rooms back that seemed to be made up of panels of frosted glass. \"I could  probably wait in here in case you need me.\" You weren't really sure what all this meant so you just sorta shrugged in response. She smiled a bit and then stood up to her full height. You craned your neck to look up at her as she turned and opened the door. She disappeared for a few seconds into the hallway leaving you alone on the counter. A moment later she returned with a small round white object in her hand. She closed the door once more and set it down next to you. It was almost as tall as you and it seemed to thin ridges running up its sides. She turned the sink on and a steady stream of water emerged, crashing with a pleasing hum into the sink's basin. She thrust her finger into the stream, waiting for it to heat up. \"I figure you'd want your privacy so I got the bottle cap you can use.\" she said plainly. When she was satisfied with the water's temperature she filled the bottle cap about half way before placing it back down beside you. She pinched a tiny piece off of a bar of soap and dropped it into the water. \"There you go,\" she said. \"OH almost forgot!\" she quipped just as she was about to leave. She took a tissue and began ripping off pieces of it and dropped it down nearby. \"You can dry yourself off with those when you're done...I'll be back in about ten minutes ok, hopefully by then I'll have something else you can wear.\" She shot you a wide smile once before swinging the door open and heading back into the hallway. You sighed and made your way into the make-shift tub. The warm water felt good on your skin as you slid the misshapen mass of slope along your arms. Your kind never placed much importance in bathing, but since you'd began living with Sarah you've began to realize just how strange your society was. This moment alone allowed you to collect your thoughts as you lay down in the crystal clear water. You let yourself float so that only your face was not submerged. Then....</span></div></div>",

You shot back up and clung to the edge of the bottle cap, trying your best to hide yourself from her gaze. She poked her head in just enough to see you still in your makeshift bathtub. She let out a slight laugh and quickly retreated, \"Oops sorry about that, well when your done you can put this on!\" she said proudly. Her arms reached through the crack in the door and dropped a tiny wad of cloth on the other edge of the sink. \"I'll be back in about five minutes, be ready by then ok?\" she said before closing the door. You lept out of the cap as soon as she was gone and quickly scrambled towards the wads of tissue. After drying yourself off you made your way across the sink's edge and picked up the white cloth Sarah had deposited earlier. It was rather rudimentary even by your people's standards, consisting of a small but soft rectangle of white cloth folded over several times with a few tiny, crooked holes cut into it to act as sleeves and a neckline. You take a few moments but finally manage to figure out how to put it on properly. Once satisfied with how your new outfit looked you sat down cross-legged and awaited for Sarah's return. A lot of things raced through your mind, and even though you were happy with your new life you couldn't help but feel strange about how things were turning out. Would Sarah keep you forever like a pet? What was going to happen to Seth? Who was that strange man who visited me and what did he want? Why was Sarah going away and why was she so nonchalant about it? You were beginning to realize how much you didn't understand this new world of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door swung open and Sarah came back in. She had changed into a white t-shirt and pair of short, loosely fit black shorts; the same sort of thing she always wore at night right before she went to sleep. She seemed in an especially chipper mood, almost to the point of dancing as she moved. She bent over top of you and addressed you keenly. \"Awww you look great, I know they're not what your used to but considering it was last minute I'd say I did a pretty good job!\" she cooed. You looked yourself over once more and nodded in agreement. She quickly scooped you up and took her back to her room where she deposited you next to the pillow on her bed. She disappeared for a few minutes and returned once more humming to herself cheerfully. The sheets had already been pulled down and after she shut the door behind her she nearly jumped onto the bed. You were sent up into the air good ways before landing awkwardly back onto the massive mattress. Sarah rolls over so that she faces you, a huge smile on  her face and your blonde hair splayed about her head. \"Hey I'm gonna be gone for a little while tomorrow night, ok? Will you be alright here by yourself?\" you shift a little under her gaze but manage to formulate a reply. \"Sure, where you going?\" you ask. She laughs a bit and says: \"Oh just this guy....I've been waiting for him to...take me out somewhere\" she said giddily. You were confused and it was readily apparent. She furrowed her brow a bit and gave an amused smirk. \"Its ok, its hard to explain, do people....date where you come from?\". \"What do you mean?\" you ask in reply. She adjusted her  position ever so slightly and continued to speak, \"Like when a guy and a girl who like each other go out places and do stuff together...well its a bit more complicated than that...\" she trailed off. \"Well we don't have a lot of places to go for fun...\" you begin, but you understand precisely what she means. She smiles again and swiftly changes the subject. You talk about your old world for a little while, a little about your history and where you grew up. By the end she was very sympathetic but also excited as she began to talk about all the things she'd take you to see and do \"for the first time in your life\" as she put it. After that she sat up, leaning on her left arm as her right hand descended on you. She picked you up and brought you up to her face. You were a little confused with what she was doing but complied nonetheless. She lowered you a bit and and then gently pressed you to her chest, just below her collarbone. You look up confused and she peers down with a content look on her face. \"This is called a hug, its a sign of affection...\" she says, \"I suppose it makes more sense if you were my size...\" she laughs. She then deposited you on your own pillow by her bedside and flipped off the lights. </span></div></div>",

You could hear her stir just as the first few glints of sunlight drifted through the slits between the closed blinds over her windows. She rolled over a couple times groaning with exhaustion before finally her alarm went off as usual. She lifted herself up and sat on the edge of her bed, rubbing her eyes and brushing her hair from her face. She stood up, looked briefly in your direction and then immediately walked out the door. You pretended to be asleep but watched her as she left. Your own fatigue finally caught hold of you again and sent you back into a dream-like state. You felt yourself falling...no drifting upward towards the sky, higher and higher and higher. It started out peaceful but as the distance between you and the earth grew further and further you stomach began to lurch and the calm of sleep was quickly replaced by the uncertain terror of a nightmare. You jolted back into consciousness and sat up...Sarah had gone and it was now mid-morning. You began your usual routine of pacing about and staring at various corners of the room. The door was slightly ajar and you could faintly hear the patter of soft, pawed feet coming down the hallway. Suddenly the same yellow-eyed monster from before poked its head in the room and wandered about the floor. You took special care to be as quiet as possible but you still poked your head over the nightstand's edge to observe it. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.best-cat-art.com/images/gray-cat-300x261.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.best-cat-art.com/images/gray-...</a><br>\r\nIt paced around the room aimlessly for a while, its long tail swaying gracefully from side to side till it found a spot in the corner next to the dresser. It spun around a few times and once it was satisfied it laid down on the hardwood floor and began licking its paw. Though you were still frightened by the beast you were glad it came along, otherwise you'd be forced to continue staring at the ceiling like you usually did. It wasn't long before the feline was fast asleep and you grew bored yet again. Hours went by. You fiddled with your new clothes for a while, trying to make them fit better though you did little to alter its bulky shape. After a while you heard the door downstairs close. 'That's odd' you thought to yourself, 'Sarah doesn't usually get home for another few hours' But surely enough a few moments later Sarah pushed the door open and tossed her back on ground. She seemed exhausted but with traces of enthusiasm buried beneath her seemingly stoic temperament. The cat sprang to its feet at the sudden intrusion and began walking towards her. As it approached it rubbed its sides against her legs and she looked down at it with a smile. She picked it up and walked over to the bed where she then carefully set him aside. She turned to you with a cheerful expression. \"Hey there, I've got good news!\" she chirped. You sat up and looked at her quizzically. \"I won't have to leave you alone everyday from now on!\" \"Really?\" you ask, your voice welling up subtly with excitement. \"Yeah I'm free now, its summer! I'm sure you were bored out of your mind but now we can do stuff!\" she quips. A moment later she stands back up and reaches down for you. After gently clutching between her fingers and lifting you up you begin to remember your nightmare and start to choke with  panic. She noticed right away and looks down with concern. \"You ok?\" she asked. You nod, though you can tell she doesn't quite believe you...</span></div></div>",

She returned after a brief time and approached you. Typically she would adjust her height when she spoke with you to make you feel more comfortable, but this time she seemed distracted and instead addressed you whilst standing. She peered down like some massive primordial figure passing judgement on a pitiful mortal but her words were as sweet and caring as usual. \"I'm going to be going out here soon...I hate to leave you again so soon I know its boring here all by yourself.\" she said sympathetically. You sort of shrug in an attempt to appear nonchalant about it all, though you secretly hated  being left alone again. \"Well I still have to decide what to wear, so we have a little time left, it'll be ok!\" she said, trying to curb your anxiety. Sarah wasted no time in getting straight to it. She began rummaging through her closet grabbing all assortments of clothing, half of which the likes you'd never seen before. Shorts, jeans, skirts, dresses, everything of that manner was thrown onto the bed in rapid succession. You had no idea that there could be so much thought could be put into your appearance until now. Sarah began analyzing the mass of clothing on her bed occasionally throwing some over her shoulder or sorting them by color or style. She held some up against her body and turned to you. \"What do you think?\" she asked. You didn't know what to say, you'd never encountered a situation like this before. As you analyzed your current situation Sarah took note of your silence and laughed a bit to herself. She continued her task with a magnitude of focus that you had never seen in her before. After what seemed like half an hour she finally narrowed it down to two. \"Ok now you have to give me your opinion...\" she said as she spun around to you. She held up both and you took a deep breath. \"I don't know...\" you squeaked out hardly audible. \"Come on you're a guy, I need a guys opinion, which is better!\" she pleads. You remain silent. She sighs and look intently at both. Finally she decided on one and threw the other onto her bed. She turned around so that her back faced you and pulled her shirt up from the bottom over her head. You jumped a bit at your unintentional voyeurism but continue to watch as if entranced. She tossed her shirt aside and you could distinctly see her shimmering hair cascade down her bare back just barely touching the horizontal strap of her bra midway down her back. You can't help but feel a little ashamed. She slips her chosen apparel over her head and down around her, finally turning about to face you again. \"Alright I think I'll go with this...\" she says. Once satisfied with how it sat she approached you once more and knelt down. \"I'll only be gone for a few hours ok?\" she noticed the stress in your face. \"Whats wrong?\" she asks. \"Nothing...\" is your only reply. She frowns a bit and then quickly turns her head to check her phone. \"I have to go, but I want to talk about it when I get back ok? I know something's bothering you...\" she trails off. She immediately stood and headed out the door.</span></div></div>",

This was obviously her idea of a hug and you began to grow irritated but secretly enjoyed it none the less. You began to become insconsed in her, with her perfumated aroma and the softness of her skin.  Peering behind you, you were struck with the sight of her friend Kylie. She had fairly long dark brown hair which she had tied back in a ponytail and was about a head shorter than Sarah (whom you guess was tall for a human her age) and had almost midnight black-brown eyes that seemed detached and somewhat \"stupid\".

You start to feel a sense of vertigo and try to shake it off so you sit back down for a minute. You try and listen in on what they are saying but you can' hear it over the birds chirping, and usual of outside noise. However you can tell that Sarah is struggling to explain everything. \"Well you see at first they were.....well I mean...no...\" you could hear Sarah say, but you could also clearly distinguish a great deal of panic in her voice, no doubt cause by your abrut disappearance. You finally decide to stand up and try and get back up to Sarah's room. You take a deep breathe and great ready for the ascent. You slip your hand into a small hole in the brick and start to hoist yourself up, and as you start to climb you keep telling yourself not to look down and just keep going. You almost reach the top of the first brick when a gust of wind whip over you and although it isn't very strong it still almost causes you to let go. About half way up you realize that you have no way of getting up past the bottom of the window will which juts out about three inches (like 15 feet to you). So, you decide to pull yourself up and sit on the edge of the brick which you are nearing the top of. As you pull yourself up and take a second to catch your breathe you look down and almost pass out from vertigo. It was so high, and once again you envy birds for their ability to fly......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Sarah and Seth-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth still felt like he was going to be sick as he peered warily up a Kylie who looked back down at him with a confused and curious look. \"Don't worry it took me awhile to get over that overwhelming feeling to.\" Sarah said to Kylie. \"Well I can kinda see why\" Kylie says, \"So, uh Seth right, were did you come from?\" Seth tried to avoid eye contact but Kylie constant gaze made him feel uncomfortable. \"Well it sort of a long story.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You run outside and stand on your balcony, what you see makes you soul shudder, and your heart skip a beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was 700 feet tall. Her head was in the clouds and her toes towered over every building in your city. You could barley see the top of her head, but you could tell that she had long blond hair that came down to her massive shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO LITTLE PEOPLE, MY NAMES SARAH, ITS NICE TO MEET ALL OF YOU.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess bends down and puts her hands on her knees. She was looking at the whole city with great entrust, and then the unspeakable happens she looks right at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t see you could she, you where not even a inch tall compare to her, you where a speck of dust, there was no way she could see you. You do not move, you barley had any strength in your legs to stand up right. You stay on the balcony staring at the giantess as she stares back at you. You were starting to get the impression that she could see you, seeing as how her eyes never left your location <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO LITTLE GUY, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY.\u201d The giantess said with a smile on her face. The biggest smile that you had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHATS YOUR NAME?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess takes a small step towards your apartment. A step that rocks the whole city to its very core. You did nothing, you said nothing. You looked at her toes and saw how they dug into the ground, creating huge cracks that where big enough to swallow hundreds of people. This was her power and now this powerful being was looking right at you, you had here undivided attention. Lucky you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME LITTLE GUY?\u201d The giantess said with a little sadness and fear in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still said nothing, what could you say, would she even hear you. It was already obvious that she saw you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK JUST WAIT A MINUTE, DON\u2019T WORRY IM NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe giantess stretches out her fingers and as gently as she can she grasps your apartment. To you it looked like two meteors where coming right towards you, two meteors that where skin colored. Sweat ran down your forehead, you wanted to scream but you lost the will to even do that. Soon the giantesses gigantic fingers grasp the whole apartment building. You felt the building shake, you stumble to the ground as the g-force became to unbearable to stand. The whole building started to rise off the ground at speeds never before seen. It was a miracle you where still alive. The building started to shake again and with a loud \u201cBOOM\u201d everything became still and quite. So quite that you heard the wind run through your ears and blow around your brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK NOW WE CAN HAVE A PROPER CONVERSATION. SO HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the giantesses voice again, but this time it was even louder, so loud that you had to cover your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH IM SORRY IS MY VOICE TO LOUD, ILL TRY TO TALK A LITTLE MORE QUITLY.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lowered her voice but it still was earth shattering. What really surprised you was that she could see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO LITTLE GUY WILL YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME.\u201d The giantess said with a little hope in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM, my, my names Jake, Jake Summers.</span></div></div>",

He had heard of the giantess rumours that had started way back in the 1700's when the island was discovered. You wouldn't find it on any maps of the area in the South Pacific or by googling its name, Mysteria. You had to have connections and Robert knew one man who could tell him the location of the island. The British colonised the island and had influenced the locals, many spoke English and even wore Western clothing with some semblence of Western civilisation but the islanders were all tanned, the way they were when the English arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A guide had been arranged for him to help him around the island in order to show him around but Robert had not been assured that he would be allowed to look for her, it was a taboo topic on this island. The islanders loved her and would defend her to the death if someone tried to harm her. Despite her large size, she was very gentle and friendly( so he heard) but wouldn't hesitate to hurt someone if they tried to harm the islanders. Robert saw a tall man dark man, his hair coffee black and his skin a medium brown approach him ,wearing a light blue shirt and brown trousers, tucked in. \" You must be Robert, I am Michael.\" he said, shaking Robert's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Meanwhile, the giantess sat on the cliffside, she lived in a cave on the island's extinct volcano, it made for a good warm home for her, the only place big enough for her to live in comfortably. Living with the islanders, no matter how well they got along was a bad idea. Smashed huts caused by her tossing and turning during her sleep and annoying them with her mini quakes everytime she took a step were too much for them and her and she agreed to live away from them and only to come down for visits. She protected them from the monsters that lurked in the interior of the island, none of them could harm her at all so it made for easy defending, just step on the giant man-sized bug and that was the end of the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She wore a floral dress the islanders had made for her, her dress revealed some cleavage but she didn't mind. The sight of a boat made her curious, she hadn't seen one in ages and this meant someone new was on the island. She didn't age, well not very quickly but vey slowly, she had been here when the first islanders arrived about 3000 years ago and hadn't aged at all since then, she maintained the look of a woman in her mid-twenties, tanned with long black hair and a pair of brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She looked at the boat and thought about what the visitors wanted, if it was bad, she would be there. She should, perhaps they came to look for her, something everyone not from the island is keen to catch a glimpse of her, her friends had prevented that since they knew to reveal her existence would be to compromise her situation, they would come and try to take her away.  Her name was Savannah, she had thought about that word and it stuck, she loved it and made sure all on the island addressed her as such, though some called her Sav. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She pondered coming down t<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Your father doesn\u2019t seem to care so much about it though. He is a world famous inventor, and is working on a way to cut down on rocket fuel for space travel. How he is doing this is with a teleporter to other planets. He calls it the Power Packed Planet Warper, or the PPPW for short. You have a cat as well, but she doesn\u2019t do much other than sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally time to test the PPPW, and your father was using an apple as a test. He had set the coordinates to the moon, and started the countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20, 19, 18, 17<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer controlling the countdown said. Sadly your father forgot to lock the lab door, and your cat walked in. She went into the PPPW. She mistook the apple for a ball, and started to roll it around in the PPPW. She isn\u2019t the smartest feline in the world. You had been looking for her for quite a while, but when you went to the lab to ask your father if he had seen her, you saw that she was in the PPPW, and your father hadn\u2019t noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10, 9, 8, 7, 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe countdown just kept going. You run over to the PPPW as fast as you can. You manage to get to it, and get your cat out. You sigh, and put your foot out in front of you to start walking when you hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3, 2, 1. Activating planetary transport\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the chamber slides shut, and you were sealed inside of the PPPW. You start to panic, and bang on the door. Your father sees you, and panics as well. He started to randomly press buttons on a keyboard, but to no avail. You hear the computer again. This time it a siren blared, and you heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfunction! Malfunction! Last emergency transport activated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you heard before a weird blue gas filled the chamber. It made your head ach, and you eventually pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke you were lying on grass. You got up, your legs a little wobbly, and scan your surroundings. To the north there was a GINORMOUS mountain with a huge cave in it. It was WAY to far away for you to get there in one day by foot. To the south there was a landscape full of hills as far as the eye could see. To the west there was a forest of tall trees. It looked like it went on for miles, and looked easy to get lost in. You decide that it would be the easiest to find shelter, and food there. Finally, to the east you see a lake large enough that you could barely see the other side of it. You assume its fresh water, and start to walk to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father had told you about the purpose of the \u2018Planetary Transport Mode, or \u2018Safety Mode\u2019. He told you that if the astronauts we not prepared enough for the trip, then the machine would malfunction. It would instantly warp them to the nearest planet with breathable oxygen. You know that your father would come to get you once he found the coordinates, so you don\u2019t want to wander far. The only thing that worries you is that since this planet could sustain life, there could be other life forms around. Weather they\u2019re kind, or cruel, you don\u2019t want to be found by an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually reach the lake, and get down on your knees. You cup your hands under the water, and bring some to your mouth. It was drinkable, but it tasted like something had been swimming around in it. You notice the water start to bubble in the center of the lake. Almost as if something was about to rise out of it. You panic, jump to your feet, and make a mad dash for the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running, you\u2019re not really paying much attention, but you think you faintly hear the word\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way in hell you were going to stop running. You\u2019d rather risk getting lost in the forest, than risk your life with some alien. Hearing that voice you just start running faster, and eventually reach the forest. You run deep into it, and hide behind a tree in fear of the possibility that, that creature chased you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I edited this to make it fit the rules as best as possible...)</span></div></div>",

You dismiss his statement and continue staring out into the forest. You shift uncomfortably in your seat next to him on the wagon. The mules are old and gray but they are strong, stronger than any Mule one could find anywhere else, they were bred well, you should know, you helped. The cold wind rushes over you and sways the branches of the barren, creepy old trees to make it look like a crowd of angry demons reaching into the sky. Beldrict is right, it does look like rain. Of course, you think to yourself sarcastically, what more to make this little trip even more depressing, more awkward. You have been working for Beldrict for years now but you are still quite young, and being alone with him on this \"business venture\" made you rather uncomfortable. However the most unnerving thing is more so what you are going to acquire. Everything about this trip makes you want to vomit. These \"Grand Inquisitors of Divinity\" seem like a sketchy bunch but when Beldrict heard what they had, he jumped at the chance. You know very well Beldrict is a good man, old, wise, but sometimes he seems too wrapped up in his work. You never had much in the way of family so he's always been sort of a father figure to you. But he's always thinking about the next gimmick, where they plan to travel next, and of course the next addition to his show. Just two days ago when he heard of.... well it, he couldn't stop talking about, the excitement just made his eyes light up. You were glad to see him so happy and so when he asked you to join him today you couldn't just say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been here before. Ever since you started traveling with show, you have been able to see many places, but this place; it's different, very different. The trees are grey and barren and you can't help but feel a sense of dread as you both travel slowly down the beaten old road. Your thoughts start to overcome your alertness and you begin to nod into a light sleep. The cloudy sky almost gives an illusion of night only serving to make you even more tired. The rocky road starts to become even bumpier and you look up and see a clearing just ahead. \"Well, looks like were here\" Beldrict announces as the old cart pulls onto a cobblestone path. You can tell that Beldrict senses your anxiety. He knows because this has happened before. When he introduced many other......things..... to you that have become part of you daily life. You look around at the dismal place you have come to. A large stone building with a tower twisting up at least 100 feet into the air. Several smaller stone and wooden structures that look like they were thrown together overnight surround it. At first the place seemed empty then you notice a black hooded figure with a cross around his neck and a long metal staff. You eventually pull around and stop at the entrance to the large stone building. Another hooded figure is standing there, this ones face is showing though; he has scruffy blonde hair with a scar across his mouth, stubble, and grey hateful eyes. He is resting a crossbow on his shoulder and in his other hand holds a crucifix made from wood and sharpened to a point at the bottom. Then the massive wooden door open and a few more figure step out.</span></div></div>",

He wore an odd hat, much like that of a witch but flat on top instead of coming to a point. His old duster coat looks to have suffered many abuses while the rest of his garb seemed fit for killing. He hasd a rapier at his side and you could faintly make out what appeared of be blood stains on his coat and boots. He had grey scraggled hair and a large red scar which came across his whole face. \"Yes, we're here to see, uh...her is it?\" Beldrict inquiries obviously less bothered by this group of vagabonds. \"Aye, follow us\" The lead inquisitor says before turning with his troop of creeps following. Beldrict clambers down from the cart and you are hesitant to move. \"Come along then,\" Beldrict calls to you in a hopeful voice. You plop down onto the muddy ground and follow close behind Beldrict. They lead you around the stone structure to the large cliff face which looms over the entire area. As you try to keep up with them, Beldrict and the other discuss some business, and you now notice the large number of witch hunters, inquisitor, and mysterious acolytes which dot the encampment that you pass to the right. Some chanting, others sharpening weapons, while one burned a strong incense, whose stench struck you like punch in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you came to the back you saw a massive naturally formed cavern entrance at least 60 feet tall and 40 feet wide. Once you saw this you were immediately overcome with a sense of dread, as if something truly sinister dwelled within. After some protest you finally followed Beldrict whose own demeanor was as chipper as ever. They guided you down into the depths of the cavern armed with torches and whips.. \"So, why are you so concerned with this monstrosity\" the leader asked, obviously annoyed with your presence. \"Well, I was hoping we might......perhaps if you were willing to.......you see I think that this would be valuable for\" but as Beldrict tried to explain his plans you entered an enormous chamber that seemed to extend into an eternal darkness. There, a large crack in the ceiling let in a little light and illuminated a murky, muddy pond across which sat a hulking figure, curled up facing opposite of you. Your heart began to race and a cold sweat formed on your brow. \"Hey, come now you wretch, you have company\" the Inquisitor yells. It is then you notice the figure is in shackles and a large chain connects the thing to the wall. Then the massive figure lifts its head and you notice that it is a woman, well not a woman but a giantess. She had long black hair, which shined like ravens feathers in the dim light. You looked fearfully into her green eyes and saw a great deal of fear and grief from her as well. She had grime covering her face and arms and was dressed in a sort of leather or brown linen which was torn in multiple places. You look over at Beldrict and his eyes are lit up with anticipation. \"So, how much to take this fine specimen off your hands?\"</span></div></div>",

So, armed with whips, pikes, torches, and other rather foul looking weapons the assembled vagabonds surrounded the giantess. You saw her eyes get wider and she started to curl up into a ball; she was obviously very afraid of them. Then you noticed that some where latching her wrists together through a strange iron belt, they bolted her hands so they would be locked against her waist. Then for some reason she screamed, \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\", it was a scream of agony and it caught you and everyone else off guard. Her voice shook the caverns and you dove behind a rock in fear. Beldrict ran over to you and said \"Perhaps you should go ready the cart\" with a look on his face that was half between worry and regret. You nodded, absolutely speechless, and ran out as fast as you could. Just as you exited the cave you could hear many of the inquisitors yelling and the cracking of whips. You were near to tears. You waited by the cart, there was nothing that you needed to prepare, and Beldrict knew this and only told you to go because he knew how much it bothered you. After what seemed like half an hour, you could feel the earth shake faintly and you looked up and saw the giantess being led towards the cart. As she passed many of the monks and inquisitor bystanders bowed their heads and marked the sign of the cross across their torso. She hung her head so that her long dark hair kept you from seeing her face. Your heart began to race as she approached.You were unsure of what to do, so you just stood there awkwardly with hands at your side, shaking. When they got to you, you look up at her and  faintly made out her piercing green eyes through her hair looking back down at you. You turn away and start to walk toward the woods, \"Wait, (your name) we need....\" you ignore Beldrict cry and he lets you go. You stare out into the woods while they get her to sit down onto the flat cart (which is pretty huge). After Beldrict does some more bargaining with brutes he buys 10 oxen and manages to hitch them up along with your 4 mules, he walks back over to you. \"We're ready to go, come along\" Beldrict says to you in an apologetic voice. You sort of turn and look at the giantess strapped down on the cart. Her legs are covered in chains which rap around the bed of the wagon. You look back to her face, which is still hidden.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start off you continually look over you shoulder to the giantess. She makes you extremely nervous though you know there is nothing she could or would do; her spirit.....its been broken. Beldrict looks also like he is going to be sick, and has a look of concern and pity on his face as he stares up the road ahead. He notices you staring at him and raises his grey eyebrows as if to ask 'what do you want'. You shake your head and look back and the road. Despite the giantess's enormous size the draft animals are able to slowly pull her along. The trip takes twice as long to get back. The giantess doesn't move, doesn't speak, doesn't make a sound the whole way. \"Thank god\" you think.</span></div></div>",

He stopped and did a quick backflip as was customary for him.  At 15, he is the youngest of the workers, but despite working for the circus and being an orphan he keeps a good attitude. \"Need any help?\" he says his boyish face looking happy, with a twinkle in his eye yellow eyes.  He is a mix of species, mostly human, with unnoticeable elf and dwarf hidden in there.  At 5' 8, he isn't too short and his entire body was laced over in strong muscles. The other to approach was Meg, the cook.  She is a skinny little woman and cooks extremely healthy meals. She has short blond hair and a face that looks like that of a child, though aside from her height she seemed to be aged and withered.  She stopped at the cart and asked \"Need anything?\" Beldrict steps down, and pats Zenn on the back.  \"Zenn and I will unhook her while you two go inside.\"  He tosses a key to Zenn which he catches, and cartwheels over to the locks. \"Showoff\" Beldrict mutters.  \"Jealous?\" says Zenn teasingly.  \"Don't tempt me to shoot you, those flips won't help much then.\" Beldrict says patting his crossbow.  As you can tell he was wary of the giantess and Zenn was too.  Both talked casually but feared the huge person they were unlatching.  You and Meg reach the cottages and huge tent that make up the circus.  You look back and see that Belddrict and Zenn just finished unlatching her.  Beldrict calls to her in a loud voice.  \"Come with us for your dinner.\" but she remained still.  Zenn looks over at Beldrict.  \"You wanna climb up there Zenn?\" he whispers.  \"Are you kidding me? She could easily crush me.\" she then began to whimper as she turned her face away.  \"What do we do?\" Asked Zenn.  \"Let's talk to her see if she will get up.\" Though they spoke as patiently and calmly as they could the giantess remained prostrate sobbing quietly to herself. After half an hour Zenn finally had had enough.  \"Alright I'll climb up.\" says Zenn who climbs onto the cart and shakily walks around to her face.  Compared to her, he was about three inches tall.  He looks at her face and began speaking once more.  After a few minutes she rose, shaking the cart violently as she moved.  Zenn fell and landed on his hands.  He flipped over onto his feet and he looks up at the huge girl.  \"You want something to eat?\" he calls up to her and she slowly nods.  He leads her to the outdoor mess-hall and you, Meg, and Beldrict carry the plate of food to her while Zenn continues to talk to her.  You go inside quickly and go to your bunk that you and Beldrict share.  You fell asleep and had terrible nightmares of the giantess killing you.  The next day....</span></div></div>",

You sit up in bed and realize you were sweating, thank god that nightmare is over. You slide down from your bunk and see that Beldrict has already left, as usual. You walk out and are immediately hit by a cool autumn breeze, and for a moment your mind is preoccupied by things other than giantesses. You see Zenn already at the tent were all the mules, horses, oxen, sheep, bulls, bonnacons, minotaurs, and other beastly creatures are kept. Thats were you usually work, helping to maintain everything with animals, freaks, weirdos and other less human performers. You thought that Beldrict wouldn't try to involve you with the giantess after he saw how much it bothered you, but as you neared Zenn, Beldrict intercepted you and grabbed you by the arm and pulled you aside. It was then, as he was pulling you away that you saw Zenn's injury. He had a gash on the side of his head and a black eye. \"What happened to Zenn-\" you began to say and Beldrict quickly answered, \"Well thats what I wanted to talk to you about\" Beldrict said in a hushed tone. \"You see last night, we needed to shackle the uh...well you know who I am talking about, but anyway Zenn was trying to talk to her and as he tried to put a lock on her ankle she pulled back and kept on doing it so Zenn got frustrated and started yelling and well...'' he paused for a moment and looked over at Zenn. \" Well I don't think she meant to hurt him but she sort of kicked him off her ankle and well I assume you can piece together what happened after that\" Beldrict finished. \"Yes, and...\" you started to say nervously \"Why didn't you ask...\" but Beldrict interrupted you and said \"Well I know kind of bothered you and all...\" Beldrict hesistated again \"Listen here, since you are so much better with the larger 'additions', and well lets face it you're just more patient then Zenn, I decided to make you the main caretaker of our new guest\" he finally finishes with a grimace on his face. You stare blankly at him for a minute. \"Oh come now, ma boy,\" Beldrict continued, you know he was desperate, he only calls you \"ma boy\" when he desperately needs you for something. \"This will be good for you and for her, besides no one else wants to and your the best at it so.\" \"Alright\" you say before he is done speaking. He perks up and gives you a smile \"Alright!\". Beldrict then walks off and starts shouting at bunch of sword swallowers messing with a dwarf. \"Hey, so I hear you're in charge of the new addition to the family\" Zenn says as he approaches you. You just sort of nod, trying to collect your thoughts. \"Hey don't worry about it, and don't worry about this\" he says pointing to his black eye. After talking with Zenn you figure you better go and check up on your new \"friend\", who you see washing the grime off her face with water from a large trough usually used to hold drinking water for large creatures but is merely a bowl to her. She looks down and stares at you, as if frozen, and you can see her eyes looking at you through several strands of her long black hair. You stand there motionless and petrified with anxiety or panic, you can't tell you're to scared.</span></div></div>",

His finger moves in the air, as if he were writing the problem into existence.  You hear him mumble something about selling the third Minotaur and replacing it with something else.  He looks up again.  \"Ah, instead, you take care of the leopards and minotaurs and I take her.\" you shake his hand and you do your new duties.  Zenn hobbles in with his new cane.  You go up to him.  \"You ok?\" you ask, knowing he wasn't.  \"This,\" he replies, \"is nothing.  I've had worse.  Remember that fall off the tightrope?  Now that was painful.\" You remember it well.  He fell off and hit the net, then bounced out and caught himself on the edge of the stands with his arm.  His shoulder got yanked way out of joint and he fell again, breaking his wrist.  He peeks into the giantess' stall and then hobbles in.  You keep walking and leave, not wanting her to see you again.  You hear Zenn's calm and cool voice talking to her, still with no verbal replies.  He asks only yes or no questions which she answers with nod or shaking her head.  A while later he hobbles out and goes to his room to chill out.  Which he relishes, considering he does the work of two people for only the pay of one.  Tomorrow.....</span></div></div>",

You had come here to be alone for a while but this place is always populated by the other workers and performers, and you turned you head as he came over and walked up to him, completely ignoring the man who was trying to talk to you. \"So, feeling any better?\" you ask him and he just shakes his head and looks down. \"Now come on, like I said don't worry about me, the real question is if you're ok.\" Zenn finally replied. You look, away and say \"Yeah sure, why wouldn't I be?\" you say in an almost shaky voice. You know that as bad as the feeling you get when you're around the giantess, the fact that everyone thinks, no KNOWS, you're afraid of her just drives you insane. \"Alright, I get it...\" Zenn says casually. \"So what where you two talking about yesterday?\" you ask with a curious look on your face. \"Who- Oh yeah her, well I was just asking some stuff about her, but she never said anything. Look I really think you should reconsider, you know just as well as everyone else that you are the only one that would be able to get her to talk, or at least cooperate a little more\" he said. You sort of nod and decide to go and just see her for a second. You run over to the stalls where she is located and peer in for a second careful not to let her know you are there. You then see she is curled up in the corner, her face buried in her arms. Beldrict is trying to talk to her but it is obvious she doesn't want him there. At first you think she is crying but she suddenly looks up and her eyes are fixated on you. She stares coldy at you with eyes that are full of frustration, fear, and anger. Beldrict turns to and seems quite surprised. \"Uh, well now (your name), please come in for a second,\" you approach warrily. He leans in close to you and whispers to you \"Look I absolutely need you to talk to her, I couldn't get her to talk to me at all but all I know is that she wants to talk to you. Beldrict then turns and leaves closing the door behind him. The giantess never took her eyes of you.</span></div></div>",

Ok?\" You nod, knowing that you need to talk to her or you will be stuck making excuses forever.  \"You, uh, wanted to talk to me?\" You say, not sure she would reply or not.  She nods to you.  Her eyes seeing your clear fear and she looks sad, yet does not reply.  She looks at you again and she stifles a cry.  Suddenly, your compassionate side comes out, as it does when you see these things.  You walk up and awkwardly give her ankle a hug, for whatever reason, throwing caution to the wind.  \"Don't cry, It'll be ok.  Just you wait and see.\" She seems touched by your sudden compassion and picks you up.  You manage not to wet yourself as she gives you a gentle cuddle.  Your fears are diminished at this, and you begin to loosen up.  You talk about Zenn first.  She listens intently, never interrupting or doing anything but giving the occasional questioning glance.  You answer her glances by explaining whatever you can to her.  You move to Beldrict and he peeks in, saying \"I hear something bad, it'll be coming out of your pay, ok?\" She giggles a little bit, and he leaves, happy to see you talking to her.  Eventually Zenn hobbles in.  \"Hey you two, dinner time!\" he hobbles over to the shackles at her ankles.  Will you unlock her arms?\" he asks, handing you a key.  You walk over and you hear the lock click, and Zenn's as well.  She rubs her wrist and ankle, and then when the next two locks open, she stands quickly, giving Zenn a shove, sending him to the floor.  She squats down to look at him, worry in her eyes.  He grabs his cane and pulls himself up.  He sees the worry in her eyes and says \"Don't worry, I'm accident prone anyways, it takes more than that to keep me down.  Now casts on both arms?  That kept me from doing much.\" She still looks concerned but less than before.  You lead her out of the tent, her stooping to get out the door, and barely making it.  At dinner you see a huge one person table with a smaller replica on top of it.  You start to climb the ladder up the table leg, but she stops you and sets her hand down.

You nervous climb onto her palm and sort of kneel, not sure how to position yourself on her hand. You look up at her and she gives you a weak smile, pleased with your descision. She slowly lifts you up to the table top, which although large in diameter isn't necessarily very tall, only about 20 feet or so. After setting you down she crouches near you and bows her head again, nervous with so many other people around. You look away from her and see that most of the others don't seem to mind the giantess surprisingly, but with so many dangerous, strange, and bizarre things that are involved with the show I guess they are used to it by now. Throughout the evening the giantess doesn't eat, doesn't speak just sort of sits there and stares. Occasionaly she looks over to you and smiles briefly, and sometimes she would nervously look around at others, or back to the mountains were she was being held. After a while you walk over to the ladder and you start to climb down. She doesn't notice you for at the moment she is looking over at a group of workers trying to force some cattle into a pen. When you reach the ground you walk over and set your hand on her leg. She jumps a little, obviously startled, and looks down and sees you there, stifling a smile. She reaches down to pick you up when all of a sudden the crack of a whip echoes through the small valley and her hand freezes. You both look over and see the laborers using a whip to try and control a steer that is giving them a hard time. The whip cracks again and you see her wince, still traumatized from her imprisonment. You look up \"Are you alright\" you manage to choke out. She looks away and gives a subtle nod but you can tell she isn't. You walk with her back to her stall where she goes and sits in the corner. You are now quite curious about her and you finally build up the courage to ask \"How long?\", you say almost inaudibly. She looks up and gives you  a questioning glance and you repeat, \"How long?'', this time ouder. She still looks confused and you repeat once more \"How long.....did they have you locked up?\" you finally said and kind of grimaced when you were done. She lay her head in her arms and spoke no more. You go up and lean on her ankle and she looks up once more and she looks at you with a glance that says, 'please don't ask me about that'. You decide to leave her then and perhaps come back tommarrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

She pointed to her shackle, which was now just one on her ankle, and you unlocked it.  She rubbed her ankle and slowly stood to a stooping position which is all that was allowed in the space.  She squeezed herself out of the tent and stood all the way up outside.  You decided to show her everything.  You pointed to the cooking tent where the food gets made and then continued to show her the place.  You point to the other big tent and tell her it's the show tent.  She gives you a confused look and you explain how it's a circus.  She is a bit sad that she's a show, but doesn't seem mad.  Then the huts that the staff live in.  You show her your hut, and she looks inside.  It has a coy a dresser and a small cabinet for your things.  She opens the window with her mfinger and points to the cabinet.  You open it up and show her a pendant and a clean sheet.  She points to the pendant and you explain how your parents were adventurous.  They gave you this pendant and disappeared.  You were just 7 and Beldrict took you in and you started work here.  You put it back and Beldrict says \"You two!  Come over here!

After a little while, no one could come to a descision, since many thought it would be dangerous if she did anything other than sit there. She eventually got fed up with it all and stood up and walked back to her stall. This caught everyone off gaurd, and her hurried steps made the ground shake a little. You look over at Beldrict and he had a concerned look on his face and his gaze quickly came to meet yours, and he hurried over to you. He came up and looked back to the giantess walking away, \"Well, this should have been expected, look we need to work with alot more before we can put on, but unfortunately word spreads fast and some have already heard about her so if they come and we don't have her out yet, well....\"he stopped, stroking his silvery beard. He looked at you and you knew exactly what he meant; you needed to get her ready and fast. You knew it would be long and hard, first you had to get her to talk, at least to you. Then get her comfortable with her new home and the others, then get used to the idea of being a show; then get rid of her fear of crowds and maybe then you can use her but until then, well. You quickly run back to her stall and find her there in the same corner as always, and she has her face buried in her hands. You know from working with many animals and other beasts that its when they are upset and emotional that they are most dangerous. You approach her, and you lack confidence that you can calm her down. \"Hey...\" you sort of whisper and she looks up for a second. You can't tell for sure, but she seems to have an angry expression mostly hidden by her dark hair that covers her face. This creeps you out and when she lifts her hand up and sets it down by her side, you sort of jump and take a few steps back. She sees this and moves a little closer. You edge away and start to feel a little panicked. She notices this and stops moving. She lifts her head some more and you see that instead of a look of anger, she seems worried, concerned, or maybe regret. She moves her hand out towards you and then to your surprise says in a quiet calm voice \"Don't fear me\". You were startled and inched forward a little \"What?\" you sort of grunted. She says again slightly louder this time \"Don't fear me\", and now you can distinguish a slight accent. She leans a little closer her blue eyes fixed on you and says \"Please\". You came forward and just nodded. It was a start. </span></div></div>",

The others aren't.  Beledrict smashes one over the head with the hilt of his sword and it falls, but another smashes him with it's palm.  Beldrict lays still.

You look at him questioningly but turn away to see some of the others nursing various types of wounds. \"Injured or not, if she hadn't come along we might of had some deaths\" Beldrict followed up. \"Wait where did she go off to?\" you asked but Beldrict shruggs. You wander off and search for her but she can't be found. Then you go down to the spring and see her sitting by the pond's edge looking at her reflection. You run up to her side, and stare up at her, she doesn't say anything or even look away. \"Hey down here!\" you yell up at her. At first she doesn't seem to notice but after a little while she turns her head and looks down at you giving you a weak smile. \"Hey what are you doing here\" you start, and you look up at her expectingly.

Wuch it\" he screams after you and turn around an apologize as you continue moving. When you finally make it to her stall, you slowly step in as if not to be noticed and see her sitting in her usualy corner looking up and the low (well low to her) ceiling. You come up to her questioning her as to what she is looking at. She looks down and gives you a sweet smile, and brushes some of her dark hair away from her face. She doesn't respond but instead just picks you up and brings you up till you're about level with her shoulders. \"So, uh how are you today?\" you ask awkwardly trying not to look her in the eyes. She laughed a little and said in a quiet, calming voice \"Fine\" she cooed, \"Just fine\". Unsure of what to say next, you just sort of sat there looking up at her, when finally she sort of dropped her eyes and then looked around the room and said again rather quietly \"Its so cold in here...\" she looked back to you \"at night.\" You looked at her questioningly and then she pointed to the roof where she had been looking earlier and there you see a large slit opened up to the outside. It looked to be about 10 feet long. You look back down and lock eyes on her. \"I'll see what I can do about that\" you say.

He never even moved.  \"That'll be 20 lashes each.\" the figure says before walking away.  Zenn just hops to his shed and shuts the door.  Suddenly the door opens and.......</span></div></div>",

Your heart racing, you peer out the door but see no one. As you stand in the doorway you are hit with massive gust of wind. \"Just the coming storm,\" you say reassuringly to yourself. You close the door tight and go back and sit down on your bed. You mind is racing and feel nothing but fear, for yourself, for Zenn, and it is just to much to bear on your own. You want to talk to Beldrict but you aren't sure were he is. You begin to pace, and decide to go to Morgwyn and talk to her about this. You take up the stick again and cautiously open the door, poking your head out first to be sure no one was around. It was starting to get dark and the looming storm clouds gave an eerie feel. No was about, so you threw open the door and ran as fast as you could to her stall. She was there curled up in her corner trying to keep warm. She seems quite surprised to see you but is welcoming none the less. She reaches over to you, and without loosing your momentum you continue running and practical crash into her hand. She seems confused by your sense of panic and quickly brings you closer. \"What is it\" she says quietly as you try to catch your breathe. You finally calm down and give a slurred, and hurried version of your story, and she looks down, obviously deep in thought. She then looks back up at you and shakes her head. You know that she isn't sure what to do, but you don't feel comfortable back outside not that it is completely dark out. You stay with her for the night. Staying in the opposite corner, you manage to get comfortable lying out on some straw and a small blanket which Morgwyn gave to you, but you manage to get no sleep throughout the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next day</span></div></div>",

He started to run, then sprint trying in vain to follow the voice. As it grew ever louder he knew he was getting closer, but suddenly he tripped and he collapsed on the shadowy forest floor. He began to crawl, desperate, completely commited to not stop moving, as if he stopped the imaginary monsters around him would draw his breathe from his body and leave for the crows.

It hadn't been long before she was taken away from this world. The man then tried to look up at the young giantess that now shielded him from the rain, and he began to make connections. She reminded him so much of his beloved, similair raven hair but her face took a different shape and did most everything else, and she smelled of straw, unlike his lost love who always smelt like that of a fresh running spring. He closed his eyes and began to weep, but not about himself about his companion, his soulmate, his forgotten love. He left her there in the mountains years ago to seek his fortune, and when he returned empty handed, she was distraught and they grew apart and she left for the snowy hills. One morning a chilling breeze took her life away, carried off like a lone leaf in an autumn gale. His heart shattered and he just wandered on with his friends and companions across the wildnerness, to forget about it all. Suddenly he loved the soft prison and embraced it and continued to weep like a child. Morgwyn noticed, smiled slightly and soon the rain began to slow, coming down in a gentle, even pattern, like a shower to wash away all regrets of the past.

These giantesses were very different from their formal selves; they became self-absorbed, vain, violent, aggressive, cruel, and a host of other bizarre behavioral deviations. Most had devastated their native areas but they had been dispatched by the military forces of the world. However some of the larger ones were easily capable of defending themselves. Much of the world's military had been exhausted combating them, and a few of the more powerful ones remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a small city in northern Virginia, the remaining inhabitants milled about the remains of their town. Most had fled west to escape the onslaught, and now only half remained. Most of the largest buildings had been reduced to rubble and the modern amenities that had once been a keystone of modern life were now gone. Electricity, and running water were gone; food was scarce and people were forced to live in a state of poverty. A young man, crossed an empty street , lugging a heavy jug of water behind him. He took a moment to rest, wiping the sweat from his brow. The heat of the dimming June evening was greater than he had expected. 'Can't stop now, gotta get back before dark' he thought to himself. As he continued on his mind began to wander again, 'I wonder when she'll be back...if she comes back'. The sun began to slip behind the crests of two nearby mountains, finally providing some much needed shade. 'I hope she's gone for good this time...' he thought again. However his train of thought was quickly interrupted when he felt something. At first he ignored it but a second later he felt it again. He set down the water jug again...he looked down and saw a ripple reverberate through it. He seemed to grow in intensity, he hadn't felt this since...since it all began.

Slim fit jeans and a white tank-top, funny how he remembered that...from all that had happened. She blocked the sun, and the shadow that drew itself across her front made it hard enough to discern her face. However once she moved he could see it again, the same sadistic smile she wore before. Her almost silver eyes flicking back and forth across the cityscape, a smug smile creeping across her lips. She stepped along casually, briskly strolling through the streets, stepping over buildings and bridges, leaving a wake of crater like footprints as she went. The ground shook and people scattered, trying to find some place to hide from the returning menace. \"I'm surprised how many of you stayed\" she chirped, her head swiveling about as she looked down at the small crowds of people scattering about as she walked along. She came to the center of town where the old bank building stood, there was only a pile of rubble there now. She sat down, sending up a cloud of dust and debris. She stretched her legs out, demolishing a pair of nearby buildings before they come to rest in a fractured parking lot. She sighed and leaned back, \"its good to be home...\" </span></div></div>",

She placed each of colossal feet one in front of the other as she stepped almost nimbly through the streets between the crumbling buildings. This had been her domain for some time now, and she was happy to see that it was just as she left it. When she finally came to rest at the remains of the old bank building, the young man ducked behind a nearby dumpster. She was close, so close that he could she the dust stirred up from her breath. \"Now now little ones, there must be someone out there left to entertain me...or do I have to go looking again\" she said in a sharp tone. He knew he wouldn't last long if she caught him. He quickly searched around him for a possible place to hide, but all the buildings in front of him were barricaded or covered in rubble. The only option was to sneak past her and head back home. It was risky but he did not want to sit and wait for her to discover him. He had seen what she'd done to her other \"friends\" and grew anxious just thinking about the torment he'd endure. He crept around the block and saw that the massive woman had her back to him. He began running from cover to cover as he made his way around her. Meanwhile she had rolled over and rested on her side, picking through the buildings looking for humans. \"Ahh there you are\" she cooed as her hand slipped through a massive hole in the side of one skyscraper. She withdrew a trembling figure whom she then deposited on her thigh before continuing her search. He sighed with relief, she was distracted. He decided to make a break for it across the deserted urban corridor but as he began to sprint across the cracked pavement he saw her hulking form shift. Startled by her movement and the tremor she created he crashed into a nearby trashcan which sent him sprawling to the ground. His head and hands ached as he caught himself on the gravel below and as soon as he realized what had happened he shut his eyes. He knew she would discover him now, it was only a matter of time. The giantess spun her head around to address the disturbance and saw the tiny figure laying deathly still on the ground. A devilish smile crept across her face as she reached over and plunked his body off the street and brought it closer to her face. \"Now now who's this...\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't know what to do, he simply lay in her palm choking back tears. She raised her eyebrows inquisitively, \"Not in a talking mood?\" she boomed. \"I can understand that, but you'll have to speak up eventually, otherwise I'll lose interest...\" she paused for a moment, letting the fear well up in him. \"...and dispose of you.\" She cackled softly to herself. Without looking down she scooped up her other captive and adjusted her sitting position. She held a cowering human in each hand and her attention shifted back and forth between the two, obviously trying to unnerve them. Suddenly the other captive spoke up, \"You--you can't keep doing this! We'll stop you, you--you huge bitch!\" he screamed. Her eyes shot to him and narrowed with anger. \"Rude\" she said. She closed her hand around him slowly. His muffled screams began to emanate out, the young man stifled in a scream and shook violently. The giantess sighed and turned back to young man, \"you little guys never learn...\" she said matter of factly. She tossed the other man over her right shoulder carelessly, his screams sounding in the distance as he crashed into a building three blocks away. \"Now, its just you and me\" she cooed. The young man felt like he was going to vomit...</span></div></div>",

He figured if he could just get enough momentum he could jump out past her hands and finally end it all. Meanwhile the giantess eyed him curiously. She had never encountered someone so eager to escape her that they would surrender their own life. This only made her want to play with him more. However, there were more pressing matters to attend to at the moment. Her cool eyes locked down on the minuscule figure as he bent down, readying himself to sprint off her hand once again. Just as he started off she brought her other hand down in front of him. He collided with her colossal fingers and slumped down onto his side. <br>\r\n\"Come now, I can't have you killing yourself. Am I really that bad?\" she asked with a laugh. The young man lay down in defeat, curling up into a ball to await the tortures he knew were coming.

She frowned. The sadistic glee on her face melted away to disappointment. \"Booooring, but you seem to be full of surprises so you don't need to be so scared...I think I'll keep you around. Can't have you trying to off yourself while your with me though.\" She hummed innocently. \"Lets see if I can't find a place where you won't get into too much trouble...Ahh here.\" With her opposite hand she plucked the little man out of her hand while with the other she lifted the strap of bra on her left breast. She deposited the young man against her chest, gentle lower the strap over him to ensure he could not escape. She gave him a soft pat on the back and whispered down to him, \"there, don't go getting into any more trouble now, we're gonna have a nice little chat later...\" The young man sighed with relief, realizing that his life was not about to end. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All is according to the Will of Nature. I have learned this over many years, from many people. When I was a boy and the fisherman came back from the river with spears of trout I knew it was the Will of Nature that we would be provided for. When the Chieftain slew the Bonebiter King even though his face was nearly cloven in two, I knew it was the Will of Nature that we would resist our enemies. When my master, Ekburkan, showed me the hidden pools with which he spoke to the Ik-Haran I knew that it was the Will of Nature that we would never be left in the dark. My name is Kleito, and it is the Will of Nature that I become a Shaman. I will guide our people through this furious world. I will show them how to tame the many beasts. I will teach them not to fear the darkness. I will heal their injured and commune with their spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was twenty when it all changed though. It started with a simple matter. One of the Chieftain's nephews came running back into the village screaming about demons in the crags. He and the other boys always wandered off to the cliffs overlooking the lake when they were done with their daily chores. It was a harsh place, and my master Ekburan had warned the elders many times that the place was cursed. Mothers often told their children to avoid the place, but only out of fear that they may hurt themselves on the jagged rocks. Few believed our warnings. Now, perhaps, the people would take heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Adu?\" the Chieftain asked when he saw his young kinsmen running back through the brush with the other boys. \"Where is Vaanku? Where is my son?\"<br>\r\n\"Black demons in the hills!\" Adu cried with tears streaming down his face. The whole lot of them were terrified. \"They looked like men with the heads of wolverines! They moved like mist. They have taken Vaanku!\"<br>\r\nImmediately the Chieftain was overcome with grief. ALthough he was furious with the boys for disobeying his orders he was more dismayed by the loss of his son. Without hesitation he started off toward my master's hovel on the outskirts of the village. He brought with him many of his strongest, bravest, warriors. When they had reached my master, I saw that the Chieftain face was red with sadness. He pleaded with Ekburkan, asking forgiveness for his apathy and begged him to aid in his sons return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ekburkan, master of the Wilds, do not forsake me now! I have wronged you yes, but now I see my mistake. Do not leave my son to these foul creatures!\"<br>\r\nEkburkan was always a wise man, but he knew that this situation was far more grave than the others realized. <br>\r\n\"I cannot chief, it is not within my power to deliver your son from these beings for I do not know of them. But there perhaps one who might...\"<br>\r\n\"Who?\" The chief asked with desperation. <br>\r\n\"One of the oldest Gods of the wood. She dwells beneath the oldest tree in the oldest part of the forest, many many miles from here. It is said she has power over all in this domain.\"<br>\r\n\"Then I shall go to her!\" the Chieftain decreed, but as he stood to leave Ekburkan stopped him once more. <br>\r\n\"No, these Gods, are not to so casually be trifled with. Only one accustomed to their ways may broker such a deal.\"<br>\r\nThe Chieftain's face sank. He knew what this meant, and it grieved him because he knew that only a Shaman could make contact with this goddess. Likewise it was readily apparent to all in teh village that Ekburkan himself could not go for he was far too old and blindness had already began to set upon him. To make such a journey would be treacherous for him. There was only one choice. <br>\r\n\"I shall go and petition the goddess for aid!\" I cried out. <br>\r\nAll eyes turned to me. The Chieftain's face lit up with relief for a second but it quickly faded when Ekburkan chided me. <br>\r\n\"You cannot go Kleito, you are not yet ready!\", But I was adamant. This would be my defining moment. If I could make contact with the goddess, bring back the chieftain's son, and perhaps establish good relations with the governing deities than my place in the village would be solidified. I argued on and on. Finally the Chieftain came to me after I had stormed out of my Masters hovel and said:<br>\r\n\"Kleito, forgive your master, for though he is wise he is far too cautious. I have faith in you, I must after all for you are my only hope. Here take this\" he went on, handing me a special totem made of bone. \"This is my seal, take it with you and you will have safe passage through these lands. Please hurry! Go to the goddess and ask what you must. If she asks something of me I will grant whatever is in my power to recover my son.\" I nodded.<br>\r\nThe next morning, I rose earlier than usual, just as the sun began to creep out over the ridges. I gathered what I could, including my gnarled stave that I had fashioned from a twisted Willow branch. Then, I was off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I will not bore with my journey through the wilds for it pales in comparison to what happened to me when i finally arrived. I swam across a stream. Climbed across a hill of boulders. Staved off a pack of savage wolves and when I drew closer I wandered aimlessly for hours in a dense fog. Finally, whether it was by sheer luck or divine will, I came to my destination. Before me was the largest tree I had ever seen. Its gnarled roots spread out in an unending fan, creating massive hills in the woodland and displacing other lesser trees. The trunk was cut off a third of the way up, leaving only splayed bark and mountains of moss along the surface. Enormous cracks in the tree's body sprouted life of all sorts. Flocks of birds milled around it as though it was a mountain. I had never been so fully humbled in my life. I took a second to take a knee and give a thankful prayer to Sydros, Lord of the Sky, but remembered how fickle the gods were. It would not be wise to offer a prayer to one god while in the domain of another. A murder of crows eyed me hungrily from a nearby maple, cawing after me as if to mock my approach. I was yet unphased. My skin dripped with sweat, my heart raced, and my muscles grew weary from the day's travels. Yet the excitement drove me forward. I would have to conduct myself carefully if I was to survive and flawlessly if I was to be successful in my mission. I could see the enormous hole in the tree's side, leading to the Goddess' home beneath the massive trunk. Before it was an enormous stone table which served as the deity's altar. Many sacrifices had been placed here over the years, usually when the Goddess slept or was away. Few wanted to meet her in person but if my petition was to be heard I would have to face her myself. <br>\r\nWhen I stepped onto the stone surface the mist seemed to close in around me. A sharp whisper began to pull at the back of my head. <br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" I paused, the voice faded, and I continued on. Then again it hissed: \"Someone coming to seek my aid?\"<br>\r\nI didn't like how she was in my head already, but I knew that I had to follow through with protocol. I knelt down on both knees and began to meditate. <br>\r\n\"Have you brought me an offering?\" the voice came again. I had. From my sack I produced a human effigy woven from fine flaxen bundles and decorated with shiny stones, black glass, and beads. Feathers from at least twelve birds, the bones of a vixen, and bundle of human hair, blood of a new mother's womb, and small shells from the lake. I set it in front of me on a slightly raised deus. No sooner had I withdrawn my hands that the mist enveloped it completely. Whether it was still there I could not yet tell. My mind was seized by other things, namely the massive shadow rising up out of the fog. A warm orange glow appeared from the depths of the tree. The figure was distinctly female, with long hair. Her shoulders arched back and finally in the gloom I could see her face. It was painted with many strange signs with white and red clay. Her hair was smooth and brown, like that of a fine mare. Her eyes though! Here eyes were a deep green. So green that they reminded me of newly budded leaves. Those dark pupils darted across my form. Finally she spoke again. <br>\r\n\"Such young blood comes to me this day.\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't know how she got there, or where she was, only that she had to keep moving forward. She saw a small light ahead, illuminating a lone door. As she walked forward she heard a scream come from behind the door. \"Hello?\" she cried out. No reply. She continued forward, somewhat uneasily approaching the door. \"Hey are you alright in there?\" she said nervously. She reached for the doorknob, but just as she was about to touch it it began to turn, back and forth, back and forth. The door began to open<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadelyn suddenly awoke, her head laying atop a mound of books and papers. She quickly sat up in her chair, brushing her loose hair from her face, her eyes wide. She looked around her small apartment, with a tinge of fear. What an odd dream, she thought. She looked back down at her desk seeing the pieces of last night's work strewn about...ugh! \"I need some kind of break, all this studying is getting to my head\" she said to no one in particular. She sat up and switched on the tv on her nightstand, the news was on and they were talking about her again. \"Ugh seriously? They're STILL talking about this shit...\" she said with frustration. The shit she had been referring to happened a few days before when Madelyn, or Mega Woman rather, stopped a series of attacks in New York by a technology based terrorist cell, using machines and helicopters to attack major landmarks. She managed to dispatch them with relative ease, like swatting flies out of the sky. However being a giantess she naturally caused some damage of her own, and everyone either praised her over and over again for her deeds or criticized her for her mistakes. In the past year and half that she's been Mega Woman she would always get a mix of love and hate from the people. The government always hated her because they couldn't control her, in her first few appearances (before anyone knew who she was or what she was trying to do) the army repeatedly tried to destroy her, but their weapons did little to affect her. The worst though was the media, half wouldn't stop talking about her outfit alone. Though she like helping people, honestly the attention was getting to annoy her, she was just glad most people hadn't found out who she really was yet (they had a good idea though).

Madelyn was just about to reply when she saw what time it was. \"Oh shit!\" she cried, she realized that she was late for her morning class, she ran into the bathroom to get ready. A few minutes later she emerged, hastily gathered her things and headed out the door. Just as she got in the hall she doubled back, ran into her room and grabbed her brown tote which held her Mega-Woman costume. She rarely went anywhere without it nowadays, should any trouble appear. She bolted down her stairs and raced across campus. When she saw the pscyh. building she slowed down, seeing she had a few minutes left. As she walked up the path she heard a familiar voice behind her. She turned around and saw her friend Noah walk up. Noah was a freshman, she didn't particularly know him that well but they had Intro to Art History together. He was sort of a shy kid, and a tad eccentric but almost everyone who met him ended up liking him. \"Hmmm you're looking rather disheveled this morning, rough night?\" he said whimsically. She looked over at him, raised an eyebrow and replied \"Oh yes, good morning to you to, girl's love being described as disheveled\" she said sarcastically but without malice. \"Am I wrong though?\" he said. \"No no you're right, but then again you're always right\" Madelyn retorted. She stopped at the door to psych building, brushing a few of her loose blonde strands back into place. \"Well I gotta run, I guess I'll see ya later\" Madelyn cried but Noah just sorta nodded and kept on his way as if he hadn't heard anything at all, he was odd like that but Madelyn found it charming. She went in and found her seat. As class went on she began to nod off, still tired from all the sleep she didn't get the night before. Just as her eyelids began to shut the whole room began to shake. She quickly perked up, everyone in the room did the same exchanging looks of concern and confusion. \"Alright everyone calm down its probably nothing\" their professor said. Just then an even greater tremor rocked the entire room, and one student by the window looked out. Fear quickly replaced his former look of apathy as he peered upward \"oh my god...\" he whispered. Everyone rose from their chairs and cautiously approached the window. Madelyn too got up, she looked out and saw...</span></div></div>",

Mega-Girl had been rather inactive these past few years and it seemed to her that she had retired, but if she came out of retirement for this than it must be serious. Madelyn turned away from the body, fearing that if she looked at it for too long she would lose it. She quickly scanned the room, seing nothing but smoke and rubble. She heard wails of fear and sadness from the others but saw no immediate bodies. Madelyn turned to join the tide of students running out of the room, she knew this wasn't the end...more trouble was no doubt to come and if she was going to do anything about it she needed to act fast. She bolted down the hall till she found a half collapsed janitors closet, she looked both ways down the hall to be sure no one would see her enter or leave and once she saw it was clear she forced her way in and began to change. Madelyn had learned to change pretty quickly in the past 18 months and in less than a minute she had fully changed into her Mega-Woman outfit. With it she wore knee-high purple high-heeled boots, a small pair of black and purple short-shorts and a short of sports bra like top that was likewise purple and black. The whole suit was designed by Madelyn's friend Oliver in the engineering department, made of a special synthetic material which in addition to being soft and durable it was also able to grow with her. Over her face she wore a thin mask which hid her face just enough that those who didn't know her VERY well would not know who she was. She wore her blonde hair down, and it reached down to her scapula. As she finished she quickly bolted out and open window and charged through the brush a ways so that when she grew she wouldn't damage the building nor would people know that that was where she came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Madelyn had reached a safe distance she took a second to collect herself. She then began to focus hard and quickly began to grow. First she surpassed the tree but she quickly began growing faster and faster, her legs elongating her body expanding. Not long after she was as tall as the campus building and in a few more moment she loomed over them too. She kept growing and growing until she finally reached about 500 ft tall, her usual height. The rest of the campus was dwarfed my her now massive form, the building only reached up to her calves and the people looked only to be about one and half inches tall. Mega-Woman took a second to scan her surrounding, to make she she wasn't about to step on anyone or anything important. She then looked up and looked all around the sky, scanning for further alien threats. She saw none, and decided to go and help Mega-Girl. She took three long strides and then knelt down next to Mega-Girl body each step causing a small earthquake for the tiny people below. Mega-Girl was covered in blood and Mega-Woman saw she wasn't breathing, just as she reached out to touch her she began to shrink back to her former size. Mega-Woman sighed, and her eyes began to well-up with tears. Meanwhile the many panicked students and faculty now looked up at her expecting her to do something, she noticed this and said \"Everyone please just remain calm and get back to your dorms, everything is going to be fine, don't be afraid...\".  She heard screams and yelling from the tiny people below, but could not make out anything they said. Just then she felt something hit her squarely in the back, a sort of burning sensation followed soon after as her whole body was thrown off balance and she feel inward on top of pscyhology building. She managed to catcher herself before she completely destroyed it. Most of the building crumbled against her body, but she was able to stop herself from destroying it completely, \"oh god, I'll never hear the end of this\" she thought to herself. She quickly stood up and twirled around to see and odd bluish ship hovering a hundred feet above her. Her eyes narrowed, and could tell this was not an earth ship. She decides to....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

What she did, she started to increase herself to a bigger to about 1000ft. She is right where the ship was firing at her. She is easily defending the people as the weapons has no effects on her at her massive height. Mega-Woman grabs the ship, and rips it easily and eats it like nothing, killing the aliens in the process. But... more ships then descend on the sky, firing at Mega-Woman. \"Well, this is going to be interesting... try this!\" Mega-Woman yelled out, and then she charges her eyes and focuses her energy, and then she fires the lasers onto them, blowing them up like fireworks. The people were easily getting to safety just as she deals with them without problems. Eventually, the aliens gave up, and their ships retreats back into space. \"Well, that's pathetic for the aliens!!!!\" Mega-Woman said, the people came out and celebrated for her victory as she won against the aliens. \"Horray...

The meeting had been called to resolve the recent international issues caused by project GIDA, a secret government program which hoped integrate genetic coding of different species. It was this program that generated the now world famous Girlzilla, as she was popularly called. When she was first released she got quite a bit of media attention. Nations around the world were outraged, fearing this new technology could be used to breed a super army. The action was condemned by the UN Security Council and now nations everywhere were in a desperate race to make their own super-humans.

She rose from her bed and approached the door, trying to wake herself up from her rather restless sleep. \"Ready for the big day?\" She heard a tiny voice chirp. She looked up and saw Takumi, the systems engineer waiting on a platform just above the door. He was sitting before a large panel of buttons, dials, and levers all of which controlled the hangar and its functions. \"Morning Takumi,\" she replied rather sluggishly, still rubbing her eyes. \"Just keep your cool and everything will be fine, I hear the old Colonel has a surprise for you as well...\" Takumi chimed, trying his best to sound uplifting. \"Yeah I bet he does\" Girlzilla said with a heavy tone of condescension. \"Well goodluck, door's opening in 10...9...8...7\" he began to count down. Girlzilla though wasn't paying attention though, she was still thinking about these other giantesses. Would they be like her? Will she get to meet them? What does this mean for her and the rest of the program? \"3...2...1\" Takumi finished, suddenly the hangar door opened letting in a blinding ray of sunlight. Girlzilla stepped out, shielding her eyes with her hand. She was immediately met with cannons filled with confetti and the cries of thousands. As her eyes adjusted she looked out at the tiny townspeople cheering in the streets and from rooftops. She stepped out into the streets which had been cleared for her. She began her usually parade down to the center of town where she would meet the mayor and proceed with the day's activities. As she passed down the street, the crowd closed in behind her, cutting off her path back and following her to her destination.

The day is known as Girlzilla day, and it's a very important holiday as it is to celebrate the great heroic deeds that Girlzilla has done over the years for the people. She has help built cities, she has defended them from monster attacks, terrorist attacks, and many other threats, so the people decided to honor Girlzilla by giving her a holiday by her great name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holiday pretty much consist of a huge parade that is in her nane, and then the monster known as Girlzilla appears herself, and she comes in acting like any kaiju would, but she doesn't destroy the city, she just roars like a monster and just walks through the city. She really embraces alot of the people, especially kids who just loves her. The kids would play on her during the day, and more. Heck, she is even worshipped as a Goddess during that day, and heck, they even get to see her destroy stuff like a giant monster. She is a kaiju after all, so may as well be one sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were ton of things made after her, like video games, movies, action figures, commericals, etc... And all of it started the Queen of Monsters herself. One of her most favorite roles is when she becomes the monster herself and attacks the city! Man, this day is just awesome for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how to experience it?</span></div></div>",

She was coming back from the cargo bay when she saw The Atom bolting down after her. \"Diana wait I need your help!\" he cried after her, his voice filled with desperation. She turned around and grabbed a hold of him. \"Calm down Ray, what's wrong?\" she said calmly. \"My experiment...its...its going unstable come on!\" he cried pulling onto her. \"Alright alright just calm down and explain\" Wonder Woman replied as they reached The Atom's lab. She looked about and saw a collection of various machines and gizmos that The Atom used in his size altering experiments. \"Well I was working on a way to stabilize my regrowth process and...well things got out of hand, its hard to explain but the controls are locked up and I need someone super strong to open the quanta chamber!\" he cried pointing wildly to a large glowing cone shaped machine. Wonder Woman waited a second longer, she then immediately stepped up to the machine and punched a hole in it. Meanwhile Dr. Palmer was typing away at his station trying to bring his machine under control. As Wonder Woman ripped the machine open with relative ease a blinding light erupted out. \"No no this isn't supposed to happen, the core is getting to hot...we have to..\" Dr. Palmer cried, but he was interrupted by a blast that sent Wonder Woman flying. The intense energy knocked the amazon out cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to a few minutes later. As she opened eyes and stood up she saw The Atom looking up at her. He looked like he had shrunk down to 2 feet tall. \"Hey what happened? Why did you shrink-BAM!\" Wonder Woman rammed her head into the ceiling as she stood up. How could that be though, she thought, the ceiling is like 16 feet tall. She then looked around and realized that Dr. Palmer had not shrunk but she had grown! \"Wha- what happened to me...\" she asked, obviously quite stunned. \"There was a malfunction, the core...it...it changed you quantum ratios you started growing as soon as you were knocked out...\" he said sheepishly. \"what does this mean? will I- BAM!\" she hit her head again she could feel herself growing even more. \"You will keep growing until you stabilize, you took a lot of energy so you will likely grow a lot more, we need to get you off this ship!\" he said, but she had already bolted for the transport pad. She ran down the hallway, her now massive feet shaking it violently as she went. She reached the pad and The Martian Manhunter was there. \"Diana what happened to you?\" he asked quizzically. \"No time J'onn beam me somewhere without many people, hurry!\" she said desperation mounting as she continued to grow bigger.

The the green grass would normally have been knee high but now as she looked down she saw that she was growing fast. She began to get dizzy and finally fell to her knees, clutching her head in pain. She began to fade out of consciousness, just as this was happening she could hear The Martian Manhunter on her ear piece...\"Diana...Diana are you alright...we..ne....can you....\" but the transmission ended as she faded into darkness. Moments later she began to stir, as she awoke she could feel the soft grass underneath her cheek and a nagging dizziness in back of her head. She blinked her eyes open and saw a small blur in front of her. She could hear a subtle noise too, as if someone was speaking to her. Her eyes began to focus and adjust to the mid-afternoon light when all of a sudden she saw the tiny ant-sized figure. \"Wha-\" she began, the little person was waving up to her. Wonder Woman shifted her position so as to get a better look at the little guy, twisting her body so that she rested on her hands and knees, but the slight movement seemed to cause tremors for the little guy who seemed to struggle to keep standing. She leaned her head down and saw a young man staring up at her. \"Are you ok? who are you?\" she asked quickly, but she didn't anticipate the force of her voice and the sheer intensity of both its amplitude and the force from her breath sent the tiny man flying backward. A mixture of guilt and surprise came over her face, she reached down picked him up with two of her figures, careful to be as gentle as possible. She set him in her palm and brought him up to her face. Now whispering, \"Are you ok?\" the man lifted himself up and and replied. Wonder Woman could hardly hear his tiny voice, so she turned her head and brushed her ebony hair behind her ear, she brought her hand up next to her looming amazon ear and said: \"sorry what was that?\". The man repeated himself and Wonder Woman could finally hear him. \"I'm ok, you...you did land on my house but I was outside...\" at this Wonder Woman turned to her right and saw the shattered, flattened remains of wood house next to an old dirt road. \"OH I'M SO SORRY!\" she cried, forgetting to monitor her volume. She turned back to her tiny friend and saw him covering his ears. \"sorry...was anyone hurt\" she said, whispering again before lifting him back up to her ear. He went on to explain how he had been renting the place and how he had seen her massive form from inside and had come out to see, only to nearly escape death when she fell over.

His head began to spin from vertigo, \"I'll be right back, stay here...\" Wonder Woman's voice boomed overhead. She turned her palm and he rolled off onto the ground. She stood up to her full height, casting a massive shadow across the shattered house. Her looming form turned towards the rising smoke and took a few steps toward it...the ground shook violently with each step, in a few stride she had come to the crest of the hill and looked out over towards the long stretch of woods. The trees were ablaze with bright orange flame. She scanned the scene but saw nothing in detail for her vision was clouded by the mass of smoke. Suddenly she heard a strange noise amid the roar of the fires, through the smoke several helicopters emerged. Like flies they buzzed around circling her head, waist, and legs.

If you are the general what's going on? Why are you just standing around while there's is a forest fire raging out of control?\" her whispering voice sent a few trees flying and several soldiers were forced to cover their ears from the sudden hurricane created by her voice.

The array of tanks, soldiers, and helicopters released a barrage of missile and artillery fire on the colossal woman. However because of her enormous size, the shots did nothing to her, she hardly felt them. But the helicopters buzzed around her like tiny flies, releasing waves after wave of machine gun fire and missiles. Wonder Woman didn't want to hurt the tiny soldier, but she couldn't allow them to continue attacking her. Her skill and reflexes would have easily allowed her to snatch the copters from the sky but she couldn't risk crushing them. Meanwhile on the ground, troops of soldiers, tanks, and jeeps surrounded her position, keeping a safe distance from her towering feet. Wonder Woman had an idea, she took a deep breath, drawing in a massive amount of air and then, with the force of seven hurricanes she released the air from her lungs, blowing a powerful gust into the flight pattern of the circling Apaches. The force of the blast shattered the helicopter canopies and caused them to lose their momentum, sending them spinning out of control. As one descended Wonder Woman reached her hand out and caught it; the rotor flew off and the remains began to smoke. She looked down at her palm and saw the cockpit open and two minuscule figures came stumbling out. Whilst the other helicopters spun towards the earth, their cockpits opened up and small figures shot out with parachutes trailing behind them. However as they floated to the ground a titanic hand caught them up. After Wonder Woman had gathered all the small pilots she turned her attention to the ground forces. They were spread out around her. She needed to deter them, so she lifted up her foot and slammed it into the ground, causing a catastrophic earthquake to resound through the earth. The soldiers, tanks, and other surrounding objects were rocked furiously. Many stood up and ran after the earthquake subsided but the tanks and others stood, continuing to fire on her. She lowered her body and dumped the pilots on the ground. She stood and took a long step over the ground of soldiers. She turned back, brushed her hair from her face and said in her strained whisper: \"Go home, I am not a monster!\" She then continued walking on, massive tremors emanated from each footfall.

She was so preoccupied by her thoughts and her attention scanning the ground that she didn't notice a large passenger jet flying not far in front of her. Though she wasn't flying particular fast the sheer force of the shockwave sent out by the air displaced by her gigantic form caused the pilots to experience terrible turbulence. She flew past and saw the plane turn away from her quickly and suddenly begin to plummet towards the ground. She drifted down after them, catching the plane in her hands before it fell too far.

A couple feet above him, Wonder Woman's shaded face hung over him, her dark ebony hair cascaded down around her head, almost like an enormous tent. The boy tried to run away but before he could get more than 10 feet he came face to face with colossal finger. Whilst sprawled on the pavement he heard a deafening boom from above \"I'm sorry little one, but I don't want you to run away, I'm not here to hurt you or anyone...\". The young man looked up in terror, but his line of sight was cut off. In the darkness he felt himself be twisted rolled and raised. Suddenly the light returned and he found himself laying in the giantess' palm. He looked up at the superheroine's face and saw that she looked somewhat annoyed. \"I'm sorry\" he squeaked desperately, trying his best to collect himself. Wonder Woman frowned, \"Oh Hera help me! you needn't be sorry, I'm just starting to get sick of everyone treating me like a monster just because I...got a little bigger\". Wonder Woman took a second to look around and saw the the sun was starting to set... \"Why are you still here little one?\" she asked him calmly.

With Giganta a good ways off, beaten fairly badly at that, Wonder Woman had ample time to do a thorough search for her passenger. As she lifted her breastplate wild thoughts about his gruesome demise swam through her mind. She couldn't bare to think that she had allowed him to be crushed between her breasts or fallen to his untimely death. With her right hand she pushed her right breast aside slightly to get a better view of her cleavage. Then, she sighed. Lucky for her the young man was still trapped between her boobs and had only fallen deeper. <br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" she boomed from overhead. The boy's head was so cluttered and his body strained from all the rocking and commotion that he could hardly register what she was saying. Instead he simply peered up warily into the massive blue eyes nearly a hundred feet overhead. There wasn't much he could do, especially considering he had no idea what was going on. So, he simply nodded. Wonder Woman took that as a good sign. Her face melted into a mask of utter relief before looking back down to address him once again. <br>\r\n\"Will you be ok down there for now?\"<br>\r\nAgain, the young man was so rattled that he could hardly understand a word she said. Wonder Woman's titanic voice didn't help much either. Again he sort of cautiously nodded. The movement made him feel dizzy, forcing him to brace against Wonder Woman's breast for balance. She gave him a slight smile and gentle removed her hand, thus allowing her boobs to return to their original position, closing in around her bug-sized passenger. <br>\r\nWith the tragedy luckily avoided Wonder Woman turned her attention back to her fallen foe, who was just now rising back onto her feet. </span></div></div>",

The massive woman was sent sprawling onto the ground, choking for air. <br>\r\n\"I don't have time to deal with you right now, Giganta. I suggest you turn yourself in now, don't make me come back for you.\"<br>\r\nGiganta was just barely able to wheeze out a response before Diana took to the skies once more. As she rocketed up into the air, an enormous wave created a deafening thunderclap. The wind whipped around her, creating great tumultuous meteorological problems for the minuscule world below. <br>\r\nMeanwhile her tiny passenger, struggled to keep his bearings. With his head just barely poking out from from the cusp of Wonder Woman's cleavage, the sudden surge of wind nearly sent him flying back into the dark abyss behind him. The speed at which the titanic Amazon flew was nauseating, but he knew he would survive it if he was smart about it. Hunkering down behind Wonder Woman's breastplate, the young man tried his best to grip to the soft skin of his colossal keeper. He began to consider everything that might happen to him from this point on. What would Wonder Woman do with him? What would become of her? How would he tell everyone he knew about all this. Its not he could just say: \"oh yes, so then this gigantic goddess stuck me in her boobs and we carried me around for the next week!\" It would get mixed reactions.

All the while taking heavy fire from the various soldiers, however this time she chooses to ignore the tiny things. The buildings quake and occasionally she'd step on a building or two but by now she was starting to not care as much, she simply wanted to find Circe and get back to normal. Wonder Woman looked down at a small multi-story building nearby and it looked as though there was a troop of soldiers on it, one of whom was manning a large comms unit. She reached down and carefully snatched the man up, bringing him up to her face. \"I need you to call someone for me-\" she boomed, trying her best not to overwhelm the little man. He simply screamed and squirmed between her two fingers. Wonder Woman sighed and set him back down....'now what' she thought to herself. Wonder Woman thought she might ask some of the civilians that were still in the city if they had seen Circe, but she feared they would panic and scatter. She found her way over to the evac trucks and saw many people already had scattered. \"Has anyone seen-\" but before she could finish something struck her in the face. Though it was lacking in force it was enough to make her lose her focus. All of a sudden a small fighter plane zipped just overhead followed by a few more who likewise released their payload on the giantess' head. Though they still did nothing physically harmful,l Wonder Woman found herself getting annoyed. She waited for them to come back around before clapping her hands together with a tremendous amount of force. The resulting shockwave sent the tiny planes spinning out of control. She managed to catch one but the others spun out, but not before the pilots ejected. Wonder Woman looked down at the small, banged up plane, and crushed the body of it in her hand. She dumped the tiny pilot out of the cockpit and lifted him up. With another sigh she said \"I don't suppose you've seen Circe...\". \"noo nooo I have\" the tiny figure stammered almost imperceptibly, \"she's...\"</span></div></div>",

She bent over slightly and deposited him on top of a skyscraper. As she stood back up to her full height she scanned the city looking for the stadium, meanwhile ignoring the continued barrage of bullets and missiles. She spotted it over by a bend in the river that cut through the town. In a few strides she was there standing over it. The roof had been pulled over the rest of the circular building, prevented any debris from the copters and planes from falling in. Wonder Woman knelt down so that she rested on her knees and grabbed either end of the circular roof. With almost no effort at all she ripped it from its steel anchors and casually set it aside. She looked down to see a rather modest in size football stadium which was illuminated by bright spotlights. Inside she saw a crowd of people all standing in a circle around a floating, glowing figure. \"Circe\" she rumbled, \"let them go...NOW!\" she roared angrily. \"Oh soooo pushy, and so disrespectful...\" Circe mused. \"No need to be so angry child, I have done nothing...truly terrible to them...yet...\" she cackled. Wonder Woman reached down to grab the glowing figure but before she could reach her Circe said...\"Ah ah ah.....you wouldn't want anything to happen to this poor young man now would you...\". Wonder Woman looked closer and saw that she had the same boy from before wrapped tightly in illuminated chains, floating next to her. \"Release him!\" she said, pounding her gigantic fist on the ground, causing the entire building to quake. \"Ahh but if I do that, then things would just be...too easy for you dear\" she said slyly. She began to laugh evilly, throwing  her head back as she did. Wonder Woman took her chance and reached down, flicking the tiny goddess across the stadium. She quickly reached over and scooped the boy up out of the air, just as Circe's spell broke and he began to fall to the ground. She brought her hand up...\"you ok little one?\" she asked anxiously. The boy was dazed but nodded, just as a powerful ray of light shot out at Wonder Woman. Luckily she reacted quickly and deflected the magical energy with her bracelet. \"YOU INSOLENT FOOL, HOW DARE YOU!\" Circe screamed, with almost the same intensity as the giant superheroine. \"ATTACK MY CHILDREN!\" she cried. The crowd in the stadium suddenly seemed to fade from their human form to that of some twisted gray demons. They took to the air, surrounding Wonder Woman, breathing fire and reigning magic down on her. She stood up, swatting the monsters away, but there were too many. She looked down at the boy who was being thrown about in her hand as she moved. \"Hold on, don't worry I'll keep you safe...\" she said as she....</span></div></div>",

They released a massive jet of flame, which Wonder Woman blocked with her bracelets. As they got closer she swiped at them with her arms, smacking all of them out of the air at once. The monster's onslaught continued though, surrounding her from every angle. She managed to grab some, but they were too numerous. Then all of a sudden the cloud of flying beasts was cut by sudden rocket fire. The military squadron appeared to fight the monsters as well. Wonder Woman stepped back out of the fray, careful not to run into any planes. While the rest of the military engaged the beasts, Wonder Woman took the opportunity to step back and assess the situation. She stepped carefully over city blocks till she reached a small (well at least by her standards) patch of grass next to the river, which appeared to have been some kind of park. She sat down cross-legged and sighed. \"Oh Athena guide me...\" she said with a mixture of relief and annoyance. She then felt something squirming down in her cleavage. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">errrr help...</font>\" a tiny voice called out. She had almost forgotten! Wonder Woman quickly reached down and fished the struggling youth from between her breasts. \"Sorry about that little guy, it was the safest option, and I needed both hands...\" Wonder Woman quietly pleaded. The young man was quite disheveled now, and was just trying to regain his breath....\"Well at least we got you back from Circe right?\" she asked him coyly. \"Now...where did she go\" the giantess asked somewhat to herself. She looked down at the tired youth, who looked about ready to collapse. 'hmmm I should let him rest, he's had a rough night' she thought to herself. She carefully laid him prostrate on her thigh. \"You take a second and rest\" she said to him calmly, \"then when you're ready I'll need your help with something\"....</span></div></div>",

She sighed with relief, \"At least that's over\". Suddenly another, sleeker, aircraft came zipping down from the sky. It came to a sudden stop fifty feet from Wonder Woman's face. The side door in the fuselage slid open and a tiny green clad figure emerged. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Diana! We have Dr. Palmer working on a way to fix you, but when his...err machine malfunctioned it destroyed the main core, he says it will be some time before he can get it working, the rest of the League is working on some kind of alternative but so far we got nothing....we need you to...</font>\" but the small figure was cut off by the boom of the gigantic Amazon's voice. \"Its fine, Green Arrow, I can manage, I'm getting used to this size now\" she said calmly. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> well you better get out of here quickly, the army still isn't too keen on you, we've been getting all sorts of hell from them, you're just lucky they had those monsters to deal with</font>\" the hero said in reply.

'He's right' Wonder Woman thought 'I'd better get going before they come back after me'. She looked down and nudged the youth laying on her leg, now slumped over in an apparent slumber. He shot up, startled by the sudden intrusion. \"Come little one, we need to get out of here, I have some questions for you and then I'll let you go\" the giantess said sympathetically. She stood up, the boy still her palm and saw some military helicopters heading her way. She looked down in her palm again and said \"sorry little guy, I need to keep you safe while I fly, I'll be sure to make you more comfortable this time\". She deposited him again in her cleavage, this time slipping him between her chest plate and one of her boobs, so that he would stay in place.

After all this giant woman had found him in a city, gotten him kidnapped by an evil sorceress, stuffed him in her bosom (not that he was complaining too much about it) and now wouldn't let him go until he answered her questions. He was exhausted, it was late at night and he had had enough of this super-human world for one night. She was being very kind to him but a combination of her enormous size and her domineering demeanor kept him fearfully silent. He simply stared back up at the inquisitive blue eyes that focused down on him. \"Well?\" she asked, trying to sound innocent but failing to mask her somewhat impatient tone. The boy looked up and shook his head; Wonder Woman squinted and leaned in closer and said  \"come now, this is important, I know you've been through a lot tonight but if you just tell me this I'll let you go I promise\". The boy began to shake and Wonder Woman noticed. She sighed again and closed her hand around him. She slid down off the cliff so that she sat in the valley, leaning against the canyon walls. She opened her hand again to reveal her tiny companion. \"Ok, I'm tired, you're tired and you're scared, but I swear to the gods...you can trust me, I won't force you to talk if you don't want to...\" she said.

Though she was huge the journey was still quite long and she usually would take her invisible jet instead of flying herself the whole way. The hot sun beat down on her, and she reasoned that her tiny companion was probably suffering from heat exhaustion. She could feel his tiny form nestled against her chest but he hadn't squirmed about recently. She found a small island chain and decided that it would be a good place to take a moment to rest and resolve her bearings. She drifted down and inspected her landing site before touching down, so as not to destroy anything. The area she landed in seemed uninhabited. Wonder Woman took a second to scan the horizon and noted the sun's position in the sky. She guessed she was getting close to the Mediterranean and that at this pace she should make it to Themyscira around sundown. Having satisfied her navigational needs she looked down to check up on her companion. He had slipped down her breastplate a bit and was wedged about (a centimeter to her but probably 8 feet in actuality) down between her chest and her armor. She lifted it up a bit and reached down to fish him out. She lifted him in her palm and inspected him closely, to ensure he hadn't hurt himself. He was certainly disheveled, his hair was tossed about and his clothes wrinkled and misplaced but aside from that he was ok. \"Alright there little one?\" she asked him, he started to say something but she couldn't quite tell what it was. \"Well I'm just taking a break, and giving you one too, doing alright down there?\" she asked him, again he replied but it was confusing hard to understand. She knelt down and was about to put him on the ground, so that he could walk a bit in the shade, too cool off from the blazing sun and her own body heat but then realized that he would only be thrown to the ground by the tremors from her foot steps. Instead she too sat down for a second and threw her hair back over her right shoulder, then laid him on the knape of her shoulder/neck where her ebony black hair shaded him from the sun....</span></div></div>",

She landed down in a dimly lit cove, surrounding on either side by two rocky crests, adorned with great marble statues that to Wonder Woman now only appeared to be a foot tall. She looked over the rolling tropical hills to the white citadel atop the spiraling acropolis. Smoke rose from one of the main temples and it was clear that Circe had been busy since her arrival. Wonder Woman's stomach suddenly growled, as if thunder. She realized she hadn't eaten in a few days and was feeling a extremely famished. She decided to ignore her hunger however and looked down her chest to address the boy. \"You aren't allowed to actually set foot on the island\" she boomed over head. The boy adjusted himself as he peered up from his vantage  point at the titaness' face. He hoisted himself up, grabbing on to the edge of her chest plate and scrambled up her breast so he could better see her. \"You will have to stay put down there, but you're probably getting used to it so just hang on, if things get too rough I want you to climb...err deeper ok\" she said, the boy nodding in reply. After taking care of that Wonder Woman turned her attention back onto the matter at hand and strode forward towards the city. She could already see hordes of flying demons buzzing about like insects.

'Mother will never let me hear the end of this' she thought to herself. She made her way to the acropolis where she saw a crowd of amazons battling hordes of monsters and demonic creatures. It was the she saw Circe atop the main temple, glowing with magical energy. She also saw her mother, bound in magical chains nearby, guarded by by several batlike creatures. \"Ahhh so you've found me yet again...\" Circe hissed. \"This has gone on long enough, surrender you cannot defeat me\" Wonder Woman said in reply, her voice welling up with anger. \"You are reaaaally getting to be quite a nuisance!\" Circe roared back, \"but pray tell how will you fight off all my minions without leveling your precious home?\".

Demonic creatures, bat-like monsters, and other foul horrors shrieked and spewed fire from their mouths as they descended upon her. The clawed and swiped at her but were unable to penetrate her armor and left only minor scrapes on her skin.

With a slight flick of her finger she knocked Circe out, her body going limp as she hung between Wonder Woman's thumb and forefinger. She dropped her at the edge of the crowd, and she was quickly swarmed by the nearest Amazons. They took her away binding her in chains that would cancel out her magic powers. Wonder Woman half smiled awkwardly addressing her kin, \"greetings sisters, things have been...pretty strange recently\" but instead of receiving a clear answer they cheered. Wonder Woman noticed Artemis nearby waving to her. She quickly snatched her up and brought her up to her face so she could hear her better. \"Yes Artemis?\" she said plainly, \"Things have been chaotic here as well princess, your mother is indisposed at the moment...but don't worry we'll take care of Circe...\" Artemis replied. Wonder Woman nodded in response, \"Well I probably shouldn't stay too long, I've only been here a few moments but I've already caused more damage than I'd care to...\". Artemis likewise nodded, \"So how did you get so...\" she began before Wonder Woman cut her off, \"Its a long story, I'll tell you when I return to normal...\". Artemis then began again, \"So who was she referring to? Who is with you?\", Wonder Woman strained a bit under Artemis' unexpected scrutiny. \"No one, I don't know who she could possibly mean\" she said, knowing all to well that bringing outsiders, especially males to Themiscyra was forbidden. She moved her hand up to her chest, laying her fingers gently across the cusp of her right breastplate. The boy felt himself gently pinned against her boob, signalling him to be silent and still. Wonder Woman continued to tell Artemis the recent news before depositing her back on the ground. She nodded to the rest of her kinsmen before taking off, landing on the other side of the island to collect her thoughts and check on her minuscule companion.

She leaned in and whispered, hoping that her thunderous voice would not be heard on the other side of the island, \"Thank you for that, you've been very patient with all of this and have put up with a lot...I'm sure you were getting hot down there.\" He didn't say anything reply just sorta slumped back. Wonder Woman sat and felt her stomach growl again, she hadn't eaten anything since she grew and it was starting to take its toll. She knew there was an orchard nearby so after setting the boy down and swiveled herself around over to a nearby forest, she plucks several of the fruit trees out of the ground like dandelions and shakes them till all the fruit fell into her open palms. After uprooting almost 20 trees she finally had a handful of tiny fruit. She lowered her hand next to the boy who lay on the grass half asleep. He greedily took some and began eating them. Wonder Woman lifted her hand back up and dumped the remaining fruit in her mouth, it wasn't much but it would do for now. However her remaining hunger left her feeling weak and the night had already descended. Wonder Woman stretched her colossal legs out flattening some of the nearby forests and leveling a small mountain, causing the rocks to crumble to the ground and the entire island to quake. \"Sorry\" she whispered, after noticing the destruction she caused. She sighed again, growing tired of her massive size she began  to lay down along coastline, weary from her flying, hunger, and her thoughts. She tossed her long silken black hair (now hundreds of feet long) so her head lay on the grassy earth, her blue eyes looking out into the violet seascape. As she was looking out her line of sight was disrupted by a tiny figure popping up in front of her face. The boy looked at her quizzically, but he suddenly stumbled back from the force of Wonder Woman's breath. \"Sorry little one...\" she said her voice trailing off, \"I'm very weary after all that has happened, I think I will rest here for tonight, tomorrow I will take you back, you've probably seen enough of me for one lifetime\" she said with a smile. \"you can wander about here, if some comes hide...I think you know where...\" she said with a bit of mischief before patting her cleavage gingerly, \"if you can't, go to the woods, just don't let me roll on top of you tonight...\".

Normally he'd be exhausted but he'd slept most of the way over, besides its not everyday you get to explore a bit of a hidden island. He looked back up at the sleeping giantess, her dark hair cascading around her face and neck reflecting back the moonlight. Her torso rose and fell with each breath, which washed over him with a wave of warmth. With her now laying down she somehow seemed even more massive and he decided to walk down towards the forest near her feet. As he strolled along he switched his attention from the seascape to Wonder Woman's massive form. He approached one of her hands that lay out next to her with her fingers fanned out over the sand. Her fingers loomed over him and he continued on past her waist admiring the reflection of moonlight on her golden girdle and the silvery stars on the bottom half of her armor. It took quite a long time to make his way down to the tip of her boots as she was a thousand feet tall. Once he reached the forest he wandered about a bit, but nothing of great interest was there to be found. He decided to return to Wonder Woman and wait for her to wake. As he neared the forests edge again he could hear voices in the distance, female voices. He began to panic...he knew that the Amazons would surely kill him if he was found. He began to sprint back hoping to get there before he was noticed. He didn't know where the Amazons were but he didn't want to risk it so he bolted as fast as his legs could carry him...ducking underneath the heels of Wonder Woman's boots and ran along the length of her legs so as to avoid detection. He could hear them approaching just over the soft noise of the sleeping giantess. He finally made it back up to her chest and he could hear the Amazons calling out to Wonder Woman, trying to wake her. He took a second to catch his breath and and then tried to climb up the length of her chest so that he could hide. But with each attempt he'd try and scurry up by clinging onto her bustier with one hand and the skin of her chest with the other. But with each breath he would loose his balance and fall. He was running out of time and could see a crowd of women appear near Wonder Woman's feet,  walking in his direction. He ran to cover under Wonder Woman's hair, crawling on his hands and knees till he reached her head and sprinted till he was next to her ear. He then spoke in a strained whisper/yell, trying to wake her so that she could divert the Amazon's attentions. Finally she stirred and began to lift her head, but it was so suddenly that as she sat up her starry earring collided with the boy. He clung to it desperately as she sat up, rubbing her eyes. The boy tried to climb up the surface of the silver jewelry but it was large even compared to him and could just barely hold on. Wonder Woman looked down to where she had been resting but saw the boy was not there. A puzzled look came across her face, oblivious to the fact that he now clung desperately to her earring. She then turned her attention to the approaching Amazons.</span></div></div>",

Wonder Woman nodded, unknowingly swinging the boy to and fro, causing him to nearly fall. He did his best to keep from crying out, biting his lip in fear and frustration. The Amazons departed, allowing Wonder Woman to return to sleep. As they retreated into the forest Wonder Woman looked back down at where she had laid. She flicked her eyes about in search of the boy, even checking her cleavage to see if he had stowed away in there. Then she suddenly heard a tiny squeak. She turned her head but saw nothing, then another, this time sounding more a semblance of words. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">help!</font>\" the boy cried. Wonder Woman was puzzled and as quietly as she could asked \"Where are you little one\". All he could get out was \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">earring</font>\" before he began to slip. Wonder Woman brushed her hair aside from her right ear and carefully lifted her finger up feeling around for the young man. She brushed against he strained tiny body clinging on for dear life and quickly but gently clamped down on him, carrying him to safety. She brought him out to her face and asked \"What are you doing there? you could have been found or worse!\" she cried out in a hushed tone. The boy only panted and shook with fear. Wonder Woman felt a wave of sympathy wash over her, she had put him through a lot and decided he needed to return to the normal world, one without evil sorceresses and giant women.

People came out of their homes to see what all the commotion was only to see a towering woman looming over them like a mountain. Wonder Woman knelt down next and produced the young man from her cleavage once again. \"You're probably getting pretty used to it down there,\" she said whimsically. The boy just nodded in reply. \"Well I've dragged you through enough, you should be able to get home from here, sorry I don't mean to just dump you off but I don't want anymore...err accidents to happen I could seriously hurt you.\" she said as she lowered him to the ground. \"Stay out of trouble now little one, and I'd keep most of your experiences to yourself, you don't want anyone else taking too much of an interest in you...\" she trailed off. She stood to her full height and scanned the horizon, she was still tired, and hungry but she had to find out if the Atom had made progress repairing his machine. She turned around but not before turning her upper body just enough so that she faced the young man again, blew him a kiss and a wink and walked off. The young sat there on the ground, his heart racing, his hair tossled from the events that had taken place over the last 24 hours or so and sighed...\"no one will ever believe me...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder Woman hadn't gotten far when suddenly a missile struck her. It was the army again, and after everything she had gone through Wonder Woman was tready to tolerate nothing more. She stopped over to the tank that had fired at her and picked it up off the ground. She tore off the swiveling turret and peered down inside at the tiny crew which now cowered below her. She held them waste high staring down menacingly at them. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/jlu/bios/ww/47.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/jlu...</a><br>\r\nSuddenly the terrified heard the giantess speaking in a thunderous voice...\"WHERE CAN I FIND SOMEONE FROM THE JUSTICE LEAGUE?\" she asked.

This town was still occupied by civilians so Wonder Woman took extra care as she touched down. It didn't take long for a chorus of screams to erupt from the surrounding land as the titanic Amazon landed, and everywhere people took to the streets, either to catch a glimpse of the giantess or to flee from her towering red boots. Wonder Woman scanned the ground around her, seeing tropes of people and vehicles gathered about. Finally a streak of green light cut across the landscape and came to rest in front of her face. \"Diana!\" the tiny figure cried. \"Hal, I'm glad I found you!\" Wonder Woman echoed in reply. She looked down around her again nervously, clearly afraid she'll accidentally crush a building or two. \"I know, but we've been monitoring you, but you're still a huge liability...errr literally\" he said. Wonder Woman nodded, \"I know, I still want to help but perhaps I should lay low for a while, have you figured out a way to fix me?\" she asked desperately. The Green Lantern sort of shrugged his shoulder's in reply, \"errr we're working on it, apparently The Atom's machine is really messed up, but we need you to travel to a safe location away from populous areas, just you're footsteps have been sending seismic activity up the coast...\". Wonder Woman winced, \"yeah sorry about that, its sort of hard to control when you're this big, I'll find a place\". Green Lantern drifted closer and flew towards her ear. \"Also just between you and me, the army getting pissed, they think you're gonna destroy the whole world or something...\" Wonder Woman gasped, \"I'd never\", \"I know\" Green Lantern interrupted but they're thinking about escalating their attack if you don't...you know, slip off the radar.\" Green Lantern flew back again and just before he departed he turned back to her, \"Good luck Diana!' and then like that he was gone. Wonder Woman looked down at the crowds of people staring up at her in amazement. She crouched down to get a better look at them. They all began to scurry about like tiny ants as she drew closer. \"Its ok I'm not gonna hurt you!\" she boomed. She looked over at a skyscraper which stood near by. At her full height, the skyscraper would only reach her waist, but from here she could see inside. She peered into some of the tiny windows and saw dozens of little people flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a young intern in a new law firm was just coming back from break. He had heard the commotion outside and felt the building shake and assumed it was an earthquake. As he approached the conference room hear what sounded like thunder but...also like a voice. As he opened the door he looked out the window across from him and saw an enormous female face peering in at him. \"Holy shi-\" he began, dropping his coffee on the floor. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/jlu/episodes/hawkdove/32.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/jlu...</a><br>\r\nHe was about to flee, but then instantly recognized the massive woman. It was Wonder Woman, no doubt about it. He cautiously approached the window until he could reach out and touch it. He leaned in against the glass and the her bright blue eyes finally caught him. She leaned a little closer and a sudden force erupted from her mouth. \"Hello little one!\" she said, the force of her breath and voice shattering the glass and causing him to fall forward. As he tumbled through the air he let out a terrified scream. But instead of coming face to face with the pavement 20 stories below he crashed into a soft surface. He shook his head and rolled onto his back. He looked up and saw Wonder Woman looking down at him. He sat up and realized he now rested in her hand. </span></div></div>",

Still being near the coast she spotted a modestly sized island which would be just large enough for her to roam around a bit but didn't look heavily inhabited.

Wonder Woman knew that if she was to rest here she needed to make sure that no one was in the house, in case her movements caused it to collapse. She cautiously approached the tiny building, which compared to her looked to only be a few inches long. She knelt down and extended her hand towards the minuscule building. She tapped the ground lightly in an attempt to shake the inhabitants out. No one emerged, so Wonder Woman carefully began to lift the cabin's roof which she then set aside. She looked inside and saw two cowering inhabitant curled up in the corner. <br>\r\n\"Come on out little ones, I promise I won't hurt you, I may be big but I'm gentle\" she said reassuringly. Still the tiny inhabitants did not budge. <br>\r\n\"Listen I need to stay on this island for a little while, its the most deserted place I can find for now. However, as I'm sure you noticed I've been making the earth quake a bit, so for your own safety I need to take you somewhere safer. The two strangers stood up slowly and Wonder Woman reached her titanic figures down and picked them up, depositing them in her palm. The Amazon's hand was like a football field to the humans and as the giantess stood back up her had shook ever so slightly, causing them to lose their balance. Wonder Woman carefully stepped across the bay until she came to the shore where she gentle deposited the two humans. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I promise I won't step on your house, when I'm gone you can come back\" she said as she turned back to the island. Once she returned she sat down and looked out across the water. 'What now?' she thought to herself. There was only so much a giantess could do before she caused more harm than good. She instinctively looked down to her chest to check up on her former companion but found no tiny person tucked against her boobs. She sighed. Things were pretty lonely as a giant, and it was only a matter of time before the army tried to attack her again. </span></div></div>",

At this depth the ocean only came up to her waist, still giving her several hundred feet on the boats. Water cascaded down her titanic form causing her skin and armor to glisten slightly in the fading daylight. The peaceful demeanor she had before was now replaced with one of anger. She glared down at the metal ships surrounding her, striking great fear into the men on deck. As they made ready to fire on her again she quickly reached out to the nearest boat and lifted it straight out of the water. To her the gigantic ships were only three feet in length and could be destroyed if she wished to do so. She brought the boat closer to her face to observe the tiny sailors. Many clung onto nearby railings for dear life, while others struggled to keep their balance. <br>\r\n\"Why must you keep attacking me?\" her voice boomed. Cries of terror came from the ship and she felt a sudden barage of gunfire strike her back as the other ships tried desperately to weaken her. Wonder Woman turned to face them. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I have only one option then\" with that she waded towards the shore and dropped the ship on dry land she quickly returned to the fleet which was now trying in vain to flee from the titaness. Wonder Woman quickly gathered up each of the ships in her arms until she had collected all of them. Men on board screamed in terror as their vessels were carried over to the island and deposited on the white sand. Wonder Woman seemed pleased with her work. Just then another flurry of helicopters flew in and began to buzz around her head. She turned to them menacingly. <br>\r\n\"That's it, this is your last warning! Leave me be, I'm not trying to hurt anyone and its clear you can't stop me at this size.\" her voice echoed. At last realizing the futility of their assault the choppers turned and left. Wonder Woman took a deep breath when suddenly....</span></div></div>",

Her massive feet left enormous craters everywhere the walked. Her flight created catastrophic wind storms. When she spoke she made entire cities shake. She was simply too big and she had far too much on her mind. \"I really just need to find someplace desolate where I won't harm anyone\" she said quietly to herself. Everyone she had gone people fled in terror and the military hunted her. Wonder Woman continued to fly, her mind preoccupied with recent events. Suddenly she passed through a cloud. As she soared through she found herself face to face with a fleet of planes. By the time she realized what was happening it was too late. Her momentum carried her headlong into the jumbo jets, which had appeared to be fleeing from her gigantic flying form. There were a series of flashes as a series of explosion went off across her body as six of the airplanes collided with her. The shattered into thousands of tiny pieces and began to tumble to the ground. Without thinking Wonder woman began scooping up what bits she could, collected shattered fuselages and wings in her titanic hands. Most of the minor debris fell to the ground. After some tricky maneuvering she managed to collect five of the planes before descending back to the ground, touching down lightly on some rolling hills. In a panic she laid the shattered plane on the ground and began picking through their remains for survivors. Some of the debris and gotten itself stuck on her person as well. She picked a few wings from her hair and one of the planes from her exposed cleavage. She looked down and saw the survivors climbing out of the wreckage gathering in a tiny puddle below. She heard tiny cries for help and felt little people crawling on her body. Some had stuck to her! She quickly went about picking the little people off of her. One clung to her nose, three behind her tiara, a couple behind her belt, two on her right thigh and at least a dozen down between her boobs. As she plucked them out she was careful not to harm them as many had already been severely injured. She placed them in her palm before cautiously depositing on the ground next to the others. The minuscule crowd cowered in fear in the shadow of gigantic woman. \"Its alright everyone, I'm sorry I'm just too big I didn't see you! Is everyone alright?\" she boomed from above. </span></div></div>",

Hundreds of people went screaming in all directions, creating a pool of chaos over which the gigantic woman knelt. Wonder Woman sighed and leaned down further. Her two enormous hands crash down into the path of the fleeing humans, creating a tremor that sent them sprawling to the ground. She began to ease the panicked mob into her palm. After some careful doing, she managed to sit the last of the tiny people on her hand. Those that sat in her grasp screamed and wailed with fear as their colossal captor rose to her feet and proceeded to walk to the nearest town. Upon her arrival she stepped over a few city blocks and found a nice, open square where she could deposit the humans. She let the slide off onto the ground, and stood back up to her full height. Nearby there was a gigantic monitor on a nearby building, showing a local news report. The screen had shaky footage of Wonder Woman's recent titanic escapades, including the recent mid-air collision. Wonder Woman knelt down and watched the screen anxiously. The media was making her out to be a monster as well. \"Hmph, after all this you guys still think I'm some kind evil rampaging monster?\" She asked to no one in particular.

Ares simply laughed and waved his hand. \"I know this...no one's a match for you...that's the point...\" With that Ares released a blast of red magical energy straight into her face.

She stepped back, her massive boot crushed a convenience store and another apartment building collided with her hip, causing it to crumble and fall. \"NOOOOO!\" she roared. By now more helicopters belonging to the media and to the cops surrounded her once again. She lifted her foot as if to smash the nearest block. She quickly removed her lasso of truth and wrapped it around her. \"Come on...\" her mind became sharper, focused. She remembered her times back at Themyscira, back with the Justice League and suddenly her anger began to soften. It was push and pull, for every peaceful thought she had another violent one would resurface. She began to stumble around even more, trying to maintain her composure. As she stepped the city below rocked and quaked. The skyscrapers shook, the roads crack and sank and countless people fell to the ground amid the extreme tremors. People screamed as the towering titaness trampled the city block. Something finally gave way. She let out a cry that sounded out for miles. \"AHHHH!\" she cried. Suddenly the red aura disappeared as the combined force of her willpower and the magic of her lasso drove the last traces of Ares' magic out. However the severity of the situation had made something inside of her snap. She was so exhausted she immediately lost balance. She felt light-headed, so much so that she finally collapsed.

Had it all been a bad dream. Her being a giant, causing untold destruction everywhere she went? Slowly her eyes opened once again, blinking as they adjusted to the sunlight. She lifted her slight off the ground only to realize that the events of the past few days were, in fact, reality. Around her were the shattered remains of a sizable portion of the city. Mounds of rubble surrounded her titanic limbs but what really caught her eye were the dozens of military personnel surrounding her. At least 20 helicopters dotted the sky around her and all across her body were tiny soldiers mulling about. Upon noticing the giantess waking they turned their attention to her head, weapons raised. \"Wha-what are you doing, get off of me!\" she cried. The sheer force of her voice caused many to drop their guns and cover their ears in a futile attempt to block the thundering noise. On her chest a dozen soldiers cried out in terror. Wonder Woman inhaled deeply, causing the majority of them to fall to down as her chest rose. She let out a gust of air as if a gale from a hurricane knocking the remaining down. She began to sit up. Causing those on her chest and neck to tumble down onto her boobs, a few stragglers  fell down between her breasts. Those on her stomach fell into her lap. Wonder Woman took a second to assess the situation and decided it was best to get out of here as soon as possible. But it was then she noticed the nearby command tent erected a hundred yards to her right. Perhaps she could finally put a stop to this constant harassment by the military if she could get a hold of whoever was in charge. She began collect the humans in her lap in her hand, ignoring the barrage of fire from the helicopters and tanks. After depositing them elsewhere she began to collect those that had fallen in her cleavage. \"Hera help me, if another of you little people end up down here\" Once her task was done she rolled over onto her hands and knees and crawled toward the camp. Personnel were fleeing in all directions and she was careful not to cause any more destruction than she already had. She plucked off the canvas cover of the command tent to reveal the tiny occupants below. </span></div></div>",

Instead of replying she turned to the General and said \"Please tell your men to stop attacking me I was tolerant the first few times but if it happens again I may not be able to control myself.\" He seemed unmoved \"You're a menace Wonder Woman not only to the U.S. but the rest of the world as well, I don't see why the rest of your teammates don't put you out of your misery right now!\" She looked completely sour but managed to keep her temperature in check \"Meaning?\" He looked squarely at the titanic beauty \"Until you somehow shrink back to normal I'm authorized to hunt you down and end your reign of terror. And believe me I will succeed, we got half of the world's military forces at our back, even LexCorp and Starlabs have offered to aid us so you won't be around for long I'm afraid.

Not on my watch!\" This was her first solo mission and she was determined not to screw it up \"Okay Kara here goes nothing Clark will be proud!\" As she swooped down ready to tackle whoever it was coming out of the spacecraft but instead there was a explosion of gas which spilled onto the streets people ran and screamed but with her mighty speed  Supergirl was able to avert the gas elsewhere but still she managed to breathe in a batch and coughed \"Uggh what was that stuff? Smells rank!\" She moaned as she watched for signs of any green men but was utterly surprised when insect things came out snarling and hissing but  her amazing superstrength she sent the vehicle and the invading bugs wherever it was they came from but as the people cheered and applauded for the teenaged heroine Supergirl felt strange and clutched her stomach \"Hey-what's happening to me?

Why am I....oh no it....it must have been that strange gas from those alien insect things! It's making me grow but how big will I get?\" She soon received her answer as she towered over the city at a alarming 80 feet! Kara was really terrified she had faced off against normal criminals,natural disasters even super powered villains like Parasite,Metallo and Lex Luthor but this was far more worse than any of that \"Oh no,oh no what's Clark going to say?

Until a loud explosion came from the Museum of Science. A group of Super-villains known as the Monster Society of Evil had mange break in and stole several pieces of advance scientific equipment. The leader of the group, Doctor Sivana was less than please. \"King Kull, you overgrown ape! I thought I told you NOT push the green button!\" The sound of Police sirens filled the air as dozens of Police cars show up. \"Oh just great,\" The mad scientist growled. \"Now the cops are here, at least do something useful and eliminate them!\" The Cave man grunted as he and the rest of Society attacked the cops. Meanwhile Doctor Sivana fiddled with a sci-fi looking gun. \"Hopefully this draw out the attention of that Big Cheese.\" Of course Big Cheese is his nick name for Captain Marvel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he doesn't know is that Captain Marvel is out of town, helping the Justice league. And the only one coming to tow is none other than Mary Marvel, sister of Captain Marvel. Soaring through the sky like an eagle Mary Marvel heads toward the Museum of Science. She arrives just Monster Society of Evil just finishes beating u the cops. \"So Captain Marvel little sidekick decided to show up. I was so hopping that the Big Cheese would be here. OH well, I guess I can test this on you!\" He Smiles wickedly as he pointed his sci-fi looking gun. \"What's that?\" She asked with a stern look on her face. \"This little beauty is going to CUT  you down to size!\" He pointed the gun at Mary Marvel and shot a lazer beam at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she seem fine. \"I guess your new toy is busted,\" She giggled. Suddenly she has a weird feeling in her stomach.The mad scientist laughed, \"It worked! My new Shrink ray worked!\" But it a little earlier to gloat as she starts to grows. she goes from 5 feet to 70 feet in a matter of seconds. \"Oh No! My shrink ray malfunctioned!\" Mary Marvel is amazed by her new height. \"Oh my, everything looks so small.\" Ten she smiles at the now tiny looking group of Super-villains. \"I guess it times I brought to the proper authorities.\" But even with her new size, the  Monster Society of Evil didn't go down with out a fight. After a short but epic battle, she had finally defeated them.

After all, she was able to handle all those bad guys with relative ease. She though of all the ways she can help the good folk of Fawcett City. Then she heard the siren of a Fire truck and turns in the direction of the alarm. She saw smoke rising out of the local orphanage with Billy Batson used to live. With out evening thinking, she flews toward the burning building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at the burning building, her left foot lands on a empty police car and caused an old abandon building to shake and fall down. Thinking quickly, she grabs a water tower and pours the contents all over the fire and putting it out. Not realizing the damage resulted by her new size, she takes a bow and says, \"You're welcome.\" Mary Marvel  excepted everyone to thanked her but what she heard was nothing was people screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes and sees everyone running away. \"No stop, I don't want to hurt anyone.\" She cried out. But no one was listening. She was almost alone, the keyword; alone. She looks done and sees one boy hiding behind a mail box. Mary recognizes him; he a rude little punk that bullied her brother Billy. Smiling mischievously, she picks him up by the collar of his shirt. \"NOW you listen, you are going to stop picking on Billy Batson Understand?\"  She expected him to obey, boy was she wrong. \"Why should I? And what are you gonna do if I don't?\" He grinned smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response, was to start tickling her. \"Hey stopped that,\" the boy laughed. \"Not until you promise to leave Billy alone.\" She stated. She kept on tickling for 3 minutes. \"All right, you win! I leave him alone,\" the boy cried. She places him back on the ground. She suddenly felt hungry, \"Oh dear, I'm so hungry. But I don't want let the people of the city stave.\" But there was a side effect of the mad scientist growth ray. Her mind and conscience temporally go away as she began to eat all within reach. After that she drank every bottle of soda. Soon after she appease her ravenous appetite, she soon return to normal (well as normal as 70 feet Super heroine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realize that was standing in the remains of a destroyed food mart.  \"Maybe staying this big wasn't a great idea.\" She told herself. But then she felted a weird painful feeling in the pit in her stomach. She then let out a long and loud burp that broke every window in a five miles radius and set off every car alarm in the city. Mary Marvel, blushed with embarrassment and covered her mouth with one hand and said \"Excuse Me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">What will happen now?</div></span></div></div>",

Seriously, she has no idea how she gets into situations like this. One moment she was trying on a nice little princess dress that she found in the back of her closet, when suddenly a hole seemed to open up under her and she fell down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she's been doing that for about five minutes. However it would seem to be coming to an end as the young Hero could see herself enter a bright light. Blinded by the light, she fell down and landed ass first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes and look around, she was in a room. An empty room, this room was white with a fancy feel about it and the only thing in the room was a table with some cookies on it. But she was more interested about how she's in one piece, she was falling for ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhh....\" she heard a voice underneath she looked down and saw a young boy. He looked about to be 10 years old with brown hair, green eyes and wearing a black T-shirt, brown pants and grey sneakers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOSH! ARE YOU OKAY?\" Kim said as she got off the young child and helped him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something hit me\" the young boy said as he got his senses straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me, sorry. I'm Kim Possible. And you are?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens his eyes to see that she wasn't lying \"No way! Your Kim Possible, I'm Jake and I'm a huge fan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks kid. I do my best, but I have to ask you a question? Do you know where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. I just fell down a hole and ended up here, and then you fell on me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's no good. Cmon Jake, let's figure this out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo both Kim and Jake looked around the room. While the only thing to really care about was the table and the cookies, Kim found a small door on one of the walls, but this door looks like it wouldn't even be able to fit a toddler, let alone a teenager like her. She looks over to Jake and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake! don't eat that\" she says running over and stopping Jake from eating the food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it says Eat Me\" jake retorted back. Thats when Kim saw that not Only the Cookies with the words eat me on them, but for the first time a golden key. No doubt to the door but it would be pointless as its too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other options, she reached down for a _____________ and ate it\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was the Cookie poisoned or something. She felt wooziness as her body has a sort of feeling quickly wash over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Kim\" Jake said as he looks over Kim. \"You've grown\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Jake\" Kim replied as she looked towards Jake. And just like he said, She grown. The table was around her knees and Jake was much smaller then he was before. She looks around the room and notices her eye level has raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What The! I must be around 7 Feet Tall!\" Kim realized. however things got even worse as Kim felt another growth spurt. As she started to grow again this time to 15 feet tall. Her head bumped against the roof as she had to slightly bend her back to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Jake who was just as amazed. \"Out of all things I've had happened to me, this maybe be the weirdest\" Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least your clothes grew with you\" Jake said trying to make the giant girl smile. After an awkward silence Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe give me the other cookie. It might rever....... Oh no another ones coming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it did as Kim grew more and more, she had to sit down just to fit inside of the Room as she quickly grew back up to the ceiling.

He might have been under her but he wasn't squished. However there was another problem. Because the Giant Possible was crying up a storm. In fact an obscene amount. In fact an amount that was actual flooding the room. Within a minute it was up to Jakes neck. He's got to stop this before he ends up drowning. He swims over towards Kim's dress and start pulling himself up. It wasn't long until he arrived on top of her knee. It was close to the ceiling so he didn't have much room up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim! Kim! Why are you crying!\" Jake said up to her.

But other then the amazing speed she was swimming, there was nothing else to really focus on. It was just a big and empty ocean. The fish and sharks down below Probably afraid to even be near the gigantic girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a boring swim for Kim until she saw something that perplexed her to no end. It was a dodo moving through the water on a little plank of wood. Not only is seeing a dodo odd for her but that fact that the dodo was dressed in a sailors suit and was singing a sailor shanty made it even more confusing. Kim stopped swimming for a second and came to the dodo. However when he saw the giant sea monster that was Kim, he made the appropriate decision to freak out and paddle away, moving at a speed even Kim wouldn't be able to catch up to. Kim figured she was close to land considering that the Dodo had to come from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swimming some more Kim finally reached land, she saw it so far away as she saw a populated island, she couldn't make out the figures but she could see them running around. Kim started to swim closer but noticed something. She was shrinking! Jake noticed it as well as he quickly jumped off of her head and into the water. Kim watches as she shrinks down to her normal height. Which is good considering shes no longer a freak but bad because that means the sharks aren't scared anymore. At least the dress shrunk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and jake started swimming closer and closer to the shore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The side effect took place. She felt her body go through a weird change. It felt like it was expanding, and truthfully it was. Her height was now doubled as she looked at the already small house and noticed that it looked half the size. And even worse for Daria, she was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln realized this too when he turned around and was greeted by the giant leg of Daria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria, what's going on?!\" Lincoln asked both concerned and confused as he looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria reached the top of the ceiling and sat down just to avoid growing even more.

However it wasn't long until she couldn't see him anymore, because her head broke the ceiling and she came out on the other side. She saw the forest that was surrounding the house as her head saw above all the trees. She felt her arms and legs break through the walls too as she was at this point wearing the house like a dress. Finally after a while the growing seemed to stop as Daria was relieved. She didn't know much about what happened but she did know one thing. The Rabbit will not be happy.

It was very easy to do thanks to the dress. He climbed up her leg and started to climb her sleeve and eventually her arm.

He shivered as he crawled upward, his clothes still wet and foul from the salt water. Rik sniffled again, his thoughts speaking to him. <i>Maybe you'll get found. Don't give up yet. There's probably people looking for you.</i> The thought made Rik feel only a bit better, as all his life, he felt as though he hadn't a friend in the world.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica awoke with a sleepy yawn that shook the foundations of the castle. It was built especially large for her by Lionel, king of these lands...and one of her few friends. She had helped him oust the previous, corrupt king, and his loyal followers. Though she wore little clothing, for she had been 150 feet tall at the time just 2 years ago, their weapons proved incapable of drawing blood from her. Most of said followers either ran away with their proverbial tails between their legs, or...reluctantly permanently neutralized. After the remainder of them had surrendered unconditionally, she had personally gathered the dead and gave them a proper funeral by burning their corpses in a fire. It had been a terrible day filled with bloodshed, and she had nearly lost her hope in humanity that day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Lionel did his best to maintain her positive attitude towards humanity in general, reminding her that this terrible day was a necessary one for a better tomorrow to occur. And indeed, though the local villages still feared and shunned her for being a giantess that could wipe them out in a heartbeat if she so desired...they at least started to treat her with a little more kindness much to her joy. She hadn't asked to be born big and grow ever bigger as the years passed, but she would try to show humanity that it had a friend in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat up near the keep, which would only come up to her proportionately large breasts should she stand up. Sometimes the garrison would have to help her adjust her top, which she's grateful for whatever help they provide considering the danger. Those who live in the castle are much more open to Jessica, at first on King Lionel's orders, but eventually on their own terms. A wizard even helped cast an incantation on her clothing so that it would grow with her should she grow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth is a matter which Jessica is most uncertain of about herself. As of now, on her 22nd year, she's roughly 200 feet tall. But as she has known no family, she has no clue if there are others of her kind or if she was once a human baby that had been gifted to grow to incredible size as she grew older. Furthermore, she has no idea if she's stopped growing yet, and if not, how much bigger does she have to look forward to...<i>if</i> she is ever to stop, that is. Ideally, she was done, but she can't say for sure and no one else she knows can either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such thoughts are put aside as Jessica greets her friend, saying, \"Good morning, Sire.\" softly so as to not make him go deaf. One benefit to being who she is is that her eyesight is incredible, able to pick out the tiny humans that scurry about the castle with ease, including King Lionel himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lionel, please, Jessica. We've been over this before, you needn't address me in any special way...\" Lionel responds in a friendly manner. Jessica has proven to be a most valuable ally to him, and a close and trusted friend since saving his life a few years ago. Thus, he has dedicated much of his power as king to trying to make her feel comfortable and welcome. She's beautiful, and her green eyes reveal a woman who only desires to see the good in people, even when they fear and shun her for being larger than even this castle's keep. And though he has forced his people living in the castle to be open to the giantess, it warms his heart to find that they gradually come to know her like any other person, and not as a humanoid monster. He then informs Jessica...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most days, Jessica sat content in the seclusion of her mountain fortress. The citadel was nestled between three mountain peaks overlooking the lush lands below. The three mountains were the highest point of land for miles in any direction, although to call them mountains was stretching the trust a great deal. The huge lumps in the ground were barely worth of the title, but when everything else was flat the word mountain sufficed. Jessica's seat of power used to belong to some lord or another, whose family's exalted rear had sat in their fancy chair for many generations. Then Jessica decided it would make an excellent 18th birthday present to herself and took it. Now her rather larger butt sat on the keep, long ago crumbled from the giantess's tremendous weight. Taking the jumble of stones had been a very simple business. At eighteen she had already been nearly 150 feet, so she stepped over the 50 foot tall walls and into the courtyard. Crush the garrison that hadn't fled, walk past following strongpoints on the way to the top of the mountains, and step daintily into the inner keep. Once there, sit down on the fancy rectangle housing the lord and his family, and the castle was hers. All the survivors had fled into the towns dispersed along the valley floor, although that didn't guarantee them safety from Jessica's adventuring. Over her three years' occupation, Jessica and the tinies she had come to rule had struck a form of understanding. She was an all-powerful giantess, and took what she wanted. It wasn't too excessive, and never left too many starving. In return the inhabitants wouldn't rise up against her and die, and wouldn't deny her any of her wants. A few villages had tried at first. Those villages had simply ceased to exist, and no survivors lived to tell tales of what had happened. But occasionally some workers would also journey up to her castle to keep it well in order, even if its only inhabitant was much too large to live in it. These laborers were generally treated well, and almost always returned. Only when Jessica was feeling especially playful, hungry, or lonely did problems arise.<br>\r\nJessica tried to keep rampaging to a minimum, and understood that it tended to tick people off. That's not to say it didn't happen, although villages with lots of food to give up as offering were often spared the worst. Any towns beyond her domain were at constant risk of instant annhiliation at any point in time. She had also learned that other lords considered themselves as good as herself, and felt hurt when she killed their villagers. When several got angered, things got serious. Her most recent swaths of destruction had covered all lands and people, for the most part excluding her own. And as a result, a massive army marched itself across her lands. At night she could see thousands of fires burning as the horde inched closer day by day. Jessica had decided to let it come to her fortress unmolested. Her greeting would be so earnest, it would knock them dead.</span></div></div>",

She especially hated having to hunt down groups of three or four men scattered throughout her territory after the main horde had been dispersed. As they moved up the mountainside they would pass numerous walls and gates, and their descent would be that much slower. To pass the time she went through the plans for defense in her head, picking the most amusing way to slaughter the assembled army.<br>\r\n     When the army finally reached the gates of her castle, Jessica realized the size of the host waiting to confront her. It obscured the pass leading up to her gates, as well as many miles beyond that. The other rulers seriously wanted her dead this time then. Jessica grinned a predatory grin. She liked challenges. Her keen eyes picked out numerous siege weapons scattered in the army. When the siege towers rattled forward, she knew the time had come to begin the defense of her castle. The giantess rose from the crumbling keep, falling bricks tracing lines of dust through the air. She lifted her arms and yelled out several words in an ancient tongue. The ground shook as she spoke the words, only partially because of her volume. Along the walls of the castle, and down on the ground as well, a bloodline substance seeped up into terrifying mounds of dripping red ichor. Slowly, they solidified into more definite shapes. They were men slain by Jessica in earlier battles. At first they were as they had been as they died. Some were flat as pieces of paper, some had armor crinkled like tinfoil, others had missing limbs or heads, and others unfortunate enough to die in her mouth were little better than the red goo that had formed them. For a moment the troops storming the walls recoiled in horror. But as purplish light swirled around the corpses, the men were restored to the shapes of normal people. And the began to fight back against the invaders.<br>\r\n     But the dead made for poor fighters. The first three of five walls had fallen by the end of the day. Jessica didn't mind, she had played this game before. She could rise up late at night and push the entire force from her lands by daybreak if she wanted. But she enjoyed the rush killing gave her, and seeing her slaves fight had warmed her up. On the second day, the going was slower as the living fought the most skilled dead, the ones who had penetrated deepest into her fortress. But once again the dead were outmatched and outclassed. The evening found the attackers encamped outside the high walls of the main keep. Jessica herself was still unseen, she could lie down on the ruins of the keep or crawl back into the mountain abode the nearby towns had made at her request. While the armies below slept, the giantess prepared herself for war. She carried no weapons, she had yet to find any as deadly as herself. Clothing herself was difficult due to her size, but she still had some outfits. Jessica chose to wear a tight leather bra, made only a few months ago. This was before she stopped growing, so it was barely up to the task it was presented. It left little to the imagination, allowing the soldiers to gave upon her well-toned belly and beautiful snow-white color. To cover her sensitive regions she had a cloth covering. Due to shortages of cloth that year, (mostly her doing), this outfit was also as small as possible while still fulfilling its role. Jessica didn't mind, she had a gorgeous body and enjoyed showing it off. Her stunning legs were the last thing many men saw, and Jessica kept them beautiful enough for the task. She decided on no foot ware, she did enjoy the feeling of stepping on armored soldiers. Her preparations thus completed, Jessica emerged from her cave just as the dawn shined down over the mountains. She stepped into the hordes below the keep walls with a wonderful squishy feeling and paused for a moment to let the armies drink her in. She was an angel of death, painted gold and red by the rising sun behind her. When the first waves overcame their shock they rushed forward and the battle began.</span></div></div>",

He wore a wrinkled white shirt, stained with coffee and sweat, and from the looks of things he hadn't slept in a while. In his right hand he carried a thick brown folder with a faded photographed clipped to its front. As he made his way towards the center of the room another man, seated behind a broad wooden table, lit up another cigarette. This second man was in a similar disheveled state, though he had a few more years on him. He ran his wizened fingers through the grayed mess of his receding hairline before taking a long drag of his cigarette. The round man tossed the folder onto the table in front of his partner and took a seat across from him. Shortly after another man entered. He had a strong, square figure, and dark green officer's uniform with his silver star proudly pinned to his lapel.<br>\r\n        \"Gentlemen,\" the officer began, \"I'm glad we could find the time to meet\" The two men nodded and pushed the folder towards him as he approached the table. \"I've heard quite a bit about this project of yours.\" As he neared he saw the folder before him, the words 'Classified' written in bold black letters across it. Beneath that it read \"Project Talos\". <br>\r\n        \"We can assure you, Colonel Ashton, this will work...she's the perfect subject\" The round man said. Ashton exchanged a few wary glances with the two before picking up the photo on the file. He nodded approvingly. <br>\r\n        \"When can I meet her?\" Ashton asked. The older gentlemen smiled. <br>\r\n        \"Right this way...\" The older man said. He rose and opened a nearby door...</span></div></div>",

You said a test subject to undergo this particular mission and all I see is a teenaged girl!\" The older man carefully explained \"Er yes this is Susan Shepard she was a popular cheerleader and straight A student in her school you see we searched endlessly for a proper test subject for no one else would dare volunteer not even the toughest men not fighting overseas so we had little choice but to choose a female in the end.\" The Colonel was still unsure about this \"But..but she's just a...\" Then the girl spoke up with a strong air but sweet tone \"I'm capable sir to perform the tests and I'm quite aware of the risks after all I do want to serve my country it's unfair that women don't get to fight in this war.\" The other man nodded eagerly \"Quite right Susan you see Colonel she is very courageous and willing to do what it takes to aid the Allies..\" But Ashton now asked the jackpot question \"Hold on just what is she doing to be doing to aid them? What is this top secret experiment?\" Sighing the first man handed him the files he had earlier the Colonel took one look and gasped aloud \"Are you serious? You're turning her into a..a..monster!\" \"No monsters only exist in fairy tales and folklore Susan will be transformed into a giant nearly hundred feet tall according to our measurements or our mathematics this way she will prove to be the ideal weapon against the Axis why should we waste more men when she will be literally a one man Er I mean one woman army?\" Ashton looking over the reports frowned \"So she will be a giantess fighting against the Axis fair enough but how long will she remain this way? I mean will she automatically be restored to normal once the war is over?\" The first man shook his head \"That much we are still working on we pored over the results of the experiments and concluded that it's highly possible she may be stuck like this forever but don't worry it's just a theory hopefully we'll be able to reverse the effects once Susan's done her part.\" Ashton turned to the girl once more \"And you're okay with all this young lady?\" She nodded \"As I said I'm willing to do whatever it takes to aid in this war.\" She stated truthfully finally Ashton shaking his head walked out of the room thinking this was pure craziness did the President know about this hidden operation but he turned back to ask one more question floating in his mind \"Alright I don't like it but we got little choice and the girl does seem very brave to undergo this dangerous task so when do you start Project Talos?\" The other man replied </span></div></div>",

In a week Susan would be titanic giantess, standing at least 200 feet tall. After a few days she was taken to a large hangar and placed in a tank to which dozens of cables and hoses were attached. The process was begun, sending Susan into a trance-like state. The scientists monitored her vitals around the clock, ensuring that everything was going according to plan. On the final day Colonel Ashton returned to see the great unveiling. As the clock counted down the last of the hoses hissed and wheezed as the machine powered down. A moment later there was rumbling, almost like an earthquake. Suddenly the tank burst open, a colossal arm arching out toward the ceiling. The assembled crowd fell silent as the giant woman slowly pulled herself from the crumbled metal container. She was dripping wet, her long dark hair clinging to her skin as she stepped out onto the the cold linoleum floor. She wore only a black skin-tight nylon suit stretching down  from her chest to her hips. \"uhhh, so what now?\" she boomed. The assembled crowd began to cheer. The round man from before sprinted forward and addressed Susan. \"It worked, you're ready!\" Colonel Ashton nodded approvingly. \"So...it begins.\"</span></div></div>",

So you guys just dump me off in the middle of nowhere and tell me I have to stay put? So unfair I thought I was supposed to be helping!\" The cadet in charge sighed heavily nobody informed him just how incredibly whiny this giant girl was but he spoke in the calmest tone he could muster \"Listen Ms. Shepard..\" \"Call me Susan.\" She replied huffily \"Right Susan we got orders or you got specific orders to stay here for the time being we don't want you wandering off and scaring the locals now do we? Or destroying livestock like a...\" Susan raised her eyebrows \"A monster? Humph you guys still don't fully trust me do you? You all think I'm going to rampage across the globe and destroy the planet's life forms. Men how typical no wonder you needed a woman to do this...\" \"Sheesh you are one crazy broad even such a stunning beauty we know you're not a rampaging monster Susan and believe me we have no intent of leaving you like this just please stay here the Allies will be here in a matter of days or weeks and if you ever hungry there's plenty of food in those crates over there(gesturing to the large stacks of crates labeled 'Food for the Giantess') plus we got you a radio transmitter of sorts so you can listen in on any conversation between us and back in the USA in case you're needed well that's it Susie.\" \"SUSAN!\" The girl screamed causing a slight tremor many of the soldiers let out frightened yelps as the earth shook violently Susan blushed \"Sorry I don't like it when people call me Susie it sounds so ordinary and currently I'm far from normal as possible.\" A soldier getting over the shock of the quake curiously stated \"Wow you really must be pretty excited by this being larger than life thing huh?\" She beamed \"You bet! It's something I always dreamt of being taller compared to my usual short height this is a dream come true for me!\" The men could tell she was enjoying every moment of being bigger than any living thing they could only hope this oversized teenager didn't let the power and influence go to her head once more the first man spoke up \"Yeah please just stay here for now help will be here in a few days hopefully okay Susan?\" Finally she understood completely despite the expertiment on her they clearly didn't trust her one bit or thought she was capable of carrying out this dangerous task smiling inside Susan thought she would show them all that a female could be just as useful in a war as a man \"Yes I will stay put sir until help arrives.\" Taking their leave the young giantess was left alone for the next few days nothing happened nor did any troops arrive as she had very little to do except listen to the distant sounds of jungle animals though none would dare approach a creature hundreds of times their size and listen to snippets of discussion between various countries until she stood up \"I can't just stand around doing nothing I don't care what they said I took this mission for a reason to help stop this war and darn it I'm going to do it!\" As she took her first earth shaking steps towards civilization where she found </span></div></div>",

You wanted to move; step beyond the purplish mist but found you could not...it was like you were floating...wait, you WERE floating. You began to rock back and forth but found yourself restrained by someone invisible chains. You had no memory of where you were, nor how you got there. Then suddenly the whir of drill broke the silence and you lapsed back into consciousness. You open your eyes, realizing it was only a sordid dream. However when you try and lift yourself you find that you are in fact being held down by iron restraints, a bright light shining down above you, almost like you were in some demented dentist chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's awake...we can't have her awake...\" you hear a voice drone in the darkness. Soon another answered this one more high pitched and shaky...\"We'll increase the sedative...but there's no guarantee it'll work after the process it complete.\" You try to speak but find yourself too dazed to form words, only allowing a clumsy mumble to emanate from your mouth. You looked down at the rest of your body which lay prostrate on the chair or table or whatever it was you were confined too. It was completely covered by a black latex looking material like some kind of skin tight suit made of rubber or some other material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whirring began again and you felt your entire body go numb once again. The suit became illuminated by pale wiring like seams of blue light twisted and turning about the contours of your body like veins. You began to lapse back into unconsciousness, but as you did  a mask-like breathing apparatus descended from the darkness above and clamped down on your face. Your claustrophobia kicked in and you started to writhe, convulsing desperately to escape whatever it was you trapped in. You let out a weak muffled scream, but it was no use...you were too weak to fight back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin now, bring the DBME up to functioning capacity...\" you heard the voice in the distance trail off, you could hear further words but a mixture of dulled pain and drowsiness clouded your mind until once again you fell into the purple mist of your dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like only a second later your eyes shot open with intensity. They darted about the dimly lit warehouse that you know found yourself in. The chains from before had been replaced by bundles of thin metal chord, and you no longer sat on the metal table, instead finding yourself on the cold concrete floor. However everything seemed...distant, different somehow. Small figures milled about, as if unaware of you. Suddenly you became filled with some instinctual rage; some force seized hold of your mind and body ignoring the continued numbness and attempts at reasoning. Every muscle of your body flexed at the same time and the constraints which bound you suddenly creaked. You did it again and again, this time rocking your body back and forth. The small dark figures became panicked and began running about, but you paid them no heed you just kept going and going. More numbness returned in a wave in your bloodstream but you ignored it. Suddenly your twisting and convulsing allowed you to free your legs, then your torso, then your arms, till all that was left was that which bound your head. You effortlessly pull it off, freeing your long brown hair and allowing you to sit up. Something was definitely wrong</span></div></div>",

The room only seem liked it was 3 ft tall but as you looked down to see the minuscule people and equipment below you, swiftly realized that was not the case. For reasons unknown to you, you felt angry...angry at yourself, angry at the little people but oddly enough mostly angry at the ceiling. You pushed up against it, expecting it to resist, but with a little force it gave away. You through the rafter and tiling upward, allowing a hole just large enough for you to stand through to form. Carefully standing to your full height you were suddenly met by a faded sunlight. The sky was gray, as though rain was coming. You couldn't tell the time of day but it was temperate and pleasant. Calm suddenly filled the place of the anger you had just felt, but it was swiftly interrupted by tiny pricks on your legs. You looked down and saw that you were being shocked with tiny wires, but they did nothing to you. You lifted your right foot and brought it down. You felt something crunch underneath your foot but did not know what you had just stepped on. Tiny screams eminated from below. Annoyed you ripped apart the remaining roof and with your foot, knocked over one of the walls. You stepped out onto a large concrete clearing filled with tiny box-like buildings and swarming with tiny people. You took a few steps forward but were suddenly struck in the stomach by some small projectile. You look down and find yourself surrounded by tiny vehicles and people all shouting at you, brandishing guns and other assortments of weapons. They looked pitiful and for whatever reason you were intensely annoyed by them...you wanted them to go away....you wanted to hurt them. So, without warning you lifted your foot up and brought it down on top of the crowd. They screamed and ran, and you loved it. However you were assailed by a barrage of bullets and missile fire. But aside from a few bruises you were relatively unscathed. You decided to get out of there as quickly as possible and decide what your next plan of action would be. You ran forward, paying no attention to the vehicles, buildings, and people you trampled as you went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were clear of the complex you sat down in a clearing. You could see tiny helicopters circling in to follow you, but you didn't care. You began to think back in order to divulge how you came to be here. You remembered who you were but not much else about your personal history, nor how you came to be where you were. You simply felt confused, and annoyed. You looked down and inspected your body to see if you had been injured. The black suit which had once completely covered you now hung in tight scraps about your waste and upper legs, as well as most of your upper torso. You wore nothing on your feet and your arms were compoletely bare. You were tired...what's more you were hungry and for whatever reason wanted revenge....</span></div></div>",

You turned in a random direction as began to jog at a brisk pace. You mostly saw trees and small mountains but then in the distance little blocks appeared. A mixture of grey, blue, and reddish brown permeated a plane that stretched across the valley. You could tell it was developed land filled with buildings. You don't know why, but you decided to go there, thinking you'll find something there to help you. As you walk their you feel the numerous trees crunching under your feet until you see a line cleared through the brush. An interstate, packed with two lanes of traffic is leading towards the town ahead. Curious you step towards it and as you do you notice the cars become erratic, trying desperately to get away from you. You step over the road so that you have a foot placed on either side. You lean down to inspect the tiny cars, packed together tightly with horns blaring trying their best to escape. You notice some people have abandoned their vehicles all together and have fled on foot. You pick up a small white van just as a portly middle aged man opens the door and runs away. You turn it over in your hand thinking to yourself 'funny how tiny these things are now...at one point one of these could have easily killed me...now' as you give a slight squeeze crumpling the metal frame like cardboard, twisting the tiny vehicle into a flattened mass of metal and rubber. You drop it carelessly and pick up another, again crushing it with your bare hands. Feeling somehow invigorated you lift up your foot and bring it down onto the mass of traffic, flattening multiple cars and creating a shockwave that rattles the entire street. When you remove your foot the resulting crayter begins to fill with the bodies of fleeing citizens. You smile with a devilish satisfaction and continue towards the town. The noise of terror behind you somehow feels...good...you're not sure why but it just does. As you approach the city that lay before you notice it isn't very large, the tallest skyscraper probably not more than a couple hundred feet tall. You stroll over to an intersection where you see waves of tiny people scrambling about, screaming in terror as they try to escape. You kneel down once more and lower your hand; blocking the path of one the little people, they smack into with great force before tumbling to the ground. They look up in terror as your fingers wrap around their frail little body. You bring them back up to your face and narrow your eyes, inspecting their trembling form. </span></div></div>",

Around this time, Giants were emigrating from Europe due to European society becoming just too crowded. However, Cathleen and her mother, Fiona, had been forced to move from Ireland to the Americas due to the fact that Ireland was becoming just too brutal a country to live in for Hill Giants. Despite this, Cathleen had faced just as bad treatment, for she moved into a neighborhood of Spanish Mountain Giants. However, one of the Spanish Giants, Barbara, had sympathized with Cathleen and became fast friends with the Irish Giantess. Though Barbara was a good 30 feet tall, she didn't give a care in the world who did what to her, just so long as they didn't do anything rough... However, the story mainly focuses on Cathleen's journey.</span></div></div>",

I remember how I used to chase sheep down the creek beds and how they would speak to me in funny accents when I caught them. Or how I once found a tiny granite statue half buried in the sand by the sea and when I broke it in two out poured liquid gold. To me those memories are as real as any, but I know now that none of that could have been true. Sheep don't speak, statues don't contain liquid gold, and I...well I wouldn't even really been allowed that close to the sea anyway. Youth gives us so many fond things to reminisce about but I often wonder if it'd have been better to have forgotten it all. All the little adventures I made in my head. I never thought anything even remotely magical could ever happen to me, and in a way I was right for the longest time. It wasn't until a few days after my 23rd birthday that the first real adventure of my life ever began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking down the grassy causeway between the basalt mountains to the west and the forested cliffs to the east of what was once my homeland. It was late November, yet the air was barely chilled by the breath of winter. My long skirt was fastened by a neatly woven leather chord from which small golden trinkets swung. I kept my head tilted to the ground as I stepped over the tiny crags and pebbles beneath me. My eyes jumped back and forth from the path that lay ahead and the jostling golden emblems that hung from my waste. I was so caught up in my own thoughts that I almost didn't hear the tiny voice call out to me. At first I stopped and said nothing, twisting my head around to investigate the peculiar noise. Nothing. I continued on my way when I heard it again. This time I stopped and turned about. It sounded like someone very far away trying to get my attention. I was just about to turn back and continue on my way when I heard the distant cry once more. I bent down slightly when I suddenly caught a glimpse of a minuscule figure moving in the corner of my eye. My attention shot to my right where on a nearby hilltop a human stood upon a mossy boulder waving his arms frantically. This was odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see humans rarely strayed into our territory and I'd only ever seen a few from a distance. Now, here one stood in arm's reach alongside a path I walked nearly every day. What could he be doing here? Why was he trying to get my attention? Humans typically feared us, and took particular care to avoid our gaze. I leaned in closer to the tiny figure to get a better look at him, but he reeled back ever so slightly out of fear. I thought for a moment he was going to turn and run but he stood firm, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot. I opened my mouth to speak but he quickly seized to moment and cried out instead. </span></div></div>",

I could feel my mouth slightly parted and my eyes fixed on his form. I didn't know what to say, what to do...nothing like this had ever happened before. I lifted my hand and reached slowly toward him for a moment. He quickly jumped back and made as if to run off. As he turned about I finally croaked out a response. \"Wait...\" He stopped and cautiously turned back to face me. \"What's wrong?\" I asked in a stiff tone. For a second he stared back up as if entranced. I could feel his tiny eyes peering back into mine and I was suddenly seized with an urge to reach out and seize him. My hand drew up at a snail's pace and as soon as he caught sight of it inching closer he snapped out of his fugue state. \"We, uhh, we are being attacked, held hostage, drifters from the east...we need...help\" his words began to drift off as I leaned in a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on that moment I honestly can't say what came over me in that moment. I wasn't a cruel person, he seemed desperate, but...I should have walked away. I wanted to, this wasn't my concern; our people don't usually mix. Yet, he approached me, in spite of the fear that i could clearly see in his shaking limbs. Without reply, without even really thinking about what was happening I shot my hand out and wrapped my fingers around him. He was only half as tall as my index finger, and his shaking body felt frail, almost malnourished. I brought him a little closer to my face and sighed. \"Where?\" His anxious face melted to a strained content as I spoke. He lifted his head as if to speak but couldn't seem to croak out any words. Instead he simply pointed. I rose and looked on in the direction he indicated and with a steady step began walking. </span></div></div>",

As I peered down at him I could tell he felt my eyes on him, as he would shy away with each passing glance. I wanted to speak to him, but he didn't seem interested...no he was far too frightened. That was something else that bothered me. Humans have always been afraid of my kind. The size difference tends to put them on edge, and who can blame them, compared to me this little thing was so fragile and helpless. Yet, he still approached me, asked for my help. Given our peoples' history I'm surprised he didn't run for his life. My kind had made habit of tormenting these little buggers in the past. In fact there were still some communities where humans were still considered a delicacy. I myself never had eaten one, and I don't think I ever could. Anyway it wasn't long before we came to the edge of a forest, whose tallest trees reached only up to my knees. I looked down once more and pointed to the forest, to which my minuscule friend nodded warily. I began to wade through the trees, occasionally stepping on smaller ones in the underbrush. In my wake a left a trampled path of shattered trunks which the little human looked back on in awe. Suddenly I could little wisps of smoke rising through the tree tops. The human began to grow anxious as we neared what appeared to be a broad clearing in the thicket. Suddenly he began to squirm furiously, pounding his tiny hand down on my fingers which still wrapped around him in a secure embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and raised my eyebrows, \"what is it?\" I finally asked. Then I lifted by head and saw a small village, built in a circular pattern around what appeared to be a makeshift fountain. The town was filled with with little crowds of people, who all turned their attention to me as I approached. As they peered up in sheer horror I finally saw....</span></div></div>",

I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, but I could tell it wasn't good. Whatever violent acts they were committing they stopped dead in their tracks as soon as I came onto the scene. Everyone in the village looked up at me and I could feel the tension in the air. No one made a sound, the only noise that drifted in came from the wind in the trees. The little human in my hand began to thrash about frantically, drawing my attention away from the silent mass of people below. He pointed wildly at the brigands below looking on with both fear and anger. I wasn't sure what he expected me to do, but I suppose I had agreed to do something as soon as I started playing along. <br>\r\nI took a step into the village, and the silence that had once hung over the tired little town suddenly broke. Screams of terror flowed from the crowds of people as they began to scatter in my shadow. The ruffians turned their tails and ran back into the forest, without so much as a glance back. The remaining humans tried to flee into the woods as well, some hid in their homes, while others simply ran in circles. \"Well, that was....easy\" I said quietly to myself. The whole village was in disarray, and, uncertain of my next course of action, I looked down at my tiny companion for some sort of guidance. At first we was preoccupied by the chaos several hundred feet below, but with a gentle shake I got his attention once more. He wriggled around for a moment before turning to face me. He no longer looked fearful, instead somewhat relieved, even thankful as I began to speak to him. \"Was that all?\" I asked. He looked up and nodded, \"yeah\" he squeaked out. I turned my eyes back down to inspect the village and it appeared as though it had been completely abandoned. The humans that remained likely were stowed away in he various buildings that dotted the hidden hamlet. I turned and started walking away, still clutching the little human. \"Come on\" I said, \"I need to talk to you about a few things\" </span></div></div>",

I mean, sure i'm a few hundred feet taller than the little human I was carrying, and yes he was sort of helplessly trapped in my grip but I hadn't done anything to harm him! Yet, as I walked away from his village he could not have been more upset. He began to thrash about violently, screaming incoherently with a voice that sounded somewhere between a sob and a angry scream. I wasn't but twenty steps away from the tiny town that I grew visibly concerned about his mental state. I stopped dead in my tracks and knelt down in a small forest clearing. I loosened by fingers and opened my hand so that he sat on my palm rather than trapped in my grip. He immediately began to calm down. As I took a seat on the soft mossy earth I brought my new companion a little closer to my face. \"Feeling a bit better?\" I asked him. He made no response, instead he stared back up at me nervously. He wasn't quite terrified but he was still clearly uncomfortable. \"Was that it? Some bandits attacking your village?\" I asked him. He nodded and motioned as if to speak, but then quickly recoiled back into his silent state. \"Are you okay?\" Again no response. \"Come on now, I'm not gonna hurt ya, I'm just...big is all\" He began to stand up. After a moment establishing his footing he finally addressed me. \"Thank you...\" he said sheepishly. I cracked a weak smile and brushed some hair from my face. \"My name is Lera, what's yours?\" I asked him. He averted his eyes for a moment but then looked back up, \"I'm Darian\" he said. I continued to look at him intently. \"I'm sorry to ask you this, but I'm just...well curious I guess.\" I began once again. \"What made you try and seek my help, I mean, especially considering most of the other humans fled at the very sight of me?\" He shrugged and returned to a sitting position. \"I don't know, I was...desperate I guess, I thought you definitely could get the job done, and...well you didn't seem malicious.\" I smirked and began to lower him towards the ground. \"Well, I don't deal with humans very often and I must say you certainly made my day more interesting, which is why...\"</span></div></div>",

I should've expected as much of a response. His breathing quickened, and for moment I was afraid his heart was going to give out. \"Wh-why?\" he finally stammered. Truth is I was terribly lonely, and he was the first person to approach me that wasn't a member of my own household. You see, my kind doesn't place a great deal of importance in...well having friends, and things were especially bad since I moved out of my parent's house. So, having someone I could talk to, someone  I could control, well it made me feel good. \"Its just that, I...wanted to get to know you better, I'll show you around my hometown, then maybe you won't be so afraid of me or the rest of my kind.\" I said weakly. He clearly didn't buy it. \"I'll bring you back, just come...for a little while, I promise I won't hurt you.\" He continued to cringe. I began to stand, dusting the grime off of my leggings as i got to my feet. He threw himself forward with his hands clasped together. \"Please, no, let me go I...I just want to go home!\" he begged.

As he ran away I spoke out to him, \"Remember, here...tomorrow at noon, ok?\" He stopped and turned around, looking back up at me with a mixture of emotions. \"Be here...or I'll come find you\" I said, right before giving him a mischievous wink. He looked a little panic stricken but nodded and continued on his way. I chuckled softly to myself before turning and making my way back home. On my walk back my head was filled with the events of the day. It was a welcome change of pace from usual routine. I must say I liked the idea of being...approachable, even if its out of desperation. Though it felt a little weird making an entire town flee for theirs lives just by showing up but still...it was interesting to interact with humans so closely. As I made my way over the hills and long pastures that separated the the border of the human realm from that of my people I felt the sting of loneliness hit me again. I sighed when my own home town came into a view. The cottages were relatively conservative in relation to some of the human dwellings, albeit hundreds of times larger. I walked up to my own door and pushed it open with little effort. I passively wandered inside and plopped down onto a cushioned chair immediately opposite of the hearth. It was a pain living alone sometimes, but then again my neighbors did tend to find their ways inside every once in a while. Still, I'd grown quite sick of them, I simply wanted some kind of escape. Before long I drifted off to sleep where I dreamed of a fire consuming my house, trapping me inside. I awoke suddenly to a knocking at my door....</span></div></div>",

She was built with a tight armor that makes it immune to many attacks, plus it's loaded and armed to the absolute teeth. It's powerful attack is the Breast Rocks, where her breast compartments opens and fires 2 massive rockets straight at the enemy, knocking them out. She is a skinny clad woman that's for sure. With yellow eyes, dark greenish blue hair, massive breast, etc sizes.... she is one hot chick for a mecha-girl. How is she controlled, actually... Saika is a person who joined the U.S. military a year ago, and she was killed in battle, but she had a bad-attitude and a thirst for killing. She was accepted into Project-Saika, were she was rebuilt as a skinny clad mech-girl armed with weapons with (unlimited ammo surprisingly) and she enjoys her look, size and powers, but hates the U.S. for controlling her. Eventually, she left the military, and while she still protect the U.S. of A from monsters, aliens, terrorists, etc... the people she rather get praises and worked with, was the civilians, and especially.... the children that look up to her. She likes her sex appeal, but she also has a great heart for the kids who look up to her, some say that she is \"Robo-Girl..., etc, or Mecha-Girl\" and she enjoys it. She is currently in New York City. (government doesn't control her, she does herself)</span></div></div>",
