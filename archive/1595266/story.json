            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was year 2085, a very important year because the operations to create a colony in Mars were about to begin. Even when technology has advanced and there haven't been any wars since Mid East conflict. Things have been quiet for a few decades. But population kept growing and this was the reason to work on such projects to colonize other planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to research, two things were discovered in Mars: A bacillus that might be deadly for people due to being unknown to Earth beings. The other, is a strange kind of nanomachines found near Mars' atmosphere, these nanomachines have just been retrieved by robots for its study in Earth. It might be a new extraterrestrial disease or something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists began to perform tests and experiments where several people died, and they began to think in a solution to it... unless they could infuse the machines in any human they wouldn't know its effects, as it didn't work in animals or plants either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Kyuketsuki's house in Tokyo, Japan...<br>\r\nA 17 years old boy woke up and dressed himself, then he went out of his room to see his father drinking coffee while reading the newspaper. The man has short black hair slightly spiked up and glasses, he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Morning, Samael. Did you sleep well?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Morning, dad...I guess I did...\"- The teenager answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Breakfast is served\"- Dr. Kyuketsuki said while reading the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And, where's Airisu?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She cooked your breakfast. She said she'd meet you at school, and she left about 15 minutes ago\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...\"- Samael said and then he began to eat his breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's new today\"- Samael asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm...\"- the doctor said -\"Those American scientist still want to send people to Mars\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Still?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's a story I'll tell you later, Sam...but the point is that...\"- And Dr. Kyuketsuki cut off himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't be...\"- Samael's father mumbled -\"They found...the nanomachines...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's with that nanomachines? Almost everything has nanomachines, even clothes\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's part of what I'm going to tell you later, you're not ready yet. But those scientist will get in trouble if they keep playing around with those machines, they aren't toys!!\"- Dr. Kyuketsuki seemed to be angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Come on dad, what can be weirder than to know my best friends are a vampire and a werewolf and that their families are so and that they live right next us??\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A lot of things\"- Dr said and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Myself?\"- Samael said, his father sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There are a lot of things you don't have to know right now. and would cause you trouble\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like the unknown origins of my weirdness?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what am I? I know for sure I'm not vampire nor werewolf, but... I'm not a human either\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When the moment comes you'll know everything you need to know about yourself and else\"- Dr. looked at the watch and said -\"Hey it's getting late, you better go to school\"- Samael said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can go later\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll get in class late, Samael, go now\"- Samael sighed, finished his breakfast and picked up his backpack, and when he was about to close the door, Dr. Kyuketsuki said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And NO super speed AND NO flying, ok?\"-<br>\r\nSamael sighed and bowed down his head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You ruin my fun\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And he left, walking normally, which he found very boring, not walking itself, but the fact to walk always the same place to sit in school and do same stuff everyday. He went to the bus stop and met with Ferdinand and Steven. He was aware since much earlier that they weren't humans, but taking on count he wasn't either, he never minded about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Sam, have you heard the news?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About people and Mars thing, yeah, now they're playing with the nanomachines they found in space\"- Samael answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It would be great to be able to go to Mars\"- Steven added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't raise your hopes, the first travels will be very strictly controlled and they probably will analyze your blood to find a disease, and they'll found out that you're a vampire and a werewolf\"- Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lycanthrope, please. I've always been told that werewolves are wild animals that can't even return back to normal\"- Steven said, sounding strangely smart, which made Vlad and Samael stare at him blankly until he said -\"What? I'm not that stupid\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeeah...Whatever\"- They answered at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But what if you go?\"- Ferdinand asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They'll find that I'm a Who-know-what-the-hell and they'll take me to a lab to make experiments with me, at least that's what my father has told me before, and it seems he doesn't like people to use the nanomachines\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- Steven asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, my father has a lot of mysterious stuff\"- Samael sighed and waited for the bus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She greeted them by their names and so did they, until Samael came behind them. He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi, Airisu\"- She blushed when she saw him and said shyly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...Hi Samael\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when thay had grown together, she somehow fell in love with Samael. She thought it was strange because they grew together since she could remember (she was adopted as a baby, then Dr Kyuketsuki found out that she was a vampire). But soon she learned they weren't blood related, and after being explained some things about Samael by his father (nobody has been told about Samael, excepting Samael who still doesn't know very much), she was aware of his main dilemma to know what is he exactly and became very affectionate to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough also, even when Samael showed to be tough boy, she knew he had noble feelings and could risk his own life to save who are important to him. But the reason she had never told him her feelings was that she wasn't sure how would he react. But she was sure that Samael wan't like most guys, even at his age he hadn't shown signs of being pervert, which his friends showed although not being humans. And most vampires were hostile to people. But the fact that Samael's calm could be by not being any of the species worried her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you feel?\"- Airisu asked shyly to Samael<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm fine, thank you\"- Samael answered, not knowing fully why she and his father worried about him that much.<br>\r\nThe bell rang and the four friends went to their busy school day. When it finished, they had homework to do in pairs and strangely, Airisu would work with Samael (Mostly he worked with Ferdinand, and regretted working with Steven) though he didn't complain at all. Steven and Ferdinand left, and while the lycanthrope was always behaving as a child, the nosferatu closed his face with his hand and said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"This is gonna be a looong homework...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirisu and Samael worked in a cyber cafe, and finished quickly due to Samael's talent at computers and great knowledge (he was the guy who didn't need to study for exams). Then he saved the work to an USB drive which was his key ring and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're done, and in less tme than expected\"- Airisu smiled cutely at him and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We've got all the evening free. Do you want to do something?\"-</span></div></div>",

At the movies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirisu brought Samael grabbing him by the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, what one will you watch?\"- Samael asked, sighing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You mean what one will WE see\"- Airisu replied and smiled in a cute way again. The employee (who was a girl in early twenties) smiled at them, she already knew that kind of look in a girl, though the boy seemed to be unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay...whatever...so, what one will it be?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirisu pointed at a movie poster and Samael took out his money to pay both tickets. They entered to the movie's auditorium and watched the movie. (I'm not gonna say what movie since I couldn't think of a film to display at 2085, use imagination :D). When it finished they walked together, Samael was intended to go home but he checked his watch and it was 10:32 pm, no buses at that hour. He looked at his wallet and shook it, just 2 dollars. He heard Airisu's voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I prefer to walk\"- He remembered, she was a vampire, and enjoys more night. Well, although not being one, Samael also liked the night more, he hated the sun's heat and he preferred night or cloudy days. They began to walk, it would be a 40 min. way to go<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Airisu gathered courage and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Samael?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it?\"- He said, being surprised because he was interrupted of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have something to tell you\"- Airisu said, her blushing wasn't visible just because of the night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...sure what is it?\"- Samael said, a bit puzzled because Airisu was acting strange<br>\r\nThere was a long silence while they walked until Airisu broke the ice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Samael...\"- She said, and he looked at her -\"I... I love you\"- Samael now rose an eyebrow and before he could say anything, Airisu spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not just the way you think... I love you... more than just as a brother\"- Samael gulped, he didn't know what to say, but somewhere inside him he knew what she was saying, and he wanted it to happen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...I... I don't know what to say, Airisu...\"- She looked sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No!! It's not what you think!! I mean...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael sratched behind his head while thinking something to say<br>\r\n'Okay... what have Steven and Ferdinand taught me about girls?' He remembered some flashbacks where Ferdinand and Steven were slapped, punched, kicked, and pepper sprayed...and then he thought 'Ookay, that is NOT the right example... So, I must think up something, and better quickly'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I mean... I feel like this would be right... but officially we're family... what would dad think?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm adopted, we aren't blood related...we aren't even the same kind\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't even know what kind am I\"- Samael said, then, he was about to say something but Airisu grabben him by behind his neck and kissed him passionately. It was their first kiss.</span></div></div>",

Human couples are always all the same\"- Said a mysterious man from the shadows, as he walked out from the darkness and also, suddenly, appeared another one at super speed. He sniffed the air and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're wrong... there's a vampire in here\"- He smiled and showed his vampire fangs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hah!! This is really gonna be good!!\"- The other one had white hair and yellowish green eyes.<br>\r\nAirisu got very angry and also her expression revealed her as a vampire, with sharp fangs usually hidden as normal sized human-like ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael stood, serious, and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Airisu, stay back, I'll take care of this\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But...but...\"- She hadn't a real excuse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is more dangerous for you, the other one is a lycanthrope\"- He said, still in the serious tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's right... but even a skilled human won't make it against a lycan and a vampire together\"- Said the mentioned guy, who had gray hair and blue eyes. Before he finished last word, the vampire dashed at hyper speed and tried to punch Samael, but, much to his surprise, Samael had stopped him with a punch in the stomach. The vampire recovered and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Just luck...\"- And suddenly Samael disappeared, then, a kick from behind hit him and sent him against a wall, denting it. Samael stood there and said defiantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that all what you got?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why you?!!\"- The vampire said and punched Samael several times at super speed and Samael blocked and dodged them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You!! You're not human!!\"- The vampire yelled angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what?\"- Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't know what the hell you are but I'll rip you apart\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd like to see you trying to\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high speed combat began, and though to normal people they weren't visible, Airisu and the Lycan could watch perfectly the fight, which was causing little tremors due to their strenght, after a harder clash, the two fighters dashed away from each other. The vampire wiped off a bit of blood that flowed from his lower lip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This will be fun, but now I'm serious...AAaaarghhh!!!\"- The ground shook slightly and the vampire turned into a more demonic form with bat-like wings. Samael smiled and they dashed toward each other, but before they made contact, the lycan, who transformed also, slashed Samael's left arm and threw him down to the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I was gonna have fun!!\"- The vampire protested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There's no time to waste, anyway, if this guy is strong enough to face you at such speed it means he's not human, and with the vampire girl's help they can match us easily\"- Said, now turned into a completely gray wolf with yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know he's as strong as me at full power?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thinnk it wouldn't be smart to find out\"- The lycan looked at Samael, and so did the vampire, he was holding his left arm and was bleeding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The boy's already hurt, he won't be a threat anymore, and the vampire girl can't overpower us at this level\"-<br>\r\nThe lycan jumped towards Samael in attack position and to his surprise, Samael smiled and kicked him right in the abdomen when he was above him, and caught him in air, punching him more and sending him against the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll get the blood, you can have his flesh\"- The vampire said, confident about their victory<br>\r\nThen, Samael stopped bleeding and absorbed back his blood, the wound also closed and healed fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, a regenerator? I was thinking you were a serious problem\"- He felt a sudden punch in his stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Think again...\"- Samael said, and as he kicked the lycan away, the vampire attacked him, and he blocked all of his attacks until he counter attacked with some kicks, then jumped behind him and ripped both vampire's wings apart, causing him inmense pain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn you!! I'll enjoy when I drink your blood\"- And regenerated two new wings<br>\r\nSamael was still holding the vampire's wings in his hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"See this?\"- And he clenched his fists until the wings exploded like tomatoes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That will happen to you, piece by piece\"- Samael added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire thought 'There's no way a human can be that strong, not even a regenerator' The vampire flew toward Samael but missed the hit and looked around disconcerted, then, a foot came from above and sent him down hard against the ground, he tried to grab Samael but he dodged it and stood at a safe distance, but something slashed Samael and his left arm fell off, then it hit him for a second time, slicing his right arm this time. It was the lycan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now you're done...\"- The lycan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope\"- Samael answered, and the two arms dissolved into blood, which he absorbed back and created two new arms, he opened and closed his fists repeteadly and muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like new\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two supernatural beings engaged Samael this time, resulting in more wounds to him and slight damage to them, but the lycan noticed Samael was causing internal damage to them, which wouldn't heal as easily, as he only fought with fists and kicks, while the vampire and lycan used claws and fangs to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael dodged both beings and received some hits, but he didn't lose any blood as he absorbed it all back and so his arms or legs which they sliced or ripped off. It seemed that he didn't care much about being hurt like that. The lycan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You have a limit, you won't be able to heal back forever\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know?\"- Samael asked rethorically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody can keep healing back unless they kept feeding to have energies left\"- The vampire said angrily and flew toward Samael, strangely vanishing before hitting him and then hit him from behind many times, sending him through an abandoned building's walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirisu screamed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Samael!!\"- she had no response, and she got very angry, showing her fangs again and said -\"You asked for this\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd air dashed toward them (she was in human-like form, nothing physically different from normal form than the fangs and increased strenght and speed) She succesfully hit the vampire several times and sent him crashing against some walls, but she was hit by a punch from the lycan, which hurled her against the ground and the lycan kept hitting her. He was stomping on her continuously and also slashed her, then he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you had a single brain cell you'd know that such young vampires can't mess with us lycans like that\"- And a sudden slash cut his right arm off, freeing Airisu, who hadn't even healed the damage, and saw Samael, who now had his hair rising up, fangs and his eyes were now dark red<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Vampire? You don't scare me\"- And the lycan transformed before them into his ultimate form, a bigger and even more muscled beast that stood in about 1.90 - 2.0 meters tall and way bulkier than before, looking more like a wolf while the previous one had just the fur and some more muscles, but still retaining most of the human figure. Now looked like a true wolf standing on two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the vampire flew surprisingly in an attempt to attack Samael, just to discover he flew up right before that, and was floating in the air with no wings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should have guessed... a rare species vampire, but not even one can defeat both me, a nosferatu, and a lycan\"- The vampire said [NOTE: There weren't still Methuselah, this happened a year before Nightroads were born]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael remained silent and vanished, appearing just to hit the lycan or the vampire repeteadly, until the lycan grabbed him by the arms, and kept hitting him with his knee before ripping his both arms apart, also cut him in the left side and punched him that strong that he broke some of his ribs, then he sent him away with a punch just to be caught by the vampire who also slashed him with his claws, but when he tried to bite him, Samael kicked him, which the vampire used to catch his leg and rip it off too, now, on the ground was a single-legged Samael. The vampire and the lycan looked at him from above and the lycan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think it's time to finish this\"- As his claw approached, he closed his eyes and expected the piercing feeling, but it didn't hit him, he opened his eyes and saw Airisu came between him and them, taking the claw hit herself, she spat out blod and the lycan threw her away. Samael now got furious, and he generated another pair of arms and a new leg. This time his expression was of anger, deep anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now...you'll regret having come here\"- Samael said and with that he disappeared and reappeared strangling the vampire, who couldn't free from his grip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You say you're above humans in food chain and power... Humans are above animals... so... shouldn't be there someone above you?\"- Samael asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"*cough* Wha-at?! *cough* What the hell are you...talking abouut?!! *cough,cough*\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll tell you this way: You're my dinner...and I'm hungry\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wha?\"- Samael tightened his grip, preventing him from talking and threw him away. The vampire had a blurred vision by the lack of air but he recovered quickly and when he looked at Samael, now there was a weird being that had two wings, but these had black feathers. It was Samael, who still had the hair rising up but his fangs had grown more, twice long as vampire's (and any vampire) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes had become bright red. Also, a scar he had in the right eyebrow, in each elbow and in the chest glowed in red also. They were visible because most of his clothes were destroyed, except by the remains of a T-shirt and his black jeans, though they were very damaged also. Suddenly, thunderbolts flashed around him as he stood, and when he spoke, his voice turned slightly deeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell are you?!\"- The vampire sensed the incredible power he was holding and began to reconsiderate attacking him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your worst nightmare\"- Samael answered, as he grabbed him, ripped one of his arms and strangled him again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"D-Da-damn it!!\"- The vampire said, and Samael, in anger, pierced through his chest with his right arm, the vampire screamed in pain and horror, because he couldn't heal back, and felt his life being sucked, and looked how his blood was being absorbed by Samael. He didn't even need to bite as vampires do. The vampire suddenly returned to normal form and went pale, completely, he only could mumble something before he fell and disintegrate in dust. Then he looked at the lycan, who was kind of shocked. The lycan stood on fours and howled, and growled, threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're next\"- Samael said, and as the lycan rushed in four legs to attack him, he blasted a thunderbolt right in his chest, leaving him in the ground, writhing in pain by the electricity. He walked slowly toward him and when stood before him, he stomped on his left arm, crushing it and breaking all the bones in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he tore the other lycan's arm, and put his hand on his chest. Then electricity flowed from him to the lycan and electrocuted him more. The lycan was panting in pain as slowly his body repaired back, and Samael said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You should know you won't live to heal fully\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damn..it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I could use more blood, but I think you deserve another death\"- Samael said as he grabbed him by the neck and began to strangle him. Then he used more electricity and caused an electroshock to the already damaged lycan. He still retained his full powered form, proving to be stronger than the vampire. And Samael smiled. Then, he hit beind his neck, breaking it, but not killing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis forced him to heal that fatal wound and turn back to normal. In the mean time, he had healed back his arms, but now he had no strenght to keep fighting. He was thrown in the ground and looked up, Samael was charging up thundebolts in his hand, and finally, the lycan's last vision was a white flash light as he died, turning into ashes inmediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...bastards\"- and looked toward Airisu, she seemed to be scared, she had never seen him like that (The only ones who have seen him at 100% are his father and Vlad)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she ran toward him and hugged him tightly, he closed his wings around her and said calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. You're safe...\"- She tightened her hug and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before they could react, two lycans appeared suddenly and a vampire between them. The vampire clapped and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Very well... but I'm afraid we can't let you go like that\"- The vampire said, this one had light red hair and dark brown eyes. The lycans had black and dark brown hair, both with yellow eyes (Most common color in lycans) which showed they already activated their powers. The vampire also had his fangs at full lenght. He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now!! Attack!!\"- Amd the two lycans ran toward Samael and Airisu while transofrming into their full powered form, but before they made contact, Samael and Airisu vanished. Then, they smelled the air and found him above a 3 stories tall building, he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If things get ugly, run away\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What about you?\"- Airisu worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I'll manage to go on my own, If you are chased contact Vlad, Steven or Adam\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay\"- She decided to stay there as long as possible. Samael extended his wings and flew right above them, he began to fly down until he was floating just 5 cm above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your business is with me...\"- Samael stated to them<br>\r\nThe lycans attacked him but Samael dodged them both, then, he saw vampire's fist coming right onto his face, and hit his forehead. Samael didn't even react and stayed still, then smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If that's all you can do then you're just a blood-sucking wimp\"- The vampire yelled in anger and before he did another move, Samael grabbed his two arms and hit him in the stomach with his knee, then punched him with a lot of strenght, sending him about 5 meters away and against a wall, which collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, thunderbolts began to flash around Samael as he extended his wings and stood in there, then, he opened his right hand and a long but thin katana like sword appeared, it had some kind of gothic design and it was dark red, strange for a metal, all the sword had the same color, even the handle. The vampire slashed at him with his claws, but Samael didn't even dodge the hit, as the claws couldn't penetrate the skin, then, tha vampire punched at his stomach and nothing happened, his body wasn't affected by anything, then, he saw how the scars Samael had began to glow in bright red, and his fangs grew slightly (to about 6 cm long, while vampires were only 3) and he slashed him several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire healed back very quickly but Samael punched him and they both began a fierce fight, the vampire turned into his full power form, looking more like a demon and they both fought in air, punches, slashes and kicks were flashing at incredible speeds, and in a chance, the vampire slashed off half of one of Samael's wings, he began to fall but before a lycan attacked him in mid air and tore off the other wing, and when he hit the ground, the other lycan stomped on his stomach and slashed his chest, then rose him up grabbing him by the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lycan tightened the grip until his claws began to sink into Samael's neck and he looked at him, Samael suddenly kicked him right in the nose, and the second kick in the stomach, freeing from the lycan. Quickly, Samael healed the wounds back and rebuilt his damaged wing and a new one. Then, a light ball appeared in his palm and around it thunderbolts flashed and became part of it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael cupped his hands and before shooting, he changed the aim to the vampire who tried to attack him from behind, and the thunder beam hit him, damaging him severely, smoke appeared as he fell down, and returned to normal form. Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Light in a more powerful way\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damnit\"- Then the lycans attacked Samael but he swung his saber and slashed off the right arm of one and the left of the other one. The lycans regenerated back inmediately and one of them asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the HELL are you anyway?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm the one who feeds on vampires' blood... I'm the one who will destroy you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey two lycans attacked at the same time and they could slash Samael's right arm anf left wing, he inmediately healed back and dashed, in a flash, he cut in a half one of the lycans right in front of them. before he even fell to the ground, he shot a thunder blast at his chest, beheaded him, and finally disintegrated him with another thunder blast, remaining of him nothing but ashes, as the other ones. Samael looked menacingly to the remaining lycanthrope. Samael punched him in stomach with way more strenght he'd normally would have used, leaving him on the ground, squirming in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at the vampire, who had healed back but his clothes were most burnt. The vampire looked with anger and turned again into his full power form. And dashed towards Samael but he didn't move and his eyes began to glow, suddenly, his wings grew slightly, and his fangs almost reached his chin, on his skin began to appear more tatto-like patterns, similar to his scars and the design of his saber, but on his whole chest and arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese marks also began to glow in bright red and claws grew in his hands (he had short black claws before). Also, his muscles tightened and his full muscle tone was revealed. He looked in anger and stood still. The vampire hit him several times but he couldn't move Samael even an inch, then the vampire tried to slash him but his claws didn't any scratch, the punches had no effect also, and when tried to bite him Samael blasted another thunder beam from his extended right hand. Then he walked slowly toward the vampire, and though he hit him with all his might the hits had no effect on Samael<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You...Monster!!!\"- The vampire screamed in desperation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you... Prey can't defeat its predator\"- The vampire for the first time gulped and tried to get away, just to be chased in air by Samael who surpassed his speed, then, after many tries, Samael bit his neck, making him to bleed and the vampire found out he couldn't heal that wound back and ten, Samael added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Isn't ironical you tried to drink my blood and also Airisu's, thinking we were humans...Now you'll feel how people feels when you feed on them\"- With that, he electroshocked the vampire with a lesser electrical ray, paralyzing him, and making him to fall down. Then Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Though you deserve to be bitten, you're disgusting\"- And blood began to flow from vampire's wound to Samael's wings and body. Soon, the vampire went pale and dissolved into dust. Then he walked toward the lycan, who had returned to second grade form (more humanoid) and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I should kill you... but you can be useful\"- Then, he grabbed him by the neck and eletroshocked him until he went back to human powerless form and kept eletroshocking him until smoke began to appear and he threw him down, then stomped on his chest and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm letting you go, go and tell vampires and werewolves there's someone they must fear... tell them, that I am the Vampire Slayer\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"T-There are a lo-lot of vampire slayers...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Crusnik... that's the name that must terrify them. If a vampire or a werewolf ever again get in my way, I'm gonna slaughter you all, and you know I can\"- With that, he let go the lycan. The electroshocks rendered him unable to turn wolf again, though he could still turn to first degree with vampire-like appeareance but much lesser skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he left, Airisu appeared inmediately and looked at Samael, she'd never seen him like that. Samael retracted his fangs and she hugged him again. Before Samael could think in anything to say, she kissed him again. She found him somewhat cute, he looked like a kind of angel, compared to demonic vampire transformation, and without the fangs, he looked even more like an angel, though the scars and black wings suggested a fallen angel or a dark one. [If it wasn't said before, Samael's wings were black but feathered, not bat-like]</span></div></div>",

He looked down, feeling that a he was going to have a long scolding season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Samael...\"- The doctor began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know all that 'you can't use your powers outside training' stuff, just tell me how long is the punishment\"-<br>\r\nSamael's father sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"There is no punishment\"- Samael looked at him puzzled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You indeed acted correctly... people can't live following orders all the time. Sometimes it's necessary to take the risk and break some rules. That's part of being human. Sometimes it's our heart, our soul what tells us what's right and what not\"- Samael looked confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're even more human than most. Not everyone can risk their own life to save others. But also, don't let your feelings to control your whole mind, anger and hate usually makes us to exceed. Just try to contorl yourself next time...And don't go 100% anymore, please\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't, unless it becomes necessary\"- Samael said and turned around to leave, as his father stopped him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't think I'm not aware of you both\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"YOU WHAT?!!\"- Samael now screamed, and Airisu gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How long have you been here?\"- Airisu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I saw the whole thing\"- the doctor answered, Airisu and Samael looked down, blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I already knew this would happen, it wasn't hard to find out by the way she always looked at you, it seems you were the last one to find out\"- Samael blushed more now knowing he wasn't sly enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have no problem with you being a couple. You aren't related nor anything, so, there's no problem by me, but, Airisu, I'd like to talk to you for a moment, alone\"-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All that stuff kind of confused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Airisu was alone with Dr. Kyuketsuki, he took a silver bracelet from his pocket, and handed it to her, it had a blue gem in its center. He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Take this, please\"- Airisu took it and looked at it. It seemed to be simple jewelry, but knowing the doctor, she knew there should be something else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And...I don't want to sound ungrateful, but what is this for?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was expecting you to ask. You see, have you noticed that silver tag that it's attached to a silver chain which Samael wears?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yup\"- She nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's more than his name with golden letters, it's a power restriction device, made by me since he was a baby\"-<br>\r\nShe looked at him now more confused, then, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would you restrict him? He needed his powers to save us\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"In fact, no... I analyzed the enemies he fought, and with his normal form, which can use up to 20% without any physical change, he can already defeat normal form vampires\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They didn't fight at normal form\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He could actually defeat a single vampire at full power with just 40% of his power output. And in worst of cases he'd need just 80% to defeat them all, even werewolves at full power. He indeed exceeded, that was why the power difference him and the vampire was that much. The vampire couldn't even cause a single scratch\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"They hurt him a lot before that\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He was distracted because he was focusing on protecting you. After he left you in a safe place he fought seriously, but taunted them making them to believe they could defeat him. It isn't wrong since they're evil but it could get dangerous. If he gets angry he could destroy the whole city in hours, or minutes\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Then why don't you control him? He's your son\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that won't work. It failed before...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, Azrael... but he was already an evil one, and he was near uncontrollable, he went insane\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It proved that only a strong person can control such a thing, and I'm not that one\"- The dr. replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why me?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you love him truly, and you'd use it wisely, for his own safety\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't love him?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course I do, he's my son...But the way you love him is far different, and that's why I trust you\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, but how do I use this?\"- Airisu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It works at will. You can limit Samael to 40% safely. If he tries to use more power the gem will glow, and it will prevent him to go any further, though in some times it might be necessary to use 80%, but that's the limit. 100% can't be handled by the device. The gem would glow in red and if he would get very angry, the excessive power amount could break the control and the gem. Though using so much power would weaken him.\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, no more than 40% most of times, and if things get ugly, just 80%? Why do you talk about him as he was a dangerous monster? I know him and I've seen he has a good heart\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but he can also get angry when someone he cares is threatened, and allowing him to unleash his full power would be disastrous. He isn't ready yet. Anyway, you have centuries to spend together and he'll learn to use his powers properly\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's fine by me... but I don't like the idea to be his 'tamer' at all...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Usually things are fine, but if someone hurts you or me or his friends, he'll become dangerous\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He went full power and he didn't even hurt me, in fact, he retracted his fangs before I hugged him\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't say that he'll lose control totally and hurt you, but he could for example destroy part of the city, don't worry, this is for emergencies only. I'll keep on training him to prevent him to use full power at anytime\"-</span></div></div>",

He slapped his forehead knowing the reason, though he found strange she didn't seem to be bothered by his transformations. He remained silent and went to the kitchen, just to see his breakfast was already made by her. He saw that his father was silent too, reading the news. Then, he put away the news, anger could be noticed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can't believe this, those madmen are gonna screw Earth up\"- he muttered, which both Airisu and Samael could hear due to their superior hear sense. They stared at him and he realized what was going on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No matter what, no matter how long, I just can't get used to you two having higher senses\"- He sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are those United Nations scientists doing something wrong?\"- Airisu asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Actually yeah, but I can't tell you more details... Just, be careful, ok? I have to go inmediately, I've got to report this and some other things... the United Nations aren't nothing but Americans' and Brittish'* puppets\"- He left angrily and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It seems something is wrong...\"- Airisu worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But we can't know what the hell is it... but somehow... I feel this is related to me or something\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?! Don't say such things, Samael!! I don't want you to get hurt or caught by those people, they're mad...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's the truth, they might have interest on my powers...\"- Airisu sighed, she knew he was right, they probably were intending something related to his powers and a way to use them on war or something. The probabilities to be used for good were zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I won't let them get you\"- She said, looking at him in a lovingly way. Samael got slightly nervous and began to eat his breakfast. He thought that anyways, he was more likely to be able to get rid of whoever who tried to catch him, but he knew she said that to calm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NOTE: After receiving some mails about that part of the chapter, I want to add that is not to offend anyone. Just I thought it'd be the way of speaking of an angry scientist, plus the fact that United States and England are usually depicted as the world's most powerful countries, so, No offense intended.

As he thought, she grabbed his hand. It's not that Samael didn't love her, he had a slight conflict inside him because she is his adopted sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the attack that happened the previous night turned his guard on. The thought to be attacked by more vampires and/or lycans would make him more protective towards her. Even when she is able to go full power as a high class vampiress* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to school (Samael could get her to release his hand) and encountered with Vlad who was yelling at Steven. Airisu and Samael sighed and asked the everyday question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What did he do this time?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Made us to make the same homework three times because the first one, he left it near the chimney. Second time, outside, a dog took it away, and you'll guess who fought it over the work, which they both destroyed\"- Samael barely could contain the laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And here's the third one. He was bringing the wrong work and I was about to kill him, but I went at superspeed at his house and brought it back\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked like a scolded kid, and this sort of dumbness was part of him most of times, to the point of some times forgetting his strenght and causing pain to Vlad and/or Samael. Also, he's the one who gets them in problems by stupid motives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also somehow doesn't control fully his instincts because he barely represses himself when seeing a good-looking girl, gets angry at animals easily, specially cats and dogs, but he befriends with wolves and coyotes (or even skimo dogs, alaskan malamutes or siberian huskies, because they're pretty close to wolves)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael and Airisu laughed at the scolded childish blond and the furious vampire, who was kind of comical when scolding Steven. They took their stuff and went to their class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*[Note to Trinity Blood Fans: Methuselah don't exist yet, by vampires I mean the true ones, all of them descending from Dracula, and mid class are burned by sunlight as Methuselah, but high class remain either weakened or powerless or are unaffected, this depends on the higher class lineage, the closer and purer to Lord Dracula, the more powerful and resistant the vampires will be. Example: Airisu is powerless during day if there's sunlight, but she can get her powers in an eclipse or cloudy day. Vlad Ferdinand on the other hand, is totally unaffected]</span></div></div>",

Don't ask...), and Samael got the food from the cafeteria. Airisu and Vlad brought their bottles but Samael gestured them to be more discreet, and Vlad replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... according to this paper, I have anemia and need to drink tomato juice...\"- He said showing a medical prescription<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamael sighed and looked at Airisu, who had already finished drinking, she smiled. Before start drinking, Vlad asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Sam, wanna some of this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ferdinand... I've told you a million times... I am not a vampire...\"- Samael said, serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Are you sure? You have fangs too... and those fangs must be for something...\"- Vlad answered, which annoyed Samael slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm OK. In difference of you, I can actually eat food without getting sick...\"- Steven and Airisu laughed at this little argument, it was like that since they were kids. Vlad always tried to make Samael believe himself to be one more vampire just like him, though they already knew he wasn't. Vlad always found fun in trying to get Samael to drink blood and behave like a vampire, which annoys him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is that so?\"- Vlad replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah. I can eat anything I want and don't need to be always sucking blood\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Medical Blood, please...and it's tastier\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But having blood all time? I'd get sick just to think about it... Eating the same everyday...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Argh...I'll kick you in the next training season for that...\"- Vlad drank the blood and crossed his arms. He grunted because he had lost another lunch argument, again... However, deep inside, he knew that Samael was different. Also, Dr Kyuketsuki had hinted that slightly. Vlad also has seen him at full power when training (Currently, Dr Kyuketsuki, Airisu and Vlad have seen him at full power. Steven has only seen him at 80%)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a boy came to their table and sat with them. Vlad immediately said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Where's the 'Hi' thing? Where are your manners?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I thought that you were against human customs...\"- the boy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're lucky that I just had my lunch...\"- Vlad replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even Adam would kick your ass, Ferdinand\"- Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't call me like that!!\"- Vlad replied -\"Vlad is a cooler name...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-*Sigh* The name 'Vlad' makes you suspicious of being a vampire\"- Samael answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah, c'mon, nobody have believed vampires exist in at least 300 years!!\"- Vlad said and added -\"They even make movies and cartoons about them, and by the way, many of them put vampires against lycans\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're natural enemies...\"- Adam replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I know, but, everyone knows we're far stronger!! I mean, we've got class. We're not simple beasts...\"- Vlad continued and Steven replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, the beasts can kick your ass. And the stories are right, Lycans are better\"- And before another argument about the strongest species began, Samael replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"None of you. Humans are weaker but have developed methods to defeat both of you, so, I think that the brains owns the muscles in this one\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Meh... Who was the one to discover that silver could hurt us anyway?\"- Vlad said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nobody knows... It's very ancient knowledge. Also, someone must have found out that beheading or destroying the heart can kill both species\"- Airisu said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Not necessarily. Some vampires can regenerate even after being beheaded. I've read that the purer ones can, the ones closer to their ancestors' bloodline\"- Adam added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Samael was drinking a big bottle of water (about 1.5 liters, or half of a gallon), and Vlad paid attention to this little detail, saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey Sam, you always drink that much water?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why?\"- Samael said after finishing (rather quickly)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmm... Not even wolves drink that much\"- Vlad said, and Steven was clueless at what he had just said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's your point?\"- Samael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You drink water as much as I and Airisu drink our food\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So what? I'm just thirsty and train everyday...\"- Samael replied, beginning to feel annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you haven't trained yet today...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I have a theory... but forget about that, I'll bring that up later...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wait, what?!! No, you now have to tell me!!\"- Samael said, and the bell rang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh. This is my day...\"- Vlad laughed and left happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...Saved by the bell...\"- Samael mumbled, annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey, what did you say about wolves?!!\"- Steven said, and was ignored by everyone, as all of them had to leave to go to their next classes...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>UPDATE: Found images for some characters and their info has also been updated</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Lilith, Seth, Cain and Abel weren't the first Crusniks to have appeared?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an alternative story to the Trinity Blood Universe, where is discovered the existence of another Crusnik, different to other ones. Also, this features some differences to the original anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPECIES</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Humans</b>: Called also Terrans by Methuselah (Vampires). Ordinary People with nothing but technology. Not special abilities. Some are very skilled though, and manage to fight superior life forms with the proper weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are also Enhanced Humans, who have replaced some parts of their body to acquire higher abilities such as super speed, strength, intelligence or regenerative factor. (Example: Hugue de Watteau, or like Anderson from Hellsing series).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Androids</b>: Advanced machines that serve people. They also are more powerful than most people and more resistent to damage. Most of them use guns with lethal precision (like Tres Iqus) but some are designed to close combat. Also, some of them have more capability to think on their own than others. All of them use self-repair system to match the vampires' regenerative factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lycanthropes</b>: Also known as Lycans. Beings with human appeareance but with the ability to turn into werewolf at will, and they keep self control and act at will. They have regeneration also and holy silver is their weakness only if pierces a vital organ and keeps stuck. If they get cut by any weapon, they'll regenerate back. Normal silver can just cause them skin irritation at contact but bullets made out of this are just as normal ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly holy silver weakens them if stuck into their bodies.They can breed normally with any lycan of the opposite sex and also eat normal food but they're more likely to consume larger amounts and mostly meat. Lycans can control their power level in three degrees:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>Normal form</b>: No powers, but can take much more damage than humans and have faster reflexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>1st degree</b>: Eyes change color to their beast form (Also, the eye color is always different from normal form to any further transformation), fangs lenghten and muscles tighten. This is minimal power they can use, and can regenerate wounds as fast as vampires but they don't regenerate entire parts back. Speed and strenght are enhanced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>2nd degree</b>: This is more werewolf-like form, they grow fur and get the wolf appeareance but as a bipedal one, muscles grow and abilites grow stronger. At this state they can slowly regenerate entire parts like arms back. They can go on fours to run faster but are predominantly bipedal, and legs are longer than arms as their normal form (They're like Cornell from Castlevania series)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>3rd degree</b>: The full power lycanthrope. The wolf transformation is complete but they are still the same psychologically. This form can heal back as fast and efective as vampires, but eventually runs their energies low. At this state, if there's full moon they'll get unlimited stamina and healing ability. Werewolves are humans infected by a wolf's (not lycans) bite and are irrational, also, they only turn into beast when fullmoon and can be killed with silver. Though they are as strong as second degree lycans. Werewolves aren't considered lycans and are seen more like mad dogs/wild beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two kinds of vampires:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Methuselah</b>: Known as vampires or low class vampires. They descend from people infected with Mars bacillus. They have speed and strenght above humans. They can breed normall with their own kind and also can eat normal food. Ultraviolet sunlight kills them. They can form blades from their hands and so from other parts of their body such as nails and even hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery few have uncommon powers such as pyrokinesis (fire control). Any form of pure silver (even not holy) hurts them and has the potential to kill them. Also, their healing factor decreases or is canceled with the use of silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nosferatu</b>: Also known as true vampires or original vampires. They existed way before Methuselah and are descendants of legendary Count Dracula. They can only feed on human blood. Also, their healing factor is faster than Methuselah's. They don't have the blades but can transform into a stronger demon-like form (As Dracula from Van Helsing). There are mid class and high class (Methuselah are considered low class). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mid class</b> are hurt by sunlight slowly and can only breed among their own kind, they aren't compatible with any other kind, once so each 10 years. Their difference to Methuselah is little in strength and abilities. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nHigh class</b> can breed (but just once each 100 years) and sunlight leaves them only powerless (they retain fast reflexes,only very few high class were unaffected by the sunlight. Both classes can be killed by stabbing their heart with holy silver or a bullet made out of the same material. Beheading only kills mid class and methuselah. Mid class are more vulnerable to silver while high class are more affected by holy stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Crusnik</b>: A superior life form that feeds on vampire's blood. They're unaffected by sunlight. Breeding is unknown. They can also eat normal food. Healing factor as effective as high class nosferatu. Their power comes out from nanomachines in their bloodstream, and also they can regulate their power output by verbal command. Only 4 Crusniks were known and existed official data about them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lilith Sahl, Crusnik 04<br>\r\nSeth Nightroad, Crusnik 03<br>\r\nAbel Nightroad, Crusnik 02<br>\r\nCain Nightroad, Crusnik 01</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were experimental tube babies used for the Mars colonization project, and were infused with nanomachines found in Mars which people couldn't endure, they got infected by a martian bacillus and became Methuselah instead. Crusniks have blades made out of their blood and are extremely sharp. Also, at 80% they're able to use electrical powers. What nobody knew was that there was another Crusnik who didn't adjust to all descriptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The backstory will be written in story chapters</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b>: I won't write much about Trinity Blood official characters since this is an interactive fanfic and I assume you've seen at least some of the anime/manga. Here are the other characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Samael \"Zero\" Kyuketsuki</b>: Also known as Crusnik Zero. He's a 17 years old looking boy with medium lenght black hair and platinum eyes. He's 1.80 mt tall and slim but with muscled toned body. He's very serious and in difference to any other Crusnik, he kept feeding on vampires the whole time, criminal ones. At human form he can heal back as a vampire and also keep up a fight decently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fights mostly with punches and kicks, but also has an ancient sword that belonged to his ancestors and was made out from a strange meteor and holy silver. He was born in September 15th, 2074. The way he acquired his powers will be explained later in story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being tough and having fought in the Armageddon War which was 300 year long, after some events he left fighting, he had fought secretly since people shouldn't know about Crusnik's powers by those times, according to his father. He fought along his friends by humans side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's very tough but he's kind of shy specially with females. He's stronger than ordinary Crusniks and also is capable to use electric attacks even at 1% (normal form), he can control the energy and create powerful electric blasts or shock enemies. His weapon when uses at least 20% is a katana like sword made out of his blood, from 80% and onward he can draw out two of these blades and even fuse them as a double saber and turn it in a bow-like weapon, shooting arrow shaped thunderbolts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another characteristic is that he can surpass the 100% form (that will be explained in story). Actual age 996 years old. Is very smart and also is a very talented hacker and knows almost everything about lost technology (Which he knew since he grew in the pre-Armageddon world). Actually, even after 900 yeras and having mastered his powers, he still doesn't know much about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis look during Armageddon War: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static.playdo.com/1015/hunt/tabimages/shadowwarrior.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.playdo.com/1015/hunt/tabimages/shadowwarrior.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is his look during the Trinity Blood events: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static.playdo.com/1015/hunt/tabimages/-anime-guy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.playdo.com/1015/hunt/tabimages/-anime-guy.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull powered form during Armageddon War: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i221.photobucket.com/albums/dd215/masterdrako/Angel_of_Death.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i221.photobucket.com/albums/dd215/masterdrako/Angel_of_Death.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSort of his 100% form: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://loveless2beloved4u.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/sammael.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://loveless2beloved4u.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/sammael.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference are the clothing, the swords which are made out of his blood, the hair and the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jasmine Taylor</b>: Human girl saved by Samael about 610 years after the war, in 3074, she was born March 3rd, 3056 and is 18 years old. She's white with light brown hair and green eyes. Her body is well shaped (not too skinny). She meets Samael by the current time (900 years after the beginning of the Armageddon War).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/blue.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/blue.jp...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/BLUE-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/BLUE-1....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vlad Ferdinand von Abendroth</b>: Nosferatu, and Samael's best friend. He looks 18-19 years old but he's as old as Samael. His body is slim and normal, he has slightly tanned skin, dark brown hair and wine red eyes. His family was vampire in secret and were helped by Dr. Kyuketsuki (Samael's father) to live along people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his family was killed by the methuselah at the very beginning of the war and that made him to side by humans and turn to Samael for help. He's a high class one and also is one of the very few unaffected by the sun, thought they fought most at night anyways. They fought together for 200 years and after some events including his father's (who was human) death and other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fights in a style similar to Samael but also is a master using guns, and he uses two huge ones, which are 42 cm long and shoot special bullets, either holy solid silver ones or explosive ones with mercurium or holy water. He also can turn his hands into powerful blades, or pull out one of his bones (sometimes his own spine, as he inmediately grows a new one) to create a saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks and sometimes behaves like L (Eru, Lawliet, Ryuzaki, from Death Note): <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/1642/l400bk5.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/1642/l400bk5.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the War he dressed like Samael but in black, and wore a hat like Alucard (Hellsing) or Vampire Hunter D's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Airisu Tsuki</b>: Vampiress, she's orphan and was found by Dr. Kyuketsuki, who raised her as her own daughter. She grew along Samael and they became friends. She was his same age, and developed a strong affection to him, and it was more than brotherly love. When they turn 17 she asks Samael to be her boyfriend, but she's murdered after 200 years of Armageddon War. She's the reason Samael left fighting. Physically she had green eyes and black hair. Well shaped body also due to her being a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kind of looked like this: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/animegirlblack.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k32/Kadaj19/Trinity%20Blood%20Pictures/animegi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetails: A more feminine body (more curves). Her powered form is the same but with two bat-like wings, and elonged fangs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer normal form is just without the wings and fangs retracted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Steven Schneider</b>: Lycanthrope. Friend of Vlad Ferdinand and Samael. Fought along them the war for 200 years too and left when they did. From his family survived his father Adolph Schneider (looks like 30, and isn't known much about him) and his younger sister Abigail (looks like 16 and has a crush on Samael before the war). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them lycans, his mother was the only one who died. Also looks 17-18 years old. He's blonde with short hair. Tall and more muscled than Samael, like a guy who goes to gym very often. His eyes are jade green and yellow when turns into wolf. He's average smart and kind of dumb sometimes, mostly he doesn't control his strength properly, which Samael regrets the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim at second degree form (at the left) <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/werewolf-comparison.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/werewolf-comparison.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis form could go on fours but isn't as well developed as full power, and runs kinda like gorillas because his arms are longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull power (looks like this, but Steven is golden as he is blond at normal state): <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s.bebo.com/app-image/8109096476/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/08/08/03/werewolf1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s.bebo.com/app-image/8109096476/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full power form can stand either on fours and bipedal.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nDr. Kyuketsuki</b>: Samael's father, a very important scientist who learned about vampires and lycans long ago in his youth days. He made friends with the von Abendroth and Schneider families. Further past is unknown but it seems that some ancestor of Kyuketsuki family fought alongside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe died in 2102 by being murdered (after the first 13 years of Armageddon War). He couldn't tell much to Samael about his powers' origin and created a secret lab where there would be a hologram with his personality and all the data to tell Samael, it would be a home for him too. Also he created seveal servant robots to keep the lab/house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Kyuketsuki: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs32/f/2008/214/f/b/Dr__Stein_by_kresnik02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs32/f/2008/214/f/b/Dr__Stein_by_kresnik02.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmit the zombie-like things, besides that, this is the looks he has, and black hair instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ryuuken</b>: Also known as RK-072BTX, a strange and unknown android model found very damaged by Samael during Armageddon War. Dr Kyuketsuki repaired him and upgraded a lot his original design, giving him more combat capacities. It seemed that he had a secret special mode but the way to unlock it was never found. Also it seemed that his original combat design was unfinished leaving him only as a civil android with serious combat skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought in the war with no armor and nothing but whatever he found such as tubes, sticks, guns. Even when Samael has treated him as a brother/friend and equal he still calls him \"Master\" and protects him the most he can because Samael was the one who saved him. His appearance is a normal human with long dark red hair worn as a ponytail, and golden eyes that glow when he fights. He also can work as a computer, storing and playing any type of data and having hidden ports in his neck, shoulders and hands (even USB). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis helps Samael a lot because he is a very experienced hacker and so they could unlock security systems during the war. Actually uses Kyuketsuki's familiar katana as main weapon, which was made out of a strange alloy of meteoric metal that was half silver half steel with something else unknown. His blueprints and registers were wiped out with most things during war, and he's kind of a relic model due to the fact nobody could replicate his chipsets or his strangely complex operating system. Also, is inmune to any virus due to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this (forget the clothes, and hair is red): <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blackzero04.deviantart.com/art/Zero-in-discise-128575706\" target=\"_blank\">http://blackzero04.deviantart.com/art/Zero-in-discise-128575706</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibi like (a funny one but the only red haired one I found): <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th04.deviantart.net/fs42/300W/i/2009/096/d/d/Hey__Baku__Are_you_d____gasp__by_CursedMoonlight.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th04.deviantart.net/fs42/300W/i/2009/096/d/d/Hey__Baku__Are_you_d____gasp...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dresses like this: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs45/f/2009/117/b/e/Alternate_Bluesy_by_crazylegz42.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs45/f/2009/117/b/e/Alternate_Bluesy_by_crazylegz42.p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hakkon Zetsumei</b>: Ancient king of Mars, and the true \"true\" Crusnik, he looked like Abel at 100% but he was dark green, four bat-like wings instead of two. Eyes completely red and pupils weren't visible, no fangs, and he had electrical powers. He came to Earth after first vehicles made contact with Mars, and caused great havoc. He was defeated by unknown warriors and everything else is unknown... to be told more in story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Akohainen</b>: Another powerful mars being, sealed away long time ago, rumors said that he'd give limitless power to the one who awakened him and could break the seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny character of Trinity Blood universe is allowed. If you're going to add a new character, please do so if you're going to add more than once (or ask me by e mail)<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nThe countries/factions</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vatican</b>: Governed by the Pope and the Catholic Church. It has a lot of military technology and has orders which are lead by cardinals or other high ranked bishops. It seems that the celibacy was eliminated due to the low human population after war (that's based in the fact that cardinal Sforza and di Medici, and the Pope are all three siblings and their father was the previous Pope). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's said to have most of cultural content and to be the safest place for people. It seems to be derived from Rome and Italy mostly. Most of people are European. There are still occasional attacks from Nosferatu and wild werewolves (not lycans), they're faced by Catholic agents and mercenaries called Hunters. In secret some nosferatu vampires live in here and pacific ones feed on animals such as cows and horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Albion</b>: Independent kingdom also for mostly humans, it's derived from England, they have higher technology due to the usage of methuselah to make and operate those machines, technology is everywhere and everyone uses it. Most of people is specifically Brittish descendent. Attacks are very rare but sometimes appear wild werewolves and more rarely vampires. Albion uses a police-like force entirely of androids to face threats (that last part was added by me).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Empire</b>: An empire where methuselah and humans live together, Nosferatus refused to live along people so their population in here is very few. They're governed by Augusta Vradica, aka Seth Nightroad, Crusnik 03. Sometimes they get attacked by the Hunters or Rosenkreuz Orden, which operates from the inside. They have their army and Royal Guard mostly formed by Methuselah. Humans are still kind of discriminated here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rosenkreuz Orden</b>: A.k.a Contra Mundi, Formed by Lycans, Methuselah, Nosferatus and very few humans who are against the world's order and their aim is to destroy all current kingdoms and create a new world. Their leader is Cain Nightroad, and the Orden also aims for his personal goals such as rebuilding his body, trying to get Abel's and whatever Cain considers important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Euroslavia</b>: A kingdom inhabited mostly by lycanthropes. It conformed the Slavic Countries and a few of Asia. They have a standard level of technology comparable to Vatican's alone. They still live at the norway/finland/iceland kind of style. Humans are welcome but relationship with the Empire is pretty tense, as vampires have been always their enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, they sided with humans during Armageddon War. They have some strange customs as part of their culture which will be explained later. This is the least polluted place due to having a lot of trees and kept the environment as it once was, and that people and lycans decided to use clean energy sources and let the nature fix itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso has some of the most beautiful places to be. Currently they have developed the lycan medical area to be able to heal lycans hurt by holy silver or other dangerous objects. Also, they use healing tanks to heal people as quick as lycans or vampires would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLycans and humans befriended here and lycans don't use their powers 8unless necessary) to not be mistaken or to not scare their human friends (Although most are used to it anyway). But due to their mostly meat based diet, when they hunt they use them at first or second degree. Some times they suffer attacks from the Hunters mostly, as the Contra Mundi is seen as an ancient legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Hunters</b>: They were a secret Vatican's force codenamed Black Cross Orden. The orden was created to protect people when Armageddon War began and were given great technology and powerful weapons to accomplish that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn't accept the alliance with Lycans nor having vampires and Crusniks to fight for them. After some attacks on allied lycans and vampires, and lots of casualties, the Vatican sent warriors who were supposed to retire them. They failed and as the orden's integrants escaped, they formed a new faction of their own and their aim is to wipe out vampires, lycans and establish a new government at the Vatican. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are all humans and androids but most of humans have been altered by mutations to be able to match the \"monsters\" they're after. Others are enhanced humans or cyborgs, anyway, one of their most used warrior-type are hybrids (Half human + Half Vampire/Lycan or 1/4 both). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso there are Armored units which are either humans or civilian androids using special armors to enhance their battle abilities. Agents and squadrons work also as mercenaries to mantain themselves. They use Templar Knights kind of style, and they call themselves the \"true followers of God\" as they insist on that only humans were supposed to live in the Earth, anything different is an aberration. They kill people if they oppose. They have most of ancient relics and most of old knowledge about how to kill vampires and werewolves, which they stole during their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'm sorry for this being too long. I hope you add and enjoy this story<br>\r\n</td>",
