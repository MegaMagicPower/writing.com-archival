It was a good thing she was the first one back to Team RWBY's dorm, or else WBY might've lost some eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Using her semblance to cross the immeasurable distance of three feet, she finally made it to her destination. On her desk sat a plate of still-warm cookies, perfectly preserved on a plate and covered in saran wrap. Ruby lifted the plate up, nothing that it, too, was warm. She was about to tear into them, when she noted the card sitting next to the spot the plate was. Inscribed on it in beautiful handwriting were three words and a single letter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Made with love,<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n                     W-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ruby's face warmed slightly at reading this. Weiss had made her cookies. <i>Weiss</i> had made <i>Ruby</i> cookies. Ruby face got a little redder. Her and Weiss had been going back and forth with awkward hand touches and flirtatious glances for months. The crushes the had on each other were painfully obvious to everyone but themselves, and when asked about having anyone they liked, they always either shoot down the question or laugh nervously and stare at the floor. Even their other two teammates, Blake and Yang, couldn't get them to see the obvious (even though they, too, were in a very similar situation). However, this... this is the first time Weiss had gotten her ANYTHING. It was probably the first time she'd gotten ANYONE anything. If Yang were in the room, she would've said something about how Ruby had just \"melted the Ice Queen's heart and stole it at the same time.\" God damnit, Yang, why'd you have to ruin the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Finishing her subconscious conversation with her sister, which is a very normal, sane thing to do, she eyed the discoidal treasures sitting in her hand and the card from her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Made with love\" Ruby read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>Love.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ruby shook the thought from her mind and turned her attention back to the cookies. 'They'll get cold if I don't eat 'em soon,' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I can't let them go to waste,\" she said to no one in particular. She tore the plastic wrapping of the circular delicacies, causing the delightful smell to invade Ruby's senses. She picked one up and investigated it, taking in everything about it, the smell, the texture, the warmth, and, of course, the flavor: chocolate chip, her favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ok, what was that Yang keeps saying? BOLO? GOLO? Ah, whatever, they can't be THAT bad.\" Cautiously, she brings the cookie up to her lips and takes a nibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was one of the best cookies she'd ever eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ruby quickly devoured the rest of the cookie, savoring everything about it, the warmth, the spices, the... well... EVERYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"OH. MU. GWORD!\" Ruby said through a mouthful of cookie. \"DISH ISH AMASINSH!!! Not even bothering to swallow fully, Ruby grabbed another cookie and consumed it, this time taking in the richness of the chocolate. She wouldn't be surprised if Weiss had hand-picked this chocolate, it was to die for! She swiftly grabbed another and inhaled it, this time noting how it was somehow warm from being fresh from the oven, while still being slightly crispy; it was to perfect time for a cookie to be eaten. This went on for several minutes, Ruby quickly cramming cookies down her gullet, while also taking time to savor every crumb that was prepared for her. Various noises could be heard coming from Ruby, chewing and munching, moans and groans, all of completely drowning out the sound of the dorm door opening slightly, a pale figure peeking through. A smile graced the Schnee's face as she removed herself from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Weiss walked back to the dormitory kitchen, a blush crept onto her face, not just from the heat in the kitchen, but from seeing Ruby enjoy her creation... as well what would be happening to her soon. It was no surprise to some in from her home, like Winter and Klein, that Weiss had a taste for women; larger women. Winter would always note when a plump businesswoman would grace the Schnee family with their presence, Weiss would always be glancing at their flowing middles, or staring at swaying behinds as they took their leave. Weiss knew this, and tried to keep it down, knowing that her father would disapprove of her preference in gender. However, meeting Ruby, she had found one person she could confide in, one who wouldn't see her as a Schnee, one she could trust, one she could love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She just happened to be one who was ripe to have a fuller figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Weiss had witnessed her partner's outlandish eating habits for a year and a half, and, even still, wouldn't gain a single pound. There had been one time after the year's end ball that she had put on a good ten pounds or so, making her corset slightly tighter and her skirt not cover up all of her rear (both of which Weiss took note of... and pictures), but by the time their break had ended, she had shed the pounds, returning her to her slim self. She cursed herself for not taking advantage of the situation then, but, this time, she would ensure that her pounds would stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Weiss returned to the kitchen, the smell of baked goods in the air. Coming to her station, she found everything the way she had left it, completely in order. 'The only thing missing...' Weiss thought as she reached a hand into her pocket, 'Is the secret ingredient.' Many people would say that the secret ingredient in their cookies is love, though, as she had made it clear in her note, that was no secret, a fact that she regretted slightly, but which faded soon after she saw her crush consuming the cookies with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Weiss gathered her apron, gathered her measurement apparatus', and got to work on her second batch. She made sure everything was perfect, the measurements, the consistency, how much to mix it, but just as she was about to start forming the cookies themselves, she added some of her secret ingredient. Then a little more. Then more. Then more still. Until, finally, she had run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I can assure you, Ruby Rose, that you will love these cookies, as well as the pounds they give you.\" Weiss spoke quietly, as she stirred the compound into the dough, then started forming the balls of dough. She set all two dozen of them in the oven at exactly the right temperature, and set it for exactly the right amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'll be back for you later\" Weiss said, as she strode of to check on Ruby's \"progress\". She walked along with a slight bounce in her step, a rare sight from the Schnee heiress. As she came up to the dorm door, she noted that she couldn't hear Ruby's eating anymore. 'She must be done already,' Weiss thought. 'No surprise there.' With a smirk on her face, she turned to doorknob and let herself in. What she saw surprised her: Ruby was sitting at her desk, happily licking her fingers of any residue of cookie that remained. What startled her, though, was Ruby's size. Her stomach had grown out slightly, putting a bit of strain on her corset. Someone that saw her might think that it was a food baby, but Weiss knew better. Weiss knew that that little ball was all of <i>fat</i>. Eyeing up the rest of her partner, Weiss noted that Ruby's thighs were slightly thicker, her usual stockings thinner and more stretched out due to holding more thigh. Glancing up, she saw that Ruby's breast had grown ever so slightly. She was never too gifted in the boob category, those genes went to Yang, but she might at least have Blake beat out. 'I think Ruby's gonna be a pear, though.' Weiss thought, seeing how Ruby's middle and lower half took most of the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After she had finished licking all ten of her fingers TWICE, Ruby finally noticed Weiss had walked in and gets up to walk over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hello, Weiss.\" Ruby said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hi, Ruby\" Weiss responds, a blush dusting her face as well. Ruby's next words surprise the heiress...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So I saw your cookies,\" came the words of the fuller figured girl, a small blush lighting up her cheeks. Weiss too gained a fuller blush as she realized that Ruby had picked up on her meaning behind the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I'm glad you like the cookies...\" Weiss knew she couldn't just let Ruby knew she was interested, in typical weiss fashion, she knew she had to play hard to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookies?\" Came Ruby's adorable retort before realization came to her. \"Ah yes! Cookies!\" Lightly patting her fatter stomach, she seemingly lost herself in a daze. \"They were delicious.\" Unconsciously rubbing her stomach, she almost seemed to forget that Weiss was in the room as a small line of drool leaked out of her mouth at the mere memory of the cookies she'd just ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnthralled by her potential girlfriend losing herself to the memory of her confections, Weiss quickly coughed into her hands, awakening Ruby from her daze. \"Ah, yes. I'm glad you enjoyed them. They were an old Schnee family recipe you know, plenty of love put into every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to insinuate every syllable of 'bite' she could feel Ruby's blush from where she was standing, as the red hair tipped huntress picked up on Weiss' meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh she's so adorable,' were the thoughts on Weiss' mind as she couldn't help but imagine Ruby with an added 100 pounds or so. Not enough to force her to give up on her huntress dreams, but certainly enough where she could be the ideal girl for her. Images of the two of them, laying in bed together, with Weiss feeling her large lover fatty confection after fatty confection. Her soft pale unblemished skin perfect for kneading and warming her on those cold nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss would make sure to take care of her lover whenever she was home, or at the very least having the latest technology available to pamper her. She imagined Ruby struggling to get on her clothes, from those cute white panties with the cute corgi print, the sheer thought of those being stretched wide, Ruby unaware that she'd outgrown them 80 lbs ago; to her skirt which would occasionally have a small rip in them, only for Weiss to quickly replace or repair the garment, making sure Ruby never knew her weight. Her shirt would often times lose a button or two, but a quick lie to the younger girl would hopefully placate her, and maybe a larger version of the garment worn would keep her from finding out about her added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate at night, Weiss would sometimes dream about Ruby growing so large that her clothes would all burst off of her, her fat having been too much for them. Each button bursting on her shirt, each thread tearing on her skirt, and her bra and panties tearing off in a show of embarrassment would sometimes have Weiss waking up late at night realizing she had to change her sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-iss! WEISS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly thrown out of her daydream, she hasn't realized that Ruby had been talking to her for the past minute or so. Quickly catching herself, she answered her now pudgy partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I got lost in the moment. You were saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a shrug at her partner's response, Ruby got right back on track. Grasping her partners hand, she hugged it, unknowingly bringing it close to her stomach and sinking it into her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you had more of those cookies! They were some of the best things I'd ever tasted!\" Ruby's straight to the point demeanor was something Weiss appreciated. Why beat around the bush when you could be up front about what you wanted. However, Weiss knew such sentiment was ironic with her current desires of fattening up her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her best 'warm friend' smile, she addressed Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it just so happens, I have a new batch ready in the oven right now. Much larger than the one you just had, they should be ready soon, so if you want you can get them right when they come out of the over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a slight squeee from the younger girl, Weiss saw her team leader hopping up and down in place, unknowingly shaking her newly added fat a bit. Licking her lips a bit at the sight, she turned from Ruby so that the girl wouldn't see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway, let's go. I can tell you're hungry for them, so why waste the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching out of the room, Ruby soon followed, with no notice of her new pudge.</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes and started scratching her arm, but the tingling didn't stop. \"It there a bug on me?

Ruby looked down and, to her horror, her flat gut had started to bulge out, forming a perfect pot belly. \"Oh My God, I've got to get out of here!\" Ruby ran or rather, waddled out of the bathroom and attempted to grab her clothes, but before she could, something took her attention away from that. The feeling of fullness began spreading to other parts of her body, starting with her young butt and thighs. Her butt and thighs started to swell, filling with juice and making Ruby's movements harder, \"I...I've got nothing.\" Ruby said staring at her ever growing, red ass. Soon her butt swelled to the point that the weight was too much for her and she fell back, landing on her butt. It jiggled as she recovered from her fall, making a clear sloshing sound. \"Huh...Am I filling with juice? How is that possible?\" But she wouldn't have time to think of a reason, as the fullness made its way to her chest, rather quickly. She turned her attention to her rather small chest and placed her hands on her C-cup breasts. \"Oh please don't, I don't want to know how Yang feels with her big boobs.\" But it was too late, her breast slowly grow, passing cup sizes one by one, until she reached just shy of P-cup, her bra not surviving. While all this was happening, her belly was growing to impossible sizes, reaching twice the size of an exercise ball. \"OK, so Now, I have a huge boobs, a big butt and a still swelling belly, can it get any worse.\" She soon learned to regret saying that, as the fullness spread to the rest of her body, forcing it to round out. Her legs and arms started to sink into her rounding body, the feeling of juice sloshing inside her was almost pleasurable to her, but she tried to keep focused on her predicament. But her focus would be interrupted by juice rushing to her head, forcing her cheeks to swell, making her speech slightly muffled. She continued to swell for 5 minutes, all the while she could feel the juice slosh and flow through her. She was thankful that her panties somehow managed the hang on throughout the who transformation thus far. \"I hope this stops soon, I think I'm reaching my limit, both capacity and mental strength, this is starting to feel too good.\" Ruby thought to herself. Thankfully, to her delight, she finally stopped swelling, she stopped at about a meter in diameter with two 30 centimeter breasts sticking out. \"Oh thank god, it stopped. Now I just need to...wait...what's that smell?\" Ruby noticed the scent of something strong, something...familiar. \"It smells like...cherries.\" But she would soon realize why as she felt something roll down her round body. She looked to the side and saw the red drop before it was sucked into the floor cracks. \"That was...did that come from me?\"  </span></div></div>",

Ruby couldn't do anything but stare at her teammate as she swelled up, but something would catch her attention, the sounds of small objects moving inside of Weiss.

Second, she could head back to her team's dorm; the blonde brawler had a fairly sizable supply of snacks stashed away in the room, and she knew for a fact that Ruby did as well. If worst came to worst, she could always ask her sister for some extra treats if her current stash didn't turn out to be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, a little voice had begun to speak up within Yang's mind - a voice that was surprisingly persuasive.

Just please keep in mind these rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep the grammar and spelling good, <br>\r\n2. Do not make shoddy, short chapters like this :\"ruby ate a bunch of food and gained 1000000 ponds\" <br>\r\n3. No sex or gore.<br>\r\n4. Do not kill off characters. Which also means no fatal popping(Popping but staying alive might be alright I guess)<br>\r\n5. AUs/Deviations from canon is fine, as is making plots based around the current canon. Just keep in mind some people may not be up to date on the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowed kinks/fetishes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat<br>\r\nWeight gain<br>\r\nStuffing<br>\r\nForce Feeding<br>\r\nAir inflation<br>\r\nWater inflation<br>\r\nBlueberry/Fruit inflation</td>",
