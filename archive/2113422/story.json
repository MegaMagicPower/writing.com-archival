You spend your time charting out the land, selling maps, and working on little contraptions when you have the money and or free time to do so. A Master of nothing, but knowledge of many things, you have also taken up the sword at some point in your life.  You have many the workings of what one would consider a rogue. You stand at roughly 5'7\" and resemble that of a young tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomeki;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Domeki. You are a demon with many eyes located on various parts of your body, most notably a third eye on your forehead. You have a few different powers but being a rather young demon, you have no idea how to use them. You are considered of adult age, as all demons spawned are born at an adult age. You have only been alive for a few weeks, and have already learned the harshness of hell. Being a demon of mostly good nature; your hope is to escape hell and find a place to live among mortals. You are 5'3\" and have tabby cat like features clashing with your demonic bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun had already risen to the east. It was high enough now that one could estimate the forest had betrayed you the light of day for perhaps an hour or so now. In front of the sun, halfway into the sky- you see what appears to be a rickety wooden bridge. Noting the location of the bridge passing through the sun, and looking to both side you see a; tall, rocky, jagged surface- you now realize that you are in a very wide chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way forward as you look up in wonder, turning back and taking in the sights. You can hardly make out the tree line above the shifted earth, but you can tell where the forest cuts off. You soon take off the backpack you had been wearing up until this point, and remove the map from it. You take a moment to draw a rough sketch of the area and return the map and pack to their original positions on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou progress through the chasm, and as time passes, the bridge you had seen earlier is right above you. Someone seems to have made their way down here before you, as you can see a considerably long rope leading nearly halfway up the chasm. Where it stops, you can make out an indentation at least big enough for 3 or 4 people to fit through. Further on ahead you can see bramble, leading into what looks like another forest. Right in front of that bramble however- appears to be a rock path leading right through it.</i></span></div></div>",

As you made your way through the bramble, and into what you thought was a forest- you saw large clearing. A large field stretches out in front of you, and resting in the center- is what looks to be an abandoned temple. Egyptian like Glyphs carved on left and right side of the entrance. You take a moment to examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou very quickly realize that you don't have any sort of knowledge about glyphs or deciphering them, and even less knowledge about the Egyptians. This of course was not going to stop you from exploring the temple. You step through the entrance and prepare yourself for the traps you were most certain lie ahead. You were pleasantly surprised to find that there weren't any- albeit a bit of a maze in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure how much time has passed since you have been here, but you feel as if you have made progress through the temple. You have been up for quite a long time now, and are debating on setting up camp. The temple seems to be uninhabited and you're near certain that no harm could come of it.

You make your way into a large circular room, and in the center of that room- rests a pedastal. On that pedastal, what looks like a hand rises from the center- gripping a bronze sphere. Perhaps some magical artifact, or some sort of lost technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the sphere and began to  reach for it, when you heard a voice from somewhere else near by. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" It was a females voice. The sound echoing off the wall tells you to walk into the room just beyond this one. Just around the corner you would see a rather large women leaning against a wall. just around the corner you would see a rather large women leaning against a wall. She wasn't just big either, she was about two feet taller than you, and she was built with a firm foundation- as well as being.. pink?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? And what are you doing in a place like this\" <i>You ask the large yet oddly colored Vixen.</i> \"I am the guardian of this temple. I am here to make sure no one does anything that they might regret.\" <i>She responded. You couldn't help but wonder how long she had been here. There didn't seem to be any light sources within the temple, and it was still a bit of a maze. She would have to leave this place once in awhile to gather food- wouldn't she? Were their other Temple guardians?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does someone manage to get a job title like that?\" <i>You ask.</i> \"You guard a temple.\" <i>She responds rather quickly, and after an awkward enough pause she speaks again.</i> \"-It's not a job that pays out. I do it because it is what the spirits of my ancesors requested that I see to. I wouldn't want to disrespect them\" <i>You arch an eyebrow, letting the words,</i> \"Talking to ghosts now are we?\" escape from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She steps forward and retrieves her glaive which you had not noticed beside her prior to this moment.</i> \"That's exactly what I did. Now that, that is out of the way- you must leave this place. gather your belongings and leave.\" <i>She haunches over a bit to meet you at eye level. And speaks again</i> \"Or you can fight me, and if you win- you're free to loot and pillage as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The way she had said that, it seemed like she wanted you to try and fight her. Perhaps she had grown bored here, but it's very clear who the victor would be if you took her up on that. A decision had to be made.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

But you also think that the quote unquote guardian you had spoken to had one too many screws loose. You decided you would swipe the relic from the center of the room provided the opportunity. It had to hold some sort of value, otherwise it wouldn't be here. After taking your time to examine the situation, you respond. \"I'll have to decline, I'll leave you and your temple in peace.\" She stands up straight, and retreats back against the wall she had been leaning on before simply saying, \"A shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back through the circular room, turning your head just enough to give you peripheral vision of the women behind you. She soon turned and made her way down the hallway nearest her. Was she not worried? Did she no longer care? Perhaps she wasn't a very good guardian. You couldn't make heads or tails of it. You continued to walk forward, and pulled the relic away from it's pedestal. What was left was the hand in the center, grasping towards nothing anymore- creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop staring and start walking out of the room and back into the maze. The moment you take that first turn she is in front of you, her chest hangs nearly just above you. She presses her hand into the back of your head, and lightly presses your face up against her upper stomach. She spoke,</i> \"You understand the mistake you have made don't you?\" <i>Your heart races, the little you do know about this woman, is that you believe her as crazy, which is not a good sign. Your pupils dilate as you try to look for a way out. You can't move your head much, and your vision is blocked  by stomach and boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released your head and spoke</i> \"While that artifact you hold may in fact be a treasure, it is also this temples only trap.\" <i>You take this moment to take a few paces back. Holding the sphere in your hands firmly keeping an eye on her, as well as the relic it's self after her comment.</i> \"What- exactly do you mean?\" <i>You say. She responds,</i> \"The moment you release that, your size will be reduced, the longer you hold it, the smaller you will be.\" <i>You let out a small rather nervous laugh,</i> \"You don't expect me to believe that do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what you believe. You have already held it for quite some time.\" <i>She said so as she folded her arms. You're on the verge of trembling as you speak,</i> \"And what will you do with me if I return this to you- will, you let me leave?\" <i>She sits down criss-cross, placing her glaive upon the floor.</i> \"You will be punished, for attempting to steal from my ancestors, you should expect nothing but that punishment for the remainders of your days. But I will not kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not you speaking is it- you seemed so nice before.\" You spoke. \"Before you stole from my temple! Now you are out of time.\" <i>She had placed a glove on while you were speaking, and quickly swiped the relic from you. She was not lying, you quickly shrank to near the size of an ant, if not perhaps a slight bit bigger. Your eyes widened as you stared up at the vixen which was nothing more than a curvy wall of pink at this point. All you could see was her legs crossed infront of you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She leans forward and stares down at your less so significant form. She speaks,</i> \"You should have released it quite some time ago, maybe then you wouldn't be presented with this dilema, but the time for choices is over, and your new life begins now.\" <i>She lifts you as you begin to shout and squirm within her grip. She could not hear you shout, although she could feel your struggles. She takes this time to wrap a thin yet thick string around your body several times making it near impossible for you to move in anyway that you would like to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be fun for me, as well as suitable punishment for you.\"  <i>She continues to wrap you with the  string, but she now wrapped it around a piece of her body which she had just lowered you to. You could make out where you were now, and the smell and feel was a definite reminder, you were now struggling between her toes- which she was tying you to. It didn't take her much time to finish either.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're snug.\" <i>She wiggled her toes about rolling you around and crushing you. Despite your size, you were quite durable, and perhaps that had something to do with what had shrunk you. Eitherway she seemed to be enjoying every moment of it, because she continued to do it for quite some time, though perhaps it was your squirming she was really enjoying. She soon brought her other foot into the mix, forcing you to the bottom of the toe, she rubbed you all over the sole of her other foot. To say the least, you were not having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time would not be your last. She would remove you from your prison daily- to eat, and to bathe. You would not get the chance to bathe, no- she used you to clean her feet- exclusively. Often she would make you scrub them down, but even more often she would simply lather you in soap and rub you into her soles, between her toes- she never missed a spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were all you were ever to touch, she decided this the moment you had shrank to your current size; this did not stop her from taunting you with other parts of her body on the rare occasion. She would flaunt her chest, rest it in front of you, place you between her legs adjacent to her loin cloth. She would dare you to make your move, to touch. She told you, if you were to do so, she would swallow you whole- and that would be the end of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you one day made that mistake, this was your life.</i></span></div></div>",

You remove the bedroll from your back and place it upon the ground, then examine the area you have chosen to sleep for the night. It's humid, warm, and fairly dark. The only reason that there is any light at all is due to small cracks in the top of the structure bleeding just enough moonlight in for you to make out your surroundings. The walls were a shade of tan, and upon further inspection seemed to be made of limestone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was made out of the same material, and seemed to be even more damaged than the roof. It cracked in several areas, and elevated unnecessarily in others; this revealed soil and  even grass in a few small areas. It surprised you that it had received enough sunlight to even grow in a place like this. After you felt you had done a thurough enough examination of the area, you adujusted your bedroll so that it was in a location in which it was able to lay flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with your work, you removed your pack and any semblence of armor on your person- then laid it to the side. Your stomach growls and you remember just how long it's been since you've last eaten, so you lean to the side once again as to retrieve the rations from your bag. You remove some of said rations, you eat them- and the rest of the night goes as you might imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie on your bedroll placing your arms behind your head as you stare up at the limestone ceiling. You didn't need a blanket tonight, it was warm enough to keep you mostly comfortable throughout the night- it was a shame you could do nothing about the humidity. Soon enough your eyes shut and your dreams take over; simple dreams, nothing worthy of remembering. And when you woke-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRRRRRAAAAASHH!</b> You  jump from your bed and turn quickly to see the light of day shining in and the nearby walls and ceilings crumbling. Something incredibly large and black has landed on the temple not too far from you. You can't quite  make out what it is, but that could be because you were in a bit of a stupor scrambling to your feet an running out of the temple. It wasn't too awful hard  as  the walls were crumbling down, but you did have to get quite a bit closer to the mysterious black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it out without any major damage, a few scuffs from chunks of falling rock. You had been extremely lucky that a larger piece had not fallen on you. You take a quick moment to examine the object a few feet in front of you; long, black, big, alive. It almost slithered, and you took a step back, only to turn your head and see that it was part of something much larger. You tilted your head back, and made out wings, a somewhat heavy-set body, and scales; what you were seeing slither before you just moments ago was a tail. It was clear to you now that this was a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you didn't fear many things, but you did fear dragons. You have heard tales of dragons eating people, destroying villages, hoarding the world's treasure. You had not heard a single good thing about a dragon your entire life, you had only heard that you should keep your distance from them, lest you end up on their plate. You had to move quickly, or you had to move silently, and you had to make up your mind quick.</i></span></div></div>",

Any chance of making a silent getaway was now gone, but you don't know if you could have kept quiet enough or out of the dragon's sight for long enough anyway. Things however, did not go quite as you had planned, the moment you had broken into your sprint and your feet colided with the ground- the dragon quickly turned and pinned you under her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you still had your swords, or any of your other equipment for that matter- at least then you could have tried to put up a fight, but now all you can do is squirm underneath the dragon's hand, which was blocking your view. You may have not noticed this due to your panic, but the dragon was not forcing you too roughly into the ground, just pressing firm enough to keep you pinned. That however, did not last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon coiled her fingers around your form and lifted you into the air. That ALSO, did not last long. The dragon speaks, \"What sort of creature have I stumbled on today.\" A female voice. Her fingers uncoil, once again exposing you to the light of day break. Now you were finally able to make out the dragon's form in it's entirety. You were not prepared for what you saw, she had an interesting face to say the least. She had no eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she lowered her face into into her palm and sniffed you thuroughly before licking you from head to toe. Up until this point you have remained silent, mostly from the fear coursing through your mind; but as she licks you, you stifle a groan caused by the pressure applied. You thank the stars that her breath didn't seem to have much of a smell despite that being the last thing to worry about at a time like this. Wearing only an undershirt and your boxers made this situation only that much more awkward for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire front of your body, as well as the slim amount of clothes that you have on are now rather damp. She had pulled her tongue back into her mouth, and seemed to be analyzing the taste- of course you could only assume this based on her lip and muscle movement. You take this time to readjust yourself and make small movements towards the edge of her hand- which she notices rather quickly and cups her hand ever so slightly to let you know.</i> \"Just a  kitten are we?

You turn your head back, only to keep an eye on the dragon- and to make sure it has not made any sudden moves. Feeling relieved that it hasn't yet, you continue your slow movements, but only for a moment! It has turned to face you, and just as you were about to bolt in the other direction, you were able to deduce quite a few things. Number one, this dragon- had no eyes- a mouth yes, a snout yes- but no eyes. Deduction number two, was that there was no way this dragon could actually see you. Deduction number three, this was not an ugly dragon- but a rather attractive female; albeit a little thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than to continue to run away, you begin testing your luck. You wave to the dragon, who was currently attempting to stand up. Seems like she had fallen on the temple, if not- than she was attempting to sit on it and it caved in.

If she couldn't see you, this was a great opportunity to sneak some peeks of dragon naughty bits- assuming you don't get stepped on in the process. By the time you have already made up your mind to do so, the dragon has stood up right, and is on the move. If you had to guess, she was around 70 feet tall give or take, you would have assumed a less were she still sitting. She was practically a titan, but that wasn't going to stop you, even if it did set you back a bit. You started to approach this creature that you were terrified of just moments ago, in hopes you might see something naughty. This struck you as somewhat shameful, but to hell with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hasn't moved much from the spot she stood- a little here and there- and when she did move she seemed to be examining her surroundings; sniffing at the air, bending over and feeling about at the ground. At least that was your first assumption. Maybe she lost something, maybe she was looking for something, or someone, or maybe even as you had assumed. It would make sense granted that she didn't have vision. You moved closer and closer, keeping your distance somewhat, you didn't want to get stepped on after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to see everything; tits shaking, the canyons, the valleys, the hills. Everything you would hope to see. From your position now, she was standing, looking the other way, back toward the temple. You have a perfect view of her ass from here- at least you would have if it weren't for that large tail swaying from side to side ever so slightly. You would have to get closer, and so you did little by little- until something seemed a little off. She dropped, not instantly, but close enough that you didn't have enough time to react before that ass came crashing down on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't dead, but you almost wished to be. You were in the right place at the wrong time, you've been completely contained by the tail hole of this giant dragoness. The worst part was that she didn't seem to notice at all, but perhaps that was good granted your perception of dragons. It was rather compact, and a somewhat unpleasant place to be, you couldn't imagine something like this happening in a million years, not to you. The odds were way too low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air in your lungs was knocked out the moment you were compacted into this place and you run out of air, you would have to breathe the air of this place, and try to conserve oxygen if you want to go unnoticed.

You've pulled yourself up into that little indentation- finding some make shift furniture. A bed, and a table with notes scattered upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould someone actually live in a place like this? it seemed like such a pain to scale up here. That is when your eyes were drawn to a small hallway carved in the rock. Further investigation revealed that there was an elevator fitted with pulleys and levers. You figure that this must lead the rest of the way up the chasm, which was very convenient to say the least. You make your way back into what could be considered the bedroom and begin examining the room. The first thing you notice is that the rope you were climbing was tied to a leg of the bed, and the bed has seemed to shift out of alignment with the rest of the room. Things could have gone way worse than they did.</span></div></div>",

Your senses and your movements scramble as your body is now attempting to wake up twenty times faster than it had intended. As you hit the earth below, you manage to weaken the collision a bit with your hands, though that didn't quite stop you from landing on your chest. You take a moment to catch your breath, and remind yourself of why you were in that tree in the first place. An indescribable monster had chased you up it at some point during the night, but now it would appear to be gone. You roll over onto your back as the heart rate caused by your rather unpleasant wake up begins to drop. Minutes pass with you merely laying there on the ground before you manage to push yourself up off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin making your way through the forest you are currently in. The constant sounds of the forest have you paranoid and the blue leaves of the trees block your vision of the red sky above. You weren't enjoying this isolation, but you enjoyed running into the larger demons quite a bit less. That being said the forest doesn't seem to stretch on for too much longer, and you can't quite decide on if that puts your mind at ease or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the end of the forest, you can make out a town in the distance- behind said town lies a rather large castle. You likely would have seen it a long time ago if it weren't for the trees blocking your vision. You know full well that there's going to be plenty of other demons there, likely powerful demons at that if you take into consideration the size of that castle. You would avoid all of them if you had the option to, but you haven't eaten in a few days now- and you hadn't noticed any sort of berry fruit or even mushroom on your way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can risk running into other demons in the town on your search for food, or you can simply hope you'll run into some eventually in another direction.</span></div></div>",

If it weren't for the castle standing firm in the background, you could almost say a bomb went off there; it was a mess. There's wreckage strewn about the place as well as partially destroyed buildings with what still appear to be tenants living in them. Regardless of the mess, there are still street vendors selling there goods, and other demons walking about casually as if the mess wasn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the town and enter from the side trying to stay out of vision. The demons here didn't look quite as hostile as the majority of such that you have seen up until this point, but that didn't mean you could trust them; they were still demon at their core. You do your best to avoid them, staying low to the ground an creeping around the wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but wonder why this place was in the condition that it was, and why no one seemed to be making any attempt at repair. You thought about that as you made your way around, for a little while anyway- and then your empty stomach's aches and pains soon reminded you of what you were doing here. You didn't exactly have money or the courage to approach the demons in town anyway, so you're first thought is to steal from the vendors. However this town is a bit bigger than you had originally thought, and you're not sure which way you should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Not too far from you, there's a building, that has a few pieces missing out of the sides and top. The roofing that's gone has been covered with what appears to be garbage bags. There is a sign above the doorway with a picture of bread on it, but you can't read the words beside the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Further into the town and ever closer to the castle, it looks incredibly busy- it seemed as if there was event going on. It struck your curiosity, but you were almost certain you wouldn't be able to keep your cover in such a populated area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;on the other hand, there is a street vendor not too far to your right, a large burly looking bull of a man stands in front of it, selling various kinds of demon fruit, if you were quick you could grab from his cart and make a clean get away.</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for you to get there, but you were also right on the money. There was no way you'd be able to maintain cover here, in fact several demons had already spotted you- but they also didn't seem to care. Your mind was at ease for now and you stepped out of the shadows and into the gathering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt a small tremor in the earth, and it's power would steadily increase for the next 10 seconds or so before what was causing the tremors was clear as day. A gigantic demon unlike any you had seen before stands in the center of crowd. Your eyes widen in awe, and perhaps a little bit of fear. Was this the reason for the town's condition right in front of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a black furred canine wearing a rather unconventional chain mail bikini. The creature had 3 heads and was attempting to quietly argue back and forth with it's self. It was doing a surprisingly good job at being quiet despite it's size, as you weren't able to make out anything other than a little sighing and growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure there was enough room, she dropped to the ground and sat with her legs and her arms crossed. The central head soon began to speak. \"We called everyone here today for one reason. We're looking for one demon, and one only. For what we can not tell you the purpose, but know that it is a great honor, and you will be taken care of if you are chosen. Please try to organize yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trust wavers as she speaks and you begin to doubt that you should be where you are. She is quite large, and with 3 heads, a vision radius longer than you could hope of bypassing. You worry what might happen if you try to leave, but you also don't want to stick around and get chosen for whatever this great honor is.</span></div></div>",

You begin to make your way through the crowd and back toward the more empty side of town. Some people are shuffling about the crowd, but the fact that you are moving to the far end of the crowd has caught the attention of one of the giant demon's heads- her left head to be precise. That head begins whispering to the central head, and soon after you would feel a gust of wind hit your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have made our decision.\" speaks the central head. You turn to see the giant standing once more. You get the feeling that the gust of wind was caused by her standing up, you couldn't imagine what else could have done it. Nevertheless the giants gaze, or rather gazes, seemed to be set on you. Not a moment later she raises her hand  and points directly at you. You take a step back. You were at a loss. your eyes scouring the crowd. You hoped that she was pointing at someone directly beside you. But that hope was dashed the moment people made room for you. Center stage, the giant cups her hands around you, and lifts you high high into the air. She adjusts her hands and places you in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning far back, eyes wide, you stare at you captor. She stares at you too. The center head seems unsure. One side seems particularly upset, you would even venture to say angry. The other, her eyes sparkle, she is clearly, very happy- ecstatic even. The center head, speaks once more. \"Everyone else may return to their dwellings and enjoy the day.\" While the center head speaks, the happy side on the left has brought her snout to palm of her hand... and then, lick.. lick.. lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head on the right speaks loudly, almost yells at the head on the left \"Can you at least wait until we get back home?!\" using her hand to force that head up and out of the palm you were now laying on your back in- covered in spit. \"Of- course I can, I just don't want to!\" Shouts happy. You try to raise yourself up and get a look around, and Cerberus begins to move- most likely on her way home. Which from what you could make out while she was moving- was that castle behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long passes, and you're almost shaking in fear as she carries you through this large castle. Eventually she comes to a stop and places you on a bed, atop a very soft blanket no less. She then haunches over so that all heads are now level with you. The central speaks. \"First, what is your name little.. eye demon?\" You utter your name, \"..Domeki-\" as you stumble backwards and catch yourself. You then take a knee- because the soft surface on top of your current state of dizziness caused by being lifted so high into the air is not a great mix. Being unsure and worried about everything taking place certainly wasn't helping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe central head speaks up once more. \"Scared are you? That's fine, you have every right to be. It's not every day that Cerberus chooses a servant.\" The other 2 heads chime in. \"A slave!\", \"A pet!\" and then the center returns to speaking. \"..As you can see it's not too hard to understand our personality. It is nice to meet you Domeki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything she had said, she still managed to come off as.. friendly? Friendly for a demon anyway. She still just wanted a servant. The center head speaks again. \"I promised that these two could have their turns with you first.\" You raised your voice- \"Turns with me?! Doing what?\" She gives a very faint smile, \"We'll be learning a lot about each other.\" She pulls a large gold coin from atop her dresser. \"You call it. Heads or tails. If it lands on what your choice, you may start with the safer of the 2.\" You  stare at the coin, and then her, and then the coin once more.. \"Right.. now?\" You spoke. And she replies, \"Yes, right now.\"</span></div></div>",

She doesn't even bother to reveal it. She just gives a small chuckle. \"It would appear you've won the coin toss. You'll get to spend the day learning about this side of me.\" She gives the happy looking head a pat, and in return her eyes shine and her smile grows quite wide. \"Yes! Yes! I didn't think I could wait any longer!\" She was very energetic to say the least. The center head speaks- \"You know where we'll be if you need us.\" The other heads disappear, placing happy at the center... Happy, which is what you were now calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we begin! There's so much to do!\" She says as she lifts you up off the bed. You're wide eyed for sure, you have no idea what she has in mind, While she didn't seem the most normal -as that was clearly the central head- she did seem to be the most safe out of the options. You speak up, \"Do- I get a say in this?\" She stifles a chuckle, \"Of course you do. What would you like today.\" What a relief you thought, she's reasonable. You say, \"It would be nice, if I could get something to eat, and maybe clean myself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both easy fixes. I'm sure we can do something about that hunger.\" She places you down on the bed again for just a moment and removes her chain mail bra, picking you up again once she has placed it on the bed. \"You know where this is going don't you?\" You were once again worried, red faced, nervous, all kinds of things. This shouldn't be something out of the ordinary, because it's very common as is for demons to walk around hell naked anyway. Most demons wore little to no clothes at all. You yourself had only been wearing a pair of shorts this entire time. But something about the size, and what she was suggesting, and the fact that she did actually remove clothing, just wasn't a good mix. You shake your head and try to return your focus. You don't quite regain it, and you shout, \"You want me to do what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to drink my milk! There's plenty, and you have cat like features. Cats enjoy milk don't they? So drink up.\" She presses your face firmly against her nipple. It was still somewhat soft but quickly hardening and forcing your head back bit by bit. You didn't have too much of a choice here, you were likely going to end up doing this at one point or another if you were stuck with her anyway, might as well get it over with, and after all you were still quite hungry. She eventually felt you making progress and drinking, she giggled uncontrollably for almost half a minute, and you were drinking for maybe 2. Not because you wanted to at that point, but because it was quite difficult to pull your mouth up off of that nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done now? And you said you wanted to get clean next\" You spoke, \"I- yes please?\" You hoped she wouldn't come up with a ridiculous and or sexual way of getting you clean, like she did with feeding you. You didn't know what to expect after that. She responds,\"Alright then, we're going to have to remove these!\" She holds you gently in one hand and tugs your shorts down and off with the other. If you weren't blushing before, you were now. You shout, \"I could have taken them off myself!\" And she responds with, \"Where's the fun in that?\" Letting out a little laugh she returns to speaking, \"I know a little bit about how you cats bathe too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins licking all over you, much like she had been earlier, only this time you were completely naked- which made it feel- quite a bit... different. You couldn't keep things covered too long as she was thorough and little rough with her tongue. Eventually your dick was at full mast from the constant attention. She couldn't help but giggle.. again. It was something you were getting quite used to hearing from her already. \"Let me help you out with that.\" She then focused all of her licking directly on your package, and after some time, it took it's toll, and you finished on her tongue. This was the first time you had ever felt anything like that, despite being born at an adult age, you were still quite young. \"What- just- happened?!\" Just slips out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes wide eyed herself there for a moment then responds, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were a virgin- nothing to do about it now though. Lets get you dressed.\" You ask, \"I- can't just have my shorts back?\" She gives off a sly smile you don't quite like and responds, \"Of course not, I bought all kinds of little outfits, of course we weren't sure if who we chose would be a boy or a girl when we chose them... Or how big they would be for that matter. It's alright! You can try a few things on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you back on the bed. She then pulls a large bundle of clothes of about your size and of various designs from on top of her dresser. You ask, \"You were planning this for quite some time then?..\" She responds, \"Of course!\" She ties a little ribbon up in your hair. \"What are you doing?...\" She responds, \" Getting you dressed! Now spread your legs.\" She stretches out a little pair of panties in front of you. You take a moment and stare at them, and then her before saying something about it. \"I am not putting those on! I've only seen women wear those. There is no way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls back for a second and says, \"Come on- do it for me. Please?\" and you quickly respond, \"NO! No way!\" She pouts for a second then smiles and says, \"You can put them on yourself or I can put them on you and then let my other head have her turn with you. She'd probably get a kick out of seeing you that way. She's like that.\" Your pupils couldn't get any smaller if they tried and you reply, \"You.. aren't serious about that are you.\" She replies, \"You can always test me\" and  then she sticks her tongue out and winks.</span></div></div>",

A hand large enough to grab you in your entirety juts out out of the portal, and does just that. You don't even have the time to scream, much less move out of the way. You're reduced to squirming and shouting in the vice grip.The hand quickly retracts through the portal pulling you into that blinding light. After your eyes are given a moment to adjust, you notice a few different things. One, the hand currently gripping you was blue, and very smooth. Two, you could make out a bed and a dresser from between an opening between your captors fingers. It was safe to say it was their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers unwrap as the giant turns their palm over. You lye on your back and stare up at what was now revealed to you as a female shark. A very, very big female shark, and not a stretch to say that she was an attractive one either. Despite her intimidating height, she was rather lithe. She stares down at you with wide eyes, and mutters, \"I can't believe that worked. I-\" She speaks up, \"I mean! Uh- hello little demon- person..\" Now your eyes were also quite wide at this point; though not exactly for the same reason- but because as she continued to talk her face continued to lower until her face was just about prodding your entire body. You respond \"I'm- uh, I'm fine thank you. Who, and what exactly are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a goddess.. Or well, a Demi-goddess anyway. Same difference. You can call me Ashe. What do they call you.\" You keep still but take this time to look side to side before responding \"It's.. Domeki.. And.. you are treating this a little too casually. Not that I'm complaining! I was just pretty sure you godly types, didn't much like demons.\" She lifts her head, so as that her face isn't practically buried in you anymore before speaking. \"Most don't. I think they're kind of cute. I was looking for my own personal demon, and I think you fit the part.\" She stares down at you once more for quite some time, a pink blush slowly brightening her face. It was that combination of incredibly worrisome and incredibly awkward tension running through that sent a bit of a chill down your spine. You could only imagine what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \"I- What exactly do you mean by your own personal demon?\" She shakes her head snapping out of her trance and replying. \"I'll show you exactly what I mean.\" She gives off a big toothy grin, and lowers you to her groin, where you can make out her white panties, and what exactly they mask. A pulsing cock rises up and out of the top of said panties, but is once again covered by the loose white t-shirt she is wearing. You start to speak as she brings you closer to it. \"Hang on a minute! What Why- do you have- gck\" Before you manage to piece together a sentence she presses you somewhat firmly into the shaft, and ever so slowly rubs you into it, and under that shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, this thing needs all kinds of attention. That's where you come in.\" She continues to rub you against her already mostly hardened member, before lowering you down into the front of her underwear where you are met with the lower half of the shaft, and some big soft orbs- neither of which seemed to want to give you much of any breathing room, forcing you up against the cottony material. She sticks a finger in and lifts the material enough for you to both move, and look up to see her face; which held a much much brighter shade of blush than it had before. She retained that somewhat awkward stare for quite some time again before speaking. \"...So yuh know.. Get to work.\"</span></div></div>",

She then releases the fabric, smacking you back in to the underside of her cock and testes. She places her finger on your back from the outside of her pantie fabric and in slow rhythmic movements rubs you into her sack. There was a bit of a smell to the dick, but here it was quite a bit more noticeable- and a little moist. \"I think it's the perfect place for you.\" She chuckles. It was made clear to you then that the reason she didn't look so disappointed, is because she didn't really care if you thought this was the place for you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released you after a good half a minute of forcing you up against her flesh orbs, but that didn't really mean much. That was where she was focusing you, and thus you have shifted to the underside of them. Being pinned between them and the stretched cotton material was not the greatest of positions, you had to hold the flesh up so it didn't suffocate you, but it would constantly shift, so you had to as well. Of course you didn't have to worry about this too long. She spoke up, \"Keep struggling down there. Since you're not comfortable with everything just yet, you'll have to start there, and after a few days- or whenever hormones kick in, you can move on to the shaft. But until then-\" She takes a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her, this was just a seat, for you- the ground was now suddenly a lot more firm- and the weight of those testes came crashing down on you. Her balls completely smothered you, and any hope you had of fighting them back began to vanish, they were quite a bit heavier now and you were already fatigued.

She notices fairly quickly, as you hear a quiet, \"ouch \" from under her. She stands back up releasing some of the tension for a moment and giving you some breathing room. Once again you are forcing the testes up and off of yourself, but that doesn't last long. Her hand has come to retrieve you from your cotton and flesh prison. She grabs you firmly, pulling you up and out before opening her palm, which you were now sitting in. You staring back at her once more. She speaks, \"What the hell was that about?!\" To which you reply, \"I couldn't breathe!\" She pauses for just a moment and reply's, \"That makes sense. But you could have just said so. I can hear you from anywhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves you closer to her maw and gives you a lick. \"I could hear you from all the way in the bottom of my stomach. Or underfoot, or in your case\" *She moves you away from here mouth and lowers you back till you are once again in front of her panties. Not a moment later you are tied firmly to the bow that you had seen there prior. If you were to look up, you could see her hard cock forced up against her stomach- going under her shirt. If you looked at just the right angle you could see her boobs too. Easier said than done with that mushroom head in the way. She speaks once more, \"I guess even those were too much for you on day one. So we'll just get you accustom to being near and on it first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick to reply yourself, \"That sounds better to me.\" Though you wish you hadn't. It felt inevitable that you would soon have to fight that monster. She lets out a small laugh, and walks to the mirror in her room, now speaking, \"You sure do make interesting apparel. By the way- do you think this outfit makes me look.. curvy?\" You don't know what outfit she was talking about, you could only make out a shirt that was a little too large for her, and the underwear you were currently tied to. You could however make out that the shark goddess you were speaking to was masked in blush. Her expression now seemed nervous, or possibly embarrassed if anything.</span></div></div>",

What was one a look of near embarrassment was now a look of annoyance. She speaks \"I changed my mind.\" She pulls you out of the lace strapping you to the front of her panties, being a bit rough with you now. \"I think we can acquaint you a whole lot sooner.\" She places your head firmly against her dick hole and begins fitting you through the hole. You of course begin to panic, squirming and trying to explain yourself- which is not working to well granted your head is in a giant cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer natural blush and smile now restored she begins sliding the rest of your body in, slowly yet surely your body begins sliding into that cock on it's own. It's at this point Ashe lays back on her bed and lets gravity take over from here, well- more or less. She has takin' her hand and placed it on the lump that is you traveling down her cock; because of this your descent into tight moist cavern has stopped. She then toys around with you, pushing it back up and down for a few moments before simply lightly rubbing the lump, and helping it on it's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually land in her cum filled sack. Mostly cum filled anyway. Standing straight up means the mess you are standing in just reaches your stomach. You use the time you have now to make your way to the walls of the sack- pressing your hands up against it and shouting at your captor, \"Ashe! Please! This isn't funny! I didn't mean it like that! Let me out of here!\". She responds by also pressing her hand into her sack and and against you. The pressure on her testes causes the level of her cum to rise to chest level; only that didn't matter just this moment because her hand had also knocked you back causing you to slosh around in the white liquid and swallow a bit of it before managing to surface. You shout once more, \"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she responds this time. \"Calm down! I won't leave you in there. But you're going to stay down there for awhile alright? You said something stupid and now you're being punished for it, that's how it works.\" Your remain quiet, you find it hard to argue with that logic, and then she continues to speak. \"Tell you what though. I'll make you a deal. I've been walking around all day, so my feet have gotten a little dirty. I'll let you out if you agreed to clean them.\" You open your mouth to speak, and just as you do she shifts again and you are once again swimming deep in sperm, surfacing once more, that helps you to make your decision. \"That sounds a whole lot better than this!\" She speaks again, \"With your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now at a loss.</span></div></div>",

You were saying this because it was what you thought she wanted to hear, and apparently you were right. That being said, it was also your belief, she was beautiful- save for the giant cock still looming over you anyway. But you figured it best to keep that to yourself. She turns her head to the side, trying to prevent you from making out her clear embarrassment- a bit too late mind you. She twiddles her fingers as she speaks, \"You think I'm beautiful?\" You were surprised at how quick your compliment had taken effect, and you didn't know whether to be worried about the effect or not, but you said, \"Yes\"  anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou world seemed to shift, and even cloud up for a minute; the next thing you knew you were sitting in front of Ashe, roughly the same size as her, -she sits about a half a foot taller- and atop her bed. In hindsight, maybe beautiful was too big a word, maybe you should have used the word cute. She just examines you for a little while, keeping a very awkward tension in the air. Before too long passes she edges herself forward and over top of you- forcing you to fall back onto the bed. At this point, you are very nervous, curious to where this was going, and also very worried. \"Don't be afraid\", you hear her say. Then she falls forward and wraps her arms around you- snuggling herself into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs were on both sides of your face, firm, warm- very nice feeling. Which contrasted greatly with that cock of hers you could feel lightly rubbing against your stomach. You weren't sure how you felt about this, for a moment anyway. After some deep thought, you cared a little less about that dick being there, at least while she was embracing you like this. It was a comfort unlike much else you had felt before. Soon enough you were hugging her back, the both of you now on your sides enjoying the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime would pass, and eventually you could make out that she was sleeping, if you really wanted to attempt an escape now was the time. If you wanted to simply look around now was the time too. You imagine it being very stupid to escape into a world of gods as a demon, and worried that there might also be someone else in this home. Staying and enjoying what you have going now could be your best option.</span></div></div>",

Separating yourself from her grip you start looking around her room. It looks like any typical room; there's a mirror, a dresser, a bed, and a door out- nothing out of the ordinary. The one thing that did catch your attention while you were looking around was an easel. There was a large sketchpad resting on it, and being the curious individual you are, you begin to look through it. The art in the sketchpad is all very well done, mostly pornographic, but very well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure how you feel about what you see. There's pictures of her fucking small towns and villages, and a few were simply an individual she was playing with- similar to the way in which she was playing with you. Not all pictures were of her though, even if they did reflect similar content. It was now safe to say, if it wasn't before, that this goddess was very hyper sexualized. You couldn't help but wonder if some of these pictures were based on prior events, you couldn't say for sure, but based on her personality so far- you would guess, yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the journal you start looking around her room again. You decide to investigate the contents of her dresser. When you open up the top drawer, surprise surprise- it's filled with underwear; from frilly, to naughty, to the most basic. You can make out the corner of picture frame from beneath her panties. Pulling the frame out of the undergarments you examine the picture within the frame. It looks like a family photo. Ashe looks a little bit younger in this picture, she's standing in front of an orange cat and a wolf with a golden color to her fur. Could they be her parents? Neither of them were a shark. Either way, they looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you wanted to get into my underwear you could have just asked.\" You hear Ashe speak, and you drop the picture back in the pile of underwear, reactively shutting the dresser in the process as you turn to face her. She's sitting up on the bed looking at you and rubbing an eye. </span></div></div>",

Your hands are pressed into the edge of the dresser, twiddling. After a small pause she speaks again, \"Well, it's not really a problem, but like I said, you could have just asked.\" She stands up off of the bed and peals off her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment later and she was rubbing her cock; wrapping her underwear around it, and using it as a sort of makeshift condom. It didn't take long for her to get done what she was trying to do. She creams, all over the front innards of her prior undergarment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished now, she takes a step or two forward and places her panties right over your head- so that the crotch is right over your nose. A sticky substance covering the front of your face, and you know full well what it is. You begin to stumble, you almost fall over, the smell is rather strong and overpowering your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up, to pull them off of your head, but she grabs your wrist. It was a firm grab, not tight, but enough to stop you from reaching for it. \"Don't take them off, I think it's a cute punishment for snooping around in there. If you try to take them off again before the punishment is over, I'll shrink you back down and stick you in that mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all you needed to hear. She let go of your hand and you placed it once again on the desk, and just stared back at her, as she stared back down toward you a bit. She gives a small chuckle and simply says, \"Good.\" A moment or so passes, and then she sticks her hand in your shorts, grabbing at your already hard cock. Boy would you love to say it wasn't though.</span></div></div>",
