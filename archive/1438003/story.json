The male Ice Climber grinned: \"Ness, my friend, I can control ICE. I know how to keep myself cool. See, the ability to control ice allows me and my girlfriend to control our body temperature. Of course, you can't get... dis... tract... ted...\" Popo's voice trailed off as he saw Nana (the female Ice Climber) and Paula (Ness's girlfriend) standing nearby, giggling in bikinis. Immediately, the ice crystal that had been forming in his hand melted, and he felt the heat rush back. \"Did it suddenly get hot here?!?\" he asked, taking off his hood. \"C'mon.\" said Ness, with sly smirk, \"Let's go find you some trunks.\" <br>\r\nMario, Luigi, and Peach kept looking suspiciously at Bowser, despite his insistence that he would not be having his son use that E.Gadd paintbrush (and, anyway, that contraption hadn't been seen since the events of Super Mario Sunshine). <br>\r\nPikachu looked around and noticed a strange glow nearby. He hurried over to the glow and found an odd egg. <br>\r\nKirby was speaking with Chef Kawasaki for dinner. \"Now remember: NO spicy curry!\" \"Extra-spicy curry, got it.\" \"No, NO spicy curry!!!\" <br>\r\nAnd finally, Morton, the NME salesman (not in Brawl) was desperately trying to find a way to increase investments in the company (profits were down in the company after Kirby and his friends masticated the HQ). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It almost seemed unreal \u2013 how much of her life was spent on some godforsaken assignment on some inhospitable planet, working \u2013 or worse, fighting for her life? Admittedly things had been considerably less stressful during her Smash Brothers time, but it was still work. She honestly wasn\u2019t even sure how to handle herself without some job to do \u2013 it had been so long since she\u2019d had a chance to relax in earnest. Maybe even nearly as long ago as the last time she\u2019d had a smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samus looked down at the drink in her hand. Maybe it was weird to be so invested in this, but Samus had always been a weird one. She\u2019d been looking forward to it the whole way over, and as soon as they had gotten everything settled she\u2019d gone looking for a place that sold them. Others had pointed out that she could have gotten one at the airport \u2013 on either end \u2013 but they didn\u2019t understand. It had to be just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first time she\u2019d ever had the magical crushed-ice beverage was the summer after her first year at the academy (well, it had been summer on that planet, anyway). That had been such a wonderful, innocent time, before life had decided to try and beat as much happiness out of her as it could. She\u2019d had <i>friends</i> then. Well, OK, that wasn\u2019t really fair to the other Smashers, but that was different. She liked all her fellow Nintendo characters well enough (except for Fox \u2013 <i>screw</i> Fox), but she\u2019d always felt like an outsider among them. That summer had been a time when she\u2019d really belonged somewhere. That summer had been a lot of things to her, actually, which is why the smoothie was so important. It represented those days; a last link to a time when she\u2019d been happiest. One sip would bring all that back again, she was certain. Not that she\u2019d told anyone else any of this, of course. As far as they knew, she just really wanted a smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And now she had one, in her hand, its straw beckoning her lips like a lover\u2019s kiss (ooh, that was a good one. She should write that down). She tried to recall the taste in her mind, but it was just a faded memory now. A faded memory of a fruity sensation. Samus knew that she\u2019d waited too long already. She brought it up to her face \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPIKAAAAA!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samus whipped around to see the small yellow pokemon barreling toward her with a look of panic she\u2019d rarely seen outside of battle. Immediately she tensed up, instincts preparing her for a fight. Something had spooked Pikachu badly, it seemed, and that didn\u2019t bode well for her either. Samus was wondering just what sort of terrible monster might be about to make an appearance when she noticed something else: flames were coming out of Pikachu\u2019s mouth. <i>What on Earth\u2026</i> Perhaps that was the reason for Pikachu\u2019s distress, instead. Something about it did seem familiar\u2026 The word \u2018curry\u2019 had just crept into her mind when Pikachu was on her. Samus quickly dodged, but not quite quick enough: with a look of desperate, crazed desire, Pikachu snatched the smoothie from her hand. Samus felt the bottom of her stomach fall out as the horrible creature ripped the lid from her precious, cool drink and drained the cup in what seemed to be one foul gulp. For a second, he looked as sick as she felt. Then his cheeks ballooned and he let out a tremendous belch (Samus didn\u2019t even know Pikachus could burp).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAAAUUGHHH! You @#$&amp;*, &amp;^*#\u2019#%\u2019\u2019 ^&amp;^@#%@#@ little RAT!\u201d she heard herself say. But it was too late. Pikachu was on his back, groaning, his face an unhealthy color as steam rose from his mouth. Already it was hard to stay mad at the little guy; he really looked sick. Doubtless it had something to do with whatever had lit that fire in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2026Damn it,\u201d Samus muttered to herself. Maybe she couldn\u2019t stay mad at Pikachu, but damned if she couldn\u2019t be mad in general. She had lost her smoothie, the thing she\u2019d been looking forward to for hours, and now she\u2019d have to go all the way back to that little shop and get another one. Well, no sense in waiting, then. After making sure Pikachu was at least not dying, Samus headed back towards the shop where she\u2019d bought her frozen drink (but not before picking up the empty cup, lid, and straw and throwing them all away. Remember, kids: Sakurai says DON\u2019T LITTER). Little did she know what awaited her on her journey\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What the eff are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the smash crew had jumped at the chance to take a vacation together, a few had declined. The mysterious loner Meta Knight had been one of them. So the little round warrior was one of the last people Samus had expected to see here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was never my intention to imply that I would not be present, only that I would not be traveling with your party\u201d, said Meta Knight. \u201cI saw no reason to take public transportation when I had better means available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus assumed he was referring to his ship, the <i>Halberd</i>. A few of the others had spaceships; in fact, Samus herself had one that she could summon at any time, but the others had all taken the plane to enjoy the company of their fellow smashers. Although, after the 7-hour flight, Samus could understand why someone might have passed on the plane ride. And where the others\u2019 ships were all fairly small, Meta Knight\u2019s was a huge battleship. Why would anyone take a normal plane when they had that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026where did you park your ship?\u201d Samus asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it at the airport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch things are of no concern to me\u201d, Meta Knight said dismissively. \u201cI merely set it down on a nice patch of land on the island\u2019s other side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d Samus wondered what the local authorities might say about that. \u201cDoes anyone else know you\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the first I have encountered. But now that I have arrived, I shall make my presence known soon enough!\u201d Meta Knight ended his statement with a dramatic flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Meta Knight added at last, \u201cWhat\u2026what exactly will we be doing? Will there be surfing? I have never surfed. Exactly what does it entail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been on a vacation before, have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-not as such, no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, <b>I\u2019m</b> going to go get a smoothie. You can come along if you want, but don\u2019t think that means I\u2019ll be paying for both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeta Knight thought for a moment. \u201cHmmm\u2026yes\u2026yes, maybe I shall. I shall have this \u2018smoothie\u2019 you speak of. Let us make haste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlikely pair headed down the street together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These poor saps really have no idea what\u2019s in store for them!\u201d He grinned. \u201cWell, they\u2019d better have fun while they can, because this vacation is about to take a disastrous turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s in place, Roy!\u201d shouted Bowser Junior, interrupting his gloating. \u201cPhase one of the Evil Plan is ready to go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit, Junior!\u201d cried an exasperated Roy. \u201cI told you not to use my name! Now my secret identity won\u2019t be a secret anymore! I had a big dramatic reveal planned and everything and you just ruined it, Gawh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, dude. But really I only ruined it for the readers, you know? The other Nintendo characters still don\u2019t know that you\u2019re here or anything, so you can still reveal it to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d, sulked the rejected Fire Emblem character, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the same!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyway, I just wanted to let you know that everything\u2019s all set up and everyone else is ready to go. We\u2019re ready when you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy recovered from his moping as quickly as he could. \u201cFine. Good.\u201d He paused. \u201cI mean, uh\u2026 excellent,\u201d he added, rubbing his hands together again in what he hoped was a suitably villainous pose. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just for me. This is for everyone they wouldn\u2019t let into Brawl! This is our payback!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiiii!!\u201d Pichu interjected, enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell everyone it\u2019s time to start\u201d, Roy said to Bowser Jr. as they slunk off toward the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do. Say, did I ever tell you I have a brother named Roy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You\u2019ve told me almost every single day since we first met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPichu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
