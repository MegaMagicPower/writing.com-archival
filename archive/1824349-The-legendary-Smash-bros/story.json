He saw the primids attacking the smash mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic beat up some of the primids as he made his way to the mansion. He noticed that a lot of the heroes were missing. He then thought (Those primids must have taken the others.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked around and found an unusual trophy. It was a vixen wearing a blue jump suit with her hand in her fur. Sonic touched the trophy stand and the vixen start waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"I know you. Fox told me about you.\" The vixen then says \"Did you say Fox?\" Sonic then asks \" Yeah. So what happened here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen thought about it and replied \"We were talking about the next tournament we were going to do but then those weird things attacked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then said \"Those were primids.\" The vixen looked at him and was suddenly mesmerized by his eyes. Sonic notices this and asks \"Is there something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen replies \"No. Not at all.\" Sonic then asks \"But we need to find the others.\" The vixen then asks \"Did you see Fox?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic replied \"Nope. You're the only one I found at the moment. I'm going to search this place some more.\" The vixen then says \"I'll search too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic nodded and search the mansion alongside the vixen but found nothing. Sonic then says \"Damn it! If only i got here faster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen replies \"Don't beat yourself up. You didn't know we were under attack.\" Sonic sighed and said \"You're right. We should go looking in other places instead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen says \"By the way, my name is Krystal. What's yours?\"  Sonic replied \"The name's Sonic. Sonic the hedgehog!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Krystal then ran across the plains in search of the others but someone was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then yawns and says \"I'm bored! I need to do something!\" Roy was in Pherae castle his father left him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was trying hard to forget about his short time in Smash world but he couldn't forget the adventures he had with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't leave because the kingdom needed him. Roy then heard the door open and Lilina came and asked \"Why do you look sad Roy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy simply replied \"There's nothing to do here. The different nations are getting along fine now and it's been peaceful ever since.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina then says \"I know what you mean. It's pretty hard to stay calm when this land has had its share of attacks in the past.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then says \"I'm thinking about going to smash world to see how the others are doing.\" Lilina get mads and says \"Roy! You can't leave! The people need you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighs and says \"I know but I can't help it. I miss those days.\" Lilina then says in a apologetic voice \"I'm sorry. I've been on edge ever since that uprising a few weeks back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then says \"No. It's okay. I need to protect everyone so I can't just get up and leave.\" Lilina then says \"I wish there was a way to let you go to smash world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice says \"I think you should go.\" Roy looks up and sees Marcus walking in. Roy then says \"You heard that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nods and says \"It's always good to have a little fun.\"  Roy then asks \"But weren't you the one who said that my responsibility comes first before anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus replies \"I did but if all you do is sit around and mope then the morale of everyone will go down.\" Roy then says \"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus then says \"Don't worry. I may be old but I still fight! If anything happens while you're away, I'll take care of it.\" Roy looked at his mentor and said \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus simply replies \"Don't mention it. You still have your youth. Have your fight and come back a stronger leader then before.\" Roy then says \"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then rode a horse to the temple of seals and stood before the sword of seals. Roy then says \"I never thought I would draw it out again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy pulled it out and rode to the gate that Master hand left in case he decided he wanted to rejoin the fight. Roy opens the gate and sees Smash world before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then says to himself \"It's been a long time.\" Roy then jumped off the horse and ran inside but another figure ran through the gate just as it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow could be seen as it moved about. The figure kept moving as a lot of rustling was occurring behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure then says \"I hope that there are people here who would like my singing.\" The figure then started moving again as it jumped from tree to tree to avoid any pursuers.          </span></div></div>",

Do tell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then starts by saying \"Well I loved Fox and he loved me back and our love grew with each mission we undertook.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"So what happened? How did you fall apart? Fox never explained that part to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then says \"Probably because he was ashamed of it. I'll tell you once we find a safe place to rest.\" Sonic then saw a place to set up camp and says \"Let's rest at that tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set up near the tree as they look about for primids. Krystal then says \"Fox got worried about me and said that the life of the leader of Star fox is dangerous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then completes the statement by saying \"So he pushed you away to protect you?\" Krystal nodded and Sonic thought (That's what I'm doing to...) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"I'm guessing you didn't take it well.\" Krystal then says \"More like it broke my heart. I couldn't be near him after that but then the Anglar invasion happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"So what happened then?\" Krystal then replies \"I joined Star wolf, who were team Star fox's rivals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then exclaims \"What were you thinking!? They were your rivals! How could you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal then replies \"I was hurt back then! Because of Fox, I didn't think it all the way though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then got quiet after hearing that and Krystal continued with \"When I ran into Fox again, some part of me wanted to forgive him but my other part wanted nothing to do with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"So did you forgive him?\" Krystal then says \"Yes. I did but...the guilt I felt from doing what I did wouldn't go away and eventually...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"It overwhelmed you. You couldn't live with abandoning your previous life right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal simply nodded and said \"I owed it to Wolf and the others for helping through what happened with fox. So I couldn't toss them away and I made a hard choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic stayed silent for the next part. Krystal then says \"I left him to live my life with Wolf and the others. I guess you say I was the strongest member of Star fox that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"You thinking about visiting him every now and then?\" Krystal replies \"No. I couldn't tease him like that. I'm going to stay with Star Wolf and live my new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then walks away for a minute and then walks back and says \"I won't tell you how to live your life but at least visit Fox just to let him know you're okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiles and says \"I could do that or I could send him letters so that I don't have to encounter him again even though I know we'll run into each other one day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"Good. He'll probably be happy that you'll at least send him something.\" Krystal then says \"Yeah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a person appears and Sonic exclaims \"Who's there!?\" The person then says \"Wait!

Why bring an army if they were going to do it themselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then replies \"I'm not sure but we better figure out why the primids are back.\" Sonic then asks \"But who's this person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange person then turns to them and says \"Thank you for helping me.\" Sonic then says \"But that didn't answer my question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange person then says \"Oh! I'm sorry. My name is Lilina. I'm looking for my husband.\" Sonic then asks \"Husband?\" Lilina then replies \"Yes. His name is Roy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then says \"Roy? Where have i heard that name before?\" Sonic starts thinking about it but Lilina then says \"I'm sorry but I must hurry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina starts wandering off but Sonic stops her and asks \"Where are you going?\" Lilina replies \"To find my husband.\" Sonic then asks \"Then why don't we search together?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilina then says \"Well...you did save me so I guess I can let you help.\" Lucas then says \"I'll go with you too!\" Lilina then says \"I guess that's okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then asks \"So what does your husband look like?\" Lilina replies \"He has red hair, blue armor, and a sword that's infused with fire magic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then says \"Got it. Let's head back. Lilina then says \"Back?\" Sonic then says \"I have more heroes with me. We'll let them help us out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then says with an surprised expression \"You found others!?\" Sonic then says \"Yeah. So let's meet up with them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed back to the camp that he and Krystal set as someone mysterious person arrives at the outpost. The person says \"That hedgehog is interfering with our plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the other end says \"Don't worry. They weren't really important anyways. The plan can still work without them.\" The mysterious person then says \"I hope you're right.\"        </span></div></div>",

He stared at his arms as he faded into light and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The Cryomancer slowly awakened to the sound of a feminine voice speaking to him. Realizing it could be a threat he quickly opened his eyes, leaping to his feet. \" Peace friend. I have no intention on fighting you.\" Before him stood a young blue haired woman standing about 5'7 by his judgment with an impressive sword at her hip. He looked around their surroundings consisting of strange ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Sub-Zero looked back to her. \" I am Sub-Zero of the Lin Kuei.\" A cloud of fog permeating from his masked mouth. \" Lin Kuei... I am unfamiliar, regardless it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Lucina, daughter of Chrom.\" She spoke with pride in her voice as she looked up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spoke about where they could be currently and began to formulate what they should do, which understandably devolved into \"what if\" scenarios. As stud spoke he noticed a figure move in one of the ruins. \" Someone is watching us.\" He stated. \" There may be someone needing help.\" Lucina nodded in agreement as she followed him towards the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho, or what is watching them?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they approached the entrance to leave, two shadowy figures stood in the middle of the room. Both figures were complete clones of either of the duo. \" Gods.... How could this be?\" Lucina questioned as she drew her blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        An otherworldly silence filled the room as the stand off reached it's peak. The two shadow clones rushed at their originals eager to take their place. Sub- Zero ran towards his dopleganger, freezing the floor before him and sliding shoulder first into the imposter, sending it to the ground. He quickly dodged his clone as it attempted to sweep kick his legs. The clone noticeing Lucina in a struggle of her own attempted to hurl an ice cloud at her, only to have his original redirect the attack back at it, freezing it. Sub-Zero quickly created a club of ice and brought it down onto the imposters shoulder, shattering the frozen being. Unfortunately this was only a annoyance for the specter as it reformed once more as its opponent turned his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           It rushed at him with unnatural movements as it tackled him to the ground, landing on the edge of the pit. It climbed ontop of Tundra and began ferociously striking his face. Sub-Zero grabbed the imposters fist before striking its throat, before shoving it into the pit, where it would stay. He then turned too see how Lucina was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Lucina dodged her imposters swipe at her feet and nearly step right off the platform. Her clone drew its leg to kick her only to suddenly slip on a puddle of ice, falling to the ground. Lucina leapt onto it plunging her sword into the shadows chest.
