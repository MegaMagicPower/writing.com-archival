            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal day at the Kosaka Residence As The only one's there at the time were Kyosuke Kosaka and his Younger Sister, Kirino Kyosaka. It was the middle of the day since it was golden week for everyone and their parent's had gone out to spend the day together leaving Kyosuke in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyosuke was in his room doing some homework early to get it done and out of the way so he could have some more time to enjoy Golden week the best he could and maybe hang out with his friends. He knew it'd be better then being stuck inside all day. As he leaned back in his chair some after putting his pencil down and doing his homework for a little over 2 hours now. He turned his head some in the direction of the wall where Kirino's room was at and let's out a small sigh getting the feeling that she was probably playing a Eroge instead of doing her homework today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kirino's room, She was finishing up a Eroge and giggles some after getting another true ending on it. Once she had done that, she removed the game from her computer and got up to put it away when her cell phone started to vibrate as she had it set on silent. After putting the game away quickly, she grabbed her phone and laid down on her bed answering it after checking the caller ID to see it was her best friend Ayase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ayase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kirino. Are you busy at the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not. Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I found out about our next photo shoot and.....It's probably best if i told you in person. I'll be there in 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was said, The both of them hung up as Kirino changed out of her Pink short sleeve shirt and light blue small short's into a white short sleeve shirt and tan short's. She headed downstair's and made it to the door as the bell was rung. She answered it to see Ayase there but the expression she had was that of a mix of Embarrassment and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayase? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyase walked in and The two girl's went to the living room as they sat down on the couch as Ayase looked at Kirino and still had the expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-It's about our next photo shoot. I got a call and they wanted me to let you know as well. They.....well.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving trouble saying the words, Ayase reached into her purse and pulled out a magazine and handed it to Kirino. Once she got a look at the cover, She went wide-eyed and her jaw dropped at what she saw. It was a magazine with women that looked like they weighed from between 175 to 250 pounds. Kirino looked at Ayase in disbelief as she tried to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-They want us to do shoot's for that magazine a-a-and to......to put on some weight so we can look the minimum weight for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirino's Scream was so loud that Kyosuke heard it and fell back in his chair and hit's the floor. He got up and rubbed the back of his head and picked his chair up as he left his room and walked to the top of the stair's to see what was going on when he could hear Kirino talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY DO THEY WANT US TO GAIN SO MUCH WEIGHT AND BECOME FAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked them the same thing. The owner of the magazine saw some of our picture's and want's us to pose for the magazine. I was gonna tell them no but they were offering twice as much money as what we would normally make. Kanako was with me when we were told and she stormed out without a word. I don't blame her though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just tell them no!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DID! I TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULDN'T DO IT! However.......they said that if we don't do this job, we won't get anymore work for at least two month's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirino sat back as she couldn't believe that her, Ayase, and their friend Kanako were left with no choice but to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........H-How........How long do we have before the shoot date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said it'd be little over a month and a half so we can get more shoot's done before then but we'll have to gain weight before the due date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirino got up and looked at Ayase as she watched her stand up as well as the two of them headed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me Ayase. We should do what we can before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I'll see you later Kirino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyase had soon opened the door and exited the house closing the door behind her as Kirino let out a small sigh and sat down for a moment. Kyosuke had gone back to his room when he heard them coming in the direction of the door and stair's. He was sitting down on his bed thinking for a moment when he had a idea and decided to get some assistance into looking in this matter with the help of Saori Makishima. He knew that if Ruri Goko, AKA Kuroneko knew about this, it'd be hard to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirino Stood up and headed to her room as she closed her door and laid on her back on her bed with a flat look on her face as she begun to think of what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn, looks like I overestimated the prices of those figures.\" cursed a certain 'nekomimi' as she stared at the glowing screen of her trusty laptop.  A few figures from her favorite anime 'Mascara' had recently been released to the general public and Ruri readily ordered both sets from a website that specialized in such anime merchandise.  Both sets of the main characters set her back around $125 dollars, but what choice did she have?  She was lucky that she could even access the page, what with the legions of Mascara fans that also desired these action figures, and second shipments are almost unheard of.  Sighing, the black-haired girl opened up a new tab and went to her bank's website.  Going through all the 'log in'  screens and saw that her present balance was approximately $4.32.  Faster than a second, her head met the cold wooden surface of her desk, the urge to bang her head against the material to be exponentially increasing.  Truly at times, being an anime fan included much grief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where in the world am I supposed to get enough money for next month.' Of course next month was going to be the release of the limited edition box set of Mascara season 1, which she greatly looked forward too.  Usually a teenager like Kuroneko received a weekly allowance, however things had been tight monetary wise in the Gouki household.  With the economy in its lowest point in years, her parents had to budget appropriately and Kuroneko understood why she needed to pitch in as well.  The way that Kuroneko had amassed money in order to supply her egregious habit, was that she took part in photo-shoots that they often held in anime conventions.  The girl had also won a few cosplay contests as well, but the convention season was pretty much over.  It was nearing the middle of October and most conventions are held in the spring and summer where the weather is much more splendid and fair for the fans.  In an attempt to quell her mind on this matter, Kuroneko decided to browse 2ch, a famous image board that hosts a variety of pages and specific boards for one to waste incredible amounts of time with.  Ruri found herself surfing onto the Akihabara board, a sub-site where users would post all about the famous electric town.  Most of the time, stores would promote themselves, obviously in touch with their technology-based fanbase.  Going down the posts, a certain thread caught the interest of her cat's eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm a nekomimi cafe?  What in the world is that?' thought the girl, looking at the picture of a small cafe with a stylized cat-girl on the banner of the store.  She clicked on the reply button in order to see the entirety of the original post.  From the description the original poster stated that the cafe was looking for some new employment and boasted a pay of around 10 dollars an hour with any tips one would receive.  From this statement alone, Kuroneko's curiosity grew.  That pay was incredible, a job like that meant that the girl would never have to worry about her purchases and would even be able to give some of the money to help her parents out too.  Reading over the rest of the post. it stated that the uniform would be a maid uniform complete with 'neko ears and a tail' and that they were looking for girls that were seventeen or older.  Luckily, the 'dark' girl had just turned seventeen last month.  The rest of the requirements were easy to accomplish and the girl wrote down both the phone number and the address of the eatery.  Reading over the post once again, something at the very end of the list interested her.  It read: 'girls should have a healthy appetite.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, healthy appetite?\" she wondered out loud. While she did posses a small frame, the girl could eat a lot if she was hungry enough or if she put her mind to it.  Clicking off of the tab that contained the page, Kuroneko opted to download a few anime titles considering that she had some spare time.  Typing away, it startled her when her purple flip-phone rang, a familiar tune reverberating throughout her room.  Quickly grabbing the small device and read the caller ID.  Quite quickly her face lit lid up with a rouge color.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kuroneko!  I was wondering if you'd be free tomorrow.\"  The voice on the other side of the digital meridian was none other that Kyousuke Kosaka, brother of the siscon Krinio Kosaka and her secret crush of a few months.  Usually the two would go on these little 'trips' with one another but Kuroneko never found the courage to advance on her feelings.  Tomorrow would be the day where she would check out that particular cafe so she would have to pass on his invitation.  Though she would decide to amp up her 'persona' as she heard that playing hard to get was a very good tactic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph tomorrow my schedule is quite busy indeed.  A commoner like you should have the foresight to call me at least two weeks in advance.\" Over on his end of the line, she could hear him let out a heavy sigh, by which she was confused about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine, next time I'll be more considerate when inviting you out.  See you around.\" That was all that was said as he hanged up.  Kuroneko immediately regretted her haughty actions.  Going into her contacts, she picked his info and dialed his number.  A few rings and he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! Please take me out next week!\" she shouted with evidence of tears at the corner of her eyes.  And with that, they set up to meet each other in a week.</span></div></div>",

However, thanks to her having a low amount of cash, the cosplayer dark-haired girl had no choice but to walk and not take the public transit system. She recalled leaving her house around 9 am...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quarter after 2 pm. And Ruri was feeling a bit famished. She placed a hand over her slim stomach hearing it growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know,\" She said to herself as she walked through the crowd. Finally she can see some extravagant electronic stores up on the next block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at the edge of Akibahara. \"Finally!\" She began to walk through the crowd, walking a bit faster and ignoring her aching feet and her empty fuel tank's complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering into the famous district, she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper that had the address written on it. As she explored around the district, checking each store's address, her stomach continued to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one suffering here,\" She muttered to herself. Finally she has found the place. It had several tables outside matched with chairs, the front wall on the outside also had a navy blue color scheme with some glass windows. The sign of the place was above the windows and she could see some people inside setting up shop inside the aptly named Nekoko Cafe along with a few customers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking inside the cutely named eatery, the girl felt the cool air surround her, it did little however to settle her current weariness.  Looking around the restaurant, a multitude of waitresses, their attire consisting of a standard maid dress with cat ears and a matching tail, were running all over. Delivering food, taking orders and even some of them were eating with the complacent customers. The dark-haired girl could not help but stare at their grace, almost breath-taken at the actions occurring in front of her.  The fact that most of the female cat workers were quite overweight, what with their flabby bellies and chunky thighs did little to change the girl's opinion on them.  Walking up to the counter, the cheery maid welcomed Kuroneko and lead her to an open table that sat two.  She looked at the menu and was surprised that the prices were so low for a majority of the available options. Reading over each section, her mouth was dangerously close to drooling once she had reached the pastry section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, strawberry-cheesecake deluxe! And for so cheap too!\" said the girl to herself, wanting the sweet treat the very second she had laid her eyes on the picture.  It was just in her price range as well, which made it all the more enticing to eat. Calling over a waitress, the bubbly worker hopped over to where the other 'cat-girl' sat, it was easy to see that she enjoyed her job quite immensely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, aren't you the cutest? Would you like to hear today's specials before you order?\" If it were any other day and if she had money to spend, the girl most likely would have ordered everything that the plump waitress would have suggested,  Glancing at the menu for a quick review, her order was set in stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no thank you, I'm a bit low on money at the moment. I do appreciate the offer though. To order, I'd like a cup of camomile tea and a slice of the strawberry cheesecake deluxe.\" Kuroneko made sure that the worker wrote down her exact order and once again she hopped off in the other direction to place the order to the kitchen.  Waiting patiently for her sweet treat to arrive, the girl had just recalled the purpose of her trip towards this district of town. It was the well-paying job opportunity that was posted on the web the other day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I must ensure that I asked that waitress for an application. Working here will definitely be worthwhile towards my budgeting.\" Still being patient during this interval, the girl took out her phone; Ruri began to read the messages that had been sent to her within the past hour.  Her eyes were immediately drawn to a certain name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyosuke...\" Given time to reflect on what had occurred on the day before, the girl regretted that she could not meet up with him. Highlighting his message, she selected it and read it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey there Kuroneko, I found a nice little restaurant close to where I live. The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is just right. Can I take you there next week? I'm sure you'll love it and if not, feel free to curse me with your 'dark magic.' Oh I'm hanging out with Manami today so don't get jealous. haha.' A small smile on her face, she felt her mind become a bit fuzzy from this news. This was it, no more playing stupid mind games with her crush, she wanted to be more open, she wanted development. Most of all, she wanted him to hold her in a tight embrace. Without thinking, she readily typed out her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I'd love to go. I want to see you...' Hitting send without a moment's delay, the heavy blush stained her face.  Before her she could catch up to what she had actually done, the waitress had appeared, a large plate and her tea set on the serving dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go! I hope you don't mind but I got them to add a few more slices on the house. Enjoy!\" With that, the worker left to go tend to the others patrons in the store.Looking at the plate she was given, there were four amazing slices of cake, ready for consumption. Using the nearby fork, she tore off a small piece and brought it to her lips. The joy that it brought her palette was almost immeasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sweet~'  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow...that was satisfying,\" commented Kuroneko to herself as she finished the meal of the strawberry-cheesecake slices. She finished them all and felt rather 'satisfied'. She flipped open her phone and checked her messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyosuke...\" She whispered. She felt blood rush to her cheeks. What will he say? In addition, how will she react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's great! I'll see if I can book a reservation(they can do that). Until next week I suppose.' That was the end of the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuroneko took a deep breath. Clearly he was exicted to take her out, enough to book a reservation for her is quite thoughtful. She can see the plan going off well...except for one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bro-con of a sister of his, Kirino. If she ever found out, she may try to sabotage the date either before, or heaven forbid during the date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Secrecy is priorty now. I have to make sure that she doesn't know a thing...' thought the girl to herself. 'Maybe I'll let Kyosuke know-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" The small goth jumped out of her seat at the sudden voice. Her head darted around, and there before was a big person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth horizontally and vertically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person was of clear Japanese descent yet had some touches of Caucasin in her face as well as her hair, as it was red, topped with a set of cat ears. She must have been 193 centimeters(6'4) in height, and in addition must have weigh at 300 pounds, for she looked like 240 if she was of normal stature. Her weight was more distributed into her chest and her legs, although she had a clear tummy given the bump under her green and black checker shirt. The said shirt had some open buttons, revealing a great deal of cleavage and some breast fat was even pouring out, not to mention a single breast could fill one maybe two of her heads. In addition, her jeans were tight all around, given the curves and swells of her legs. Her thighs were rubbing against one another and clearly her hips were wide. And if the tummy was spilling over her jeans, along with possibly a huge juicey rear and those giant melons made her look like she was out of some exaggerated hentai/ecchi series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dear lord she's huge,' thought the goth to herself as she craned her head. The woman was clearly a foot taller and more. And with those melons, she could suffocate someone to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Asked Kuroneko. The girl had closed eyes and had a hand cupped around her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone ever told you you look absolutely adorable! The red contacts~, the goth lolita dress~\" Cooed the taller woman. Judging by her tone of her ditzy-like older sister tone and her personality, she must have been mid 20s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" The smaller girl asked, a bit put off and irked by her enthusiasm. It was if Saori was on a sugar rush plus whatever drug she can find, probably speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well~, as you can see I do have a lot of pretty young girls that work here. And you yourself are a pretty young girl~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this woman into yuri?' Thought Kuroneko. \"So you're offering me a job? Is that it?\" She said in a flat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-Hmm! Of course if you decline that's okay with you though! I'm forcing anything onto you or anything like my husband does~\" Said the redhead as she placed both hands on her cheek, turned around in thought and started to wiggle her hips. Kuroneko's eyes rose, and she can see a few male bystaners walking outside take notice, their slightly bleeding nostrils as evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So she's married huh. Why the endless joy though?' \"Well I have been thinking of getting an application...\" the redhead woman jumped around with a great smile on her thin face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, definately out of a hentai manga. Take away the belly, and you got a regular Nagodan-type lady.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: Nagodan is a pun for Mogudan, who is a hentai artist. Look him up).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing! Let me get it right now!\" With that said, she skipped away, her breasts bouncing all over the place and in place for her poor shirt. Kuroneko would even hear small quakes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well she msut be a bright ball of sunshine...' She then saw the waittress from earlier walk over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you met miss Ryoko Hayami huh?\" Asked the waittress with an understanding smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's quite the happy one. Know anything why?\" Asked the small goth. The chubby waitress chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was 26 when she got married and their first anniversary ended recently. She's a Christmas Cake that got eaten up.\" Kuroneko's eyes widened. She's well aware that Japanese women over the age of 25 have an incredibly hard time of getting married due to a stigma of being 'too old'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like she took that cake and ate it too, in a good way,\" pointed out the goth. The waitress nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she gave birth to her first child three months ago. Her son was named Shiki, and her husband graduated from Tokyo U half a year ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the father was in his early 20s and Ryoko, the manager, 27, along with them having a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she manage to open a place like this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoji, the father, works at a big international law firm, and with him being married he got quite a bit money and he decided to start off in the restaurant business,\" The waitress. \"He's quite a cutey too! Now wonder Mrs. Ryoko is happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And if she's still nursing the kid, no wonder her boobs are the size of Mt. Fuji,' added Kuroneko. Then Kuroneko did notice that the place did have chubby girls as employees...</span></div></div>",

Is there any specific reason to why that is?\" asked Kuroneko in her naturally soft and mature voice. The waitress had to restrain herself from squeezing the living daylights out of the girl. Ruri was simply precious in her eyes! Though she was surprised that Ruri caught on so quickly to the main 'gimmick' of the quaint cafe.  Knowing that the explanation would take some time and the fact that Miss Ryoko always misplaces paperwork, the waitress figured she could sit down.  Taking a seat right across from the younger girl, this waitress rested both of her hands on the soft mound that was her belly; this action caused the ever curious 'Black-cat' to get even more curious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its a long story. At first, when Mrs Ryoko got married, her husband bought this property and planned to open up a small cafe, as his family has made much of their money from owning and operating eateries. Being the loving husband that he is, he decided to let the boss to run the business. Both of them had agreed to have the general theme as a 'nekomimi' cafe in order to bring in the special types of customers that always had plenty of cash on them.  So the only selling point was the fact that it was close to the train station.  During the first month, her husband expected a loss of sorts because what business even breaks even during their opening? The miraculous thing was that the boss had managed to make a decent profit! Seeing that she was more than capable of running the business on her own terms, her husband gave her more leeway and gave her a greater budget.  The first thing Mrs Ryoko did was to hire more cooks that were fresh from school and were passionate about their confections. She also allowed the waitress to eat a meal whenever they wanted, aside from when they were waiting on customers. Needless to say, Mrs' Ryoko's eating habits kinda rubbed off on us all.\" The young waitress rubbed her belly for emphasis.  Kuroneko took the explanation in, with only a few questions lingering in her mind. The most pertaining one was the possible effect that working at the cafe would easily cause her figure to bloat out. What would her crush think of her when she was as round as a bouncing ball? Shaking those harmful thoughts out of her head, she wanted to ask the waitress one more thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was Mrs. Ryoko able to keep this cafe as profitable as before? Wouldn't the cafe have lost a majority of its regulars because the girls gained weight?\"  With the comment, the other girl only smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, our regulars grew as the girls did! The girls were so friendly that all of the guys would come more often and they even referred us to their numerous friends. Soon after that we  implement the option to have the girls eat with the customers.\"  Ruri did not expect such an outcome to occur. Generally the type of 'gentlemen' that frequented these types of cafes were usually picky on the figures of the girls that served them. Though perhaps the girls influences then as they added inches to their frames? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well then, Mrs Ryoko certainly is talented.\" Like a storm, Ryoko burst into the scene, her body naturally jiggling and the proper papers in hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cutie I have the forms, but I really don't need them because I want to hire you so bad!\" exclaimed the large and in charge boss as she place the papers on the small table.  Taking them, Ruri was careful to read it entirely just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now boss, we need to file this application for the records.\" The waitress clearly acted as a voice of reason for the child-like Ryoko. The boss took her hand and affectionately rubbed the top of the waitress' head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know Kyoko-chan! I just get excited when we can hire cute girls like this darling girl!\" By the time the two were done with their little event, Ruri filled out the papers and presented them to the boss. She quickly read it, skimming over most of the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ruri, when are you able to start!\"</span></div></div>",

She felt quite satisfied, for family meals were rare given how much work her parents have to do in order to get by just barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Ryoko that she can start in a week, the lady was more than happy to provide her with a free meal, one she ate with the small girl too. A decent helping of cake. Ruri wanted to decline, but to do so would have been rude, and to the lady that would have been her future boss wouldn't have gone well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko even whispered in her ear that Ryoko was a huge cry baby, and that would have made Ruri feel even worse, so the cosplayer relented and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll never eat cake again,' she moaned as she did her business in the bathroom, grooming and the call of duty. It was tasty yes, but she ate too much and even several hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating three slices of cake at a moderate pace(Ryoko ate seven much larger slices) she got the application form from the stuffed older woman and headed on her merry way home, did homework and socialized with the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the shower and removing her contacts, she started the hot running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way home she got a text from Saori for another Otaku Girls Unite club meeting sometime next week. Apparently she sounded quite enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly on her Gundam Unicorn high,\" she said to herself. The glasses wearing girl always was giddy whenever a mecha anime by Sunrise came out. She acted like this whenever there was a Gundam Unicorn OVA coming out, or that Gundam AGE anime, or that Horizon show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended her shower and stepped out and began to dry off, ruffling her long black hair and wrapping a towel around her petite figure. Kuroneko looked up into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a small rise around her towel and placed a hand on it, feeling the small bulge that was her still stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well small DFC-esque figure,\" she said to herself. \"Time to order a coffin and a formal suit. You're going to get buried under some fat, eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Kuroneko didn't care of the gaining weight part impacting her figure. Rather, she was a little worried on how Kyosuke would react. Would he be repulsed, or stay as her friend? Would the date stand? She didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If only I had the Queen of Darkness' power of future sight,' she thought to herself. She finished drying up and putting on a simple pair of PJ pants and long sleeved shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving her young sisters Hinata and Tamaki kisses on the heads, she said goodnight to her parents and went into her room. Turned off all the lights and plopped onto her bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd started to prowl the imageboards and check up on some new anime on her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Risen could use a try,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Three Hours later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dropped.\" She said sourly. Risen, a new anime based on a light novel adaption on the series of the same name, was about a plague striking some small town and causing the dead to rise as vampires, but they keep their sanity. Only that they can't live in daytime and that they must drink blood to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, they made a moody quiet dude blantaly ignore a decent girl who wanted to get to know him and he literally went full on gay for a friend of his, who wasn't even into that. The girl did die of the plague and rose as a vampire, and went yandere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she dropped due to bad writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thousand yen Kirino maybe loving this drivel. If she likes such man-child drivel like Meruru, she will like this fujoshi pandering trash. Nothing like Lion and Sheep, which displays a good relationship between two male friends and them being superheroes.\" She said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she felt a slight growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" she groaned as she closed her laptop and shuffled under the covers and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her stomach growled again. And again...and again...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fine.\" She sat up and walked towards the door and down the darkened hallway quietly and down the stairs with all the quietness she could muster. She rounded the corner, her small feet tapping the wood and she arrived into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she clicked on a light to see her options. Pantry...or fridge?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The decision weighed on her mind for a few moments; Ruri tried to decided what she was in the mood for. As 'sweet' food was one of the gimmicks of being a goth-loli, Ruri had adopted the habit of being particularly picky when it came to satisfying those areas of her palate.  Figuring that it was pointless to decide on what to eat without actually looking, the 'black-cat' went towards the pantry and opened the twin doors. As the economic environment meant less food overall, snacks were always plentiful due to their cheaper price and small portions. Right in plain sight was a brand new package of 'Rainbow Cookies.' They were a rather simple brand and the cookies were comprised of two vanilla wafer cookies attached together by cream and was covered in sprinkles. While they were intended for children, Kuroneko loved to snack on these. She had completely forgotten that her mother had bought these a few days ago!  One package of the snack consisted of six cookies, Kuroneko decided to grab three packs in order to avoid repeat trips. These were the one foodstuffs that she could not get enough of. The girl quietly made her way back to her room, cookies in tow and closed the door.  Looking to the clock, the girl finally noticed just how late it really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, 1:30 already. Maybe I should start sleeping earlier...\" Indeed, this black-haired girl would often spend her nights browsing imageboards and watching anime. Usually she would only get a few hours of sleep but this did little to impede how she got through the day. As it was still the weekend, the girl could afford to stay up and watch her precious shows. As school and other daily activities were very prominent in this young girl's life, anime had to take a backseat at times; this equated to the girl attaining a massive backlog of shows. Kuroneko would only really keep up with the series that she loved, such as Mascara and the like. Deciding on one more show before going to sleep, Ruri chose to watch the latest episode of the anime called 'Canine-Clash' a series that was rather light-hearted in premise. The plot was that a young male teen was summoned into another world that was filled with people that had animal characteristics. There were dog-people, cat-people and the ilk. Different kingdoms were comprised of these types of people and the main character was summoned to be the hero of one kingdom. While the fanservice was rather heavy, what with the size of female breasts and partial nudity, this girl really loved the romance presented and the relationships among the characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they'll actually progress the relationship between Quattro and Creme.\" said the girl to herself. Usually with these types of shows, no real development is made and the ending is usually left open-ended. Ruri could not recall all the times she was frustrated by this fact. Is it that difficult to throw in a kiss or a hug every now and then. The small girl opened up the proper video file with her video player and the episode began. Sitting through the opening, the girl made a mental note to by the single cd next time she was available. A few episodes in, the girl was able to discern the plot of the episode. All of the female characters of the show were seen eating rather unhealthily. A few scene changes later, there was visible weight gain on the main female cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, this certainly is an interesting development.' thought the girl, munching on her cookies every now and then. Ruri keeps her eyes on the screen, watching the females getting larger and larger. A red hue was growing on her face and she felt a certain something in her stomach. She could not explain this sensation, but it was clouding up her mind. Eventually they discovered what was causing the females to put on weight and a solution was devised rather quickly even for anime standards. While the female characters were not shown to have lost the weight, the episode ended and the credits began to play. She exited the player, the events of the episode still swimming around in her mind. Reaching for another cookie, she was disappointed that she had finished them all already. Ruri let out a sigh, she really wanted to eat more cookies but her calorie intake for the day was sky-high, she didn't want to blow up that quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, its already a new day.\" And with that Ruri went to go grab a few more packs. Minutes later, she was under the covers of her moderately sized bet, still browsing some sites using a small tablet she had received a few years back. It seemed that fanart of the recent 'Canine-Clash' episode was made. Ruri made sure to save any she came across. 'I wonder if any other shows have this sort of thing.' she thought, using the power of the internet to satiate her curiosity. While there were anime episodes that had such themes, most of them were done rather poorly. She would have to continue her search later on, her eyes were beginning to fail her. Before that would occur, Ruri grabbed her phone from the nightstand and flipping through some menus, she reread the text Kyousuke had sent her the day prior, the one about their date. Once again her face changed in color, representing her want of seeing the young teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Only a few more days now.'  </span></div></div>",

Ruri was still donning her new gloth Lolita dress, this time the hem of the dress stopping below the knees instead of the ankles like her old one. She still donned the red contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last six days, Ruri has been going to the caf\u00e9 to get a better feel of her future place of employment, Kyoko was no doubt as bubbly as ever, she even brought her husband and son along. Her husband seemed rather sensible and had a good head on his shoulders, and nowhere near as boisterous as his wife. Then again, Shoji was a lawyer so it made sense for him to be civilized. The baby Shiki didn\u2019t seem to have a problem as he always napped when around his mother. Shoji jokingly remarked that his wife is quiet and careful whenever Shiki is around, but is an endless bouncing ball of energy when not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Ruri shook her head to get rid of the memory of Ryoko jokingly teasing her husband about her being an \u2018Oni\u2019 in bed. Ruri has seen enough hentai pictures to understand where it was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, she must have Bipolar,\u201d muttered Kuroneko. As usual, she got some odd glances, but the cosplayer was used to them as she adored her choice of fashion that corresponded with one of her top three favorite anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibrate from her cellphone broke her train of thought as she inspected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Getting on train to head to the restaurant. Where you at?\u2019 It was Kyosuke. Ruri gulped a little and replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018In Shinjuku. Where\u2019s the place at?\u2019 Ruri was never told where the restaurant where her and Kyosuke\u2019s meetup was at. Only that it was nearby his home in Shibuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018It\u2019s in Minato. See you at the train station. I\u2019ll wait for you there.\u2019 Ruri nodded. She remembered that his suburbs were spitting distance to the Minato Ward after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Got it. Thanks.\u2019 Ruri closed her phone and placed it into her purse and headed up the stairs to the train station. She noticed that climbing the metal flight of stairs was a bit more tedious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh right. The weight.\u2019 Ruri looked down and poked at her small soft stomach, thankfully only a small bump on her dress. Ever since she met Ryoko, she has slowly put on around ten or so pounds in the last week, with her giving her free meals along with the late night snacking have had an effect. Her once flat stomach has gotten a bit softer and pudgier, and she noticed a little tightness around her rear. She would have been a tiny bit miffed that she saw no rise in her current bust size, which enabled her to not wear a bra half the time, but she didn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally got on the train, not before stopping by a vending machine for a pack of pop-tarts, and started the ride to Minato, snacking as the train sped along and she saw the skyscrapers pass by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped off the train she turned her head and\u2026</span></div></div>",

Ruri thought it was somewhat strange as her other friend Kirino would usually wait along with him whenever the pair came to pick her up. He looked to be waiting patiently, occasionally flipping his phone to check for messages but his expression was not that of annoyance, no it looked more as if he was expecting something good to happen. Ruri proceeded to walk towards him, carefully avoiding anyone along the way, these stations were always bustling with people heading from destination to destination. Kyousuke still failed to noticed her presence right up to her being only a few inches away from him.  Still looking at his phone, he read a previous text that Kirino had sent him just twenty minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Remember, greetings are important.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The hell does this mean?' he thought. He wanted to write it off as Kirino messing around with him but the girl had been less abrasive as of late. No longer would they argue for no particular reason and they actually behaved as normal siblings, or as normal as you can get with an otaku for a sister. Giving off a sigh, Kyosuke looked up to see that Ruri was right in front of him; she sported a rather condescending smile on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm so engrossed in your cell phone that you cannot even notice me. Perhaps you were up to something less than savory?\" Kyousuke decided to play along with her little game. After spending a bit of time with her, he picked up a few tricks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was just making some final plans with a friend I plan to met up later on. You know, flowers, chocolate, the works. I'm sure she'll love it but what do you think?\" At the shear mention of the word 'girl' her eyes sharpened not that unlike a real cat. Ruri certainly lived up to her nickname at times like this.  Multiple feelings were swimming around in her chest, those of anger, those of sadness, rather standard for a situation such as this. Deciding to play up a facade, the girl closed her red eyes and whipped her head towards its side. A 'humph' was heard as well, the coup de grace of her persona. Seeing that it was time to end their little game, he moved closer to the girl and wrapped his arms around her, giving the girl a small squeeze. Quite easily the small girl figured that the teen was talking about herself. She mentally noted that she would get him back soon. She found her own arms wrapping around his back and meeting in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do think she'll like that.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is that Kuroneko-shi has a thing for your brother right?\" said the tallest otaku female ever to have existed to her shorter, orange haired friend. Both of them were in their usual maid-styled cafe waiting up on their other two friend. Kirino decided against waiting for the pair to make her order and was currently eating a rice omelet that spelled out 'I love you onee-chan' in ketchup.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup its pretty much obvious once you see the two of them. I'd never expect that gloomy girl to actually like someone from the 3D world, but it really is cute. I just hope that Kyousuke followed my advice.\" Through her thick lens glasses, Saori could see that Kirino mood about her brother had improved greatly as of late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you been catching up on Velocity Universe? I hear its been getting good lately.\"</span></div></div>",

The goth had her eyes closed, but Kirino had an inspective look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She seems\u2026softer?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, you claim on how Velo Uni is an otaku pandering piece of trash with an obese MC in order to relate to most shut-in hikikomoris, and having every single character that has a uterus in the show to somehow land on his lap and begin to become attracted to him. Not only does this pander to the otaku demographic, this also garners those of the doujin community, especially the uncouth NTR/ ugly men demographic. If I had not known on your prior taste in anime,\u201d Kuroneko reopened her eyes, staring down the track and field otaku girl. \u201cI would have supported you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Was all Kyosuke could say as he took  a seat as Saori shuffled over to sit next to Kirino, who puffed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you\u2019re comparing Meruru to Velo Uni! If you were a boy I\u2019d say you have balls and stupid. Meruru actually does things right and simple, unlike Velo Uni that tries to be pretentious and serious but fails at it! I mean, the MC looks like that one western character from that paper-cut out show!\u201d Said Kirino in her defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do applaud you for condemning Velo Uni like myself, but the fact is you\u2019re making yourself to become a hypocrite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh girls,\u201d Kyosuke intervened, hoping that his date won\u2019t spiral out of control. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s okay to like one series and to like another right? Like it\u2019s okay to like a comedy show and like a serious drama, I mean\u2026\u201d He paused when he saw the two girls lay their inquisitive gazes on them. \u201cIt\u2019s like, taking your cake and eating it right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!

She turned back towards the goth, toying with omelet. \u201cSo\u2026what series did you drop, add, or like on your backlog?\u201d Ruri was inspecting the menu for her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order.

Her face lit up like a Christmas Tree, and she hid herself behind her menu. Kyousuke awkwardly laughed, and he glared at his little sister to make sure that she did not burst out into laughter and embarrass the girl further. Instead of a smug look on her face, the orange haired girl looked as if she was in love; Kyousuke could have sworn that he saw little tiny hearts in her eyes. It would be Saori that would show any real concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuroneko-shi? Are you feeling well? Did you happen to skip a meal?\" asked the tall girl with a soft expression. Kuroneko peeped from behind the menu and bashfully answered. Kyousuke too was now a bit worried but he let the girl explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well I suppose my breakfast was a little bit light.\" she said in a wary tone. The black-haired girl could not believe that her body did such an act and only hoped that her crush overlooked it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you barely ate, then you should eat a lot now!\" said the eccentric Kirino, apparently excited by the prospect of the girl eating plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, lay off of Ruri a bit. Figure out your own orders before you pester her alright?\" Ruri mentally thanked Kyousuke as she went over the menu, trying to figure out what would fill her. Since working at the cafe, her appetite had increased slightly. Minutes passed and everyone seemingly decided with their orders. Flagging down one of the waitresses, they all gave their orders.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"So, are you feeling better now Ruri?\" asked the teen, as he looked up from his own meal which was simply rice covered with a heart fried egg and ketchup on top in the shape of a heart, courtesy of a blushing Kuroneko.  The girl ordered two stack of pancakes, drowned in syrup and chocolate chips.  Taking a bite, she loved the sweetness she tasted and was also unaware of a particular orange haired girl staring at her, witnessing every bite. Kirino had ordered the same as Kyousuke, except she had the waitress write the message in ketchup which she didn't mind as the waitress was rather cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, earlier was simply a misjudgment in the required nutrients of my breakfast. I am fine, but thank you for worrying about me.\" she said with a bit of a blush. Kyousuke returned the smile. Saori and Kirino watched the pair's interaction, both of them highly interested in their 'relationship.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he asked her out yet?\" whispered Saori as the pair were to invested in each other to pay attention to anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he has asked her to lunch. But I'm not sure it's official or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you know when it is?\" asked Saori, her mouth curling into a smile. The girl wasn't going to snoop, but rather make sure things go swimmingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what do you plan on doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to make sure that it goes well. That's all~\"  Kirino thought about her words, and decided it would be best if she went along as well. It wasn't snooping, it was simply eating at the same place and making sure all goes well!</span></div></div>",

Thank god black was slimming otherwise she'd never hear the end of it from the track star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what now?\" Asked the blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still got room for more Kuroneko-shi?\" Asked the tall girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the girl eat,\" said Kyousuke, who didn't really seem to mind Ruri having a dessert. \"It's a free country after all.\" He took a sip from his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they say in America brother,\" corrected Kirino. The black haired teen simply shrugged his shoulders, but he looked at Kuroneko and nodded, which gave the cosplayer his confidence and felt more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a waiter walk by and raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, do you have any desserts on hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose I can have the chefs in the back make you some early ice cream.\" Said the waiter. \"It may have to cost you a bit extra though. They aren't expecting a dessert during breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl nodded. \"That's fine. I will be willing to pay the sufficient price necessary.\" The waiter shrugged and walked off, writing down in his book. Ruri heard a male chuckle and turned, seeing Kyousuke with an amused look. She felt her face heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about heavy. If people didn't know better, they'd think you'd be carrying a dictionary around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri looked away blushing hearing Kirino and Saori giggle at Kyousuke's joke. But he did say 'heavy'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no...did he notice?' she thought, looking down...and pinching her love handles, feeling the soft skin past the dark dress.</span></div></div>",

With a short laugh he waved his arms in front of him as to show his lack of seriousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey, I meant your tone with the waitress. It was kinda demanding. But really, I was joking and seeing your cute face made it worth it.\" With his response, another blush flared up on the girl's face and she turned her face once more.  Kyousuke gently patted her head and smiled. He loved it when she acted so cute. The other two girls watched this exchange, Saori had a normal smile on while Kirino sported a more sly one. She would have a field day teasing her brother later on today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's up for the rest of the day anyways? I'm up for shopping if its just that, but are we going to do anything else?\" asked the only boy present, curious as to what they were going to be doing and if he would be able to sneak away with Kuroneko during it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're going to go shopping for some doujins and then later, we were planning on seeing a new movie that came out.\" said Saori. Thinking it over, the teen thought that he could easily get some alone time with Ruri during the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aright, sounds good. Wait, we aren't seeing a Meruru movie are we?\" Looking quite offended, his sister had a frown on her face. She immensely disliked it when anyone insulted her favorite anime of the year all years. Seeing the mood he put his sister in, the brother did his best to backtrack his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I didn't mean it like that. It was more for Ruri's consideration. If that was the movie that you wanted to see, then maybe we could watch a different one. You know how different your tastes are and all and I don't want you two fighting during it.\" explained the teen, blatantly lying through his teeth. Looking at her crush, Ruri could tell he was planning on it, but decided to play along, she did want to spend time with him and him only after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite true Kirino. I don't think I would be able to stomach a Meruru movie as I still need to watch regular episodes to get a handle on characterization and whatnot.\"  Feeling like she was being ganged up on, Kirino sighed and just let it go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not even a Meruru movie! It's just a romantic comedy I've been wanting to see lately, nothing anime related at all.\" explained the orange haired girl. Of course this movie was just a front to get her brother and Ruri alone together, as she and Saori would sneak out and go watch a much cuter movie about magical girls. It was the perfect plan! By now, the waitress had arrived, alongside with Ruri's sundae, which was comprise of three scoops of vanilla ice cream, sprinkles and topped with a heavy layer of whipped cream. Taking a spoonful, the girl was delighted at how creamy and sweet it tasted. The three continued their conversation of the movie and Kyousuke was actually interested in it. Perhaps Ruri would enjoy it too? Looking over to the girl, he saw that she had a bit of ice cream on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you got a little bit on your cheek. Here, let me get it for you.\" Grabbing a napkin, he gently cupped her cheek and wiped off the sweet subtance, earning him a heavy blush from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you...\" said the girl, looking away in embarrassment and eating the ice cream at a more rapid pace. Kirino watched the little exchanged and though it was precious, the perverted smile on her face was proof of her less than savory thoughts.</span></div></div>",

He inspected his phone and waited patiently and then out of the corner of his eye he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" He smiled.

Kyousuke tried to focus as well, but there was a large part of his mind that was screaming at him to take a move, to show Ruri that he was serious about them as a couple rather than just close friends. Trying to gather his resolve, a number of potential acts flashed in his head. He could easily just grab her hand and hold it, attempt to put his arm around her, or even whispering sweet nothings into her ear. Looking over at the girl, she was continuously munching on her popcorn, eyes fixated both on her snack and the movie. It was a simple romantic movie, one that Kyosuke figured she would appreciate slightly better then a cutesy anime movie. As he was trying to come up with ideas, Ruri noticed that he kept glancing over at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyousuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, what is it Kuroneko?\" he asked, able to see a small red tinge on her face in the poorly lit theater. The girl then used her free hand to lift up the arm rest, deleting the remaining space between them. Giving him an expected look, the young man readily took the cue. Placing his arm around her side, he pulled her in closer, trying to ignore the rapid beating of his heart. His hand rested on her midsection which turned out to be much softer than he expected. Ruri rested her head on his chest, still munching on her tasty popcorn and trying to come up with any other ways of showing advances towards her crush. Kyousuke began to gently rub her side, the softness dancing in between in his finger tips. The continued on like this for much of the movie, both highly content at their level of intimacy. Finally finishing both tubs of popcorn, Ruri adjusted herself so she was sitting up and leaning against Kyousuke. Taking the hand that was resting on her side, she grabbed it and placed it on top of her rounded middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruri?\" asked Kyousuke, finding himself at a loss of words. Her belly much much softer, much more tender and felt heavenly beneath his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do think I managed to upset my stomach somewhat. Do you mind if you rubbed it for me?\" Looking up to Kyosuke, she had a cute expression on her face along with a shy smile. Finding himself grinning as well, the young man did what she asked and began to gently rub her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We should do this more often, if you don't mind...\" said the girl with a blush growing on her pale face. They sat in silence, enjoying each other as they continued to watch the movie. </span></div></div>",

While he had never actively thought that fat girls were ugly or anything like that, he never had any desire to date one. But now, with a chubby Kuroneko close by, he had to reevaluate his own preferences. The two were silent as Kyousuke escorted her home, both were too embarrassed to say much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you think we could do this more often?\" stuttered the young teen, her face still covered in a new shade of red. Looking down at her, he gave her his usual warm smile, happy that the girl wanted to spend time with him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coure, I'd love to,\" said the teen in a low voice, to convey his sincerity. Nodding her head, she gave him a small smile. The pair continued on like this, sharing the others warmth and Kyousuke continuing to rub the girl's tender love handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, to be clear, you don't mind me like this correct?\" asked the girl, a hint of nervousness in her voice. She wanted nothing more than to be with him, but her new weight could be an obstacle despite his earlier interactions with her figure.  Stopping, he released his hold on the girl and turned her to face him.  Placing both hands on her shoulders, he gave her a serious look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Ruri. I like you for being you. Nothing is ever going to change that. We've been through a lot together and you really helped out my sister, so I appreciate that. What kind of person would I be if I told you how your body should be? You're already incredibly amazing so I'd just be the biggest jerk ever.\" The girl looked at him with absolute wonder, she felt her heartbeat increase tenfold as a strange feeling overcame her. Rushing up, she nearly jumped at him as she caught his lips in a kiss, throwing her arms around him and causing the pair to nearly fall to the ground. Luckily he caught her and stabilized both of them. Placing his arms at the small of her back, he gently kissed back. Eventually the two separate, both panting heavily for air. The girl immediately wrapped her arms around the teen and hugged him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyousuke!\" shouted the girl, hiding her face in his chest. Letting out some relieving laughter, things could not have gone better. He gently patted her head as the other arm kept her close. He would have to thank his sister and Saori immensely later on. But for now, he would enjoy the moment with his little black cat.</span></div></div>",

Her maid uniform black and white and a bit tight around the middle of her now softer but larger tummy, the frill of the dress showing off her thighs. Speaking of, she was wearing some black thigh-highs with white paw prints, and on top of her head was a pair of cat ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal from the night before with her new beau Kyousuke has gone right into her belly and thighs, making them bulge out more. If Ruri had to guess, she had to guess that she put on a good ten pounds or so. But it didn't matter. Kyousuke loved her for her, and she decided to throw away the context of dieting right out to the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she had to admit she was lucky. Kyousuke was quite the looker himself, and being in the otaku community means little chance of finding a significant other, mainly due to the lower standards of otakus of both Genders in both beauty and looks, and that they would prefer the 2-D over the 3-D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer greeting caught the attention of several waitresses and the manager Ryoko, who looked quite pleased. They never would have guessed Ruri to be this happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ruri you look so cute~!\" Beamed Ryoko, jogging up as her massive mammaries bounced and she leaned forward, hands on her knees. \"What could ever make you so happy this time of the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri blushed but smiled. \"Well...can I...\" Ryoko snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's a boy isn't it!\" Cooed the manager, and now the other waitresses got in and cooed, surrounding Ruri and asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can this wait? I want to get on my first shift please Mrs. Manager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course dearie! Just clock in and get ready!\"</span></div></div>",

Sitting alone in the break room, she felt her face turn a reddish tinge as she thought about the previous night. Her crush had finally showed her that he shared the same feelings and she could not be happier if she tried. Taking out her phone, she noticed that he sent her a text. Quickly taking a bite out of the fluffy cheesecake she had gotten for herself, she read it over, feeling her heart stereotypically quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, if you're not busy, I was hoping that we can meet up with each other later to hang out or do whatever you want. Let me know soonish<br>\r\nLove, Kyousuke.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes focusing on the 'love' part of the text, Ruri had to control herself so she wouldn't let out a squeal of absolute happiness. Stuffing her mouth full of key lime pie in order to mute herself, she quickly wrote a reply, saying that she could see him after 5:00, which was when she was able to get home and change out of her uniform. Ruri even ended the text with 'Love, Ruri' which caused her to nearly erupt with pleasure and she once again muted herself, this time with a strawberry cake. The black haired girl had yet to tell Kyousuke of her work and was quite hesitant too. While she had yet to have a case where someone had done something inappropriate with her, she was afraid that Kyousuke would get angry with her and possibly snuff out their newly formed relationship. Pushing these sad thoughts out of her mind, Ruri continued to eat her cake, not noticing the rather imposing figure locking the door and slowly heading towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\" said Ryoko as she hugged Ruri from behind, engulfing the girl with the flesh from her breasts and soft gut. Ruri could only mumble as she was muffled by her boss' large frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, are you going to spill the details or am I going to have to keep snuggling you cutie?\" asked the playful boss. Ruri nodded, having been 'defeated' by such a fearsome opponent. Ryoko promptly relieved the girl, softly patting her head and sat at the chair opposite to her, expecting to hear a cute story from her cute employee. With a red tinge on her face, Ruri started from the beginning, how she had met Kyousuke and Kirino at a meetup and how they soon became friends. Then she mentioned later developments, how she began to fall in love with him and how she was the one to show him how much he meant to her. She ended with the kiss and how since then she had been on cloud nine. As soon as she was done, Ryoko blasted towards her, crushing her with a friendly hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the cutest love story I have ever heard. Oh, this Kyousuke sounds so amazing, why don't you bring him around to show off? All of the other girls would get so jealous.\" Ruri felt a chill go down her spine at the suggestion of bringing him around to the cafe, but she quickly pushed it out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-ll think of it Mrs. Manager.\" </span></div></div>",

I..I uh...want to share with Kyousuke when he arrives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetie!\" Ryoko sashayed into the back, some nearby male customers turning their head on impulse.

She took out the clothes in Ruri's size and held them up for the youth to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-oh, um...\u201d Looking at the cat ears, tail, and maid uniform made Ruri nervous. \u201cI suppose I'll change into them now...\u201d She stared at Ryoko, wondering if she was going to have to expose her figure in her underclothes to her boss, whose eyes were lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on, boss, let's give the girl some breathing room.\u201d Kyoko grabbed one of the manager's hands and dragged her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-b-but what if she needs help putting the outfit on!

It feels so indecent...\u201d Ruri blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon't worry, Kuroneko-chan. It feels odd at first, but the uniform is really comfortable\u201d Kyoko reassured her. Slowly stepping out into the eyesight of the two older women, Kuroneko's lithe form was revealed. The combination of her cat ears, tail, beautiful costume, and embarrassed face proved to much for Ryoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, Kuroneko! You're just so CUTE!\u201d The enormous owner bounded over to her, causing the room to shake. \u201cI could just EAT YOU UP!\u201d She squeezed Ruri into a bear hug, covering the tiny girl in copious amounts of fabric-covered flesh. Ryoko's huge belly pushed into Ruri's body, while her gigantic breasts covered her face, smothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMmf!\u201d Ruri mumbled as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh sorry, dearie, I forget my own size sometimes.\u201d Ryoko pulled away from the young girl, allowing her to breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh dear, I thought I was done for for a moment there\u201d Ruri said.

Sauntering off, she stopped and turned back to Ruri for some final advice. \u201cI'm sure you'll be fine, love. Just try to relax. Kyoko-chan will be taking care of you, so you've nothing to worry about. Oh, and just let me know whenever your outfit starts to feel a little tight, so I can get you a new one.

The enticing smells of the food as they grilled and boiled on the stove tempting her; however she remained resolute and refused to partake of their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been several months since the Gokou family had moved from their house into a small apartment in another city. Her father had gotten a new, better paying job, and living in an apartment had reduced their expenses, so things were looking up for them; however they had yet to remove the shackles of living on a strict budget. Both of their parents still had to work, leaving Kuroneko/Ruri the sole caretaker of her little sisters, and with their appetites perking up lately it was only made harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, the middle sister, had gotten rather greedy lately, but Ruri knew it was the result of both a growth spurt and becoming a member of the school track team, bot of which demanded an increase in fuel for her young and growing body. Tamaki, the youngest and being the innocent, impressionable child she was, was simply imitating her older sibling, increasing her food intake in an attempt to assimilate Hinata's new eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the financial strain of the moving expenses, new school expenses, and numerous other money sinks, their current budget for food was incredibly tight. To save her family the financial strain and still provide enough food for her little sisters, she decided to opt herself out of the food supply, eating only at breakfast, having a light snack before bed, and eating at whatever meals her parents happened to be present for. After two weeks of this though her stomach had become extremely irritable, growling and rumbling constantly throughout the day, even just after eating breakfast. It made things awkward in school when they would be listing to a lecture of doing a quiz and the silence would be broken by noises emanating from Ruri's irritable gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\", she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the smaller girls stampeded into the bathroom to wash up and Ruri barely had time to place the food on the table before they arrived and shouted \"Itadakimas\" and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat to fast\", she chided her young charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grinned sheepishly while Tamaki simply obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri sighed and simply returned to the kitchen to start cleaning up the mess from cooking, and by the time she finished those the dishes from dinner would be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother irritable growl from her stomach reminded her of her pressing issue. For two weeks she had been at this, and it was starting to create negative effects on her. Her stamina was so low that she could barely get through PE during school, and traveling to Akihabara and searching for a rare figurine had almost been to much for her. She couldn't keep this up much longer. If she did, she would worry her parents and her attempted contribution to helping her family would fall flat, forcing her to postpone her allowance as an alternative, something she needed for her hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gentle tug at her apron and she looked down to see Tamaki standing there holding up her dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cleaned my plate\", she stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri smiled and accepted the dishes before patting her on the head. \"You're a good girl for bringing your dishes too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki was an exceptionally well behaved child, impressionable and naive yes, but well behaved and well meaning. Tamaki always brought her dishes to the sink when she was finished, something the older Hinata rarely did, so Ruri was always sure to praise the younger girl for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to eat Nee-san?\" Tamaki asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri turned her face away and replied: \"No, i'm fine Tamaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl frowned. \"But I never see you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat with everyone at breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's it\", Tamaki protested. \"Aren't you hungry Nee-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri smiled at her concern and kneeled to down to pet her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your big sister\" Ruri told her, \"and my job is to make sure you and Hinata have as much to eat as you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki pouted. \"But that's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri sighed, but held her smile. \"It's all part of being a big sister. It's about being responsible and setting an example for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki looked sad. \"Being a big sister is hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri let out a little laugh and pulled her baby sister into a hug. \"Yes it is, but it's worth it when you have a good girl like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri was happy when the praise managed to elicit a giggle from Tamaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you promise me something then Nee-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me that when things are better you'll eat lots, and lots, and lots, and lots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri laughed again, but she understood what Tamaki was trying to say, and as if to agree, her stomach had remained obediently silent during this warm sibling exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise Tamaki.\" The two girls hooked their pinkies together, sealing the deal and Tamaki ran off to play, leaving Ruri alone again with the dishes, but no longer in the dour mood she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki somehow always managed to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tamaki gone however, her stomach resumed its complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You on the other hand-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri knew now that she had no choice. If she was going to avoid serious problems in the near future she would have to take care of her stomach soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruri groaned as she walked home from school, her book bag felt as though it was full of lead, and during PE she nearly fainted from her lack of energy. She stopped and leaned against a fence, clutching her midsection with a free hand. It felt like her stomach was trying to eat out her insides, and it was painful. She had no idea that starving oneself could be so excruciating. With some reluctance she acknowledged that she had no choice but to dip into her personal funds to fill her imploding gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a place where my money can go the farthest\" she grunted as she started walking again. A buffet seemed like the logical choice but Japanese food buffets were fairly expensive and she needed her money to go as far as possible. Ruri had heard of a western style buffet from her classmates which had opened nearby a few weeks ago and western food was sometimes cheaper-if lower quality, and it was the closest place as far as she knew so she summoned the last of her strength and started in the direction to find it. Her stomach even stopped hurting as if to encourage her, but also saying 'you'd better feed me'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet wasn't hard to find, it was among a group of small office buildings and a large sign saying \"All you can eat western grub\" indicated where she needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a tasteless title\" she muttered. Her hunger didn't give her the option to be picky however and the hourly charge seemed reasonable enough so she gritted her teeth and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior was as tacky as the title. The inside was full of 'cowboy' type paraphernalia, like wagon wheels, wooden barrels, ropes, and even cattle skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just gets worse and worse\" she muttered but her stomach was starting to act up again so she pressed forward to the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, welcome to Western Grub\" she greeted cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They even try to greet you in English.' \"One hour of all you can eat please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure little miss\" The cashier took her money and printed our her receipt. \"Pick a table, grab some grub and chow down!\" She said as Ruri walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How corny can you get?' Ruri thought as she found her self a secluded spot in the corner to set down her bag and then went to the buffet line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was currently the twilight between lunch and dinner rushes so there weren't very many people. She grabbed a plate, which was quite large, and looked at the spread of food before her. She recognized some like mashed potatoes, beans and steak but there was so much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This your first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri turned her head and saw another girl wearing a yellow one piece dress uniform in contrast to Ruri's dark blue sailor fuku. This girl was a from another school, a fancy one judging by the uniform. Her hair was a medium brown and her eyes a bright green. She was also fairly tall, not as much as Saori but at least 165cm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\" Ruri answered simply. \"Much of the food looks strange to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl giggled. \"Yes, it does look different from what most Japanese people eat. Here let me help you out.\" The girl dumped a large mound of mashed potatoes onto Ruri's plate and then started heaping ham, sausages and something she didn't recognize. She then went over to a dispenser and drowned the mashed potatoes in gravy before handing Ruri back her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's eat together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Ruri wanted to eat alone she doubted the girl would take 'no' for an answer and besides that she didn't want to be rude after she had helped her, although Ruri had never carried such a heavy plate meant for one person before. She lead the girl to her table and the two sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Yuuki by the way\" the girl said. \"It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruri Gokou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruri? That's a cute name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri grimaced slightly. Yes she had a cute name and it bothered her a bit sometimes, hence one of the reasons she preferred to go by 'Kuroneko', but if she was honest she didn't hate the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's dig in before it gets cold\" Yuuki said as she started cutting up her steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri sighed and picked up her fork. She took a bit out of the gravy soaked mashed potatoes and put it in her mouth. She moaned softly as the taste hit her tongue, the gravy, which she'd never tasted before, seemed to enhance the taste of everything it touched and as she savored the taste her stomach seemed to shout 'GIMMIE GIMMIE GIMIIE!' She swallowed and her whole body seemed to relax a bit, finally with something to sustain it and knowing more was on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good isn't it?\" Yuuki grinned, watching the smaller girl's reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri blushed slightly. \"Y-yes. The food here is surprisingly despite the tacky decor and lazy presentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuki laughed. \"Don't you think if it was presented fancy like other places it wouldn't match the atmosphere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's true\" Ruri said right before she shoveled more gravy lathered mashed potatoes into her mouth. \"I suppose here the theme is quantity, not quality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a buffet, that's how it should be\" Yuuki grinned. \"Now speaking of quantity, let's dig in and get this quantity in our bellies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri needed little encouragement. The food was delicious and she was starving so she began shoveling the food in as fast as she could swallow it. She finished off the potatoes and then gobbled up the ham and sausages with a speed and gusto that surprised herself. It took barely ten minutes for Ruri to clean her plate and the girl leaned back and put a hand on her stomach, now happy to have some real food in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're not full yet\" Yuuki said as she finished. \"You paid for an hour right? It's only been about fifteen minutes since you got here probably so let's make the most of our money and take up the whole hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat more?\" Ruri wasn't sure. True she had only been here for a small fraction of the time she paid for but she'd already eaten a fair amount and though her stomach still yearned for more 'grub' she wasn't eager to make a pig of herself either.</span></div></div>",

She loaded up on beans, steak, exotic strawberries, blackberries and a few bread sticks before returning to her table with Yuuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Ruri asked, gesturing to an unfamiliar food item on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are buffalo wings\" she answered. \"It's chicken but with vinegar and spices and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is see. I'm not really into spicy food, but I suppose I'll try some chicken on the next trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuki grinned. \"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri ate up her beans first and then spent some time savoring the strawberries and blackberries. The fruit tasted so juicy and it provided a nice variety to all the meat she'd eaten thus far, and would eat. She then attacked the large steak which took up half her plate by itself. It took the girl nearly half an hour to go through the large piece of meat, by the end of which she was thoroughly stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuugggghhhhh, so full\" she groaned, gently rubbing her stomach through her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, c'mon Ruri\" Yuuki complained. \"You haven't tried the chicken yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri grunted. Yes she wanted to try some of the chicken but she was already so full. Feeling her midsection through her shirt she felt it sticking out, creating a small bump that was very firm, indicating just how stuffed she was, even her stomach didn't ask for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have fifteen minutes\" Yuuki went on. \"It would be a shame to waste it when there's so much more to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri winced but relented. \"Alright, but just some chicken and you have to get it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl grinned. \"Done.\" She got up and left to fill up Ruri's plate while Ruri sat and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food line was properly crowded now as the dinner rush began. Speaking of which she would have to make sure she got home in time to feed her young siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a belch escaped her lips and the girl covered her mouth is shock and shame. The burp had come out of nowhere and had been embarrassingly loud. Ruri's cheeks burned and was thankful that the ambient noise of conversation and feasting was loud enough to drown it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Yuuki returned with a smaller plate of chicken. \"We've only got ten minutes so I got you boneless chicken to make it easier for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri was greatful for that, but even then there was still five pieces of chicken, any one of which would take up half the space on an ordinary dinner plate. Ruri wasn't sure she could finish them all but she was running out of time so she began quickly cutting up all the pieces into bite sized chunks and then one after the other began stabbing piece after piece with her fork and quickly putting it into her mouth. By the end of the third piece her stomach was quite disgruntled, emitting worrying creaking and groaning sounds as she started on the fourth piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ruri, you can do it! Just two full pieces and three minutes left.\" Yuuki encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy for her to say, but regardless Ruri couldn't let herself stay longer than the hour and she refused to waste food so she pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was physically hurting as she ate the fourth piece but she ignored it as she passed the two minute mark and slowly forced the bits of the fifth slice down her throat, finally putting the last bite in her mouth and then swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and slumped in her seat, finally finished and her belly ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Yuuki exclaimed. \"You're quite the impressive eater for such a small girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh, fo-foolish girl, mere mortal substances are no match for the queen of the nig- *urp*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuki laughed. \"Well, we'd better go. We've only got about 30 seconds before our time is up. I'll put our plates away, you just head for the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri groaned again. She didn't want to move, she just wanted lie down and nurse her aching tummy, but she knew she'd be penalized if she did and she had to be home in time to make dinner for her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly stood up from her slumped position and tentatively grabbed her bag. She didn't want to bend her torso too much. Lances of pain went through her stomach every time she did so. She stood up straight and walked out with as much dignity as she could muster. Her loose sailor fuku did a surprisingly good job of hiding her distended stomach, which she could only feel at the moment. She would find out when she got home just how big it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fantastic!\" Yuuki said as she came out. \"You feel like doing this again here tomorrow? I'd be happy to buy you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri looked at her. She really didn't feel like eating anything at the moment and almost the mention of eating more made her queasy; however a hearty breakfast tomorrow sounded good before she had to go out and buy several newly released manga that same day, especially if it was free. Also there was the promise she made with Tamaki. \"Very well. Perhaps 9 O'clock then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. You need help getting home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm fine.\" Ruri said with a hint of terseness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuki didn't notice. \"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.\" Yuuki ran off, leaving the severely bloated and stuffed Ruri to go home on her own. At least she didn't live far from there, in fact she could see her building from where she stood, but it was still at least ten blocks away. She groaned as she lumbered home. \"I hope nothing happens on the way, or else I'll never make it in time. She had barely an hour and a half from now to finish dinner for her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhh, *urp* After all this trouble, I deserve a free meal.\" She said to herself.</span></div></div>",

Saori Makishima, or Saori Bajeena as she is called, stood at 183 centimeters(6 feet) and weighed in at 64 kilograms(143 pounds) and her three sizes were 91/61/92, with a next perky full bosom under her green checkered long sleeve. She still towered over the group and supported a nice full D-cup bosom. What was unique in Saori\u2019s case was that she couldn\u2019t take the entrance exam when she was 18 due to going on a globe wide trip with the family as a result of winning a lottery, only increasing their finances even more. The mecha otaku promised to the Kousaka family she would help pay for the Condo and cover Ruri\u2019s expenses, earning the goth otaku\u2019s gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Smiled Kyosuke bashfully. \u201cYou are covering for half of the place after all. Felt good getting out of that dorm. Plus, it\u2019s so close to campus we can talk and don\u2019t use the car that often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea!\u201d Said a melodic voice which made Kirino roll her eyes again. It didn\u2019t help that Kuroneko was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Manami too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plain and pleasant Manami Tamura was already a student at the university, and she has grown up since Kirino last saw her, and to think that she had three years to herself for Kyosuke\u2026unforgiveable! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManami stood next to Saori smiling like always, standing at 173 centimeters(5 feet 6 inches) and weighing at 55 kilograms(121.25 pounds) and her three sizes at 89/62/90, another of the group having a decent bust size of a C-cup. As much Kirino hated to admit, despite her B cup, three others had her beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her good friend next to Manami wasn\u2019t eager to show it off, like with Manami\u2019s cut open blouse and Saori\u2019s buttoned down, revealing cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dear friend Ayase Aragaki took the same exam test as her, as well as applied to the same university, and it made the blonde feel comfortable. The dark haired girl, standing smiling as she observed her surroundings, stood at 170 centimeters (5 foot 5 inches), weighed at 48 kilograms(105.8 pounds) and her three sizes being 83/59/86. She was third in the power rankings of bust size, with C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all agreed to move into a new condo\u2026close to Uni\u2026under one roof for University as Kyosuke plans to take his Graduates courses next year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus begins a new life\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then pointed a finger at each person and did a tally count. One, two, three, four, five, and herself making six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying we have six rooms total?\" She asked incredulously. \"I mean, don't condo's usually have three rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We bought neighboring unites. They all connect in the garage.\" Said Kyosuke. \"Three rooms in each one. One kitchen, two bathrooms, one living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirino blinked, surprised. \"Wow. You actually thought this through.\" She crossed her arms. \"Guess your smart for something after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose getting his graduates program again?\" Snarked back the sole male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Kirino will get a graduates!\" Ayase spoke up, defending her long good friend. \"She just needs time first, you just have a head start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui oui easy now everyone,\" Saori said, calming things down. \"For now, let's see who is sleeping where okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good plan of action indeed,\" said Kuroneko in a calm and cold voice. \"It is best for us to think of our living arrangements, rather than bicker and quarrel,\" she took a look at Kirino. \"About nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! You just said the exact thing I said, only in a quieter voice Pretentious Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuri rolled her eyes. But the both of them looked back at Kyosuke...then back at each other. And sparks raged between their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe college student sighed, rubbing the back of his head. 'Their gonna fight over who sleeps in the same complex as me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head inside our new home to see the house's inside and see who sleeps where okay~?\" Winked Saori holding the floorplan and walking ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sure thing!\" Nodded Manami, following after the Gundam otaku with grace. Both Ruri and Kirino saw the meganeko walk past, and a thought came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She will try to get a room close to Kyosuke too!' Both of them thought at the same time. 'I won't lose to her!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ayase was thinking of having the same complex with Kirino, imagining the bathing together and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone followed Manami and Saori inside, there was a rumbling of a stomach...</span></div></div>",

Kirino and Ruri pointed fingers at each other, accusing the other of such unladylike behavior. They soon began to bicker, their tempers rising to a boiling point. Kyousuke rushed up to them, placing a firm hand on each of their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, both of you calm down right now. We're all hungry after a long day of getting here and lugging all of our luggage around. Let's just get settled and then we can figure out our food situation, alright?\" said the young man, doing his best to give a stern look towards his little sister and friend. Both girls pouted as they took their belongings and entered the condo. Everyone else followed, Ayase sticking to Kyosuke as he lifted the brunt of their things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Kyousuke, you've gotten pretty good at handling those two. I really admire that.\" said the girl with long blue hair, a sincere smile on her normally adorable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, its nothing, Its just how those to are after all. Do you need help with your bags?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no its fine! You're already carrying so much.\" Quickly walking towards the door, the girl drop her luggage inside and held open the door for the young man. Dropping off his things as well, he took a good look of his surroundings. The front door opened to a decent sized living room, with three white couches, some coffee tables and some decorative art. In front was the staircase to the second floor and to the right was the door to the garage, which lead to the other side of the condo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place is pretty impressive. Glad we can afford it.\" Everyone had gathered in the living room, awaiting the other two to see how they would arrange their living spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that everyone's here, let's discuss how we're going to split up the rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be with Kirino!\" shouted Ayase, raising her arm up high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be with Kyousuke!\" shouted Kirino and Manami at the same time, the orange haired young woman glaring at the one with glasses. Kyousuke gave out a nervous laugh. This was going to be troublesome indeed.</span></div></div>",

The only way to solve this housing issue was to draw straw, short ones would get the right side of the house and long one would get the left side of the house. Five tense minutes later and the drawings were done. Kyousuke, Ruri and Kirino would take the left side of the house, while Ayase, Manami and Saori would take the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kirino, we didn't get to room in the same house!\" shouted a hysterical Ayase, throwing her arms over Kirino's shoulders and started to whine. Kirino was silently happy that she could spend even more time with her brother but was still worried about Kuroneko. She was always a clever one and most likely had many plans up her small sleeves. Ruri held an air of victory but her face was as inexpressive as usual. Kyousuke himself was fine with the outcome, just as long as no one would fight over it. Looking over to his small black haired friend, he gave her a smirk, causing her face to glow a soft shade of red. She was always quite easy to tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, now that we got that settled, let's go put away our things real quick so we can go get a bite to eat. It's been a long day after all.\" said the tall Saori, once again taking a leadership role for the group. Manami was a bit disappointed in the outcome of things, but she would not let it deter her from her long time goal. Taking his own bags, Kyousuke decided to take the only room on the first floor, since he figured that it was the best way to give the girls some privacy. He left a whining Ayase with Kirino attempting to console her and went to the room. The room itself was of a decent size, with a medium sized bed, a wardrobe, a desk and even a brand new tv. Saori made sure that their living spaces would be fully furnished and come with a few extra perks as well. Setting down his bags and luggage, he sat on top of his bed, simply taking in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is going to be my room for the next four years huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is going to be our home.\" said Kuroneko, walking in through the door way, with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.\"</span></div></div>",
