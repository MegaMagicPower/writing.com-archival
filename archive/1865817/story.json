Soldiers came in to the to kill the experiment only to have it to shrug off bullets then killing all the soldiers and civilians in the area.

You backed the truck into an alley way and climbed up the fire escape to get on the roof. As you got to the top you were face-to-face with the owner holding a double barrell shotgun to your face. You stood there for what felt like an eternity with him giving you his hand to pull you up. You tell him you need guns and you can offer him protection. All he did was look at you and looked at a picture in his hand, you walk over to him and saw a beautiful blonde haired, blue eyes and what looked to be 18 year old girl in the picture. He says \"I tell you what you find my daughter and we have deal, she was last at the mall with her friends.\" You kept looking at his picture and said \"You got it old timer.\" As you walked to the steps you saw an explosion near the mall, you ran down the steps and got into your truck. As you pulled out of the alley noticed a lot more soldiers going the same direction as you were.

You reach around your neck and reveal your dog tags with you lowering your gun and getting behind cover, as you look around you see a bulldozer right next to you. As you got up and started to walk over to the heavy machinery the soldiers involved you in on the plan with the dozer, you were to drive the thing into it and put it in the back of an armored truck for transportation to safe location. With that you started the dozer up and alerted the zombie as you two collided you pick it up and got close to the truck and it smashed through the blade and tore through the engine you then jumped off of the dozer with three grenades in the seat. As it exploded you stood with your gun still pointed at the wreckage and just as rehearsed the zombie came walking out of the fire, with every soldier in the vicinity shooting at it. The zombie still standing you grab your machete and run over to the zombie cut its arm off and toss it in the back of the truck along with each body part. As you was finishing up you heard a high pitched scream from the mall you drop the machete and run inside just as you round the corner of the entrance. You saw a trail of blood leading to the womens restroom, along with three teenage girls clawing at the door you reach for your pistol and put a shot at the back of each girls head. As you examine each body you see a brunette, black, and a blonde as you were done examining the bodies out stepped a photo perfect teenage blonde hair blue eyed girl wearing a denim miniskirt and white blouse with a two inch heel combat boots. Realizing that the girls you shot must have been friends and she is the gun store owners daughter, you reach out your hand to take her to safety. Just as she was grasping what was going on around her, the two of you left mall you walk her to the truck and then you go grab your weapons you threw on the ground. On your way back to the truck you seen a hoard of zombies coming from the mall, you jumped in your truck and hauled ass out of there. As you were getting closer to the gun store she spoke up \"I am Kimberly you can call me Kim and thank you for saving me.\" You reached your hand to her face and wiped a tear away and said \"Don't worry about it and don't cry you have to be strong for times to come.\" Just as you finshed talking you arrived at the gun store you told her to stay put in the truck and you will get her father. As you were climbing up the ladder you seen the same double barrel shotgun in your face he then lowered his gun and extended a hand to pull you up. As the two of you made your way down stairs you open the back door athe both of you load the bed of the truck with all the guns and ammo in the store. As you were walking back to the truck you heard tires screeching to a halt in front of the store and then the window shattering you start the vehicle up and make it back to your house.</span></div></div>",

As they started you asked for one of your passengers to take the wheel, as you grabbed for your pistol only seeing two bullets in the clip and one in the chamber. You hung out the window and shot the passenger and took aim again and managed to shoot the wheel with it only swerving to the right once and last shot you took aim and shot the driver and taking a shot in your shoulder. As you came back in the window you continued driving only to be blocked by a sea of cars, as you looked around you saw that the sidewalk was clear except for a few zombies. You jumped the truck on the sidewalk and drove 30 feet and then turned between two cars, out of the corner of your eyes you saw two kids being cornered by zombies. Just as you got out the old man gave you his .32 snub nose revolver just then the girl got in the driver seat and drove out of the wreckage, you ran over to the kids and shot one bullet into the back of one the zombies and attracted the attention of the other two zombies. As you shot the second time nailing the second zombie between the eyes as you took shot at the third zombie, a zombie hand grabs your ankle and takes bite out of your leg. As you point the gun down and shoot the zombie that has hold of you the other zombie keeps walking toward you, when you hear a shot and the zombie falls you continue to shoot the other zombie. You walk over to the kids and asked where their parents were, then one of them points down at the corner of the street. You ask them to come with you to safety as you start to walk over to the truck you glance back after seeing the person on the roof go back inside. Back at your apartment you see the the lords daughter at the main holding one of your pistols.</span></div></div>",

I still had a headache from the party last night and my vision was still blurry, I shouldn\u2019t have drank that many alcohol, but what can you do if it was wild. I was so shitfaced that I was stumbling all over the floor like an idiot and hitting everything like a blind person. I made it out the door to hear some yelling and screaming with a large mess in the halls like everyone either partied hard or they left in the hurry, but I assumed that they just  went out to party even more. When I was wandering the halls my cell phone rang, I checked to see who it was and it was Darwin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Darwin, what's going on?\u201d I asked him while I was trying to stand up right and held my head <br>\r\n\u201cKaz, I need some help!\u201d Darwin said quickly and panicky while I heard some moaning and banging <br>\r\n\u201cAh jeez, sorry bro I am still shitfaced from last night, besides why don\u2019t you call security?\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cDammit Kaz I told you to not drink that much! And that is the problem the security is gone!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean gone?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? I am getting attacked by fucking zombies!\u201d Then I heard something break down and Darwin was screaming \u201cShit they got through! Better hurry over here before I get eaten! Cya, oy\u2019 get off of me!\u201d Then I was hanged up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh jeez, I hope that he isn\u2019t kidding, well better get to my- what the?\u201d I saw someone coming, it looked like one of the security guards but something didn\u2019t seem right \u201cHey! Buddy are you all right, shit what the hell stinks?\u201d While my vision was getting better I saw that his body and arm were bloodied, there was a bite on his arm and he looked like death, that was when his head went up and that I saw a bloodied face and eyes that looked like he was looking to feed. That was when he screeched or roared inhumanely and was running towards me \u201cAh shit!\u201d I ran fast back into my room and searched for a weapon, I found my Katana in the closet. When I turned back the zombie was standing right behind me, he grappled me and tried to bite me, but I kicked him back and I impaled him through the forehead with my katana. After that was over I grabbed my backpack filled with some supplies, got my TT-30 and Lee Enfield then I put on my gauntlets for beating zombies down. I checked the security zombie and found some keys; I walked out the door and went down the halls to save Darwin and to kick some zombie ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hospital--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up I was on a hospital bed, the place was illuminated brightly and it was suspiciously quite. I sat up feeling an agonizing pain in my left arm, I took a look at it and there was gauze wrapping around it with blood showing. <br>\r\n\u201cDamn what the hell happened?\u201d I looked around to see a backpack at the side of the bed and a note on the desk with a small box, I picked up the box and note and it read<br>\r\n\u201cKaz, there has been an accident involving you getting bitten by some sort of crazy old hobo with some sort of rabies so you were taken here. In this box contains a special present I wanted to give you for your birthday and there will be a backpack with some of your items, well I hope you get well soon\u201d<br>\r\nYours Truly \u2013 Darwin  <br>\r\nP.S Watch your back there has been some sort of epidemic going on involving people turning into some sort of cannibals and whatnot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, well damn, now what\u2019s in this box?\u201d I opened it to see a gun that resembled Darwin\u2019s Tokarev TT-30, one of his favorite guns. I got up from bed and checked the backpack to see that there were some regular rations, ammunition, my clothing, a Lee Enfield which I don\u2019t even know how he got that through and other misc items. I switched my patient gown with my regular clothes and was walking out into the hallway when I noticed that there was absolutely no one around, but a massive mess in the halls with open body bags and blood covering the walls. What the hell happened here, and where is everyone? I continued to walk out from the hospital and then I got outside\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in the middle of battle----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was on top of a large van and was shooting the undead while Darwin and 5 others were shooting off their weapons trying to defeat the massive hoards of zombies.  All I saw was panic in the streets and the zombies were quickly infecting everyone, I still can\u2019t believe people weren\u2019t fighting back and were completely unorganized making matters worse. <br>\r\n\u201cDammit there is just too many of them!\u201d Said one of the fighters <br>\r\n\u201cJust hold you\u2019re fucking ground, we shall not lose this spot!\u201d Said another fighter<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say! I have a dinky ass pistol you sleazy bastard while you have a SMG!\u201d said the other fighter <br>\r\n\u201cShut the fuck up both of you! If you argue as much as you fight then we would have finished this yesterday!\u201d I yelled and I continued firing with my Lee Enfield headshoting zombies left and right.

After charging through the halls I noticed tons of blood sprayed across the walls, broken doors and finally found dead bodies that were eaten, torn apart, and very mangled. I didn't bother to check the rooms or bodies since I was sure that their things would be gone and it would be a waste of my time, which I just realized I didn't know where Darwin was. I pulled out my cellphone and rang him up to see where he is,<br>\r\n\"Darwin where the hell are you? I have no clue where you are!\" I asked<br>\r\n\"Outside of the hotel in the cabana, huts, whatever you want to call them and-\" <br>\r\n\"Oh shit here they come!\" A female voice said and gunshots were fired<br>\r\n\"Crap there are too many of them! Fallback!\" Said a male voice and a loud scream of pain  <br>\r\n\"Aw shit! Meet us outside of the hotel, oy' get back to the hotel, there is backup there!\" <br>\r\n\"You better be right!\" Said the same female and then I got hanged up <br>\r\n\"Okay then, I better get outside\" I said to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to the elevators which were outside of the rooms area and had a nice view of the island, now if only there weren't fires, people getting eaten by zombies, and hell set loose out of it's chain this vacation would be better. I pressed the button and waited until I heard a zombie roar loudly I aimed my gun on the entrance where I came from \"They better not come out of there\" My hopes were crapped on when zombies came spewing out of the doorway running to try and eat my ass \"Eat this\" I shot into the oncoming group, but there were just coming out like they were in a clown car. That was when they were too close and I just used my katana and slashed them and knocked them back. I continued this until the elevator got up which I immediatley got in and quickly pressed the button while fighting the zombie that were still coming out, where the hell did they come from? Finally the elevator doors closed and went down while I took care of the straglers with me in it. Damn there was just rotten corpses all over the floor with blood all over the elevator and blood was just on me, it was just a bloodbath and I knew that whatever was outside the doors was even worse.

When I counted the zombies in my current field of vision there were about 8 to boot and probably more down the way. To conserve ammunition I switched to my katana and began walking out the door when one of the zombies spotted me, did an inhumane screech while charging at me which was quite a pitiful job when I easily decapitated him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your day had started like any other Saturday, with a hot shower and a hearty breakfast.  A little while later, a friend of yours had texted you and asked if you wanted to go to lunch at a cafe about a block up the street.  After agreeing, you'd pulled your long, red hair back into a ponytail, glanced at the nice weather outside, and gotten dressed.  Nothing fancy, just some jeans that made your ass pop and a tight tank top that emphasized your generous bust.  After stepping into a pair of flip-flops, you headed out the door of your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cafe was only a block away, you'd decided to walk and enjoy the weather.  On your way, you passed by the run-down warehouses that made your rent here so cheap.  The odd vehicle would come and go from them late at night, and it seemed every other night the cops were down there making a drug bust or investigating yet another murder.  A few times, there had been shootouts down there, and with the obvious criminal activity so close to your apartment, you'd gone and bought a small handgun for self-defense, and a shotgun for your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch had been pleasant, you and Alyssa swapping jokes and banter and generally enjoying yourselves.  After lunch, the two of you had parted ways, with Alyssa heading off to work, and you headed back to your apartment.  You'd barely made it a hundred feet from the cafe, though, when all hell broke loose in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first indication of trouble had been the dull chatter of automatic gunfire from the warehouses.  You'd stopped, cursing your luck, as what seemed to be another gang war broke out between you and home.  A few moments later, as a swarm of black SUV's screeched to a halt around the warehouses and disgorged dozens of men in black fatigues with rifles and body armor, you realized it wasn't just a gang war.  You watched as the soldiers poured into the warehouse district, listened to the ongoing chatter of gunfire and the *CRUMP* of grenades, and cringed.  As the gunfire died off, you watched as a handful of soldiers came sprinting back out of the warehouse district, pausing only to fire frantic bursts back into it.  Behind them, what appeared to be people came shambling out of the warehouses, strange keening groans carrying over the sporadic gunfire still peppering them.  Behind them, something larger loomed, completely ignorant of the bullets whizzing around.  With a sudden roar, it jumped the fence and the cordon of SUV's, landing amidst several of the soldiers, proceeding to tear into them as they continued to pepper it with bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther spectators nearer to the carnage, busy videoing the ongoing drama, were the first to fall to the zombies pouring out of the facility.  The mob of spectators suddenly shifted backwards, screams of pain and terror rising over even the groans of the undead, as the mob started to panic, people stumbling and shoving each other as they tried to get away from the horde.  It looked like the beginning of those bad zombie horror films your ex had made you watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the screams came closer, and people sprinted past you, you watched someone fall, and a pair of the zombies fall on top of her.  Her screams of terror turned to pain as blood sprayed from her neck, and that's when you finally realized they really WERE zombies.  You swore, pulling your little pistol from your purse, realizing that three six-round magazines weren't going to dent this horde, but taking some small comfort in it's presence as you ran through your extremely limited options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apartment held all of your spare rounds for your handgun, your shotgun, and some spare shells, plus about a week's worth of canned food and water, but it was on the other side of the swelling horde.  You knew you couldn't fight your way through the horde, though you might be able to skirt around it and sneak back into your apartment.  Alternately, you could seek shelter and supplies somewhere else.  There were a few military surplus stores that sold guns and old military gear away from the horde.  You could also just duck back into the cafe and try to wait out the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne way or another, you needed to make a decision, and now, before the horde actually reached you.</span></div></div>",

Behind you, you could hear the continued screams of people and groans of zombies mixing into an endless cacophony of horrific noise.  Fifty feet down, the alley bent turned left, then met another alleyway.  As you hit the T-intersection, a blood-curdling scream erupted to your left, and you immediately looked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man was laying on the ground with a zombie's jaw clenched around his forearm and another descending toward his neck.  A third one noticed you, a keening wail escaping its' throat as it started moving towards you, its' unblinking eyes seeming to glow an eerie red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamped down on the bile rising in your throat, as you debated trying to help the man, or just flee for your life.</span></div></div>",

You hadn't practiced much with your pistol, and it only held six rounds.  As the zombie lurching your way drew close enough for you to smell its' rotten breath, you fired two panicked shots at it, then turned down the right side of the alley and ran, not bothering to see if you had killed it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately found yourself cursing your choice of footwear.  Flip-flops were a poor choice for running in, and they were slowing you down.  A few seconds later, you stumbled over one as it caught on something, sending you tumbling into a pile of garbage.  As you rolled over and staggered to your feet, you risked a glance behind you.  The zombie you had shot at was doggedly pursuing you, and was all of about thirty feet away.  Worse, the other two zombies had finished with the man, and were coming your way, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a faint squeal of panic left your lips, you pointed your pistol at the closest zombie and fired the last four rounds in your magazine at it.  Two of them missed completely, another hit it in the arm, and the last hit it in the chest.  To your horror, the zombie only staggered a bit at the two small rounds hitting it, but was otherwise unaffected, continuing its' steady shambling march toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a full-fledged shriek of terror, you kicked off the damned flip-flops, and sprinted barefoot up the alleyway, barely noticing how the rough concrete bit into your bare soles, nor the filth you were running through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you, you could see a couple of doors that opened into the alleyway, and past them, where it crossed another street.  Maybe one of the doors would be unlocked, and you could take refuge in a building.  Ahead of you, you could hear sirens wailing as police and EMS teams responded to the growing crisis, and the muffled pops of more gunfire.  Maybe the police could help you, though that would lead away from your apartment.</span></div></div>",

With the first zombie still dangerously close to you, you turned and sprinted for the next door, across the alley to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed into the door in your haste to get to it, bouncing off with a resounding thud, the door rattling in its' frame, as you reached for the door handle with a shaking hand.  Looking back at the approaching zombies again, you frantically twisted the knob, and released a relieved sob as the door opened.  You squeezed through it even as you opened it, your tank-top snagging on the battered frame, then releasing with a rip as you popped through the door.  You slammed it shut behind you, fumbling for the lock as the first zombie arrived at the door, slamming its' fists against it.  As the lock clicked home, you backed slowly away from the door, gasping for breath, your heart pounding in your chest.  From the way the door was shaking, you knew it wouldn't hold the horde back for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaking hands, you fumbled with reloading your pistol, finally getting the old magazine out and into your purse and a new one inserted, as more zombies began to beat on the door.  As the slide slammed home, chambering a new round, you noticed the white rag dangling in the doorway.  Looking down, you realized your tank-top had been torn, ripping a piece of it away from your right breast and tearing the thin strap free, leaving the right side of your bra exposed.  Cursing again, you realized you needed a better shirt, and shoes, and a better gun, and friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed the panic that threatened to consume you again, turned and padded deeper into the building, wondering just where you were.
