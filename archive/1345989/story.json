They're 50 minutes late.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep thrumming sound began to play through the wide valley behind the scientist as he looked around frenetically, searching for the source of the sound.<br>\r\nAs the scientist squinted his eyes he could just make out of the other side of the valley what looked like some sort of jeep that was passing over the crest of the hill.<br>\r\n'What on earth are they doing?' Inquired the man as the jeep leaped heroically off the hill, doing a flip during it's descent and landed a good 25 feet from where it left the ground, the landing causing a short vibration that caused a little wave in a pond, disturbing an impossibly fat frog that leaped out of the pond and landed next to the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientists reaction was nothing short of petrified as he jumped as though a kitten with very sharp claws had just been inserted, kicking and screaming, into his rear. Normally he wouldn't have reacted that way to a frog, but this was no ordinary frog. No, this frog had been living in the pond next to the building of InterCorp, the pond coincidentally being in the exact same spot as where InterCorp dispensed it's nuclear radioactive waste.<br>\r\nThis frog indeed was no ordinary frog as it stood at four feet tall and was as wide as the local feminist that claims that all she needs to satisfy her is chocolate. It was also very hungry, and shot out an enormous tongue at the scientist, engulfing him in taste buds so big that they had their own individual scent. Before the frog could actually devour the screaming scientist however the jeep landed 10 feet away. </span></div></div>",

The jeep was jet black and stood at 10 feet tall, the wheels making most of the height.<br>\r\nA whirring could be heard coming from the jeep as the sun roof opened. The frog, bored with the jeep now, went back to eating the scientist, slowly drawing him into the gaping jaw. Just before the scientist landed in the mouth a black figure flew out of the sun roof and landed right next to the frog, slicing at the the tongue and separating the scientist and the frog. The frog released a deep guttural groan as it turned around to face the new presence, it's tongue spraying purple blood everywhere, (it is a mutant after all).<br>\r\nThe figure was a small man, decked out in a black suit and bristling with so many sharp weapons that a porcupine would have been cowering. In his hand was a sleek Katana, purple blood running down it's razor sharp edge. The frog suddenly drew it's tongue back into it's mouth, letting the saliva's regenerative powers do their job on the tongue.<br>\r\nThe frog and the man suddenly faced each other, both wondering who would make the first move. The frogs leg muscles bunched up for another leap, the man dropping what seemed like a steel piton from his sleeve.<br>\r\nThe frog pounced over the man intending to crush him, since it's tongue had been deprived from it. The man however leapt aside with fast reactions and threw the piton into the side of the beast, steel spikes punching through rubbery flesh and digging in with reversed barbs.<br>\r\nThe frog didn't feel this though and continued to hop away, the jet black man being dragged along by the arm, the piton being attached to his arm.<br>\r\nThe man quickly recovered though and drew out a long wide shield from his back and threw it to the ground, planting his feet firmly into the grooves he quickly produced a makeshift surfboard. The man, now standing and ready, drew his Katana and started pulling the line in, slowly getting closer to the frog that was right now hopping in circles. Little did the man know though the frog was only waiting. The salivas in it's gullet got to work on the tongue, leaking all over torn tissue and blood cells, mending them as it went.<br>\r\nThe frog stopped and turned. The man suddenly ground to a halt and was thrown off balance, momentarily incapacitated. The frog took it's chance and tensed, it's throat muscles constricting and building until it's tongue flew out at the man like a ballistic missile. The tongue hit the man with the force of a battering ram and the sticking force of fly paper, knocking the man flying and leaving him trapped by the enormous tongue.<br>\r\n'Cameron!' Yelled the small man as he was being dragged slowly into the gaping maw of the frog.<br>\r\nThe door of the jeep flew open and a mammoth man walked out, hardly having to use the steps as he dropped the 10 feet of the jeep. He slowly built up speed as he ran to the frog...</span></div></div>",

The monster truck then stopped, leaving a tire track of frog guts along the floor. The doors of the car opened and two rednecks stepped out.<br>\r\n'Enus, you idiot, you gone did run over the guy who gone give us the job.'

God however compensated this lack of brain matter for a smoking body, her buxom form gliding down the street to her job.<br>\r\nSam entire body was something to admire as her blond hair led down to her well endowed rack that was only just contained by her racing t-shirt and sports bra.<br>\r\nAnother point that could be made about Sam was that while she was thick as a big print copy of the complete works of Harry Potter, her body didn't hold an ounce of excess fat, her well toned stomach betraying her many hours at the gym, sweat glistening over her long legs as they were resplendently encased in knee length shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha finally got to her destination after about five minutes of walking, (she could have lasted way longer than that.) She took in the view of Intercorp, a large concrete block in the middle of a big valley with a lake on one side of the building. On the front of the building in big neon lights was the companies slogan, 'InterCorp, the corporation of interest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam entered the entrance of the building a sleazy looking man in a scientists get up walked over to her. 'Hello can I help you?' The man proclaimed nasally with a look of disdain.<br>\r\n'Yes, I'm here about your ad asking for subjects?' Replied Sam, holding the newspaper cutting in front of her and just inches away from the mans hook nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh an applicant,' claimed the man, his demeanor changing from disdainful to interested in a flash. 'Step right this way, my dear.' Continued the man directing her to a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked through the door, however as soon as her foot passed the threshold, the door slammed shut, and an audible thud gave the impression that a lock had just activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a whirring started in the room and Sam took a moment to look around, the room was made of what seemed like a transparent perspex, with some sort of light that ran along the interior of the perspex. As Sam looked closer, the whirring got louder and the lights came to life. The room began to distort around Sam as though the room was spinning. Beginning to get dizzy, Sam laid down on the floor, not noticing that it seemed to be getting larger. As the room began to return to normal Sam couldn't shake the feeling that something but she couldn't out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scientist walked back into the room he looked down on Sam.

He is tall, cold, and ruthless, yet he can be a bit of a pervert sometimes. His personal assistant, Dr. James Alexander, follows him into the chamber. James is 30-years-old, short in height, and a bit over weight; he\u2019s also very creepy looking too. He\u2019s highly intelligent, with a twisted, nearly sick personality. He has short, kind of messy dark blonde hair, brown eyes, and he hasn\u2019t shaved in over three days.

David was looking at the girl with the thought of scientific at the fact that they have finally managed to shrink specimens without them dying, (the first experiment occurred with a man who's skin and bone structure shrunk however the shrinking did not go as far as the organs inside. It was basically a very messy explosion.) James was looking at the girl with perverted ideas, after all a shrunken girl had always been his fondest daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grabbed James by the shoulders roughly, 'quick we don't know if the fact that she's alive is temporary or not, we need to run tests fast.' <br>\r\nThis was music to James' ears as he was already preparing the examination table, 'right away sir.' However James' malevolent grin dripped away as soon as his superior placed the girl on to the examination table and wheeled it into the next room.<br>\r\n'You'd better stay here James, we both know the way you feel about shrunken women, lets give the security teams a break from seeing your depraved acts shall we.' At this David pointed to the security camera in the corner.<br>\r\n'Oh all right.' Agreed James with a classic pout.<br>\r\nDoctor David moved Sam into the next room and shut the door.

Her wrists are bound to the table by clear scotch tape, and her ankles are secured to the table with scotch tape too. To Sam, this scotch tape is as strong as steel. As Sam lay their moaning, she could barley make out a fuzzy image of what looked like a giant old man standing above her. She saw the giant man looking her over with a giant magnifying glass. She thought this was some kind of kinky dream, or something. Then she saw him grabbing for something big as she is, and it was sharp looking too. She then saw it being brought towards her. This is no dream; this is a nightmare, she thought, as she screamed in a tiny voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n David giggled sinisterly, as Sam saw his small scissors coming towards her and she began screaming with her now tiny voice for help. She almost looked like Fay Ray being molested by King Kong, and this naturally gave him a huge power trip. \u201cBefore I go on young lady, I must know a few things about you for our records. Like your name, age, boyfriends, and do you have any family?\u201d David asked. The reason why David asked about her family was to protect him, and the project from any lawsuits, or being arrested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam looked up at him, and said, \u201cMy name is Sam, short for Samantha. I just turned 18 a few days ago. I have no boyfriends. I have two sets of grandparents, a mother, and father. I also have a younger bother, and two younger sisters.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow old are your siblings?\u201d David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy younger sisters are 15, and 13. My little brother just turned 14 a few weeks ago, and they might come by here soon, so you better let me go!\u201d Sam replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cInteresting, I\u2019m sure they to will make excellent specimens too!\u201d he said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSpecimens, you leave me, and them alone, or else!\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she protested, and screamed \u201cNO!\u201d David began cutting. She could feel the cold dull blade of his scissors pressing against her hip, easily cutting her shorts to shreds, along with her pink panties. In a matter of a few seconds, she is completely bottomless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo the carpet matches the drapes.\u201d David said wickedly, as he looked down to see a little patch of blond hair in-between her slim legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Out of modesty, and shame, she tried desperately to close her legs, but it is in vain. David then repeats the process, this time with Sam\u2019s shirt. Again, she could feel the cold, dull metal of his scissors pressing against her slim stomach, as David easily shredded her shirt, and bra. As David lifted Sam\u2019s clothes off of her chest, she is left completely nude. He then sees her tiny, yet large breasts bouncing around, and David had to admit, they are lovely to look at. David finally understands why his assistant has a fascination with tiny people, and it is making David feel like a god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then all of the sudden, James comes running in with the Mayor, who angrily screams out, \u201cWHERE IS MY DAUGHTER, SAMANTHA?

The Mayor then sees a naked, and extremely life like doll, about 6-inch tall, strapped to a near by table. The Mayor has a confused look on his face, when he sees the dolls head start to move around, and he sees her slender legs moving too. The Mayor figured that the doll was some kind of small, advanced life like robot, very life like. The tits on that doll are fantastic; they even wiggled back and forth like real boobs. The Mayor\u2019s eye then scrolled down, and saw a tiny patch of golden fur in-between her legs. Amazing the Mayor thought, as he ogled Sam\u2019s tiny nude body. Then the Mayor looked at the dolls face, and got the shock of his life. He saw the doll resembled Samantha\u2019s face, his own daughter. The Mayor immediately rationalized that Sam must have modeled for this toy, that\u2019s all. The thought of him lusting after it disturbed him, as he let go of David. The Mayor then heard the doll speak in a mouse like voice, \u201cIts me daddy, help me!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the Mayor reaches out in shock to help his daughter, and he stupidly turns his back on David. Out of fear, David grabs a tranquilizer dart, and stabs the Mayor in the shoulder. The mayor falls to the ground unconscious, but unharmed. \u201cQuick James, help me carrying him into the chamber\u201d David ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat about the rest of his family\u201d David asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell trick them into going into the chamber too\u201d David responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n James has a strange look on his face, when David told him, \u201cOk, after I examine them, you can have some of them, ok!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n James smiled wickedly, and quickly helped David move the sleeping Mayor into the chamber. After they accomplished their task, they told his family that there was an accident, and he was resting in a secured room. The entire family ran into the chamber, where he rested. David and James then activated the chamber. The Mayors family quickly shrank down to around 6 inches tall, along with their clothes. As the tiny family laid in the chamber unconscious, David smiled and said boldly, \u201cWell, it now seems we now have five new specimens for study\u201d.   </span></div></div>",

James then turns around to see that the doors are closing, and he makes a run for the double doors, but he doesn\u2019t make it. James turns around, and screams angrily at David, but he just ignores him, and smiles, David then activates the chamber. The tiny sleeping family remains 6 inches tall, but James however, shrinks down to around 6 inches tall, and he too is still clothed. A few seconds later, the door opens up, and in walks David, smiling down evilly at tiny James. David then says, \u201cWell, it seems I now have a volunteer for vivisection.\u201d David didn\u2019t want to harm the tiny family, at least not yet, and he didn\u2019t want to share them with that dork James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n An hour later, as David throws James\u2019s now tiny, lifeless, dissected corpse into the trash, and washes the blood off is hands, the tiny family starts to awaken. The five new specimens are the 40-year-old Mayor Richard, his pretty 37-year-old wife Helen, their handsome 14-year-old son Jason, and their teenage daughters, 15-year-old Julie, and 13-year-old Rebecca. They are all still clothed and trapped inside a glass jar. Except for 18-year-old Sam, she is still taped to the desk, spread eagle, and completely naked.

David then walks over to the table where the tiny family is currently being kept, and looks at them, still amazed that the chamber actually works. David smiles at them, as the cuss at him in the jar, with their now tiny voices. David then gets a long pair of tweezers, grabs Mayor Richards by his waist, and lifts him out of the jar. As the tiny man kicks, and screams in anger, David places him on top of the table, next to his daughter Samantha. David yells at him to stop, but David just ignores Richard, as he grabs for a small pair of scissors, and some scotch tape. David forces Richard to get into a spread eagle position, and then David securely tapes Richards\u2019s arms, and legs down. David quickly and effortlessly removes all of Richards\u2019s clothes, leaving the tiny man naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n David then repeated the process over, and over again. After a few short minutes, all six of the family members are now securely taped to the desk, and completely naked in a spread eagle position. All of the family members yell at David in their tiny voices, \u201cTo stop\u201d.

First they watched as David went into what looked like an epileptic fit, and then they watched as his pink skin was replaced with green skin. David\u2019s whole transformation takes less then a minute. Richard and Jason look on in horror, as the four females began blindly panicking at what they saw. David no longer looked human, standing before the six tiny helpless nude humans, was a gigantic alien creature. This alien has greenish skin, big black eyes, a wide mouth, long arms, and legs. It also has long fingers and no hair on its thick body, they cloud also see that it was most defiantly a male. Then the David alien creature spoke, \u201cDo you like my native form? Judging by your reaction, I say no!\u201d David said laughing evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow here my words carefully,\u201d David demanded. \u201cMy species translated into your language is called the Krackton. My true name is unpronounceable by your people, so will continue to call me David, understand!\u201d Everyone ether nodded yes, or was too terrified to move. David smiled, and said, \u201cI will take that as compliance. I am a scientist, sent here to study your species.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, Richard yelled in his tiny voice, \u201cHow did you build this place, and what do you want with us?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n David then said, \u201cThis scientific facility was actually built by your own people. However, less then one year ago, my own people began infiltrating this facility in order to carry out our own experiments, and it was the perfect cover. We now control everything around here, including the security force, and I can assure you, you will not be rescued.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n David continued, \u201cAll six of you are perfect living human specimens, of various ages, and we want you for lab rats if you will. We built this chamber in order to see if living creatures could safely be reduced down to a few inches, and it appears to have worked. Every one of you looks healthy, but I will have to run some tests on you all, to know for certain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny humans watched helplessly as David grabbed several things, and placed them on the table next to them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dank.<br>\r\nDank and dismal, those were the only words you could describe this room with. The room was in such disuse that pipes leaked over the ground. The occupant in the room was a girl by the name of Rachel Parker. 21 years old and still a virgin, she was what could be called a prude. Even though she was quite an attractive girl and could possibly have her pick of the men, with her auburn hair and pristine features that looked as though they were chiselled from white marble. As she looked around the room, the dank cold freezing her to her very core, she couldn't help but wonder why Intercorp hadn't just shut down this section of the corporation. Then, rolling her eyes, she remembered the companies unofficial motto, 'If It's Not Fatal, Then It's Operable.' <br>\r\nRachel couldn't help but think that this may be case as the cold could possibly kill her at this rate, that was why she had sent a petition to the board requesting that they set up an industrial heater into this big, chilly room.<br>\r\nLooking around again, Rachel cursed herself for not asking for some more lights as well, some the corners were so covered in shadow that you could lose your hand in it as though it were fog. It also set her a little on edge, after all she could swear she had heard writhing sounds coming from the shade, but Rachel just immediately dismissed it as rats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rachel was still caught up in this reverie, there was a knock on the bolted door into the room. Rachel did wonder why they had built a bolted door into this area, nothing was going to get out as she was thing in there.<br>\r\nAs she opened up the door, she immediately fell back in shock as an enormous metal thing that rolled into the room. It then rumbled as it seemed to say, 'where do you want to have this set up?' in a dangerously deep voice.<br>\r\nRachel was cowering on the floor at this point and was shivering as it began to laugh, starting off at a resonating roar but then changed suddenly into a nasally giggle. At this Rachel looked up from cowering in her arms and then took a look at the 'metal monster', after actually looking at it, it didn't actually seem that dangerous now. Before it looked as though it was red and angry but upon closer inspection it was just red from heat. Rachel then looked behind it at the source of the nasally giggle. Behind this thing was what would seem to be a small creature of some kind in a green suit, but it was just Robbie the technician. When Robbie realised the game was up he rolled the large radiator into the centre of the room and backed away, still giggling as he held up a loud speaker. 'Got ya Rachel.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was not at all impressed, tapping her black high heels on the ground in impatience. 'Will you be serious Robbie? It's freezing in here.'<br>\r\nAt this Robbie stopped giggling and shoved the radiator into the wall of the room closest to Rachels desk. Robbie then retreated back to the bolted door, all the time under the baleful gaze of Rachel. Robbie once dared a glance at Rachel, looking appreciatively at her D bust line, then caught her eye and immediately swivelled his gaze back to the floor.<br>\r\nWhen he got to the door he turned around as though to say something but all he got for stopping was the door in his face and bolted door in the face isn't something to laugh about. Rachel then swivelled around and got back to her work on an invisibility serum. Robbie could be such a pervert sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then looked appreciatively at the radiator, at least that was doing it's job well, billowing out heat and steam at such a rate that within minutes the room had escalated in temperature by at least a couple of hundred degrees.<br>\r\nBut Rachel had made a big mistake, something that would cause people to remember a forgotten mistake. There was a reason that it was cold down there.</span></div></div>",

An assimilation experiment where he could meld with whatever material he came into contact with, essentialy meaning he could turn into any matter. He had melded himself with water and eventually got frozen. The heater that Rachel installed however was turning him to vapour, making him almost invisible in the darkness. The vapour began to waft towards a certain womanly heat source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was sitting at her seat at her working on her paperwork, trying to forget about that jackass Robbie. As she was working she didn't notice the air around her begin to blur. The blurring remained in place for a second above Rachel, then moved down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachels papers suddenly swept aside as though from a heavy breeze, this made Rachel a little edgy as there was no wind in the room. Looking around she didn't notice anything and decided to get on with her work. She then felt a chill run down her spine. Whirling around Rachel saw nothing, then rubbing her hands on her skirt to warm them began to look properly. As she was walking a slight blur appeared around her leg, causing her to trip on to her rear end.<br>\r\n'Ouch' Exclaimed Rachel as she stuck her legs high in the air to balance herself up, but something caught her leg. She then felt a chill along her leg up to her foot as for some reason the laces of her shoes began to undo themselves, the knot unravelling to leave her shoes open and laces just slowly wafted away. Rachel was too amazed at this to do anything, the shoes then slipping off her feet to follow the laces. She was left with just her socks on her feet, with something brushing up the arches of her feet, causing he to elicit a ticklish giggle. Freaked out Rachel then got up and very quickly walked towards the way out of the room, freezing as she heard to sound of the door closing and then the click of it locking, the key wafting in front of her face before flying away, Rachel made to grab for the key but tripped again on something leaving her face down on the floor. As Rachel was trying to pull herself up she felt something tugging on her socks as they slowly crawled over the flesh of her feet. Rachel grabbed her socks and held them in place so they wouldn't budge. Thinking she had finally got this thing beaten, her triumph vanished as she felt the tingling flip her over, her hands still on her feet underneath her, she couldn't move. The tingling then moved to the buttons of her coat, the buttons tenderly popping out of their holes, then opening out to reveal her white shirt. Frightened out of her mind now, Rachel couldn't scream because she was also beginning to become aroused by this. The buttons of her shirt were quickly undone as well to expose her black lacy bra. Rachel breathed a sigh of relief, the clasp was on her back and the thing couldn't flip her over to open it without letting her hands free. Instead however she was horrified to see that her bra wasn't being removed but was slowly being pulled down. Frantic, Rachel tried to think of some way to stop this, but she couldn't, only being able to watch as the darker shading of her areolas was revealed, the cold of the thing bringing goosebumps to her flesh. Rachel could feel that the thing was having trouble bringing the bra over her nipples as they were already hard and holding on, however with a big tug her nipples were then revealed. They were beautiful, just the size of a strawberry tip and rosy in colour. The mist then moved over them, the cold of its touch making them stand on end. Rachel could then feel the mist play with them, rubbing them, patting them and tickling them. The whole time Rachel was beginning to feel warmer and warmer, a fire starting to build inside of her. Her breathing became more shallow.</span></div></div>",
