Strong and caring, with a loyal and fierce demeanor, she strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies and inspires hope in her allies. She inspires a great deal more than that in those attracted to women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa knows full well that she has a particularly well endowed body, and isn't afraid to acknowledge it. Of course, this doesn't mean she wants to go around showing it off to anybody interested in seeing it. Still, if wearing her short black skirt and tight white top meant a few more tips while working at her bar, she wasn't going to let herself get too bothered. Just so long as nobody saw anything they weren't supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Tifa know, plenty of people were about to see exactly that. It all began as the result of-</span></div></div>",

While the fighter couldn't control the fact that she had an appealing figure and face, she knew that such a thing could engender envy and resentment in others. The poorly hidden looks thrown her way, looks of lust and envy, sometimes both, were no stranger to Tifa, and in Midgar especially she knew she stood out from the crowd. Still, she was an accomplished martial artist, and she figured she'd simply break anybody in half if they tried anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tifa hadn't anticipated falling victim to a clever trap, one that had been carefully planned for quite a while. The simple ones thought up in the heat of the moment or that involved blatant tactics were easy to avoid, but a carefully crafted plan was another beast altogether. Little did Tifa know, she'd earned the enmity of someone capable of such a clever prank. When they were done with her, the fighter's reputation and self-respect would be in tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tifa blissfully went about her day, completely unaware of the nightmare about to befall her.

She paced around the small storage room in the back of 7th Heaven, clenching and un-clenching her fists as her heart hammered in her chest. \"I can't believe I'm going through with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been Jessie's idea. It was always Jessie's idea. 7th Heaven was already a front for AVALANCHE, and it hadn't been the first time she had brought up using Tifa's...assets to make money. But times were hard for the AVALANCHE crew right now. The reactor bombing had raised their profile quite a bit and put Shinra on edge. It had already been hard enough to move around and get supplies, but now it was nearly impossible. The few smugglers that were willing to work with them still had doubled, or in some cases_ _tripled their prices. Add to that Cloud's fees and AVALANCHE was broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie's usual joking suggestions were now desperate begging. She badgered Tifa for several days, but what finally broke her were Wedge's puppy-dog eyes as he told her he didn't have the gil to get his gun fixed after a nasty brawl with a monster on a neighborhood watch patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she relented, but on one condition; Jessie had to get Biggs, Wedge, Cloud, and Barret out of Sector 7 for the night. She could handle her usual patrons. Hell, they already propositioned her practically nightly, offering hundreds, sometimes thousands of gil (that she doubted existed) to take her clothes off. But there was no way she could endure the humiliation of exposing herself for money if Cloud, Barret, and the rest of the gang were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jessie concocted a wild goose chase and left with the crew that morning. Marlene was spending the night at a friend's house, and now Tifa was preparing to to spend the night tending bar in the nude after spending the afternoon posting flyers advertising the one-night-only event.</span></div></div>",

To keep the bar closed for the night and just hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Tifa slapped her cheeks, psyching herself up. \"They're all counting on me. I have to do this.\" Her wavering voice belied the false confidence of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she removed her studded gloves and slid the softer, longer gloves underneath them off. She then put her fighting gauntlets back on. They were her primary means of self defense and also held her materia. There was no way she was working without them. Not when she was clothed and especially if she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling hands, she slid the suspenders holding her skirt up off of her shoulders. The garment fell to the flood softly, revealing the black spats she wore underneath. She wore the skirt loose. It wasn't there for modest, that's what the spats were for, but for looks. A vestige of the pugilist's femininity. It also served another purpose. The lower body workouts she did as part of her martial arts training gave her a butt that she always felt was too big. The pleated skirt helped hide this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she kick of her boots, leaving her stockings in. In one swift motion, like ripping off a bandage, she pulled her spats and panties down and stepped out of them. The feeling of air on her exposed lower half was foreign and embarrassing. The sensation created a flurry of butterflies in her stomach. She was only halfway stripped in privacy and she was already queasy. How was she going to pull this off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had agonized the night prior about her pubic hair. She normally kept things trimmed and \"under control,\" but that wouldn't cut it if she was going to be...on display. She eventually decided that a full shave would be too much and settled on a small landing strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands fully quaking now, she rolled one of her stockings down and stepped back into her boot, then repeated the process with the other leg. The floor boards of 7th Heaven were already in bad shape when she gathered them from a scrap heap, and time had not been kind to them. Tonight was already going to be bad enough. She didn't need to add picking splinters out of her feet on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, with her hands and fingers nearly totally out of her control, she pulled off her white tank top. Exhaling, she pulled the black sports bra she wore underneath up and over her head. Her large, heavy breasts fell our, slapping loudly in the quite room against her ribs. Unlike most other large breasted women she talked to, she didn't mind her's all that much. The worst part about the girls was how sweat they would get when fighting. Otherwise, her sports bras kept them strapped down and out of the way, and her workouts kept her back muscles strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she did mind was they way other people reacted to them. Openly staring. Talking to them instead of her. The comments when people though she couldn't hear you knew that she could. Maybe, Tifa thought in forced optimism, this would be good for everyone. Get an eye full so they could get it out of their system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow naked except for her gloves and shoes, Tifa was as ready as she would ever be. If this was her way of supporting AVALANCHE from the sidelines, she was going to start going on missions.</span></div></div>",

It was empty, she knew that, and she had made sure to close the shutters so no one could peak in. But she still needed to reassure herself there was no one inside to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, she took a step out onto the bar floor. It felt so..wrong. She was no stranger to moving around naked. Often times, when she got home for the evening, she would take her top and bra off and let herself enjoy the fresh air and feeling of freedom. And there were times where she didn't bothered to get dressed after bathing if she knew she had know where to be for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was different. She wasn't supposed to be naked here. Instead of feeling relaxed and liberated, her nerves were twisted into a bundle, ready to burst. The bounce and sway of her hefty breasts and the juggling of her butt as she walked felt obscene. The fact that she was still wearing her boots and gloves somehow made her display seem more lewd to her. Wearing the articles, there was no mistaking that she was naked on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she slowly cracked to front door to the bar open and poked just her eyes out. She spotted a tuft of gray hair leaning against the railing of the front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rady to get this show on the road?\" Marle didn't turn around as she spoke. Tifa has asked to collect cover charges, a first for 7th Heaven, tonight. She knew things were going to get rowdy, but she also knew that if anyone could keep things under control it was Marle. She may be old, but she was deeply respected in the community. And everyone knew they considered each other family. If anything happened to one, there would be hell to pay from the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah,\" Tifa breathed out quietly. \"Marle, I'm sorry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize for anything.\" Tifa watched her gray hair sway as she shock her head. \"Times are hard. Well, times are always hard I suppose, but times are especially hard now. I might not always approve, but I would never begrudge a woman for doing what she hast to to get by. Besides, if you're going to do something like this, I rather you do it here, at you're own bar with me, than at some seedy back alley in Wall Market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marle,\" Tifa's voice cracked, tears threatening. She somehow felt even worse about tonight that she already did. She had lied to Marle. She didn't tell her anything about her involvement with AVALANCE. Instead, she told her she was going to lose the bar if she didn't come up with a lot of cash, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chin up.\" \"Marle's voice was soft and reassuring. \"No one wants to see a pretty girl cry. Especially one they are paying to ogle. And if they do, they aren't the kind of guys you want coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Tifa took a deep breath and calmed herself. \"Thank you, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets get on with it.\" The old woman picked up a large tin can off the ground, her collections jar, and put it next to her on the railing. \"If you put it off any longer I'm afraid the anticipation might kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa nodded and retreated into the bar. It took her a full minute to summon the courage to command her hand to flip the switch on the wall. The neon signs all over the building buzzed to bright life, declaring Tifa's 7th Heaven open for the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not bothering to flip the door to behind the bar up, she vaulted over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she waited. And waited. And waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the clock on the wall ticking in her skull. Goosebumps creeped over her body. Merle was right, this wait was going to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cover charge?\" Tifa literally jumps when she heard voices outside. \"Since when?\" It was a man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since now,\" She heard Marle slap the wall of the bar where a flyer for tonight's even was posted. \"Can't you read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, you serious?\" A different man spoke. Fantastic, Tifa thought. Couldn't be just one person to start things off. \"I thought that was some kind of prank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prank or not, you're not getting in without the cover charge.\" Marle patted her tin can, and Tifa head gil clatter to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is really happening!</i> Tifa's mind was close to short circuiting. She fumbled with her arms, trying to figure out how to stand. Normally, she would stand behind the bar with her hands on her hips and greet her patrons. It was both welcoming, and commanding. But doing that would put her completely on display. She wanted to use her arms to cover her breasts, but that was pointless. And crossing her arms underneath would only serve to accentuate them. So she just stood there, ramrod stiff, gripping the counter with white knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front doors opened. Two men that Tifa recognized entered. They were regular from the area. They were scrappers. They collected useful things from the scrap heap and sold them in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" One of them breathed. They were rooted in place, just a few steps inside, staring. Their eyes practically falling out of their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There it is,</i> Tifa winced. <i>The first time someone seems me naked and it these two, and I'm doing it for money.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good evening!\" Tifa's voice was shaky as she attempted a smile. Her eyes burned, fighting back tears of humiliation. \"What'll it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them spoke. The just continued to ogle her. Tifa could practically feel their eyes on her chest. While the bar hid her lower half from view, which she was thankful for, that meant that there was nothing, not even a distraction, to hide her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beer!\" The word fell out of one of their mouths, as if it took all of his brain power to form the single syllable. Cautiously, as if it were a trap, they walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up!\" She was relieved to have something to do other than stand there for them, and even happier that it have her a reason to turn around, even though that meant that they would now get an unobstructed view of her butt instead. She grabbed two bottles, she knew their brand already, and turned back around to their hungry gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to pop the top off with her gloved hand, but her hands were so shaky that she dropped the bottle. Luckily, it didn't break, glass bottles were tougher than the movies made them look, but the fumble added another layer of embarrassment to the normally adept bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" Tifa handed the drinks over. \"That'll be 50 gil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the part about the job Tifa always dreaded. This was the slums, everyone was some shade of poor. But even then, you paid for your goods and services. Yet everyone thought that they could just put their drinks on their tabs. Tabs that they would never pay. She had to cut off so many patrons due to their tabs, and these two in front of her were notoriously cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her surprise, they handed over the money. No protest, just payment. Tifa was thankful for the small blessing.</span></div></div>",

She dreaded the day that she would get punched. Really punched. Not with boxing gloves, but a real, bare knuckle blow. She even had nightmares about it. Then it happened. Yes, it had been awful, but not nearly as bad as she had been building it up to be in her imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very much not happy with her current situation, but, if she was being perfectly honest, it wasn't as bad as she was dreading it would be these last few days. It was deeply embarrassing, more than a bit humiliating, and she was absolutely ashamed of herself for doing it even if it was for a cause she believed in. But it wasn't fatally embarrassing. She feared that if she went through with it, she would drop dead at the first customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had gone though with it! She knew it was an incredibly stupid thing to be proud of, like the idiots who bragged about winning drinking contests after she had to Esuna them off of the floor, ginning like idiots even though they nearly drank themselves to actual death. But she couldn't deny that there was a small part of her, the stubborn and competitive part of her, that was proud she hadn't backed down from the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scrappers were downright bashful, which amused Tifa. They were turned away from Tifa, trying to talk about their day and plans for tomorrow, but it was a stilted and awkward conversation. Not that Tifa was any better. She would catch their eyes glancing at her, and every time if felt like a physical force. Occasionally, the would turn to her, to openly stare and to also attempt to include her in the conversation, and she really wish they wouldn't. Her tongue tripped over itself as her fried brain tried to find anything to say about the conversation she could barley hear over the <i>sensation</i> of being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly molly, they're even BIGGER when they're out!\" Tifa looked up as the doors swung open. She knew there would be more people here tonight, but she had held onto a fools hope that she could get through the evening quietly. It was one of the town drunkard and his bum friends, laughing and elbowing each other as they ogled the nude bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBum was a harsh term. Real jobs were scarce in Sector 7. But there was always something that needed done. Building to repair, trash to clean up, monsters to fight. These men did none of that. If they applied themselves, some might even throw a few gil their way so they wouldn't put everything on their \"tab,' which to them just mean free drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to 7th Heaven.\" Tifa faked a smile. \"Got gil tonight?\" The thin veneer of hospitality in her voice melted away as she scowled. If she was going to put on a show, she was damn sure getting paid for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, missy!\" The leader of the pack raised his hands in surrender. Tifa was glad that her red-eyes carried enough power still to distract from her bare breasts and intimidate. Everyone who patronized 7th Heaven knew that Tifa wasn't afraid to throw someone out, sometimes literally. The bum held up a pouch of gil. the coins jingling against each other. \"We worked out asses off today. We weren't going to miss this for the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Tifa wasn't sure how she felt about her skin being such a strong motivator. \"Take a seat. What'll you have?\" She asked, looking for anything to busy her hands with and distract her from the fact that was totally naked in a room filling up with men.</span></div></div>",

When she had hoped she would stay busy to help distract her from her nudity, she didn't expect this. The place was packed. All the seats at the bars and tables were filled and people were sitting on pinball machines and windowsills, with just as many more milling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loathed to admit it, but Jessie had been right all along. This was the busiest 7th Heaven had ever been by orders of magnitudes. She was making money hand over fist, and she felt intensely guilty about it, as if her shame wasn't enough. These people didn't have a lot. She felt like she was taking them for a ride with as much money they were throwing at her. But then again, they came here on their own free will. If she was going to debase herself, at least the reward was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured the liquor into the mixer and began to shake it. Normally, she would spin a twist and put on a little show as she mixed, flipping the mixer up into the air and behind her back. But her hands were too unsteady to even attempt that. It would take more time for her to get used to bar-tending naked before she would be able to do that. Not that I will, Tifa quickly cut that line of thinking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even doing simple shakes caused her breasts to wobble and bounce together. And everyone stared, openly. She could feel a new wave of heat wash over her already red face as the stares of dozens focused on her jiggling bare chest. Slamming the shaker down, half has a way to vent some frustration and half to make sure it didn't slip out of her hand, she poured out and slid the finished drink to the customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can we get another round over here!\" Someone at the table in the corner farthest from the bar waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Tifa answered reflexively, her customer service instincts not totally, only mostly, overrun by raw embarrassment. She cursed under her breath. She should have made them come up for their drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbling to herself, she turned her back to the bar and to the shelf of drinks behind the counter. The table asking for refills was drink beer our of the tap. She lined up six clean mugs and filled them up. She then took a few deep breaths to stop her from hyperventilating, then walked out onto the bar floor, three mugs in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here I am, Tifa though as her feet ground to a halt. This was her first time stepping out from behind the bar that night. With the counter top to shield her, she could pretend that she was just topless. But now, she was totally exposed. Everyone stopped talking and turned to look. She took a few steps, but her legs felt like gelatin and it took all of her willpower to quite the tumult of butterflied in her stomach threatening to bring up bile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the table felt like an eternity. The heavy footfalls of her boots echoed though the now silent bar and sent shock-waves up her body, causing her butt to jiggle and breasts to sway. It was so quite, Tifa, and she was sure everyone else, could hear the faint slapping of skin against skin as her breasts bobbed and bounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk gave her time to really see who was here tonight. She recognized nearly every face. Shop keepers, construction workers, teachers, vagrants, it seemed like everyone in Sector 7 turned out to get an eyeful of her. It was somewhat flattering, Tifa would never say out loud, so see so many people turn out just for her. Tifa was surprised to see that there were a fair number of women in the sea of faces, not just men. And the women stared just as intently. She didn't know how she felt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the walk across the bar, which felt like it took centuries, she made it to the table, where she put down the the mugs of alcohol. She kept her back straight and bent at the knees to lower herself. She didn't have the guts to dangle her breasts in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she placed the last mug down, a loud, sharp slap echoed though the bar. Someone just slapped her ass. With honed, predatory like reflexes, she spun around before the offending hand had barley left her skin. She grabbed the culprits wrist. He screamed in pain as she twisted. She could feel bones snapping under her super human strength, augmented by her righteous fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the molester in front of her now, she delivered a kick square into the center of his chest. He sailed out of the double doors of 7th Heaven's entrance, and continued to fly though the air for several feet until he skidded to at stop, and crumbled heap at the end of a dust trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else feeling frisky!\" Tifa barked, breaking heavily, teeth gritted. She looked around the room. No one was looking at her now. On the other side of the swinging double doors, Tifa caught a gimps of Marle, grinning widely and giving her a thumbs up. </span></div></div>",

Throwing out the molester had been a good way for her to vent her frustration, which had been threatening to boil over all evening. But she would have much rather the violation had never happened in the first place. But the violence had quieted some of the more unsavory behavior of her patrons. The lewd staring, talking about her body as if she weren't attached to it, and cat calls. She was still the only one naked in a room full of people, but everyone had been reminded that it was her bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was feeling better. Sure, the difference was between 0% and 1%, but it was still an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening started to quiet down after that. She hoped it was because the novelty of her nudity had worn off, but she knew it really because pockets were starting to run dry. But any reason to get people to go home was a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get some refills?\" Tifa perked up at the sound of a woman's voice. She had been leaning against the counter behind the bar top. The posture caused her breasts to dangle beneath her, but it also hid them. Straightening her back and exposing herself to the room again, she grabbed a bottle of wine and a few bottled beers and ventured out from the mild modesty the behind the bar provided her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was of damn time is what that was!\" Tifa froze as the sound of the approaching voice. A voice was unmistakably and undeniably Barrett's! But that's not possible. Jessie got them out of the Sector for the night! The stress of the evening must be finally getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More dead Shinra goons is never a bad thing.\" And that was Biggs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's mind raced faster than her body could keep up. She stood, rooted in place, in the middle of the bar floor, staring at the entrance like an animal into oncoming headlights. In walked the AVALANCHE men, with Jessie chasing after them, hands outstretched like she was trying to grab them and pull them back. And just over Barrett's should, she could see a head of spiked blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men stopped in their tracks, mouths agape. And Tifa screamed. She flung her hands against her body in a vain attempt to cover herself, sending the bottles she was carrying flying in opposite directions across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little late for that, isn't it?\" Someone in the bar laughed, and everyone else joined in as Tifa's head spun while her best friends stared at her naked body.</span></div></div>",

That person had been right, she looked beyond ridiculous trying to cover herself. She <i>felt </i>beyond ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-welcome to 7th H-h-heaven.\" Tifa's voice wavered as her friends stared at her bare form. \"Please take a seat. Jessie?\" Her voice was firm now. \"You you mind giving me a hand with drinks?\" It wasn't a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie followed followed Tifa back towards the bar while the men shuffled off to a table. Jessie let out a small help when Tifa's hand grasped tightly onto her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried!\" Jessie squeaked as Tifa's grip tightened, her red eyes boring holes into the girl. \"But the warehouse wasn't very well guarded. We cleaned things out in half the time I thought it would take-eeek!\" The metal armor on Jessie's arm started to bend under Tifa's fingers. \"I really tried, I promise! But you know how Barret can get sometimes.\" Jessie tried to twist her body out of Tifa's grasp but she wasn't able to escape. \"He wanted to wrap things up to see Marlene!\" That finally got Tifa to release her hold. She could be embarrassed, and humiliated, and mortified, but she couldn't be mad about Barret wanting to see his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another round over here!\" Someone called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa sighed, revealed for any reason not to go over and face her friends. She grabbed a few bottles of beer and shoved them into Jessie's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain everything to them.\" Jessie offered a smile. \"And besides, they were going to find out sooner or later. Not like you could have kept this a secret.\" Jessie turned and hurried off. Tifa knew that, but that didn't mean that had to <i>see</i> it! After attending to the table's drinks, she turned and made her slow death march to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...,\" Barret started when she arrived. They were all standing ramrod stiff, facing each other and not her. \"I appreciate your sacrifice for the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie filled us in,\" Biggs said. \"This is probably the most courageous thing any of us have done, if I'm being honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise we'll find a way to make it up to you.\" Wedge bowed, in spirit to Tifa but in reality to Cloud, who was seated across from him. Tifa couldn't help the small smile forming on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say something, soldier boy.\" Barret elbowed Cloud, who sat next to him. \"Or do we have to pay you for that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh.\" Cloud stammered, and Tifa caught a quick flick of his eyes towards her. That small, almost imperceptible movement hit Tifa like a lightning bolt. For a brief moment, a pleasurable excitement washed over her, overriding her anxious embarrassment. Tifa took a deep breath to calm herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want to make it up to me.\" Tifa unconsciously put her hands on her hips. \"Then put all this money to good use.\"</span></div></div>",

Still intensely embarrassing, but not for the reasons she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did receive some admonishments, namely from the older women of the community, but the vast majority of the people she spoke to, or more accurately spoke to her, spoke of her naked escaped with compliments and good humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was told, again and by more than one person, that clothes didn't suit her and that she looked better naked. She accepted the...she guessed there was nothing else to call it but a compliment, bashfully. If they had to talk about her naked body like that, at least they had good things to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone was so lascivious, however. Many people, particularly other women, sincerely thanked her. Life below the plate was hard. If you were lucky enough to have a job, you often had to commute for an hour or more to other sectors to work hard for little pay. A night of drinks and eye candy was an oasis in a life that could grind down even the strongest spirits. Some even went as far as to call her stripping heroic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, not all the women were so innocent. One women sought her out with small home made pastry, a hard thing to make in the slums given the ingredients, as a thank you gift. Apparently, after the woman's husband came home from her bar, they had the best sex of the married life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter who she spoke to, every single one of them ended the conversation by asking the same thing; when was she going to bartend naked again? And Tifa would smile and answer everyone the same way; she was still thinking about it. Years of customer service had taught her that you never gave customers hard \"no's,\" even if that was the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times during her day, she would be struck by a sudden, powerful feeling of being exposed. Sometimes it was because of a particularly intense stare, and sometimes it hit her when no one was around. She was talking to people that had seen her naked. The knew how her unsupported breasts bounced as she walked, and had seen her butt jiggle as her hips swayed. They didn't have to imagine what she looked like, they could actually undress her with their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day tuned into days, which turned into a week. People stopped talking about it eventually. There were only so many ways someone could indirectly tell a girl she should be naked more often, and only so many ways that girl could evade the topic, before it lost it's appeal. Eventually, things started to go back to normal. And that was when the dreams started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that stuck out to her was that these were most certainly <i>not</i> nightmares. Though she would still wake up suddenly them suddenly, sweaty and heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of a room full of people pounding the tables and chanting for her nudity. In the moment, it had been frighting, but in her dreams it was intensely flattering and even empowering. That her body was so beautiful, that her allure was so powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt of shopping for potions and phoenix down while not wearing any clothes. She dreamt of eating at a restaurant without anything on. She dreamt of working out in the nude, bouncing and jiggling all over the place her sweat gleamed. She dreamt of serving drinks naked, flittering around the bar while everyone watched. And in each dream, Cloud was there. Watching her. Watching over her. Protecting her as she exposed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times, her orgasm would wake her up. Other times, she would wake up on the brink, and all it would take would be a light tweak of her nipple to a squeeze of her thighs to push her over. Other times, she would find herself with her sheets or pillow between her legs and she would finish herself by grinding her hips against them. And on nights when the dream had been particularly vivid and intense, she would pump her fingers in and out, palm against her clit, while her other hand fondle her massive breast, working herself into multiple orgasms until she exhausted herself and fell back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped wearing clothes to bed. She told herself that it was because it was hot and it saved laundry. And it's not like she wore much to bed anyway, just a thin night shirt and panties. But the real reason was because the feeling of her sheets, cheap and rough as they may be, heightened her arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped getting dressed in the morning if she didn't have anywhere to go, and stayed naked after her evening showers since she stopped wearing night clothes. She started opening the slatted blinds on her window more and ever so slightly more every day as she walked around her small apartment naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Jessie,\" Tifa cursed into her dark room as she withdrew her fingers from herself after another one of her exhibitionist fantasy fueled orgasm.

She lay naked and exposed on her bed, she had kicked her sheets off in her sleep, with on hand still on her breast, where she had left it after she had fallen back to sleep after her late night orgasm. Thankfully, she had remembered to close her blinds before she went to sleep. She may have taken to lounging in her apartment naked with the blinds more than cracked at this point, but she wasn't comfortable with the thought of someone watching her sleep. Not that it she was likely to be peeped on asleep or awake, being on the second floor with her only neighbors being Cloud and a shut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Cloud asked though the door, knocking again.

She was normally an early riser, always eager to attack the day head on, but the recent interruptions to her sleep scheduled had her waking up later and later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Tifa called out, wrenching her hand away from her chest. She scrambled around her room and quickly got dressed, doing her best to ignore that she was imagining opening the door and greeting Cloud without any clothes on. \"What's up?\" Tifa opened the door breathlessly, hoping her clothes weren't noticeably askew with how quickly she had thrown them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you would help me get the items Wedge asked for for the mission tonight.\" The blonde mercenary help up a hand written list and gave her a quizzical look. \"Are you feeling alright? Your face seems a little red...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Tifa interrupted. \"I'm totally fine!\" She held up her right arm and flexed for emphasis. \"I just overslept, that's all. I'm ready when you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had been reunited a few weeks ago, things had been awkward between Tifa and Cloud. She never let on that she could tell, but Cloud was clearly torn between his desire to seem cool and aloof, and those awkward teenage feelings he had parted with five years ago. Tifa honestly founded it cute how hard he tried to act the hardened bad ass, especially when she or Barret caught him out and she fumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had grown more comfortable and confident over time. Not, it was Tifa's turn to be the awkward one. Though instead of trying to act like a badass, she had to pretend like she wasn't talking to the guy that she fantasized about watching her get naked in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where to?\" Tifa stepped forward and closed the door behind her. \"Lead on!\"</span></div></div>",

If it was Cloud's fault that AVALANCHE had burned though all the money she had earned for them, the he was going to pay her back, with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that offer you made me still stand?\" Tifa looked up at the shop keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...offer?\" The merchant looked genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, about discounts?\" She tried to jog his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" He gasped, suddenly remembering. Tifa could see the two sides of him fighting behind his eyes. The business man was calculating whether he could afford to take the loss, but the man in him was calculating if he could afford to pass up this opportunity. The man in him won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Offer still stands. 10% off per article.\" He shook his head vigorously, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa!\" Cloud turned to her. \"You don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any other ideas.\" Tifa feigned exasperation to disguise her giddy excitement. Cloud looked around the shop as if searching for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feinds,\" He finally said, but Tifa didn't let him finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take all day to make up the difference killing fiends.\" Tifa replied, and this was true. While they could kill the monsters quickly, they would still have to travel out to find them and then come back. \"And you guys need this stuff tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa furtively looked around the shop. Her, Cloud, and the owner were the only ones inside, which wasn't unusual. Potions weren't in high demand for most of the citizens of Sector 7. She was pretty sure AVALANCHE was the only thing keeping the place afloat. The entrance to the shop was also out of view, around the corner in an alley off of the main thorofare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Tifa shrugged her suspenders off her shoulders and her skirt fell off of her waist and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that's 10%.\" Tifa said, her voice a little shaky. Her heart was pounding in her chest as hard as any workout would make it. She peeled off her white tank top and tossed it to the ground as well. \"20%.\" Next, she pulled the fabric of her sports bra forward and away from her chest. Her nipples were already hard and she didn't think she would be able to keep herself from moaning if the fabric rubbed against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And 30%.\" Tifa let the bra drop. Just barley, she heard Cloud swallow hard as her heavy breasts came into view, swaying gently before settling. She still for a moment, hands on her hips, basking the the stares of both men. Almost reluctant to let the moment go, she slipped her fingers underneath the waist of her spats and began to pull them down, shaking her hips from side to side to help peel the tight garment off, while also jiggling her breasts for her audience. \"That makes 40%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, she hooked her thumps into the bands of her panties and slipped them down, having to awkwardly step out of them since she was still wearing her boots. She had completely shaved her pubic hair. She found that she liked how having less hair down there felt the first time she shaved and decided to try completely bare. Not only did it feel even better, but it made her feel more naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, 50% off.\" Tifa said as she stood up and shoved her clothes into a bewildered and embarrassed and gawking Cloud's hands. She did it! She was naked in the item shop! And she was<i> incredibly</i> turned on. Her hands found their way to her hips again, partially to put herself on display, but mostly to prevent them from touching herself. The fact that she was still in her stockings and gloves enhanced the feeling of exposure she felt. It framed her body, drawing their eyes to the bare skin of her tits, her ass, her pussy. \"So what's our new total?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men just stood there, thunderstuck. Tifa paid the shopkeep no mind. She was totally focused on the feeling of Cloud's eyes on her. After what felt like a blissful eternity of staring, of being on display, the merchant physicality shook himself and recalculated their total. The new price was well within their budget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some left over now.\" Tifa counted out the left over gil. \"We might as well get a few more items,\" Tifa looked over to Cloud. A ripple of ecstasy washed over her as she saw that he was very clearly not looking at her eyes when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa began browsing the shelves of the shop. She took slow, heavy steps, causing her womanly curves to jiggle and bounce. She was barley able to even read the labels on the items. All she cared about was this feeling. Of being the only one in the room naked. Of doing something totally innocuous while nude. Of being naked in public. It was euphoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ended up pick items at random and taking them to the counter. She was sure that the shop owner didn't bother to properly do the math on her discount. He just took her money, his eyes never leaving her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa heard an approaching voice outside and was instantly filled with a powerful concoction of equal parts fear and anticipation. Fear of getting caught, and excitement at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me my tank and skirt!\" Tifa turned to Cloud, who was still staring in awe, his cheeks flush. \"I don't have time for the rest.\" Cloud fumbled for a moment before turning his gaze down the the clothes in his hands. Me managed to pick out the requested articles and handed them to her. She quickly pulled the white tank top over her head and stepped into her skirt, looping the suspender over her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself. Her erect nipples pokes out small ridges and she was sure if you looked hard enough you could see her nipples though the light fabric. And wearing nothing underneath her skirt was almost too much for her to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"_Pleasure _doing buinsess with you.\" Tifa waved to the shopkeep, her breath haggard, and turned, grabbing Cloud by the wrist and dragging him out.</span></div></div>",

Having spent virtually no real effort leading up to this point, and the wheel landing on HP Restore for the final fight?  That wasn't a handicap at all.  This run was in the bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for!\" the announcer shouted.  \"Bring out the final opponent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from facing the crowd towards the gate, Tifa took her stance, ready to face the new foe.  She brimmed with anticipation, wondering what the arena had in store for her this time?  Will it be a giant serpent?  Or perhaps a dragon?  Maybe even a Tonberry so she could have a real challenge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a real treat for you today, folks,\" the announcer called out as the gate opened up.  \"With Ms. Lockhart's continuous success, we're bringing out a special, never-before-seen opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA special opponent?  Jackpot! Tifa thought, grinning and clenching her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making his first debut ever in the Battle Square Arena: he's as sinister as he is conniving, but will that be enough to stop Ms. Lockhart from winning it big?   Put your hands together for the abominable Orthros!\" he cheered, sending the crowd into tense anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the gate came something Tifa was not expecting.  Making its way into the ring oozed a large, black, translucent, slime creature.  The large, rotund pudge-ball was around twice her height tall and just as wide on either side.  It was certainly something she had never seen before; slime monsters weren't very common in this part of the world.  But, as suprising and intimidating as Orthros was, it appeared to be quite unassuming, just sitting there in place after it had exited the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd wasn't sure what to make of it either, apparently, as Tifa could hear their confused mutterings around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand, FIGHT!\" The announcer called out, seemingly oblivious of the crowd's dehypening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, wound up and ready for action, made the first move, bringing the crowd's focus back to the fight.  While she had a feeling that magic would be the better option here, having her materia disabled left her no other choice.  Charging towards Orthros, she unleashed her tried-and-true 1-2 combo-punch attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SQUISH* *SQUISH*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh!\" went the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh,\" Tifa grimaced.  Unexpectedly, her arms plowed through Orthrus's exterior, plunging them nearly up to her elbows in his bioslime.  Orthros didn't seem too disturbed by her blows, meaning she would have to try something else.  But as she tried to pull her arms out, she found them stuck fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-!?\" Tifa gasped, pulling backwards to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, bad move for Ms. Lockhart,\" the announcer commentated.  \"Once he grabs you, he ain't letting go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet?\" Tifa growled, straightening her hands, digging in her heels, and pulling back all at once.  With a loud <b>SQUELCH</b>, her arms slowly, then quickly pulled free.  The suddenness of this caught the martial artist by surprise, as she fell back onto the ground, hitting her head against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" she grunted, shaking her head to regain he concentration.  She pulled her legs back to stand back up, only to find that she couldn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it for her?  Is Tifa going to be taken down so easily?\" went the announcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ooze had begun to move again, engulfing Tifa's boots as it advanced.  With that last comment springing her into regaining her senses, Tifa jiggled her feet to free them from her boots, succeeding and pulling out just before Orthros reached her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away, Tifa fell back into a fighting stance, trying to think of what to do next, only to realize in horror- her hands were bare!  \"My gloves!\" Tifa couldn't help but gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-ho-ho,\" the announcer chuckled.  \"I forgot to mention, Orthros has a thing for the ladies.  And it seems he very much likes our challenger right now, now that he's gotten a good taste of her.  Is Tifa's glorious streak going to end here, as a mere morsel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Tifa could see the silhouettes of her gloves and boots suspended inside the semi-translucent blob.  But that wasn't all she saw.  For the first time, she noticed two additional yellow orbs of light near the top of the beast, and a jagged line form horizontally across the front of its body.  She fought enough wild creatures to know eyes and mouths when she saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though she was minus her gloves and boots, Tifa felt pumped.  She had asked for a challenge, and here was the first opponent all day where just hitting it blindly wouldn't work.  Sure her attacks were weaker now without her gloves and boots, but her fists and feet were still deadly weapons regardless.  \"I'm just getting started!\" Tifa yelled, pointing at Orthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's our challenger!\" the announcer shouted back as the crowd started cheering Tifa's name again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made it this far, there's no way I'm running or giving up now.  It's all or nothing! Tifa thought.  Now, for strategy.  How should I do this?  </span></div></div>",

Rather than a straight jab, however, Tifa went for a cross. She didn't want to submerge her arms in that thing again, especially after how difficult it had been to pull free in the first place. That was assuming she'd be able to pull free again without gloves to sacrifice, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's bare knuckles danced across the side of the gelatinous being, and sure enough a large wad of the material that made up the creature went flying into the arena wall with a wet splat.

After a moment, however, the creature turned back to Tifa and continued its slow march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa responded by steadily backing up, throwing punches and kicks all the way. Each hit sent another piece of Orthros flying, and gradually the monster began to shrink. Unfortunately, the sheer size of the creature would prove to win this war of attrition.

Where did that come from? she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was about to pry it loose, something struck and stuck to her from behind.  The cold and clammy feeling trickling through the back of her shirt where it hit made her realize that that too was a chunk of Orthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around her, Tifa's jaw fell open.  Sure enough, all of the pieces that she had knocked off of Orthros were steadily moving towards her, with the big beast himself closing in as well.  She was surrounded!

They hadn't done anything yet, but they were starting to weigh Tifa down, compounding her fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure don't envy Miss Lockheart right now,\" spoke the announcer.  \"Looks like it's curtains for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa snarled back, not wanting to waste precious energy on a verbal retort.

Then she could get these pieces off of her, smash them for good, and then deal with the rest.  The fight was definitely wearing on her, but it was time to put up or shut up.

Everything below her waist was encased in the ooze!  It must have been reforming during that time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!  Orthros has her right where he wants her!\" said the announcer.  \"What he's gonna do to her is anyone's guess, but it looks like Tifa's streak stops here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!  Tifa thought, struggling however she could to try and break free.  Her legs were completely encompassed in the ooze, but she could feel some movement in her hips, around where the rest of her body was sticking out.  If she could just lift herself out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, folks!\" the announcer shouted.  \"Orthros is moving in for the kill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Tifa could not turn around to look herself, the growing volume of the crowd along with the announcer's statement made it clear that there was no time left.  Clenching her teeth, she planted her arms on top of the slime-bit and pushed down with her hands and lifted up her body with all her might, leaning forward in one last-ditch effort to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orthros is right on top of her now,\" the announcer continued.  \"I think he's enjoying this, taking his sweet time with his new prize, Ms. Lockhart.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Orthros bore down on Tifa, her body shot up mostly out of the slime.  Though her knees and everything below was still caught, it was enough for her to lean forward and touch the ground.  Grabbing at the stone floor, Tifa pulled and pulled and finally, freed herself from Orthros with an enormous squelch.  Once freed, she wasted no time in crawling along the floor to the other end of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it!  Tifa escaped by the skin of her teeth!\" the announcer called out.  \"But what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the other side, Tifa started to pick herself up off her feet, but felt that her legs were still stuck together a bit.  Argh, more of that slime!? she thought as she kicked out with her legs.  She soon realized though, that it wasn't slime trapping her feet together.  Uneasily, Tifa looked back over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her legs were free of slime.  Though some black traces of the ooze remained on her skin, the residue was insignificant.  What was trapping her legs was a white piece of cloth bundled around her shins.  Aside from those things, her legs were bare.  Completely bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!  Tifa literally has escaped by her skin,\" the announcer started to crack up.  \"I didn't think that phrase would be so appropriate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the-!?\" Tifa screamed, pulling her panties back onto her bottom as quickly as possible, careful not to turn over.  How did- what happened to my skirt!? she thought, turning back towards Orthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was hard to tell from this distance, her socks and skirt were now a part of the beast.  Two trailing strips from the missing garment told her everything.  In her struggle, her suspenders must have snapped, allowing her to pull free from Orthros by slipping out of her skirt, and nearly losing her panties in the process.  To make matters worse, Orthos reabsorbed the slime parts that had trapped her, bringing him back to almost his original size!  He was back to full strength and she was tired and half-naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any hope for Ms. Lockhart at this point?\" the announcer asked.  \"Though she's looking good, her chances of victory are not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was growing restless as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, is that all you got?\"  \"I'm going to lose it big all cause of this final match!\"  \"Well, at least we're getting a good show out of it.\"  \"Yeah, you know what, this is the best match I've seen in a while.\"  \"Orthos!  Orthros!  Orthros!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat announcer is really starting to get on my nerves, Tifa growled to herself.  And that crowd isn't helping either, especially after flashing my butt like that.  Ugh... If this keeps up, I'm going to lose a lot more... maybe even the fight!  I hoped to save on these, but I can't hold back anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her shirt, and drawing a collective gasp from the crowd in the process, Tifa pulled out an X-potion and quickly chugged it, restoring her health to full and dispelling her fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-ho,\" the announcer piped in.  \"Looks like Tifa's been holding out on us!  Although Materia has been banned, items are still allowed.  I wonder what other goodies she has tucked away in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa shook the lewd comment aside.  She might be looking rather silly right now wearing a white tank top and panties right now, but she was done taking things lightly.  Orthros was no chump opponent, meaning she had to win this as soon as possible.  And so, Tifa planned to turn the tables in her favor by-</span></div></div>",

With every hit, the creature seemed to reel back slightly, seeming to recoil in pain despite its semisolid nature. Tifa tried not to think about the kind of show she was putting on as she flipped and threw high kicks with only her panties below her waist. She had to focus on blasting Orthros into oblivion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that! Ms. Lockhart has turned into a whirlwind of punishment! Could this be the turning point?!\" the announcer cried. The crowd seemed to echo this sentiment, everyone watching with rapt attention as chunks of the gelatinous beast went flying once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surge of energy was beginning to abate, and Tifa knew her Beat Rush technique was coming to an end. Hopefully it would be enough to win the fight. If Tifa still had to take care of Orthros after this, she wasn't sure how well she'd be able to handle it in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last hit, Tifa panted heavily. The entire arena was splattered with chunks of Orthros, the largest piece of the mass in front of her and only reaching her knees. She'd done it!

Both sides get knocked down but keep coming back for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole significant piece of Orthros jumped up and down, and began wiggling back and forth.  \"Oh, come on!\" Tifa groaned, wearily picking herself up to fight once more.  At least with the size Orthros was, it wouldn't take much more to finish this.  A few solid punches should do it.  Tifa threw a jab-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Shwoop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and hit nothing but the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" Tifa gasped, seeing Orthros over to the right.  \"That can't be.  He was right, THERE!\" she punched again, \"What!?\" and misssed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Orthros was on her left, and much further away.  No, he never moved that fast before... Tifa pondered.  Which can only mean, oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Tifa's eyes weren't playing tricks on her.  Orthros was moving at least three times as fast as before!  Even though the size difference should have meant that it would be moving at around the same pace as it was when he was huge, the slime beast was clearly much more agile in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer shouted something else over the mike, accompanied by audience noise, but Tifa didn't pay attention.  Her heart was pounding, her panting growing heavier and heavier with each breath... she was running on fumes.  Keeping her eyes on Orthros, she drew back into a defensive stance, and began to dig around in her shirt with her free hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does Ms. Lockhart have something else tucked away in that chest of hers?\" the announcer called out lewdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBomb Fragment... Antarctic Wind... argh, where's that other X-potion? Tifa thought.  She turned down to get a better look.  Ah, there it is.  It just got knocked over to the center of- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLAT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, Tifa just made the blunder of a lifetime!\" the announcer shouted.  \"She took her eyes off of Orthros and he took his chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds, but Orthros had somehow shuffled the distance to Tifa and leapt up onto her, completely covering her upper body and pinning her arm in her shirt.  \"Grrg,\" Tifa grunted.  \"Get off, you- EEE!\" she suddenly let out a high-pitched scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrthros wasn't just sticking to Tifa, it was now... fondling her?  That's what it felt like at least, as the slime beast oozed about, twisting in every which direction, mainly focused around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd had evidently come to the same conclusion, erupting into a wave of cheering and whistling shortly after Tifa's scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You perverted slimeball!\" Tifa shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orthros has our challenger at his mercy now,\" said the announcer.  \"And what's this?  Oh, looks like he's getting ready to do something big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Orthros had begun to change.  His translucent black body began to glow with a pale, green light from within his core.  Tifa could feel him growing warmer as well.  What is this? she thought.  A new attack?  Is it a kamikaze maneuver, or what?  Either way, I can't just sit here and let him do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing around her other arm to help, Tifa put in one last ditch effort with her remaining reserves to push Orthros off of her.  She could feel that she was making some progress, but would her strength last that long?  At the end of her last burst of energy, Tifa-</span></div></div>",

The struggle was intense, but she could feel that she was making progress.  And soon enough-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIPP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's strength prevailed, and Orthros was sent crashing to the ground as a cheer erupted from the audience.  Unfortunately, it wasn't that Orthros became unstuck, but that it was her shirt that had given out instead, ripping along her back from the strain and falling off completely with Orthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Tifa was aware that she was only left wearing her bra and panties, leaving almost nothing left to the audience's imaginations, she was too distracted to care.  With her shirt gone, the items she had kept tucked inside had scattering all across the floor, only one of which was important to her.  Not knowing how much health Orthros had left, the attack items could wait.  Where was that X-potion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Orthros, gettting knocked to the ground seemed to disrupt whatever attack it had planned to do.  It's bright glow had faded and instead it bubbled in place.  It looked like it was doing nothing, but Tifa noticed that her shirt, clutched in its ooze, was much less than it was earlier.  \"It's eating it!?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Orthros did not stop there.  In mere seconds, it drew in the rest of her shirt and digested it completely.  Slowly it quivered, moving back and forth, until it suddenly dashed away towards the arena edge, noticeably slower than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa looked to where it was going and gasped, seeing what it was going for. \"My potion!\" she cried, giving chase, but nearly tripped over herself.  She was worn out and couldn't even run effectively in her state.  She desperately needed that potion now more than ever, and if Orthros got to it first, she was screwed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all come down to this!\" the announcer roared, as the audience rustled with anticipation.  They were on the edge of their seats.  Would the lovely Ms. Lockhart make it in time, or would the abhorrent ooze reclaim the advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa panted heavily, hobbling along as fast she could.  It looked like she was gaining on Orthros, but not by much, and they were almost there.  Argh, why did it have to home in on the potion of all things!? she thought.  It could eat anything else right now, just not that potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second! Tifa realized, continuing her pursuit while doing so.  There was something that the slime definitely liked, and would possibly keep it away from the potion.  Some <i>things</i>, rather, that it had been going for the entire match.  Things that she was almost out of, and probably wouldn't be getting back if she did this.  But with victory on the line, and everything that had happened so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa glanced at her current state, and at Orthros.

It was supposed to be fast, but her quick exposure was becoming very prolonged as her long hair was getting in the way, tangling up with her bra.  \"Come on, get off!\" she said, working out the issue quickly, but unable to cover her chest during this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with her bra off and in her hands, Tifa looked ahead of her.  Orthros was almost at the potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey slimebreath!\" Tifa yelled to catch Orthros' attention, then tossed her bra off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the underclothing landed on the ground, the effect was immediate.  Orthros immediately stopped in its tracks and ravenously sped off to where it fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" Tifa said, running back towards the potion with her arms covering what bits of her chest she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" said the announcer. \"I'm betting we all thought Tifa just lost her mind there, but turns out it was all part of the plan.  Now she's-hold up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the announcer's sudden call, Tifa turned back towards Orthros.  It was heading back towards the potion, bra partially consumed and trailing along in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Orthros won't be tricked that easily, folks.  It's still anyone's game!\" the announcer said jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gargh!\" Tifa growled.  That scumbag!  Doesn't he know that dine-and-dashing is illegal?  \"Got no choice then,\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop, Tifa moved her arms away from her chest, causing the audience to cheer.  Her hands down at her hips, she grabbed at the sides of her panties, leading to another cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going for it, she's going for it!\" the announcer cried out along with additonal lewd cries from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shut up, already! Tifa thought as she yanked the panties down her legs, stepped out of them, and wadded them into a ball, her entire body on display as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go fetch!\" Tifa yelled, throwing the panties in the opposite direction that she threw her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Orthros couldn't resist, shoving off in the direction of Tifa's unmentionables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa ran towards the potion again, this time arms at her sides for a full run instead of in front her for modesty's sake.  She was out of clothes, out of patience, and had only one thing on her mind right now: to end this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Tifa makes it!\" the announcer cried out.  \"She is wasting no time downing that potion.  And as for Orthros... it looks like he enjoys this gift a lot more than the last one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the healing effects of the potion revitalize her tired body, Tifa, renewed and enraged, sighted her quarry.  Sure enough, just as the announcer said, Orthros was bubbling in place over where her panties were tossed.  Wordlessly, Tifa broke into a sprint and leapt into the air, raising her leg and bringing it down in a devastating drop kick.  Her heel crushed Orthros like a grape, the last of its slime body splattered on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa, covered only in sweat and occasional splotches of black slime residue, stood up, looked around, and stomped on each of those splatters one more time for good measure.  \"Finally,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has done it!\" The announcer roared.  \"It took all she had, but Tifa has slain Orthros and is victorious over the Battle Arena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted into another wave of cheers and whistles, re-alerting Tifa to her naked state and the view everyone was having.  Red-faced from more than just exhaustion, she clutched her chest once more and, relying on the high audience seats to prevent anyone from seeing down below, she looked down towards Orthros' remains.  But, alas, not even scraps of her underwear were left behind.  Now you decide to chow down.  One final hurrah, Orthros? she thought angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Battle Points have been awarded, Ms. Lockheart.  We hope to see you back here real soon,\" the announcer said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd like that wouldn't you?\" Tifa muttered under her breath, as she ran through the opened gate back to the lobby.  The fight was definitely intense and exhilerating, but losing all her clothes?  Who knew what other pervy things the staff could come up with after this?  It would be a while before she came back, to say the least.  Right now, she needed to get back to safety, and clothes, through the most popular amusement park on the planet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrgh!\" she shook her head.  Thinking on it wasn't going to do any good, she needed to move, now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the lobby was empty of people.  They must've all been in the audience, Tifa thought, shuddering at the thought of how many there must have been.  Well, at least this makes it easier for me to get out before anyone else shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" a voice rang out invitingly as she reached halfway across the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Tifa turned around, and saw that the receptionist for the Battle Square was still at her desk!  She quickly clapped one arm down between her legs, trying to keep everything covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an amazing fight, saw it all on the camera feed,\" the young woman continued.  \"I'll be remembering that one for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there would be a camera, dammit all! Tifa swore internally as she turned to run through the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" the receptionist called out.  \"I know you don't really wanna stick around like that, but I just wanted to remind you that if you leave, all your BP will go away.  It's a waste but it's the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa froze in her tracks.  Those were the rules.  If she didn't get something from the prize counter, then everything would have been for naught!  Changing course to the prize counter, which was thankfully close to the entrance, she browsed the menu.  \"Clothes, clothes, clothes... shit!\" she swore.  No clothes to be found at all.  Still, there was one thing that she could buy, one that she had her eye on when starting these fights, and she had just enough BP to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInputting her purchase, out from the machine came a Championship Belt.  The large golden belt wasn't just a bragging rights symbol showing who the best around was, it also provided a boost to one's strength and toughness.  And for Tifa, it had the additional benefit of covering up a bit.  Putting the belt on around her hips, it hung somewhat loosely, as it was meant to be worn around clothes, but it held fast and at least the buckle was enough to cover her crotch from most onlookers.  Someone beneath her would still be able to see, but it was better than nothing, at least.  And she could already feel the power boosts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo!  Tifa!\" a cheer went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whewhew!* someone whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click-Flash* went a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa turned around and paled.  The audience had entered the lobby, and a lot of them looked really <i>eager</i> to get up close and personal with her.  Realizing her hands were out of position, she quickly brought them up in front of her breasts again, and looked towards the entrance.  As it turned out-</span></div></div>",

Dozens of people have already seen her naked thanks to this, and many more would be seeing just as much on her way out, with or without the belt.  This was a matter of principal and pride.  All day Tifa had been fighting and fighting in the arena to claim her prize, and now someone was just going to snatch it off her and get away with it without punishment just because she was nude?  They just made the biggest mistake of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolutely, Tifa turned around to face the room again with a fierce glare, only her red cheeks giving any hit of embarrassment.  Glancing downwards, she first checked the ground.  No shining of her belt in sight, just as she suspected. \"Hey!\" she yelled.  \"Which one of you stole it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the crowd ignored her and went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we getting an encore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love it, just love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind doing a pose?\" a man with a camera asked moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa suddenly grabbed the man with a camera and quickly hoisted him above her head.  \"Aah!\" the man gasped, partly from fear, yet partly from fanatic bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd's fervor quickly plummeted into confusion and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask just one more time,\" Tifa said, her voice cutting through the crowd like a knife.  \"Which one of you took my belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd muttered amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belt?  Was she wearing a belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I was too focused on the upstairs to check out the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was naked when she left the ring, there's no way she could still have a belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that makes sense, why's she accusing us of theft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to take some of our clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  We should show her a thing or two about false accusations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began to turn on Tifa.  Tifa, in turn, tightened her grip on the captive over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOHHH!\" the man screamed.  \"I-It's fine, I don't mind!  But I don't think I saw a belt in all that crowd, if that means anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FWEEEET* a whistle sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards its source, all eyes turned towards the receptionist, who had moved from out from her desk.  Tifa's eyes met with the woman's, who gave her a wink.  \"Now hold on,\" the receptionist said.  \"Ms. Lockhart here definitely had a belt when you were all swarming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?  What makes you so sure?\" one of the crowd asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I saw her buy it from the prize stand before you all moved in.  I reminded her that her BP would be lost if she left without spending it, and so she took the time out to buy that belt as her hard-earned, well-deserved winnings, even though it allowed you to catch up to her like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMembers of the crowd began to shuffle awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But one of you decided they didn't have enough with just viewing, taking candid pictures of, and touching her voluptuous, statuesque figure-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa turned pure crimson, cringing at the choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and decided to rob this wonderful woman of all her hard work, and even accuse her of trickery to save your own skin.  Or maybe you just wanted the belt and thought she would be easy pickings.  So, either give her back the belt now and we can all go about our day, or I'll expose you with this detector,\" she said, holding up a small electronic device.  \"and have security come to have a word with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear swept through the crowd, and some members immediately broke off into the room, showing off their beltless waists as innoncence.  As the receptionist continued to draw closer, more and more members dispersed, until suddenly one of the people, wearing a black, hooded sweatshirt and jeans, bolted towards Tifa and the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the receptionist shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Tifa grunted as the suspicious figure squeezed by her, bumping into her on the way out.  But, as they passed by, Tifa's eye caught the glimpse of a gold emblem stuffed into the front pocket of their sweater.  It was the belt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Tifa yelled, starting to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah!\" the man she was carrying yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Tifa said, quickly setting the man down.  \"Sorry about that, got to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa sprinted down the stairs, just in time to see the culprit leave through one of the passages to another section of the amusement park.

If she didn't catch up before then, then they'd be sitting safe and sound while she, on the other hand, would be stranded and could kiss her last bit of coverage goodbye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Tifa would have sorely wished otherwise, there was no shortage of fairgoers at this time of day, meaning the line for the gondola was packed.  The hooded hooligan wasted no time in shoving towards the front, weaving through and leaping past anything blocking their path.  Tifa quickly gave chase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile many in the crowd were angry at the line cutter, their anger was stopped at the sight of the tall, muscular, and entirely nude young woman barrelling through.  It was the second time that day that Tifa was charging through a crowd without a stitch on her.  Even though this crowd was not groping her like the previous one, no doubt too in shock to react, she was still highly embarrassed and mortified.  She desperately hoped that it would be the last time she would ever find herself in a situation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowning out her shame by focusing on her goal, Tifa saw that the gondola had begun to move.  She couldn't help but smirk as she continued to push through.  With people already on the ride and the ride in motion, it looked like this guy wasn't gonna get to escape after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the thief just slipped past the gate and ran toward the gondola, grabbing onto the door.  All too easily, they pulled the door open, and threw out the couple that had already gotten on!  \"Right... the belt,\" Tifa grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gondola had almost left the loading platform, but there was no way that she was going to be left behind, not now!  However, there was still a large group of people between her and the ride.  To get past this many people... Tifa shook her head.  She was already in too deep, no use backing down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alley-oop!\" Tifa said, climbing on top of the nearest person and leaping across them on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps and cheers rang out from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you liked that, cause that's all you're gonna get,\" she said under her breath as she made it to the platform.  She still had a little bit of time!  With one final run and leap, she ran, jump, and made it on to the back of the gondola.  She climbed around to the side toward the luckily still-open door where she saw the culprit, sitting on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fluid motion, Tifa pulled herself inside the car and grabbed the person's sweatshirt.  \"All right, creep!\" she yelled.  \"Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, no?\" the perp responded, going slack and slipping out from their own sweatshirt, leaving Tifa holding just the empty shirt as they slid underneath, swatting Tifa's bottom as they went under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Hey!\" Tifa growled, throwing the sweatshirt to the floor as she turned around to face the thief.  With the hood no longer covering their face, Tifa could see for them for the first time, finding herself face-to-face with-</span></div></div>",

In the blink of an eye Yuffie caught Tifa's wrist in an iron grip and spun the fighter around, pinning Tifa's arm behind her back and pressing her naked form against the gondola window with supernatural strength. Tifa cursed her pilfered belt for augmenting Yuffie's strength; this grip would be trivial to break otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Tifa! Surprised to see me?\" Yuffie asked, her voice all too cheery for pinning her naked friend like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Tifa asked, struggling vainly against Yuffie's hold. In fact, all this succeeded in doing was dragging Tifa's heavy breasts against the cold glass of the gondola window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first I was just watching you fight, cheering you on.\" Yuffie explained, letting her free hand tickle at random areas of Tifa's exposed flesh. \"But when that slime stripped you down? I knew I had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Yuffie talking about? She sees her friend in a predicament like this and her thoughts go straight to having fun at their expense?! Perhaps Tifa didn't know Yuffie as well as she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you've had your fun. All those people saw me, and way too many touched me. I give my word I won't pound you into a pulp for this, and now you'll help me out, right?\" Tifa asked, mixing threat and plea in a hope that it might sway Yuffie's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie leaned in close, her lips practically touching Tifa's ear as the ninja whispered. \"Is that how you think this is gonna go? Well, aren't you optimistic? Here's what's actually gonna happen: this gondola passes right over all the main attractions in the Gold Saucer. In fact, in the right places it's not that far off the ground, as you're about to find out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tifa could ask what Yuffie meant, the ninja spun her around once more and roughly shoved her back out the open gondola door.

The bad news was quickly apparent, as Tifa leaned up to a sitting position and saw bright lights in front and above of her, obscuring the silhouettes of several people; all of whom gasping and muttering in ways that the fighter recognized all too well at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hell,\" Tifa simply stated.  Yuffie had dropped her into the Event Square's play, right in the middle of a performance!  <i>So this is how she treats her friends, huh?</i>  Tifa thought bitterly, covering her privates once again with only her arms and legs while remaining seated.  <i>Well, enjoy this while it lasts, cause once I find you-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lo!  What is the meaning of this?\" a man onstage near Tifa proclaimed, interrupting her thoughts of vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over, and saw that it was a man dressed like a king who spoke.  <i>A king?  So it's this play again...</i> Tifa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suddenly from the heavens has dropped this, this, er... unclothed unknown!\" the actor dressed like a king explained, shooting a couple glances Tifa's way while trying best to remain in character.  \"Her shocking appearance, what does it bode for our tale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Argh!  I don't have time for this!</i> Tifa thought.  She had spent too long being naked in front of WAY too many people, the only plus being a magical power-granting belt as a reward for her battles that thankfully was being held by a friend, or at least someone she knew and could get it back from (friend was really, really stretching it right now. So, all that was left was for her to find some clothes and get dressed now! \"Um, look...\" Tifa stood up, facing square with her covered front towards the audience while tilting her neck to address the king.  She didn't even want to think about the view the other actors behind her were getting right now.  \"Sorry for crashing the play, especially like... well, this.  But I have had a <i>very</i> long day, so... I gotta go,\" she said, starting to edge her way off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait!\" the king said, grabbing her arm and pulling her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  What!?\" Tifa gasped, only barely able to keep her arm in place and maintain coverage over her nipples, causing much gasping in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" the king leaned closer to Tifa and lowered his voice.  \"These people came for a play, and we were right in the middle of the climax when you and your big booty come streaking in from above and take out one of our leads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Tifa said awkwardly, keeping her voice low as well.  \"I'm really, really sorry about that, but I was pushed out of the gondola and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't care how you get your jollies on your own time,\" he interrupted.  \"But if this play doesn't get all wrapped up nicely with a bow, these people are gonna get upset, and then things are gonna get real ugly around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Tifa said, raising her voice again.  \"It's not that complicated a play!  Just get who you have left to fill in the parts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fill in-?  Lady!\"  the king was getting angry now.  \"These roles are already established, and you just KOed a key player!

Despite her attempts to pull them higher, her shorts had slid down to the edge of her hips, low enough so that the waistband of her panties was clearly visible.  \"Well, this is embarrassing,\" Yuffie sighed, grateful that the shorts were still staying on her, at least; even though she was now showing off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was here on a heist.  No one would be seeing anything anyways, so it was high time to get back up there and clean house!  Retrieving her knife and looking around, Yuffie quickly found the staircase leading back up to the shop floor.  With newfound vigor, Yuffie hurried and open the door.

Looks like they would have to go too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!  This better be worth it,\" Yuffie groaned as she stepped out of her ruined shorts and checked over herself.  The sweater was now more of a vest, except it was too compromised to cover anything in front, and there was no way her shorts would be covering much now, even if they could stay up on her waist.  She had chosen to stick with the loot and paid the price for doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie let out a long sigh.  She was not looking forward to escaping half-naked like this... but the alternative was slinking off in disgrace in torn clothes with no loot.  And, she figured, given her luck today, there was no guarantee those clothes would have held on long enough for her to reach safety, leaving her with no loot and no dignity!  After all she had been through, there was no way she was giving up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, all or nothing!\" she said, motivating herself as she gathered her former outfit and stuffed them into the bag.  At least everything fit inside, a silver lining to having a small haul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Yuffie grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small haul it was indeed.  Nowhere near the size of her usual takes.  And with all she was sacrificing for it at this point, it didn't seem worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's eyes wandered back to the display case, and the hole that she had made in the floor.  There were still several more orbs of materia left to pilfer, just lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" now was not the time to get greedy!  Who knew what other traps or self-inflicted trouble she would inflict on herself if she stayed behind?  She was already half-gone at this point, no need to push her luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, there was a lot of room in her bag; even with her clothes inside... An extra loss like this deserves additional compensation.  The normal amount wouldn't cut it this time.  And besides, she couldn't cruelly separate the poor materia like this, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips and with a glint in her eye, Yuffie weighed the risks and decided-</span></div></div>",

Sure, the damage to her outfit sucked, but it wasn't like anyone was around to care, or that she had far to go. Her decision had been made. With the spacious satchel in hand, Yuffie approached the display case with a grin. Okay, all she had to do was gather the rest and get far away from that stupid shop. Opening the bag with one hand, and tossing the orbs into the opened container with the other, the thinly-clad thief was soon making short work of the remaining orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as she began to move from one section of the case to another, it happened. At some point during her blissful gathering, a pair of tiny metal hooks extended out from separate shelves of the cabinet, totally beyond the girl's notice. One had been level with Yuffie's chest, the other with her waistline, and each specifically situating itself within the center of each of her undergarments. She hadn't been aware of their movement or presence in the slightest... until she  made to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the protruding devices took action in that very moment. As Yuffie started to move, the hooks started to pull. Without her paying any mind to the opposing force that was being exerted against her ensnared underwear, the result was instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her departure was met with the chilling sounds of two sets of fabric tearing in unison, Yuffie knew something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't have been more right, and wished she hadn't been. The top hook had perfectly set itself right inside the front center of her bra...and pulled it apart with ease, leaving her staring at her plainly exposed chest as she froze in her tracks. If only had had been the worst of it... but the lower hook had done a number on her panties, too, and began tearing them right at the waist. It hadn't done enough damage to completely split them like it had her bra, but telltale damage had most certainly been done. The torn fabric was already beginning to expose the slender incline beneath her waist, and if it tore any further, there'd be no keeping them on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez...\" Yuffie whispered to herself in disbelief, holding the materia bag while staring at her torn underwear in useless shock. Okay... this wasn't hopeless yet. She just had to get off of those hooks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a gulp and a meek attempt to regain her composure, Yuffie decided she had to-</span></div></div>",

But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the floor below her buckled and tilted forward, leaning her over enough to see her hard-earned loot resting nearby, but not far enough to fall to the floor.

Yuffie panicked internally, trying feebly to remove herself from the platform before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the paralysis magic held strong.

Only to find her hand still firmly closed around the magical orb.  \"Wait, what!?\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs shocked as Yuffie was by her unresponsive hand, she was twice as shocked when her body suddenly twisted to the right.  Desperately, she tried to force herself to stop, but found that, while she could still feel her body, everything other than her head was no longer under her control!  It had to have been the magic!  \"No!  This can't be happening!\" Yuffie shrieked as her body walked back toward the glass case, materia still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her struggle, Yuffie could only watch in agony as she opened the cabinet and put the materia back inside, and subsequently digging out the rest of her haul and returning them as well.  With the last orb returned to its proper place, leaving everything just as it was before she arrived, her body was then controlled to walk to the store front and then... she stopped moving.  \"Is it finally over?  I can't believe this...\" she muttered in disbelief.  \"To have that kind of magic as a trap?  I gotta get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie made to leave through the front door, figuring that changing in the nearby alley, while risky, was far safer than remaining there any longer, but once again, her body wouldn't respond.  \"Still?  Come on!\" she wailed angrily, then came to a realization that made her even more pissed off. \"Are you watching this, shop guy!?  Yeah, of course you are, and you're probably even recording this too.  No idea where you could be, but any materia user worth their salt knows that control magic needs someone actively giving commands!  So you have to be watching from somewhere safe.  Like what you see, sicko!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response, but Yuffie, furious and embarrassed at being caught like this, and now there being a witness as well, could only continue to yell.  \"Well, fine!\" she shouted.  \"You've completely thwarted me, got all the materia back, and even stripped me naked!  And that last thing, well, no one's ever done THAT to me before, so congratulations, I guess.  A gold star for you!  I know better now than to try and steal something from this place.  And now that you've gotten your materia back, we're square, so how's about letting me go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still no answer, and Yuffie could still not move.  \"Come oooon,\" Yuffie whined.  \"Are you really gonna make me beg?  You already gotten the loot back.  I've got nothing now, what more do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yuffie's arm moved to her bag once more, but Yuffie was aware enough to know that it was not by her will.  Given her question, it wasn't hard to guess what this would mean.  \"No! No no no!  I need those!\" Yuffie shrieked as she picked out her clothes and let the empty satchel fall to the floor.  With her clothes in one hand, the other one dug around until it drew forth her knife.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, STOP!\" Yuffie begged, but her body would not.  As quickly as it had chopped through her belt earlier, the knife proved just as effective on the rest of her damaged clothes, tearing them down from damaged yet wearable to flimsy rags to tiny scraps of confetti in merely a minute.  Then, as if to add insult to injury, Yuffie's body tossed up the pieces into the air and twirled around like a ballerina as they fell in a shower around her.  \"Yeah, that bastard's definitely recording this,\" Yuffie growled amidst her sorrow and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a third and final spin, Yuffie took a deep bow, walked gracefully towards the shop door, opened it, and stepped outside while adjusting the lock so that it would shut behind her.  Looking around, she feared the worst, but was relieved to find that while there were people on the nightime street, there was no one around the weapon shop yet.  This night was a complete disaster.  She went in ready to pilfer some prime materia, and now she was stuck in town naked save for her bandana, shoes, and socks.  The only blessing was that there was still a chance she could leave without any further humiliation, but that silver lining all depended on whether she was finally free to act.  With a gulp, she tried to move her arms, finding that-</span></div></div>",

Her shame prevented her from making eye contact with the others, but she could feel their gaze violating her. Yuffie's body temperature continued to rise and despite being naked, felt hot.  Her innermost folds and clit were clearly visible now, slick and completely moist as Aeris predicted . Juices were  running down Yuffie's inner thigh, much to her dismay and the girls couldn't have been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Looks like we're not the only one's having fun!\" Aeris chimed, teasing Yuffie about her apparent arousal.

She'd done this kind of thing before, after all, and the few people who she hadn't duped at this point in a con had either backed out or just needed a tiny bit more encouragement. \"Fine!\" she said after a short silence. \"I'm going into the water. You'll see how fun it is- but that's it! If you guys don't join me, you are complete chickens, so you'd better be right behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was of course exactly what Tifa and Aeris had been waiting to hear. With barely concealed glee, they watched Yuffie stride confidently- or was that angrily?- to the edge of the ocean, not pausing to look back, obviously certain that they could not refuse a challenge like that. It was their chance to spring their trap, and it had worked out even better than they hoped- they hadn't even had to take off any clothes to get the cute little hothead to do exactly what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir plan was to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking toward the water, Yuffie refrained from looking over her shoulder at all. The most important thing to do now was project an aura of confidence; it was the fastest and best way to get them to follow her- which they absolutely would, of course. If they weren't willing to get talked into doing this, they wouldn't have shown up at the beach. It wasn't the easiest thing to look confident walking around in her birthday suit in broad daylight, knowing that this beach would be full of people in about half an hour, but she thought she managed to pull it off. She still had plenty of time to give them the slip, steal their clothes, and sneak off somewhere to enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the ocean, she paused for just a second before getting her nerve up and continuing in. The water felt chilly on her bare skin, but of course she had to pretend it felt great. She waded in up to her knees, then took in a big breath and dove underwater. She felt her skin getting goosebumps, but it was also refreshing. After swimming around underwater for a little while, she popped her head back up, grinning. She hadn't been lying about one thing- skinny dipping <i>was</i> pretty fun. Every good lie has an element of truth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as soon as they had been sure Yuffie was lost in her own little world of schemes and plots, Tifa and Aeris had leapt into action. They had convinced the volleyball teams to move the game up thirty or forty minutes, promising that there would be a special guest who would make it worth their while. They gave the signal, and the beach started to fill up with people- the two teams, of course, but also fans, referees, random beachgoers who wanted to see what the commotion was about, and Aeris thought she may have even seen a reporter. One of the team captains that they had struck the deal with approached, a young man who, like most of the other players, had a bare, broad chest and was wearing swimming trunks. A few female players were mixed in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it was tough on such short notice, but I got everybody to come here early. This place looks abandoned, though. Where's this guest of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Aeris, turning toward the ocean, \"you can see her out there, if you look. Her head, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain squinted and frowned. \"Yeah, sure. And what's so special about her?\" In reply, Aeris held out a pile of clothes and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie spent just a little bit more time playing around in the water by herself before the absence of her victims started to feel conspicuous. Even going at a very slow pace, they should have gotten here by now... Maybe they were out in another section of the water by themselves? She finally chanced a look around, but the ocean was calm and empty apart from her. She looked toward the shore, and sure enough, the girls were standing at the edge of the water, still fully dressed. Yuffie was disappointed and angry; they were cowards after all! Still, she'd already put so much effort into this, she figured she may as well give it one last try. She entirely failed to notice a small commotion farther up the beach behind her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swam towards shore, eyes locked with Tifa, then finally stood at the edge of the water and planted her fists on her hips. Aeris smiled widely and put a hand over her mouth, as if she were embarrassed or surprised, but in her temper Yuffie thought nothing of it. \"So not only are you a chicken, you're also a liar!\" she said with a frown. \"I thought you would at least do it to keep your promise, but you guys just don't like to do anything fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuffie...\" Tifa started, smiling, \"you know that we realized this thing was a trap the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's stomach dropped. What? They were bluffing! They couldn't know. \"That's... that's not true! Geez! What kind of lousy friend do you think I am? B-Besides, why would you even come here today if that's what you thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" said Aeris, barely holding in a wave of giggles, \"you haven't realized just where you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point Yuffie finally looked past Tifa and noticed two volleyball teams and a crowd of people, eyes fixed right on her. They smiled and waved, seeing that she'd noticed them, and she heard the unmistakable sound of camera shutters as they captured the image of her on film forever, dripping wet and surprised...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...her hands still on her hips, proudly displaying her entire naked front to world. Her face went bright red and she gave a loud \"Eek!\", re-positioning her hands to give herself a little bit of coverage, and shut her eyes tight. She heard hearty laughs all around her and opened her eyes again to survey the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa spoke up. \"I know what you're thinking, Yuffie. You might be fast enough to get past me, but can you get past me <i>and</i> a crowd of a hundred people?\" Yuffie seriously considered it for a minute. It was possible alright, but it was incredibly unlikely... and something bad would definitely happen if she tried and failed. Tifa and Aeris could always have a trick up their sleeve that would prevent her from running, too. \"So here's the deal. You're going to join in their game of volleyball, just like you are right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, we promise we'll give you at least some of this back!\" Aeris shouted, holding up her wad of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie had never been one given to careful consideration. She knew right away what she was going to do. She would...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't one to dwell on what had already been done... and there was no doubt, they'd seen her naked. It was some small solace that almost none of them were Wutaian, and she'd likely never see any of them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make her exactly hyped up to go running past them and give them a show either, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she also wasn't one to ignore a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... fine!

They knew Yuffie was bold, but they hadn't really expected it on such a level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were proven wrong. The naked thief boldly strode past both women towards the volleyball court, and while trying to keep her voice from shaking, she called over to the captain, while meekly attempting to conceal her intimates. She wasn't <i>that</i> bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S, so... um... when do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain coughed politely, trying not to stare at anything but Yuffie's face. She wasn't exactly a bombshell, but he had to admit... she was pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, you'll... be serving, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a woman from the same side as Yuffie's approached with an infuriated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold the phone! We can't play with a naked girl, it'll cause both teams to screw up! It won't be a fair game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the men began to gripe in protest, but the women definitely seemed to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuffie finally came up from her dive, her head bursting out of the water and into the sunlight. She'd been making things up on the spot when she was telling the other girls about how great skinny dipping was, she thought, but it turned out there was some truth in what she'd told them after all! There <i>was</i> something exhilarating and fun about swimming around in the ocean naked. The feeling of cold water rushing around her legs, the total lack of any confinement on her body. She felt so natural and free! She could probably do this for hours... but there were other plans to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned toward the shore, though, where she expected Tifa and Aeris to be, following in her wake, all those carefree feelings were washed away in an instant. At first she just noticed that the two women were missing, making her furious that they had chickened out and escaped her plans. Then her keen eyes noticed something else missing, something much more important- her little pile of clothes, which she'd left behind without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nudity quickly went from feeling free and liberating to terrifying and embarrassing. Despite being safely under the water, Yuffie instinctively covered herself with her hands, as if to subconsciously reassure herself that she was safe from view. She got out of the water and went over to where she'd discarded her clothes, just to make sure her eyes hadn't deceived her, but of course, to no avail. Aeris and Tifa had taken her clothes and left. She had a good idea where they would be right now, though getting to them in her current state was going to be humiliating. <i>Everyone</i> was going to see her. She was pretty sure she had no better option, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie had one thing going for her, at least- she had good eyesight, so she spotted Tifa and Aeris sitting on the beach almost immediately, so she wouldn't have to wander around looking for them. It was hard to be grateful, though, when it did nothing to change the fact that she was still naked, and everyone between her and them was staring at her as she made her way over to them. She wondered if they'd intentionally picked a spot that made her have to walk past so many young men to get to them, or whether they'd just been lucky. Her hands didn't cover as much as she'd like, and Yuffie was painfully aware from the feeling of open air on wet skin that her butt was entirely hanging out in the open. And to think, the whole point of this plan was that she was self-conscious! Now she felt more self-conscious than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fit of giggles overtook both Tifa and Aeris as they spotted their companion heading toward them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your skinny dipping?\" Aeris called. \"Was it everything you told us it would be? From where I'm standing, it looks like it was... lacking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like the whole experience was missing one little thing. What do you think, Yuffie? Missing something?\" Tifa dangled Yuffie's panties in the air tauntingly as Yuffie finally stood over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, very funny, guys,\" growled Yuffie, trying to seem tough while still nervously covering her privates with her hands. \"Alright, joke's over. I want my clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you do!\" Aeris said, eyeing up Yuffie and giggling. \"I know I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, Yuffie, I want you to answer a question for me.\" said Tifa, with an air of seriousness. \"And if I don't think you answered honestly, I'm keeping your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie had no idea where this was going, but there were too many people looking at her for her to think straight. Her hands felt woefully inadequate as cover... \"Make it quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smirked. \"If your little plan had worked, and we were the ones who ended up naked, what were you going to do to us before we got our clothes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie was taken aback, unsure how to answer such a loaded question. She obviously couldn't tell the truth! Could she? What was the point of being an excellent liar, as she knew that she was, if not to lie in a situation like this? Nevertheless, there was a brief moment of hesitation where she wondered if it might be better to just fess up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Yuffie answer?</span></div></div>",

Leaning out of an alley with nothing on was just asking for trouble, especially in the growing daylight. She had to find something to use first. Anything, even! She cringed as she saw her options consisted of a nearby dumpster and some stray trash cans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl wasn't *that* desperate, was she?...  As it happened, she was. The dumpster couldn't be on any rational person's list, but checking the trash cans seemed marginally less awkward. She took a deep breath, then leaned down as she pulled the lid off. One must have been for recyclables. She saw assorted plastics, aluminum cans, and some folded up newspapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-...guess it's something...\" Yuffie became conscious of her breasts swaying freely, and bashfully set an arm across them while looking to ensure no one was looking into the gradually-brightening alley. No one was. Without much of a choice, she reached in and began pulling out bits of newspaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, she had gathered quite a few scraps of clippings from the trash... but they were just that; clippings. It seemed the best the thief could hope for was covering up her intimates, if she was lucky. Given the alternative of nothing at all, Yuffie sighed and did what she could with what little she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she had managed to create a strapless 'top' of a long strip of paper wound across her chest, barely held together behind her. For once her lack of endowment seemed like a bonus. She had enough of a bust for the haphazard cover to look silly, but she wouldn't be bouncing all over the place or be under constant threat of spilling out. Her lower body, though...her hips had proven more difficult to wind what she had around. She had just enough to bundle up a few scraps of paper to hold over her pelvic area. She blushed as she hesitantly pushed her palm against her waist to hold the thin pile in place between her legs. It was next to nothing at all, but she wasn't totally bottomless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option but to go dumpster diving, it was time for Yuffie to see what she was up against.

Despite her privileged upbringing, Rinoa has an interest in the affairs of the world, which led to her leading an anti-Galbadian resistance faction. Granted, said resistance faction was made up of amateurs with no combat experience of concept of how to go about taking down a military occupation, but it clearly showcased Rinoa's stubborn and naive nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the events of the story unfold, Rinoa finds herself imbued with a rare gift- the magical powers of a sorceress. Unlike normal people that need to use technology and Guardian Forces to harness magic, Rinoa can cast spells naturally. Of course, the full extent of this gift and the finer points of its control are a mystery, as it is rare that a sorceress' powers can be studied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Rinoa, these unique and interesting aspects of her personality would come back to bite her today.

You did, get them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously!\" Zell said, confidently producing a manilla envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've got the camera prepared?\" Seifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... though it doesn't feel right putting her through this,\" Selphie said, a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you fail, then you can't run the Garden Festival anymore, you know?\" said Raijin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I know...\" Selphie groaned.  \"Still, it feels like you guys are getting a lot more out of this than me or even Fujin.  I mean, what are we supposed to get out of seeing Quistis naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SATISFACTION,\" Fujin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Selphie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit of payback for how she treated us in the past,\" said Seifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We blackmail her with these pics, she passes us on the test, we get a little revenge and you get to stay in charge of the party.  Seifer's plan is brilliant.  He's a genius!\" said Raijin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't forget about my part,\" Zell said, while opening the envelope.  \"It wasn't easy to snag, but victory's as good as ours now... What the-!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT.\" said Fujin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't-!  Argh...\" Zell groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it here!\" Seifer said, snatching the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the paper was not the answer key they were hoping for, but instead simply a drawing of Quistis' face, with a reprimand telling any would-be snoops to put as much energy into studying as they did with their half-brained cheating methods.  Seifer didn't even bother to read it, instead crumpling up the paper and throwing it to the ground, growling, \"Nice job, chicken-wuss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  You could've helped with this!\" Zell shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to get the Confuse spell ready!  You know, our only shot at this?  I knew I shouldn't have left it to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pin it all on him!\" Selphie spoke up in Zell's defense.  \"He was the only one with free time.  My being busy with everything was what got me into this mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DISCIPLINING.\" Fujin said awkwardly, looking to the side in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... I got nothing,\" said Raijin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all finished?\" Quistis asked, addressing the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah!  Yup!  YES.  No problem!  It's cool!\" they all responded at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let us begin,\" Quistis said, bringing up the questions on the montor.  <i>We'll see just how effective this method is,</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, serves you right,\" Selphie said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget your ass is on the line if we fail,\" Seifer glowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man... what do we do now?\" Zell whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, dumbass?\" Seifer hissed back.  \"We answer her questions.  Don't mess up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the Confusion was enough for Seifer's blackmail plan, it wasn't enough to make Quistis accept blatantly incorrect answers.  Even so, as the test went on, the five found themselves...</span></div></div>",

First, she checked if anyone had contributed to the Garden Festival today.  Not much activity there, as usual.  Though she had gotten some more classmates involved, it seemed that without her at the helm, not much progress would be made at all.  Still, Selphie wasn't too worried.  Once the festival began, everyone would be enjoying themselves and would look back on it fondly.  They just needed a little push in doing all the hard work needed to make it happen, that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she checked her email.  There were no new messages, which was also dull, but at least that meant nothing was wrong.  No one else was online either, so she had the day to herself both off and on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to keep her busy, she started to play some games, and really got into it, spending a lot of time doing just that.  But, when she was about to finish the level she was on, the display of her monitor switched just as she clicked, causing her click to change from finishing the battle to accepting a computer prompt pop-up box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- Hey!\" Selphie yelled, ticked off and mad.  It had taken her a lot of tries to get that far, and now she had to start all over again.  But her anger quickly was replaced by confusion, as she soon recognized it was her webcam's software application that had interrupted her game.  \"Why's that open?\" she asked to herself.  \"Did I forget to turn it off last night?  And what did I just cli-\" she froze, as she realized just what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer webcam was a fairly recent, but often used, tool in her work on the Garden Festival, as she had begun a new approach, making videos of herself talking and hyping up the festivities and posting them on the Garden Festival's webpage, with decent success.  But, as she had been pretty busy up till now, she fallen into the pattern of setting her camera to auto-record as upon computer start-up, saving time to make, edit, and upload videos in what time she had, and hadn't used her computer for much else.  But today, she had forgotten about that function, only now seeing the output feed of her and her \"girls\" filling the picture, staring blankly up at the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" she shrieked, hunching forward and furiously closing the program.  \"Phew!  That was close,\" she sighed, and began to calm down, until she noticed another open window at the other side of her monitor, displaying a progress bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelphie's face paled as she saw that, and realized what that pop-up box from before really was.  Thanks to that accidental click, she had started a repeat export process, which was one that sends the next finished video to the be sent out under the same parameters as the last item sent with the program.  Horror dawned on her anew as she realized that her computer was now in the middle of sending her private moments-</span></div></div>",

The boy was a pretty good runner, but Selphie had a more dire need, so she went to the outside to pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, upon hearing Selphie's padded footsteps, turned and saw her, his eyes going wide.  \"Hey,\" Selphie grinned, then focused back on her goal and sped off towards the front of the hub.  <i>Must not be everyday that he gets challengers,</i> she thought, chalking up his expression as runner's pride, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy came to a stop while Selphie continued onward, panting while watching her until she was out of sight around the central elevator.  Blinking and rubbing his eyes, he realized that he had been running nonstop for the past hour and a half, and if he was seeing things like that, it was probably time for a food break, and walked the other way back towards the cafeteria wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelphie's run continued as she reached the directory, noticing the few students that usually hang out in the area.  She thought she saw them noticing her, but now was not the time to chew the fat; not while her dignity was on the line!  With chocobo-like agility and reflexes, she climbed up the stairs and reached the elevator door, pressing the call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*DING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the elevator was right there, ready and empty to take up to the second floor!  <i>There's a bit of good luck, at least.</i> she noted, catching her breath as she entered the elevator and pressed the button for the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selphie!?\" a surprised shout came from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out, Selphie could see two of the regular girls running towards the elevator.  <i>Aren't those two of the Card Club members?  What's their rush?  Ah, what am I thinking!?  I can't have any witnesses!</i> she thought.  \"Sorry, but I'm in a big hurry right now!\" Selphie called out, pushing the \"Door Close\" button repeatedely as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  Why are you-\" the girl shouted back, but was cut off by the doors closing just in front of her.  Selphie gave an apologetic look, and a \"sorry\" gesture at the flabbergasted pair as they watched Selphie ascend to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith recovered stamina, Selphie bursted out of the elevator as soon as the doors opened, and was relieved to find that there wasn't anyone around.  Not that there should be, on a nice day like this so late in the afternoon.  But there was always the possibility...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by a few of the rooms, she soon found her homeroom.  \"Jackpot!\" she said, starting to sweat from exhaustion as she entered the empty room and booted up her desk's computer.  \"Come on, come on,\" she said, tapping her foot impatiently.  Soon enough, though, the screen came to life.  Wasting no time in accessing her internet page, she found her video page and took it down with just a few clicks.  Refreshing the page confirmed it, the scandalous video was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh,\" she exhaled, feeling a great sense of relief.  \"That was too close...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her eyes fell on the hit counter for this specific video page: 2 hits!  Two people had accessed her page!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, NONONONONONONO!\" she stuttered repeatedly as she accessed the maintenance log.  Who was it, who had seen her dirty deed!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall? Not likely, he didn't really care much about the festival, or much of anything for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuistis?  She hoped not.  They were good enough friends, she felt, but the rumors of her strict discipline on rule-breakers had been circulated very strongly, and she did not want to be on the business end of her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster Cid?  <i>EW! Don't even think about that!</i> she cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fearful thoughts continued as she found the IPs of that which had accessed it.  It was... the same address?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelphie was puzzled, but less fearful since there was only one person that would need to be dealt with now.  But wait... one person accessing it twice?  She had a hunch as she pulled up the desk's computer specs.  The IP address turned out to be that of the very same computer she was using.  No one had accessed it but her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... Oh man...\" Selphie sighed, finally catching her breath for good and leaning back in the chair, the soft cushions feeling extra comfy under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Selphie uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin... she looked down at herself, and saw that she was wearing exactly what she was when she left the room: just her panties and slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at a loss for words, making garbled noises instead, as she processed what she just did.  She was too focused to realize the air on her body, and because of her slippers, her feet couldn't remind her that she was topless either.  But the boy, and the girls... She had succeeded in preventing her naked body from being seen on the computers, only to directly show it off instead!  Things were still very, very bad!  Selphie sprang up to run away...</span></div></div>",

After the debacle with Ultimecia and Seifer's complicity in her schemes, the former Garden student and his two cohorts found themselves effectively friendless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving never been one for conversation (indeed, one of her most well known personality traits was her habit of speaking entirely in single word statements), Fujin had no trouble with striking out with Seifer and Raijin on their own. However, over time, she couldn't deny a compulsion to finish her time as a Garden student. If the trio were going to support themselves, at least one of them should have a full education, after all. Considering Seifer's issues with authority that kept him from ever becoming a SeeD, and Raijin's... less than mature personality, it was only logical that Fujin be the one to take care of that responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartering her way back into the school hadn't been easy. Fujin had to effectively beggar herself before the Garden leadership, and was only allowed back into the school under a number of strict conditions. Her class load was out of her hands, she wasn't allowed off Garden premises without an escort, and she wasn't even afforded her own dorm room. She instead had to room with a \"handler\" that made sure she behaved herself. It might not have been so bad if they hadn't decided to pair her up with one of Squall's teammates.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuna was born into a world of strict spirituality and perpetual death punctuated by brief periods of peace. Every decade (give or take a few years) a monstrous entity known as Sin would arise to cut a path of destruction across the face of Spira. According to the Precepts of Yevon, Sin was a punishment brought upon the world for a time of decadence and the use of forbidden machines known as Machina. Fortunately, devout adherents of Yevon known as Summoners could make a journey and gather magical entities known as Aeons to battle Sin and its minions. Yuna knew very well what the cost of this pilgrimage was. Her father, Braska, had summoned the final Aeon ten years ago, losing his own life in the process yet banishing Sin for a time in the process. Yuna had made peace with sacrificing her life for the sake of the world, ready to die to bring about even a brief peace. The companions she made on her journey were far less comfortable with the idea. Her cousin Rikku (part of a tribe of heretics who used and tinkered with the ancient Machina) and her lover Tidus (a man who claimed to be from a time before Sin had ever existed, as well as the son of her father's guardian Jecht) were especially adamant and desperate to find another path. Their pleading and questioning led eventually to the truth- Sin was the \"armor\" of the ghost of Yu Yevon, the founder of the corrupt faith that controlled Spira. Every cycle Yu Yevon came to possess the body of the Final Aeon that killed the previous Sin, molding it into the next Sin to rise anew. With that revelation Yuna refused to receive the Final Aeon, and killed the guardian who would provide the summoning for good measure. With a new resolve, she and her guardians confronted and defeated Sin with their own strength, breaking the cycle and ushering in the Eternal Calm. In the process, Tidus was revealed to be a memory of the Aeons, a dream given flesh that would vanish with the death of Yu Yevon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the wake of her victoy, Yuna abandoned the path of the summoner and took up Sphere hunting with her cousin Rikku and the mysterious woman named Paine. Their search sought to uncover the secrets of Spira long hidden by the church of Yevon. In the process Yuna hoped to find a way to restore Tidus to the world of the living or come to terms with his disappearance and find a path for herself (facing for the first time the prospect of a long life over an act of martyrdom). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all ages Yuna is a rather shy and unassuming girl, who demonstrates a streak of mischievous fun every now and again. This sense of fun comes with a desperate edge, however. She knows that her life ends with her journey, and thus wants to have as much fun with her few remaining days as she possibly can. She has no love of making waves or standing out, making her situation very awkward as she is the High Summoner's daughter and therefore famous even before her journey begins. This shyness should not be confused with a weak will. Yuna has resigned herself to death for the sake of the world she loves, and will complete her journey no matter what. This in turn, however, does not mean she won't be mortified to find herself naked in her travels. It simply means that she will press on with or without her clothes, determined to complete her journey even at the cost of her own dignity. As a summoner she wears a fairly conservative outfit compared to many natives of Spira (especially the tropical islands and dry inner continents with their hot summers). Her preferred dress consists of a black boots, a full length skirt colored a dark blue with a series of white patterns giving the impression of star filled sky. The top of her outfit consists of a white fabric wrapped across her chest and over her shoulders. The whole ensemble is held together with a bright yellow sash tied into a large bow in back. One can speculate that this outfit works like a kimono, in which case if the sash were removed the outfit would fall to pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the events of FF10 Yuna loosens up considerably. No longer chaffing under the rigors of Yevon's teachings, Yuna is visibly more carefree and whimsical. However, she remains unassuming and relatively shy. Worth noting is that Yuna has patently refused to take up the reigns of politics despite the vacuum left by the church of Yevon. She remains uncomfortable with her new celebrity status, which has reached obsessive levels after permanently defeating Sin. Despite this, she will occasionally use her popularity to make public appearances and rally the citizens of Spira to prevent wars or simply raise morale in uncertain times. She sports a good deal more skin than before, possibly at the insistence of her cousin Rikku (who, in either FFX or FFX-2 bares the most flesh of any of the characters). Her thigh high boots remain the same, but her modest skirt has been replaced by a billowy \"half-skirt\" of light blue fabric that does nothing to hide her long pretty legs. Beneath it she wears a pair of short shorts that don't quite provide enough material to hide the curve of her ass cheeks. A brown leather belt with a satchel contains her items and equipment, as well as the holsters to her weapons of choice, a pair of magical pistols. All that covers her upper half is an extremely tight corset like item of white fabric exposing a generous amount of cleavage and leaving her shoulders and arms bare. Across her chest she wears a symbol in memory to her lost lover. Her hair is braided into two knots, one a hold over from her Summoner days, the other a sweeping new addition that somehow comes almost to her knees. One final note- although this is her typical \"sphere hunting\" apparel, she and her companions have a magical \"garment grid\" that allows them to change clothes and costumes at will. One wonders what might happen if the grid malfunctioned or a \"dress sphere\" was introduced that had not been uploaded with an outfit yet. But surely nothing like that would ever happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does our story begin?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strange how life works out, isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her youngest years Yuna had never been comfortable with spectacle or big crowds. While the utter adoration she received in her home village was vaguely flattering (and intimidating) Yuna had never been one to milk a crowd or use her public image for her own game. For one thing large groups gathering in one place was a magnet for Sin. For another, the reputation of Lord Braska had always felt like a hindrance for her...something more she needed to overcome in order to stake her own claim to life and earn a proper name for herself. That contrast set her apart from the other, more corrupt elements of Yevon, which made her all the more beloved by the people. That certain individuals, like Seymour, had tried to use her like an object for their own political games (she still remembered the way her image in that skimpy dress had been broadcast all across Spira as a show of Seymour's truimph) had made her all the more skittish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pure chance that she happened to have a rather good singing voice. The first big concert hadn't even been her at all. A rival Sphere Hunter named La Blanche had stolen her dress sphere and effectively used her image to promote a concert and sell her own merchandise. It had somewhat spooked and galled her how many people had shown up for the event. She had hoped that avoiding politics and (almost literally) running away from the public spotlight would dampen her appeal after the victory over Sin. Apparently the opposite was true. Her apparent shyness regarding the public had combined with her celebrity status and hero worship to make Spira downright obsessed with her. That she had carefully hidden a rather attractive little body under those modest robes for so many years (apparently equipped with a much more generous figure than any had suspected, to say nothing of her tight stomach and cute little butt!) and remained single and presumably chaste like a good little Yevon girl even after the collapse of Yevon only heightened Spira's adoration and fascination. To her chagrin, the promise of an appearance by Lady Yuna, the savior of Spira and bringer of the Eternal Calm, was an instant draw for people all over the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, Yuna herself had had to take advantage of that very popularity to prevent a war. She had gathered an even larger crowd in the Thunder Plains and performed a lovely song inspired by a long dead kindred spirit desiring to serenade a lover who met a tragic end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concert had been a success and likely saved the world all over again. But it had certain consequences. One of those was the constant hounding Yuna received to promote one event or another. She had flatly refused at first. But the beggars had become more and more clever. \"Blitzball is a sacred tradition! It gave the people hope in the face of Sin's despair! It kept the world united over a thousand years! And the game has always had a Maester to mark the opening game of the season! But there aren't any more Maesters to be found! If the Lady Yuna won't come out, who will give honor to the players and continue the grand traditions holy and otherwise that saw Spira through the harsh times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSacrifice your personal anxieties for the good of the world. Yes, they had certainly learned how to push her buttons. So here she was, standing up on a gaudy floating platform in the middle of an enormous stadium, a hundred dancing lights illuminating her, decked out in her songstress uniform, a jumbotron giving an upclose view of her dancing and singing. Surprisingly, La Blanche had been all too happy to volunteer her resources to the cause. That it would necessitate her rival's particularly...showy brand of showmanship was just another sacrifice Yuna made for the sake of the event. Really, more people were likely tuning in for the preshow performance than the actual game. The eyes of the whole world were literally on her! The good news was that she was doing a decent job of performing, and even the few times she tripped over the words to her song or missed a dance step the audience didn't seem to notice or care! Lady Yuna was making a public appearance! All of Spira was ecstatic, eating up every little moment like a starving dog waiting breathlessly for any little scrap its mistress was willing to toss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, poor Yuna was about to provide the world a full course meal. Just when everything seemed to be going fine....</span></div></div>",

Whatever it is, deal with it and let me finish!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it! Your dress sphere is going crazy! It might pop you into a new outfit any minute!\" Shinra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then fix it! If I change I'll deal with it and carry on! Stop distracting me!!\" Yuna hissed, before returning completely to her performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\" Paine asked over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna grit her teeth. Apparently they hadn't bothered to turn off the connection. Making the most of the situation, she moved to the center of the stage and began her big solo number, letting the familiar words drum out the annoying chatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is...invading the garment grid! I dunno how else to describe it. It reminds me of the readings we saw back when Lenne started taking over Yuna's movements and personality. But this is different...maybe stronger.\" Shinra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if its like Lenne, then you have a way to stop it, right? Some kind of firewall to prevent it from affecting Yunnie?\" Rikku piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly would I make something like that?\" Shinra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You built the damn thing! Can't you do something??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a kid.\" Shinra said, offering his standard excuse for technical issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna was on her last verse when she was blinded by white light. Crap, the dress sphere was activating! Already her clothes and skin were glowing a blinding white as peals of ribbon like energy spread out around her form. Yuna held her note. She could just treat this like part of the show, though the situation made her blush. Most of her other outfits were, to her chagrin, much more skimpy than the one she currently had on. Shinra was going to get an ear full when this was over. Still, she posed dramatically and let the transformation wash over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the clapping and cheering stopped dead as her song ended. Yuna waited, waited, but no applause came. Instead there were a scattering of stunned murmurs. Then shocked whispering. A few people started clap and woof whistle. But soon enough the overwhelming sound was a rising cacophony of shocked and mocking laughter. And almost in time with the noise the darkened theater hall seemed to come alive with flashing lights. People had been taking pictures all along, but now it seemed that literally everyone who had a camera was using it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna frowned in puzzlement. This was not at all the expected reaction. Urgh. Her new outfit must be something really stupid looking. But what? It obviously wasn't the giant moogle costume. Too much exposed skin. Speaking of...it felt particularly drafty in here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna looked down. And screamed. She found herself wearing something akin to her typical adventure's suit. She had her holster and her gun belt, her necklace and braids, her arm bands and boots. What she didn't have was her shirt, half-skirt, shorts, or underwear. In every way that mattered to her modesty or the audience, she was very naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna screamed and covered exposed breasts and pussy. Like a deer caught in headlights, she stared in horrified silence at the audience. The crowd loved it, and the laughter rose ever higher. Panic set in and she began to dash around the stage. Alas, there was no escape. La Blanche was reusing the set from her faked Yuna concert. Yuna was standing on a luminscent stage made of magical energy, being projected from a large floating machina hovering three stories up. There was no way to escape as long as the damn thing hung in midair like this! Worse, every stage light continued to shine on her, exposing every inch of her naked body to the excited thousands in the stand. Above and below her massive jumobotron like screens were happily displaying close ups of her nudity from every possible angle imaginable. And worst of all, Yuna's humiliation was being projected directly to every city and settlement in Spira! For all intents and purposes, Lady Yuna was standing completely naked in front of the entire planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No!\" Yuna wailed. \"Sh-Shinraaaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, now you want my help- OW!\" Shinra quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a snot!\" Paine snapped. \"Fix the sphere grid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to! This might take awhile, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then shut down the power! Or cut the feed! I'm naked out here!\" Yuna screamed, at last falling to her knees, raising them up to her chin so that her legs and sitting position would hide the view of her sex, breasts, and ass as much as possible. Some in the audience booed and made known their disappointment. Others found this move all the more hilarious. Yuna felt her face might melt from the heat of her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what your saying. This is all done with ancient machina. We barely know how the things work! No one can cut the power except the ones who set it up. So we'll need La Blanche's help with all this. And so far she hasn't responded!\" Shinra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we get her out of there. NOW!\" Paine declared. \"Come on blondie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Lady Summoner, accidentally exposed naked before the whole world! This would surely be the highlight of the year. Yuna's supporters were wincing in sympathy (though many of them were secretly snickering at her antics) and her enemies were enjoying mocking her with derision. But not one expected Yuna to stand up, allowing the cameras and the jumbotrons to display her nudity without any attempt at covering herself. And then the music started up again, a more energetic version of her last song. To Yuna's horror, she began to dance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience was amazed. Was this actually part of the show?? Here Yuna was, shaking her tight little butt from side to side like a professional stripper, swaying her hips in little circles and offering tasty glimpses of her inner (shaven!) folds and her bouncing breasts. Then, with a wanton wink to the audience, Yuna assumed a rather seductive pose and began playing with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\"  Yuna screamed in a panic. Her large breasts were completely on display for the cameras! Every centimeter of her orbs, now displaying rock hard nipples and being squeezed together, was being projected on a screen hundreds of feet wide. Her life was over. There was no way to come back for this! Facing down Sin in a head on collision was easier than this! This was surely the worst thing that could possibly happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to show her just how wrong she was, Yuna gasped as one of her hands let go of her breasts and traced its way up to her face. To her shock she proceeded to insert two of the delicate digits into her mouth. She felt herself suckling her fingers, slowly moving up and down, licking them in an intimate fashion. Neither she nor the audience missed the implication, easily imagining that she was gently sucking on something far more intimate. Yuna blushed feverishly as her fingers finally emerged, thoroughly licked and sucked and soaked through with her juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna's eyes widened as her hand descended. She knew where its next destination was. \"No! Not there! Anything but that! Not in front of everyone! Please No!\" Her hand was entirely uninterested in her pleas. Her wet digits parted her inner folds and began to move in and out of her most intimate of places. Yuna's mind seemed to lose all focus. The sheer depths of her humiliation combined with the fog of pleasure that was slowly building inside her was addling her senses. Sharing her room with two other good friends meant that pleasuring herself was a very difficult task for modest Yuna, which in turn meant her opportunities to please her libido were few and far between. So her body was loving the attention, even as her mind was dying of the shame. In mere moments she felt her inner walls clench and embrace her probing fingers, her hips bucking on instinct. The pressure was too much for her trembling knees. She sank to the glowing floor of the stage, luxuriating on the ground, pushing her head back and her breasts up towards the sky and the cameras while spreading her legs wide. Every inch of her was open and naked and giving the most lewd display she could have ever imagined. She felt an orgasm coming on, and everyone on Spira had a front row seat for her display!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Yuna could hear a roar of disappointment from the crowd as they were deprived the sight of her orgasm, though for once Yuna was happy not to satisfy the wishes of the masses. Some things were too private to let the world see. The timing of the power going out was incredibly fortunate for Yuna, a fact she reflected on as she sprawled out on the magical stage in a post-orgasmic haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHadn't Shinra said they needed Leblanche's help to cut the power? Yuna reminded herself to thank her former rival profusely for saving her from absolute humiliation. Unless, of course, Shinra had somehow managed to kill the lights on his own. After all, if it was Leblanche's doing, she <i>did</i> still choose to draw out Yuna's suffering before shutting off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese addled thoughts were interrupted by the sound of two familiar voices approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie!\" Rikku cried. \"Are you alright?! Say something so we can find you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm here. On the stage.\" Yuna called back. Getting off the stage might have been problematic, but getting onto it wouldn't have been too difficult for her friends. All they'd have to do is drop down from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asking if she's alright? Really? What kind of a stupid question is that?\" came Paine's voice. \"Would you be alright in her situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, yeah. But still, Yunnie's tough!\" Rikku sniped back. \"Come on, over here, Yunnie. Follow my voice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna did as her friend suggested, shakily rising back to her feet and making her way towards the sound of Rikku's voice. Rikku seemed to hear Yuna's footsteps as she approached, as the naked and humiliated summoner found herself pulled into a tight hug after a few steps. As she felt Rikku's embrace, however, Yuna became immediately aware of a new problem.</span></div></div>",

She returned Rikku's hug eagerly, putting a good part of her weight on the young girl while her own legs continued to feel rubbery and shaky like a new born deer. Now all they had to do was find a way off this stage and soon she would be back home. Fantasies of digging through her closet to wrap herself in the most concealing, confining garment she had were playing in her mind. Perhaps she could just wear everything she owned and never ever let anyone see her face or her skin ever again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she felt the surge of magic. It was like a breeze billowing up from nowhere, occasionally punctuated by shimmering ripples of golden energy that gave the viewing audience half-glimpses of Yuna's naked silhouette. Bits of Rikku's costume began to glow with a pale light. Yuna's heart was racing. No, it couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna continued to cling to Rikku, even as she felt her friend float slightly into the air. Then all at once Rikku was falling back to Earth, bumping into Yuna and causing the two to go sprawling on top of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo.\" Yuna moaned, already feeling the press of Rikku's far more naked body against her own. Her skirt, bikini top and bottom, and the meticulously tied cloth that draped both of her arms were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation Yuna tried to deny what she was feeling. Her hands swept over Rikku's body once, twice, thrice....groping and regroping her bared body well after she had confirmed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie....\" Rikku wailed in misery, confusion, and a hint of arousal at Yuna's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tell me this isn't real.\" Yuna whimpered. \"Tell me this is a bad joke! Please, Rikku, please say it isn't real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie...I'm naked.\" Rikku responded, her words feeling like an apology and realization all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you two doing?\" Paine asked, walking towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't come any-\" Yuna began, only to feel a gloved hand touching her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thrill of power ran over the stage, and in a moment Paine's costume was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...closer.\" Yuna finished softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. What's going on over there. The brain waves just multiplied. Everything okay?\" Shinra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Ack! Where are my clothes??\" Paine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie...this is bad.\" Rikku said, still huddled next to Rikku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! We...We have to find a way out of here without being seen!\" Yuna whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean...yeah...but...its worse than that...\" Rikku said, moving closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...\" Yuna began, when suddenly she felt a pair of wet lips on her own. She gasped in shock, only to find herself returning the kiss eagerly. The pair shifted their position slightly, entwining their naked bodies in a way that virtually eliminated any space between them. Yuna felt Rikku's smaller yet perky breasts pressing up against her own, felt her friend's nipples harden as she continued to the kiss and pushed her breasts around and around Yuna's already sensitives orbs. Their hands were caressing and squeezing all along their bodies, occasionally their fingers would dip down beneath the skin and play with their inner folds much as Yuna had done mere moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku was right. This WAS bad. Not just the fact that the ghost had somehow taken control of all three of them, but that it was essentially playing out a little fantasy Yuna had been indulging in for months now. Not that she would have ever had the courage to suggest she and her cousin actually DO this...but it had occupied her thoughts over more than one masturbation session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna felt a gloved hand squeeze her butt, and yelped a little as Paine began to kiss the side of her neck. She moved to a sitting position, one hand feeling and playing with Rikku's body while the other did the same with Paine. This was becoming every fantasy and nightmare she had ever had rolled into one. All that was needed was Tidus leading her by a leash through the streets of Beville and her humiliation would be complete!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie, I'm sorry.\" Rikku wailed during one of the brief moments when her mouth was unoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe despair broke something in Yuna. Reaching out, she pulled her friend's hair back. \"Don't say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Yunnie, that hurts!\" Rikku responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not your fault. So don't apologize!\" Yuna said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Let go! It really hurts!\" Rikku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it?\" Paine asked, having moved around in the dark. \"Cause it sounds like you kind of like it when she does that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku gave a small yelp of surprise as Paine, now standing over her, gently but firmly pulled her hair back until Rikku's face was arched up and staring at the ceiling. Rikku let out a small moan that elicited a snort from Paine. Then the mysterious girl in black widened her stance, positioning her legs wide apart directly above Rikku. Still forcing her head back, Paine gave a small gasp of her own as Rikku's lips began to kiss Paine's sopping sex with a hungry passion. Not to be outdone, Yuna got on her hands and knees and began to lap at Rikku's inner folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was deteriorating rapidly. Something had to happen soon or the Gullwings were going to go into a complete meltdown and start a full on orgy until someone discovered them there in the darkness. Fortunately, something did happen. Though not exactly anything to improve their situation...</span></div></div>",

I'll wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna blushed fiercely as she went back to pleasuring her friend as if nothing had happened. Apparently Leblanc had a way to spy on them. She had seen them doing this to each other! Inwardly Yuna whimpered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rikku and Paine both gasped and spasmed and fell to the ground writhing in pleasure. A moment later Yuna could hear them making out hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you do this?\" Yuna hissed into the headset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an outrageous accusation!\" Leblanc responded immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did! How could you?\" Yuna squeeked, anger and shame bubbling up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now. All's fair in love and war...and sphere hunting. Besides, its not like I did anything directly. So a few lyrics you sang tonight miiiiiight have been written by a notoriously perverted Summoner. And so there was a rumor that singing them would summon the spirit of that summoner up and cause the singer to be tormented by her. Its not like I actually summoned it or anything. I just handed you the rope to hang yourself.\" Leblanc said merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've ruined my life!\" Yuna said in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't get so melodramatic on me, hon. I've got a great little cover story ready to save your precious little reputation. Someone stole your little dress sphere, like I did last year. That wasn't you, that was some pervert parading around on stage made to look like you. Problem solved.\" Leblanc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will ever believe that!\" Yuna snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff. Of course they will. This world is full of guillible idiots. Sure, some won't buy it, but I guarantee 90% of Spira will. It'll just be our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rikku gave a little scream from nearby. \"NO! Oh NO! Please, not that! Yunnie, run! Just run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna paused in dismay. After everything else, what could possible....she suddenly felt something. Something long, snake like, cool and smooth, made out of some kind of alloy like a machina, but much smoother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku, what...is this?\" Yuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr....well...\" Rikku stammered. \"I...uh...found some machina recently that I cleaned up and...uh...tried out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Okay. So...what's wrong? Why keep that a secret?\" Yuna asked cautiously. \"What do these machina do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....vibrate, mostly.\" Rikku said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is gonna be goooooood.\" Leblanc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No on asked- whoa!\" Yuna said as she found herself turning around, bending over and using her hands to part her ass cheeks. \"What in the world??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain, you sheltered little girl.\" Leblanc said. \"You see, in the hedonistic times before Yevon the good people of Zanarkand used machina for all sorts of decadent things. And the most decadent of all, and therefore the most forbidden, was the machina used for sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex?\" Yuna asked, bewildered. She almost screamed as she felt some kind of warm cream  being rubbed across her butt crack. No wait, it was..ack! She felt someone's finger pushing the gunky stuff inside her butt! It was getting smeared all around the tiny hole! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. What you have there is a kind of surrogate penis. Judging by the size and shape of both ends, this beauty is meant to be placed inside a girl's private place, then another is to squirm onto the other end. Then the two can fuck one another to their heart's content!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's....\" Yuna stammered. How lewd! \"Wait! Your not saying...we can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course you can. Oh, and do try to look a little more distressed, won't you? That cute little face doesn't seem to know whether your scared or delighted right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!\" Yuna stammered. \"Y-you just...just...just tell me what you want! What do we have to do to stop this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I want? Oh Yuna, you silly, silly girl. Isn't it obvious? All I want from you is to....\"</span></div></div>",

Yuna shuddered (only somewhat due to the sensations of Rikku's toy inside her); knowing Leblanc was watching them was bad enough, but being recorded? That was blackmail material Leblanc could hang over all their heads!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what kind of... *pant* work?\" Yuna asked, her breath getting ragged as Rikku began to move the toy back and forth inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing terribly demanding.\" Leblanc explained. \"Some sphere hunting, some house work, maybe work as servants at some parties I'll be throwing. Nothing three women of your talents can't handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we refu- AH- refuse?\" Yuna asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I make sure all of Spira knows that it really was you on stage. Then I sell the recordings for a fortune. People would pay anything to have their own copy, after all. I'd walk away fabulously wealthy. Honestly, I'm being incredibly generous by turning down the money with this offer.\" Leblanc said, her voice taking on a dangerous edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna couldn't make this decision alone. She needed to know what Rikku and Paine thought, too. She wasn't about to resign them to one fate or another without at least consulting with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rikku?

Before the humiliated summoner could even begin to voice her dismay, she let out a cry of surprise and pleasure as she felt the devious machina Rikku had found slide into her tiny rear entrance. With the power back, Rikku's discarded microphone picked up her moan, giving the audience an earful to go along with their eyeful of the esteemed summoner being taken from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Yunie!\" Rikku gasped as she began to buck her hips. \"I-I can't control myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her situation, Yuna couldn't stand the idea of Rikku blaming herself for this. She was just as much a victim as the rest of them, even if the machina being there was technically her own fault. \"D-don't blame yourself, Rikku.\" the summoner moaned. \"We're all- aaaaaHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna had been cut off as the toy plowing her ass came to life, sending out vibrations that shook her to her core and made her weak in the knees. Unable to stay standing, Yuna soon crashed to the ground, ass still in the air as Rikku descended with her, the sexual compulsion refusing to let the two cease their debauchery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... G-guys, I can't fight it...\" came Paine's voice as the white-haired woman crawled over to her two friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the other two, Paine seemed to be doing her best to resist the compulsion they were all under, her movements seeming slow and trembling. Be that as it may, it did not prevent her from making her way in front of Yuna and pulling the summoner onto all fours. Climbing to her feet, Paine then ground her crotch into her friend's face, to which Yuna eagerly opened her mouth and began to lick. Meanwhile, Paine bent over her friend, her own lips meeting Rikku's hungrily. All the while, the audience cheered and applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Under most circumstances, Yuna loved surprises. Today, however, she very much wanted the surprises to end. It was a surprise when she found herself stripped of her clothes and dignity in front of the whole world. It was a surprise when she began to play with herself, again while all of Spira watched in stunned silence. And of course it was quite surprising to find herself now on her hands and knees between her gorgeous (and naked) teammates, licking the inner folds of one while the other thrusting a phallic machina in and out of her pert bottom- AGAIN while everyone stared. Yes, today Yuna was very much done with surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, surprises were not done with her. Her body had a rather substantial surprise in store. While not quite a virgin (that went out the window during a certain encounter with Tidus while swimming in a lake within the shimmering Macalania Woods) the sensation of having a smooth sex machina inside her ass was entirely foreign to her. She would have expected it to hurt. She was not prepared for how BIG it felt in her. Thanks to the lubricant and the ingenuity of the ancient Spirans, all she was aware of was how smooth and pleasant it felt moving in and out of her, and how much more AWARE her body was. Being a summoner, of course, required one to stay limber and in good shape (performing the dance of the sending was for neither the faint of heart nor the weak of body). Yuna was proud of her slender form, and especially the tight bottom she had managed to cultivate. Now that bottom was firmly in the grip of her cousin, the round little entrance embracing every inch of the huge machine inside her. Every sense felt alive, every intimate part erogenous and excited. In short, she was loving the touch of the device even before the vibrations began. Now she was in ecstasy, a situation she might have enjoyed if not for the public nature of their situation. As it was this was far from the most convenient time to discover a new fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the dome in which they were performing seemed to crack open. The ceiling opened to emit the warm light of the noon day sun. And before Yuna had time to wonder she found herself given another surprise. With a flash of electrical light she was staring at herself as a naked giantess, big as Mt. Gagzet, towering over the stadium and the city alongside her equally huge naked teammates. Worst of all, they were positioned over the stadium in such a way that the private places could be easily seen by everyone. Yuna had it particularly bad, her giant doppleganger looming right over the stadium with her arms and legs on either side, her enormous breasts and prominent nipples moving frantically from side to side as Rikku continued to thrust into her and her sex wide open with the clit peeking out hungrily. Yuna moved one of her hands down over her opening, intimately rubbing her clit while the machina filled her other orifice. Periodically she would pause in her masturbation just to slide her fingers into herself and push her lips aside to give the stadium a long view of her pink inner regions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and just in case you were worried, Dullwing, I've piped this little effect across the Fayth network. There's a giant 3D hologram of you in every town and village, viewable for miles in every direction. I wouldn't want those poor saps without a viewing sphere to miss out on your greatest performance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leblanc! You stop this now, or I'll...I'll.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue to be humiliated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for this!\" Yuna said, before returning to eating out her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh. Scary. By the by, Yuna dear. Its a well known fact that any self respecting Al Bhed doesn't mess around with machina lightly. They are very careful and experiment with the parts. Can't replace it, you know? Chances are good they won't carry any machina without spare parts and redundant machanisms. In case they need to fix something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what does....\" Yuna stuttered, only to watch in mounting horror and excitement as Paine unzipped Rikku's satchel and produced a twin machina like the one stuck in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leblanc....\" Yuna whispered. \"You...you shut the power off RIGHT NOW or...or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. This reminds. For lunch today I think I'll make myself a sandwich.\" Leblanc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaine stuck the phallic machina inside herself, moving in and out several times while moaning. Then she picked Yuna up even while Rikku pushed the machina in her ass in as deep as it would go. The three girls stared in awe and horror at one another, their excited breath the only words spoken. Then Yuna felt the machina fill up her sex, learning in the process a whole new definition of \"full\". Yuna grasped Paine by her red suspenders (now uselessly fastened to her belt) and pulled her close, kissing her intensely and rubbing their ample breasts together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and the boys have a little bet going, Dullwings. We wanna see how many orgasms in a row you little sluts and squirt out after taking a ride on those babies at full power. Now how about you show us (and everyone else) what your capable of?\" Leblanc laughed like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna felt the machina in her pussy spring to manic life while th one in her rear triple the sensation it was already providing her. Front and back her team mates began bucking their hips,their hands keeping her steady while their lips kissed, sucked, and nibbled her flesh. Yuna's eyes shut tightly, her face a mask of pure humiliation, yet her mouth smiling and twitching at the amazing sensation pumping in and out of her. In less than a minute her lips parted and a series of gasps, moans, and ecstatic cries left her mouth. Yes, at least one more surprise had come her way, and this one was more terrible and wonderful than any of its predecessors.</span></div></div>",

Does it just feel so, so good that you can't help but let it out, Dullwing? Or is the fact that you finally have an excuse to let your two besties fuck that hot little body the way you've been craving? Or do you just love the fact that the whole damn world is watching your depraved little orgy play out in real time- the real you exposed for all of Spira! Or is it all three? Its probably all three, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLa Blanche's endless verbal assault somehow managed to penetrate the thick fog of lust, passion and sensation that Yuna's mind had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Your the one making this happen! Its- OHHHHH!\" Yuna snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Its not our fault?' Is that what you want to say? You really are a clueless bitch sometimes. Your forgetting, the only reason your being 'possessed' is because the unsent in your dress sphere resonate with you somehow. Which means everything happening right now is what part of you WANTS. Now I knew the little ghost slut I pumped into your network would be a good fit...you three practically run around naked as it is. Why would anyone, especially our shy and demure little ex-summoner, willing squeeze into those shorts unless they got off on the attention? But even I had no idea the ghostie could push you this far! I wonder how long the three of you idiots have been wanting to screw each other? You all must have been ready to explode by this point to go at it this way! You know everyone you've ever known is watching this right now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna blushed deeply. But Le Blanche's words offered a bit of salvation. If she could just muster enough will she could put an end to this! She had to! She was rapidly arriving at the pinnacle of all humiliations- she was about to orgasm in public in front of everyone! No matter how good it felt, she couldn't just sit there and allow herself to be fucked into that final indignity! She had to take control of this situation!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her body seemed to respond to her resolution. First she pressed herself more fully against Paine, kissing her passionately pushing her softly backwards until she was on the ground, Yuna straddling her. And then Yuna leaned back as far as the two machina within her would allow. She pushed her arms behind her, lovingly fondling Rikku's butt while guiding the Al Bhed's thrusts into her own ass. Rikku in turn began playing with Yuna's breasts. Yuna's new position placed accentuated her body in whole new ways, thrusting her chest up and making the back and forth motion of her hips incredibly obvious and exposed. Everyone watching could see now that she was not merely a participant but actively leading the other two in the sexual activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WASN'T WHAT I MEANT BY TAKING CONTROL!\" Yuna screamed inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damage was already done, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuna, don't do that! I'm, I'm, nnnnnNNNNNNNOOOOOOOO!\" Paine gasped, before throwing her head back, arching her back, and writhing in helpless pleasure and release beneath the summoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yunnie! It feels so good! I can't....\" Rikku mumbled, before arcing her own back and shaking in release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their legs instinctively clenched, Yuna found herself locked between her own teammates, utterly unable to break free from the stimulation within her. The chaotic writhing and thrusting was the last straw. Yuna, flushed with lust and embarrassment, closed her eyes, threw her head back, and felt herself experience a huge orgasm....followed closely by another, and another, in a seemingly endless wave of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, that's all I needed. Time for act 2!\" Le Blanche said as the trio collapsed sideways on the ground, naked bodies pressing tightly against each other, still connected by the vibrating machina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls lay on the stage, gasping and blurry eyed as the crowd whooped around them. Suddenly, the hologram of their debached display shifted. In its place stood...a clothed Yuna, angry and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone! Do not be deceived! That...that wasn't me! Those people you just saw are three con artists trying to ruin my image! They stole my garment grid and disguised themselves as me and the Gullwings! This...this lewd display is the act of depraved criminals mocking me and this opening ceremony with their awful behavior! Please, stop them right now! Arrest them! Put them on display in the stockades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what??\" Yuna gasped in shock when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Yuna moaned in dismay as the teleportation spell popped the trio back into existence and the temperature PLUMMETED. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Who turned on the freezer!\" Rikku gasped in dismay, instinctively drawing closer to her cousin and huddling there to enjoy her body heat. Paine did the same thing. Yuna objected to neither their warmth or the close contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking her eye open, she found herself on a narrow ledge above a thick layer of fog. All around her familiar ruins and craggy mountain tops loomed. This was the city of Zanarkand, abandoned for 1000 years and once the sacred destination of a summoner seeking to defeat Sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that was officially the most humiliating experience I've ever had.\" Paine noted in a deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! This is all my fault!\" Rikku squeeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku!\" Yuna said in reprimand. With a little effort and an surprising amount of longing and regret, she dislodged herself from the twin instruments that had been pleasuring her and manuevered to face her naked friend. \"I told you before. No one blames you. This is all because of La Blanche!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....if I hadn't brought them with me....\" Rikku began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good point.\" Paine said. \"Don't get me wrong. You trying to take the blame is silly and you should stop it now. But why were you carrying those things around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uhhh....well...heheh...sometimes our missions take awhile, and I need to...you know...\" Rikku said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I see. But why two of them? If its about having a 'spare' you should leave one back on the shipm right?\" Paine persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's-\" Rikku began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention that these things are...clearly designed for more than one person in mind...\" Paine said, a hint of smugness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna's eyes lit up in realization. \"Rikku? Was Le Blanche right about you....about us? Were you hoping to have a chance to use those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku blushed profusely and shifted, her eyes refusing to meet those of her cousin. \"M-maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....How long?\" Yuna asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Um....well...when was...it? I....ummm....sometime around...Tidus bashing up that machina I was politing to try and kidnap you...?\" Rikku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had a crush on me since the day we met?\" Yuna asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's wrong with that? It was like that with Tidus, right? Besides...it might have been...a little bit before...we met? Maybe....a lot before we met?\" Rikku said, clearly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...we're cousins!\" Yuna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh, no! Yunnie, don't hate me! I'm not a pervert! I mean...not like that! Al Bhed...we don't think of 'incest' the same way Yevonites do! As long as its not immediate family like siblings or parents and stuff its okay. In fact...it...uhh....its sort of...an unofficial tradition among half-cousins to....argh! I'm explaining this badly!\" Rikku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. That explains Brother always looking to get into your pants.\" Paine whispered to Yuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Brother what?\" Yuna asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Figures. I always fall for the slow ones.\" Paine muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rikku....\" Yuna said, turning to her cousin. \"You should have said something....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I know! It just...at first there wasn't a good time, then you and Tidus...and then...I just, I tried but I got butterflies every time and....I'm sorry! I just-\" Rikku was interrupted but a sudden and intense kiss from Yuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Should. Have. Said. Something.\" Yuna said, gently pushing Rikku down and straddling her. \"All this time....we could have....all this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yunnie!.....\" Rikku moaned as a slender finger reactivated the Machina the two once more began embracing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does have a point.\" Paine whispered. \"Then again...neither of you ever mentioned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....ha!...about you?\" Yuna demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm just looking to enjoy myself and have a little fun after a long fight and an Eternal Calm.\" Paine said with a smile. \"If I'd known you two innocent little girls could handle a threesome I'd have said something way sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna gasped as she again felt herself penetrated from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is with you both and my butt??\" She wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....the shorts.\" They both proclaimed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...the shorts were your idea!!\" Yuna moaned in pleasure and mock outrage at Rikku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....yeah....C-Crush on my cousin!\" Rikku responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really our fault? You have a magnificent ass. Of course we want to claim it!\" Paine whispered, slapping Yuna's cheek before thrusting in ernest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt here....\" came Le Blanche's mocking voice over the comm link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Yuna gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might still be in the middle of something. But I don't have much time. Yuna has a lot to do, after all.\" Le Blanche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you....you said you'd save my reputation!\" Yuna snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am. I've crafted a very careful cover story that explains how a group of perverted impostors are running around Spira masquerading as a naked version of the Gullwings! I've even requested that they be punished in a nonviolent but doubly humiliating way to pay them back for the shame they have caused me. And by me, I of course me Lady Yuna.\" Le Blanche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Yuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paine is right. You are slow. I've made my own dress sphere, dummy. Me and the boys are onboard your ship right now, pretending to be you three. You 'kidnapped' us and tried to take our places to humiliate us. Sorry, to humiliate the Gullwings. The fact that the alleged criminals are actually the real Gullwings and the supposed real Gullwings are just impostors....heh heh. That's our little secret.\" Le Blanche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't expect-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can! If you admit it, you have to admit that every act of humiliation you performed at that concert (not to mention whatever misadventures you get up to NOW!) was really all you! Your actual reputation only stays safe as long as everyone thinks I'm you. So, too bad, so sad! All your spheres? Mine now! All your money? Mine! Your ship? Your crew? Your lives? MIne mine mine!! Oh, and in case it needs saying, all your clothes belong to me now too! Guess in the end the Le Blanche Syndicates get to live the high life while you get to live as impoverished, naked, slutty fugitives hunted by your old fans! Sound good? Glad you think so too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't...you can't just LEAVE us like this!!\" Yuna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I? And don't be melodramatic! Your perverted poltergeist....pervertogeist....may insist you stay naked and shame yourselves if you have an audience....but she isn't cruel. You are all allowed to defend yourselves if the situation turns violent. Full access to your weapons and abilities and everything! And who was it that took out Sin and Vegnagun again? Yep, in a fight you'll own any fiend or creepo that might threaten you. And you all have enough survival skills to hunt and camp and survive just fine out in the wilderness. So no whining, Dullwings. Your lives are perfectly safe. Its only in every other conceivable way that I've utterly and completely beaten you three! Anyway, I think I'll get back to swimming in your sphere collection while I watch the news about your debauched escapades! Enjoy your new life as paupers and sex crazed criminals! Bye now!\" Le Blanche cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence as the mortifying situation sunk in. Then Yuna found herself doing what her unsent passenger did best, play out her confused state of embarrassment and arousal in the most debauched way possible. As one the three began to hump as if they had just invented the activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sun was shining, the air was balmy, and a small, warm breeze was blowing.  This weather made is easy to enjoy being outside on a lazy summer afternoon.  Her pace was slow, and she was only half paying attention.  \"Days like this are simply the best!\" she thought happily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way around town, she had already passed through the Tram Common and the Sandlot, and she was currently making her way into the back alleys and side streets that connect the Sandlot with Station Heights.  Her and her friends' Usual Spot was located at the end of one of the alleys, but she was going her own way today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shade of one of the alleys, a figure watches the girl lazily pass by.  They grin and <i>giggle</i>.  Stretching her fingers, the master thief emerges from the alley and trails behind the unsuspecting girl.  With highly trained and sophisticated movements, the thief slides her fingers into each of Olette's pockets.  After fishing out all the munny she could find, she took a few steps away to inspect her winnings.  \"Hmm, it's not much, but I'm sure that's all she had on her...\" the thief muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlette, still oblivious to being pickpocketed, continued walking towards Station Heights, intending to make her way to the train station.  However, she was still on the side streets at the moment.  She noted that there weren't very many people out today.  That wasn't too unusual to her though.  On days like today, anyone who had plans were either at Sunset Terrace or the beach.  That, and the side streets weren't used very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat disappointed with her haul, the thief had a small idea.  She could steal more from Olette, or she could leave with just the munny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Moving close and locating the clasp, she unfastened the small clasp and removed the bracelet from Olette's wrist in an instant.  It was so smooth and quick that Olette didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next would be the necklace.\"  Though this was slightly more tricky, she used the same technique and removed Olette's necklace without a single hint to Olette.  Maybe Olette would have noticed something, but she was too preoccupied in enjoying the warm lazy summer afternoon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that should be enough for a haul...\" the thief thought.  \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master thief looked at the back of the girl she had been stealing from.  \"This girl is incredibly easy to steal from... and I do need practice on my finest abilities...\"</span></div></div>",

And I want to relieve this girl of her clothing.\"  With her, albeit twisted, goal in mind, the thief approached yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Olette, she was completely oblivious to who was looming behind her and what was about to happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to go would be Olette's tank top.  Through normal means, it would be impossible to remove that article of clothing without pulling it over her head, easily causing her to notice.  However, the thief had a method ready.  Whipping out a small, incredibly sharp blade, the thief crept close and got to work.  With impossibly swift and fluid movements, the thief slashed through each of the tank top's shoulder straps.  She then made a series of calculated cuts on the rest of Olette's tank top, and in a fraction of a second, the article of clothing was reduced to orange ribbons of fabric.  As the pieces fell to the ground, Olette's plain white bra was exposed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big question is....did Olette notice?</span></div></div>",

Olette continued on her way, now only wearing a white bra, khaki capri pants, orange socks, and creme, orange, and black shoes.  The thief followed behind, ready for her next strike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlette noticed a message board on the wall of one of the buildings that lined the side street she was in.  She walked up to it and began to study it.  \"Maybe they posted some odd jobs to do on here...\" she mumbled to herself.  Sensing an opportunity, the thief sprung into action.  She got close to the ground and began tugging at the laces of Olette's shoes.  Sliding the laces out and undoing the knots, the thief left Olette's shoes untied.  To be sure they would come off, the thief reached into one of her many pockets and pulled out a small container of incredibly sticky tar.  She lined the bottom of Olette's shoes with the tar, so the shoes were stuck fast to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as the girl was still standing and looking at the message board, the thief moved on to the next significant item of clothing.  Her sights were set on Olette's pants.  With an incredibly light and delicate touch, she reached around the girl's waist and set her fingers to work on undoing the fastenings.  She slowly unbuttoned, and then unzipped.  As the zipper reached its final clicks, the pants loosened and started to slip down.  With unnatural skill, the thief guided the clothing off Olette's hips, slid it down her legs, and allowed it to pile around her shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the odd jobs available to her, Olette continued on her way, stepping out of both her shoes and her pants in one fell swoop.  The girl was now only clad in her plain white bra and panties and her orange socks.</span></div></div>",

He might not have known so much as this woman's name, but he was immediately aware of just how heavenly her warm, wet mouth was. It had been moons since his last proper time with a woman, and all his pent-up sexual frustration was quickly welling to a climax under Yda's skilled tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYda, meanwhile, began to feel the fog clear from her mind, if only slightly. Slowly she became aware of how absurd her actions were. At the very least, she knew she shouldn't be doing something like this in public!
