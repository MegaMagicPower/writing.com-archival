Below is a series of descriptions for some pre-made scenarios I have created that explain why the Snorlax you play as is bigger than the rest. If you don't find any of these scenarios appealing, feel free to create your own in the New Scenarios option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCENARIO ONE: A Pampered Pet<br>\r\nYou have been a trainer\u2019s pet for as long as you can remember. When you were just a little Munchlax, you were caught and sold to an insanely wealthy couple to give as a birthday present for their kid. At first, you weren\u2019t too keen on being a \u2018tamed\u2019 Pok\u00e9mon, but the near limitless supply of fattening food readily available kept you from wanting to escape. This sort of diet ballooned your body to gargantuan proportions, with an ever-increasing hunger for even more. Plus, you actually liked the kid who owned you. He had no interest in making you battle, just content to just rub and lay atop your big belly as you ate. And with his parents not really around, busy on business and whatnot, you were like family to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCENARIO TWO: The Test Subject<br>\r\nYou were once a typical Snorlax, living a nomadic life across the region in search of food, only leaving until the proverbial well dried up in one spot. That all changed one day when you were captured by a group of scientists that wanted to use you for their experiments. They knew how to keep you sated, so you never really complained about the dramatic change. Your job consists of eating whatever food they offered you, usually drowned in some sort of chemical solution that did untold changes to your body. After years of this sort of diet, your body has blown up with layers upon layers of new adipose tissue, but you didn't mind. All you really cared about was what the scientists would feed you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCENARIO THREE: An Ancient Appetite<br>\r\nHumans love to paint Snorlax as nothing more than lazy big eaters, impossible to keep as pets or use in battle. But there is an untold history to this noble species of Pokemon, one only you and some other legendary Pokemon know. The Snorlax of the contemporary age is but a mere shadow of what they once were so long ago. Before human civilization could get off the proverbial floor, you and the rest of your species kept them in place underneath your flabby paws. Hundreds of veritable Gods with powers on par with Arceus, eating everything to your heart's content with no repercussions. That is until all the other legendary Pokemon got together to wipe the slate clean and turn what once were terrors of the landscape to mere roadblocks. All except for you. You found a hiding spot. You took a nap. And now you're awake. Awake and very, very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCENARIO FOUR: Gym Leader Days<br>\r\nIn a world where humans never existed, society marched on and Pokemon took their place. In this world, you are a Gym Leader under contact of the regional Pokemon League. Each gym was dedicated to a different style of fighting, and yours was the ancient art of Sumo. Your record is practically spotless, only the best of the best ever allowed to beat you and advance to the next town on their journey. You chalk up your winning streak to your size, which you've personally sculpted over the years through gluttonous eating and exercise. Food and sleep are a big part in your life, but in a civilized world, you've been finding that there might be something more to life then sating your black hole of a stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You remember the day it happened. You had just woken up after raiding some trash cans outside of someone\u2019s house, and your first instinct was to go back and see if there was any food you had missed. Then, out of nowhere, you got hit in the head with a Pokeball. Before you could even understand what was happening, you missed your opportunity to get out, a metallic click signaling your fate. Than you just...waited. You couldn\u2019t sleep, you couldn\u2019t move, and there was nothing around you save for infinite black void. You don\u2019t know how long you stayed inside, but you were nevertheless immensely happy to finally get out once it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you saw as your vision came back was the face of a human child. He looked like your typical nerd: thick, round glasses, perfectly combed brown hair, freckles sprayed generously on both sides of his cheeks, he was even wearing a buttoned-down, white shirt with a red bow tie and suspenders. You didn\u2019t even know what a nerd was at the time, but you instantly made the connection that this was the kind of kid that gets beat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked around to get a feel for your surroundings. You were in a Living room, decorated with hanging lights, terrifying wooden figures with jaws that could crush your arm, and a pine tree ornamented with colored balls and tinsel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a Christmas gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how do you like her, sweetie?\u201d The Dad of the kid spoke up, having to pry his face away from the phone he was holding to face his son. \u201cShe\u2019s quite the catch, you know. Not a lot of people can say they have a shiny, female Munchlax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, she\u2019s great guys, really.\u201d The kid responded, not turning his head away from your face. \u201cIt\u2019s just...really unexpected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, Eddy.\u201d The kid\u2019s mother, a thin as rails women clothed in a red dress, came into the room with a tumbler of scotch in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for a kid your age to stay cooped up indoors all day. I know we can\u2019t make you go on a Pok\u00e9mon Journey like the rest of the kids in town, but having a Pok\u00e9mon is a fantastic thing! I just know the two of you will be the best of friends!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the father\u2019s phone gave off a little tinny music. \u201cOh! Speaking of friends,\u201d the father tapped his finger on the surface of the screen before depositing the device in his coat pocket. \u201cI and your mother are going to meet ours at the country club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-now?\u201d The boy, who you know knew was called Eddy, this time turned around to actually look at his parents, obviously distressed. \u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake care of yourself, honey~.\u201d Eddy\u2019s mother ruffled his once combed hair with a free hand before she took another sip of her adult beverage. Before the child could get any more words of protest out, the couple was already on their way out of the living room. He blinked, processing the events that just took place before him, before letting out a dejected sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I wanted was to not be alone for Christmas\u2026\u201d Eddy muttered to himself. Now, you had absolutely no connection to this kid, and the prevalent thought on your mind was still food to eat. You could smell hundreds of individual foodstuffs just waiting for you to die into just a couple rooms away in the kitchen. But...after seeing this...well, you could at least give him a hug. So, you walked up to him, crawled up into his lap, and wrapped your stubby arms around his lanky torso. He looked down, having almost forgotten you were there until than, and eventually smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years rolled by after that fateful day, and you actually did manage to create a bond with your new trainer. Though, Trainer is a liberal term in this scenario. To your satisfaction, you learned that you weren\u2019t going to be hauled along the Region constantly fighting other Pok\u00e9mon for your human\u2019s glory. No, Eddy was more focused on school, a more boring, but at the same time practical endeavor. That left you as a glorified pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd being a glorified pet has certainly done wonders for you. For starters, you now can speak Human. Eddy wanted to bridge the communication gap between you and him, so after he would come home to school, yours would begin. Surprisingly, you were a rather quick learner! Although in hindsight, the reward of food for learning a new world is probably what did it. The food was another perk of being a pet. Because your human\u2019s parents were so unbelievably rich, you had pickings to as much food as you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you ate, and you ate, and you ate some more. And all the while you grew upwards and outwards, surging in height and weight. It wasn't so noticeable at first when you were a Munchlax, but then you evolved one day into a Snorlax, and then your gluttony really showed it\u2019s true colors. Eddy says that your the world\u2019s tallest and fattest Snorlax, even showing you a wiki page on his phone to prove it wasn\u2019t hyperbole. You felt a little proud knowing that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as you finish recollecting your memories in the last three years. Right now, you were outside, sprawled out on the grass of the manor\u2019s backyard. The sun\u2019s beams of light radiated your body to a pleasant warmth, heating your fur and fat. Every so often, a soft wind would pick up, making you giggle as Eddy, who was in turn sprawled out atop your giant stomach, shifted himself around to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Eddy spoke up, leaning his head back into your belly, the flab of countless meals pushing back against him. \u201cWhat do you want to do today, Rosa?\u201d Rosa was the name he gave you, because you were, quote \u2018pretty as a rose\u2019 end quote. You don\u2019t know why, but every time he said that you just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...same as I do every day.\u201d You respond, lifting up a flabby arm above your owner\u2019s body before dropping it heavily on his back in a hug. \u201cEat until I pass out into a food coma, wake up and repeat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant besides that, silly!\u201d Eddy giggled, wrapping his lanky arms around as much belly flesh as he could grab to reciprocate your hug. \u201cIs eating all you ever think about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d You grin and bring up your other arm, completely trapping your human against your wrecking ball of a gut. \u201cI think about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRosaaaa~\u201d Eddy blushes, suddenly finding his mobility heavily restricted via his Snorlax. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m being serious. Today might be the last day we get to spend time together for a while, tomorrow\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

I hope you understand.\" Eddy said frowning hoping he didn't hurt his Snorlax's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I understand you haven't seen them in a while, I don't feel bad,\" Rosa reassured and she meant it, besides she needed to catch up on sleeping. Although a part of her was wondering how Eddy's parents would react to their son's Snorlax speaking. When Eddy first got Rosa it only took a couple of months to teach her to speak but he decided not to tell his parents saying something about <i>Government Experiments.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later Eddy's parents entered the house. \"Eddy, we're home!\" His mother yelled happily, Eddy ran down the stairs as fast as he could and he stopped when he saw something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets of the mountainous City of Olympia shook and quaked under the immense weight of Hera the Snorlax as she cheerfully stomped her way down the avenues. The pedestrians and motorists of the city paid the massive Pok\u00e9mon no bad will as she marched along, some even going out of their way to give her a Friendly greeting. She was known throughout the town as \u2018The Goddess of Olympia\u2019, a title she took to heart. Ever since she propped up her Sumo Gym, the City has prospered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, whenever Hera left her Gym, it was to stock up on food, maybe treat herself to a meal at one of the many local restaurants. But today, the people of Olympia looked on with mild confusion as she made her way down the road less traveled. The road that led to Saint Cecilia\u2019s Home For Orphaned Boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an old Victorian home, an embodiment of the classic London era during the late 19th century. However, it had lost its grand splendor on the external environment. A fine mansion it once was, but all that remained now was a ghostly echo, a worn-down remnant. The walls of the building that once shone underneath the sun were now chipped beyond repair, with scratch marks trailing down the sides as though some kind of feral animal had tried to rip itself into the home. The shutters of the many windows creaked in the autumn wind, a horrible screeching sound followed by a dull thud against the house. Curtains hung in the windows, torn and ragged, and some of the windows were actually broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera had been going through a sort of crisis in the past couple of weeks. She loved eating, getting fatter, her status of a gym leader, fighting, training...she thought she lived the good life. But she realized that there was something inside her that all the food in the world could not fill, a gaping hole in her chest that left her feeling hollow. She pondered long and hard about what she needed in her life, until, this morning, she awoke with a sudden realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera realized that In all her years as the Sumo Gym Leader of Olympia City, she felt the most comfortable, the happiest when she fought or just was around little kids. Whether they be young upstarts who foolishly thought a sumo match with her could be won, or the timid ones that came in through her door like a lost puppy hoping for a match, her heart seemed to swell when they were around. She loved talking with them, playing with them, squashing them and fighting with them. So this morning, she asked herself a question. Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if she owned a kid, one that would never leave her and that she could treat however she wanted? The answer to that question led her to the town orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy smile, Hera trampled through the rusted, wrought iron gate without bothering to open it, the heavy metal offering no resistance to her bulk. She fell her large foot paws down on the porch, shattering the old wood into splinters almost instantly. Unfazed, she walked her way to the front door of the manor, her ears smooshed up at the top of the awning. Cobwebs hung from the pillars and dead insects lay in the clutches of the spiders sitting in the corners. There were a few broken dolls laying on the porch, their heads lolled to the side or ripped off, sitting ten inches from their porcelain bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera always got some sort of glee whenever she had the chance to destroy stuff. She enjoyed feeling something underneath her succumb to her mass. Many of the restaurants across the city had to rescale their doorways because of her propensity to barge in through the ill-fitting doorway, much like how she did with the Orphanage front doors. The tiny Pok\u00e9mon children inside couldn\u2019t have imagined what happened next if they tried. They watched from various positions in the main foyer as the Snorlax effortlessly plowed through their front door like a fatty bulldozer in something out of a monster movie, cartoony and ridiculous. Her swollen stomach and brawny shoulders bullied the wall apart. Her body acted as an organic battering ram, destroying the door and plaster frame while pushing it aside and lumbering casually into the main foyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor groaned beneath the Snorlax\u2019s mass causing the lights to flicker like in a campy B-movie. Despite the devastation, Hera went on smiling as she observed the orphanage casually. It was even worse looking on the inside. The furniture had been covered in white sheets, leaving the impression of distorted monsters waiting in the darkness. The walls had lost their color, the colors and paintings and portraits seeming more and more faded by the second. Every step she made across the floorboards created an eerie creak that whispered throughout the shadow-filled halls of the house. There were toys everywhere--an unintentional step could result in a crack of a toy's arm or body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. McCarthy came into the main foyer to see what all the shaking and noise was about, only to be greeted by the Goddess of Olympia, Hera the Snorlax In all her corpulence. This was the last thing the mean old loser wanted to deal with this morning, as residents of the city had found it\u2019s impossible to keep the attention of the hungry glutton just through simple conversation. She forced a smile and looked up at the gigantic beast. \u201cHera, so good to see you! I see you\u2019ve been swelling up nicely lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera\u2019s grin intensified and a little blush cake to her fat cheeks. \u201cNaww, thank you, Ms. McCarthy. All those trips to the buffet really paid off.\u201d She gave out a wistful sigh, and then her jovial demeanor turned solemn for a moment. \u201cBut you know\u2026today I realized there\u2019s more to life than eating everything in sight. It\u2019s having someone you can care for, to be with when your down\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it appeared, her serious mood was replaced with her usual happy one. \u201cSo, how does this work? I just pick one up and pay as I go out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you\u2026want to adopt\u2026\u201d Ms. McCarthy stayed slowly, not believing the words coming out from the Snorlax\u2019s lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh!\u201d Hera swooned with hearts in her eyes as she laid them on a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Riolu shrunk underneath the Snorlax\u2019s casually dominating gaze. He was a timid little thing, dressed up in a white polo shirt, a dickie bow tie, and a pair of black trousers. Hera bulldozed her way past the mean old Ms. McCarthy and over towards him, her huge and joyful face looming over him with a shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my...Arceus. Ho ho! You are so cute!\" she said adoringly and teasingly \"And... positively handsome. Look at you, even with your messy, blue, shiny fur. You're all dressed up, for me. They practically delivered you to me on a fancy silver platter.\" she was deeply infatuated and aroused. For her, seeing this tiny, young, smartly-dressed Riolu in front of her didn't just enrapture her - it was love. It was love at first sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Begging your pardon Miss S-Snorlax!\" stammered the young Riolu, pushing himself out of the giant's expansive shadow. As he stammered and embarrassingly motioned backward, bowed apologetically. \"Please excuse me! But I have to be elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name - young man!\" ordered the immense Snorlax, never once talking her great eyes off him, not even to blink. She brought down her massive, globular buttocks to the ground with a thudding crash, and trapped the small Pokemon with her powerful thighs. Folded in, they caged him within her closely guarded perimeter. It was akin to an impenetrable wall of a fortress. It blocked off any exit and could not be overcome or surmounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving himself to be in trouble for offending her, expecting a scolding, the adolescent Riolu stuttered \"M-My name is E-Edmund Fogge...but my friends call me Ed. My sincerest apologies Miss S-Snorlax. I d-didn't mean to intrude upon you. Please e-excuse me.\" but flabby legs bigger than many sequoia tree trunks entwined together, didn't budge an inch like he expected them to. The Snorlax's face loomed ever closer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a lovely name. You are mine. Mine to me. Me alone. I want you. You are my child.\" came a deep obstinate possessive voice from the massive mouth. Hera didn't bat an eyelid, she just grinned at Ed\u2019s attempts to escape her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please see here, Hera\" called Ms. McCarthy from behind her powerful crossed legs and paws \"Be reasonable. We will find you a child to adopt soon I promise. He's too young, meant to live with a foster family - a normal sized foster family. A Snorlax can\u2019t take care of a Riolu!.\" She paid the elderly women outside her 'defensive inner sanctum' no attention whatsoever, her 'negotiations' fell on deaf ears, and instead was kissing and licking her dearest Edmund over and over again. He was hers and she'd do with him as she pleased. The small Pokemon tried to evade her but to no avail. He could not in such tight confines hope to dodge her incoming great thumping head and the affections it brought. Her huge face nuzzling him and colossally wide lips pressing firmly and so delicately into his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund's bellows of protest at being held captive were drowned utterly out by her caresses and passionate fondling. He tried to push her off, but he couldn't. He tried to squeeze out of her nurturing humongous face, but he couldn't do that either. She was completely implacable. The young Riolu coughed out in-between her smooching and loving embrace that she was smothering him. The Sumo Snorlax laughed at the absurdity of that notion and carried on cuddling him - there was absolutely no dissuading her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt like an eternity of smothering and tenderness from an unstoppable giant, finally Ms. McCarthy came back. \"Alright Hera, Fine! There's no use arguing with you. Take the little brat, just get out of my Orphanage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But how!? Why? Ma\u2019am, you cannot be serious!\" complained the entombed Ed Fogge in terror and confusion as the Snorlax laughed triumphantly, opening her folded legs. Rearing her head back and far above her prize. \u201cPlease, Ms, Snorlax, I-\u201d but the Riolu was interrupted by the beast who claimed seniority, holding a great stern and still finger up to silence any objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh, young man.\u201d She interrupted in a flat indignant tone, eyes flashed with possessiveness, which improved into a more gentler and content one \"I\u2019m your new mommy now, so I don\u2019t want to hear any more sass about it, alright?.\" placing a proud paw on her broad and generous bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck my boy - you're all hers.\" Said Ms. McCarthy, and before Edmund could say anything, off she ran! Hera had a very smug facial expression indeed. Triumphant, she had her new Riolu to all to herself. No interruptions, no one to share him with. He was hers. Towering over her tiny human. Resting her enormous chin on her great hands. An unmistakable positive gesture of courtship - a face platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then my syrup pancake...\" she purred possessively \"First things first. Let's get out of this old building and back to my gym, you'll love it there.\" And with that, she gingerly picked him up with her paw and dangled him above her face like a stuffed toy in a crane game. With him in her grasp, she made her way out from the terrible building and back onto the streets of Olympia. Ed felt like his entire world had taken a sudden and violent turn, now under the ownership of obese, hungry Snorlax woman, who seemed to look at him less as her supposed 'child' and more like an object, a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Hera, but I guess you're supposed to say mommy now that you're mine. Now, I run an orderly and structured Gym, and I expect you to pull your weight as it's the newest employee.\" Hera explained, stuffing the small Riolu into her soft and expansive bosom so that he could snuggle closer to her. \"Your escape attempts before were funny, but once we get home, expect a stern punishment if you try to leave me, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Ma'am...\" Edmund squeaked as he wiggled around the sensitive breast flesh cautiously. \"I m-mean Hera.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hera\u2019s personal bedroom looked about the way that Ed had anticipated it to in the short time that he had known her soda bottles and cans just about everywhere with family size chip bags and boxes of dry confectionaries, snack desserts and just about anything in between. The whole room smelled like Hera, which was neither good nor bad to Ed, but showed she didn\u2019t really get out much. A computer sat off in the corner next to her bed, and she had a small kitchen consisting of a fridge and microwave. A few open counters revealed they were just used for storing her hoard of snack foods. She waddled inside, letting the Little Riolu in between her breasts slide down in between them and bounce off of her belly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera closed the door behind her and locked it for good measure. With a happy smile, she waddled her way towards her sofa, taking a seat and sighing as if she had just finished a long hike. She let out a quick belch, sucking in more air as she kneaded her gigantic fat belly. She turned on her TV,  and Ed...just sort of stood awkwardly near the door. \u201cSo, um...can I watch TV with you?\u201d He asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah, not yet my little Riolu. I got some leftover pizza in the fridge, heat it up for me will you?\u201d She ordered in a way that made it sound like asking. He didn\u2019t question her. Edmund obediently walked across the room and opened up her fridge, stocked with soft drinks and filled with several different forms of take-out and delivery. He picked up one of the boxes, it seemed like her diet consisted of nothing save for fatty leftovers. Inside was a disorganized circle of different pizzas from different places, all stuffed into one box. He took out enough to fill a plate evenly and put it in the microwave, watching her eagerly rub her fat stomach in anticipation. She grabbed another family size bag of chips she was halfway done with and unrolled it, reaching in and chomping on more handfuls. She called out to him with a mouthful, wiping some of the drool off of her chin. \u201cShoda sweetie pie!\u201d The Sumo Snorlax demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund grabbed one of the many random two-liter bottles from out of the fridge and handed it to her, assuming, correctly, that she didn't care much for any particular brand. She grabbed it and opened it up, guzzling down half of the cold beverage down in one swig before sighing and clutching her massive belly, letting out a deep, rolling belch. \u201cHuuuuurrrrrrrrrrppp!\u201d. The newly adopted Riolu opened the microwave before it could beep, taking the pizza out and walking over quickly to set it on the table in front of Hera. He pushed away some of the trash and set it down in the space he created while the Snorlax just stared at him. After a few seconds of confusion, Ed spoke with rising fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Hera rolled her eyes and gave out a sigh, pointing down at the pizza sizzling and oozing with grease. She then opened up her big mouth and pointed inside, not closing it even after he understood what she wanted from him. He grabbed a slice of the pizza, it was hot but not unbearable. Grease dripped down onto his hand and her belly as he hovered it over to Hera\u2019s mouth, where she grabbed his hand and stuffed it into her mouth, pizza and all. \u201cA-ah! Please, Ms. Hera, don\u2019t eat me!\u201d The Snorlax smirked as she made sure to suck on his hand for a good long while before letting it pop out of her mouth, chomping on the whole slice that fit perfectly into her wide mouth. The strong smell of her saliva clung to his fur as he tried to wipe the hippo drool off of his forearm and hand. It wasn't gross, as surprising as he found out, just very strong and pungent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmh~... nexht schlice!\u201d Edmund grabbed another piece and floated it over to her, right before it reached her mouth she gulped down the last piece, ready for another. Hera guzzled down more soda as she passed the halfway point of the pizza. She stopped for a moment, letting out another series of deep belches as he stopped feeding her to rub her nicely filled gut. She didn't even have to tell him to do so, and he was still giving her a belly massage! Having a ki9d rocks, she thought. In truth, the little Riolu was more curious than anything, never being so close to anything so large and spherical before. After she took a second to relax she polished off the rest of the pizzas with Ed\u2019s help. He rested his head on her grease covered belly as she licked her fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh~ what a good little kid you are, feeding me like that. Keep that up, and I might even introduce you to some of my friends. They would love you and your nimble little paws!\u201d He rubbed large circles into her belly, for a moment he was unsure if he even wanted to see next week it meant being fat for this big belly, but he pushed that crazy thought away. And enjoyed the safety of being next to a full gut, rather than an empty one. \u201cUuurrrrrpp!\u201d She belched, making her belly quiver and jiggle like an ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmn? Oh, Arceus look at you, you\u2019re covered in grease! How did that happen!?\u201d Hera exclaimed as she eyed her Riolu over, noticing how her once pure fur had been sullied and spoiled with yellow and orange splotches of pizza drippings. The connection between the stain and him feeding her pizza didn't make it in her lard clogged mind. \u201cThe bathroom is in the back, why don\u2019t you use it so you can clean yourself up?\u201d Edmund grumbled, but figured that getting clean again was the best option going forward and made his way over to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was to be anything good coming from being adopted by the world\u2019s largest Snorlax, it had to be her oversized shower. It looked brand new and was massively huge, which was to be expected since it was designed for giant Pokemon. The cubicle reached the ceiling and its width practically filled a quarter of the bathroom, complete with a large shower-head that sprayed gallons. The shower controls, however, due to the shower being for large Pokemon, were positioned beyond Ed\u2019s reach at the top. Conveniently, there was a step ladder fright underneath, Hera probably having foreseen the need for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter disrobing and climbing the steps to the controls, he turned the shower on and adjusted it to the right temperature. He started moving down the steps when he felt the floor shake, the same shaking he felt the orphanage was having earlier in the day before Hera came in through the front door. When Ed heard the steps grow louder and the tremors heavier, he moved a paw to step off, freezing once the bathroom door opened. \u201cOh for\u2026\u201d The Riolu grumbled, feeling a bit miffed that his private time was being intruded on. This morning had been utter chaos, and he just wanted some time to himself. \u201cH-Hera, c\u2019mon you just told me to come in here! Can\u2019t you wait?\u201d He moaned, pausing his descent from the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d Hera spoke above the noise of running water. \u201cI\u2019m here to use the shower, too! Yeah, I noticed I was pretty messy too with all that pizza, so I figured I was due for a wash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d said Edmund hesitantly. \u201cOkay than...just wait until I'm finished in here than you can-\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, about that pancake! I run a frugal household and gym around here, and I\u2019m not gonna waste any extra money just because there's another mouth to feed.\u201d Before the Riolu could think of a reply, the steamy shower door flew open, revealing a naked Snorlax looming over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hera! What do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m saving water, little man. You want to take a shower, I want to take a shower, so we both take a shower.\u201d said Hera proudly, like she had solved world hunger. Edmund wasn\u2019t listening at that point. He tried wrapping his head around Hera standing naked before him, and then promptly made one last attempt to get off the ladder, when suddenly the huge Snorlax lumbered in, dirty fur and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop\u2026!\u201d Ed cried out, but by then it was too late. Hera had already made herself comfy amid the warm splashing water, her enormous belly sandwiching the baby jackall against the tile. By the style it growled, one could have been mistaken that it hadn\u2019t been fed yet. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sense in wasting water! It\u2019ll save on the bills so I can spend money on other stuff, like feeding me! And there\u2019s plenty of room!\u201d Ed tried to yell out his objections to Hera\u2019s idea, but the Snorlax\u2019s belly pressed against and on top of him, smothering his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hera! Get...off!\" Edmund inhaled, noticing with Hera practically standing on top of him, the shower shrank in size the way wet clothes shrink in the dryer. As Hera let the warm water soak her fur, she leaned back and hummed an idle tune while she washed under the hot spray. Dirt, several weeks old, broke loose from her fur and fell onto the pelt of her newly adopted kid.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quinton quickly walked up to the many steps in between the rows of benches inside of the lecture hall and picked his seat where he knew he would be alone chiefly. As a bonus, it was about two-thirds of the way from the front of the hall, far up enough to not pay so much attention, yet not so far back that it looked like he was a slacker. The same process was implemented into selecting his seat, three from the edge of the row. That way, it would be close enough that he could get up and leave the hall with ease if he thought the class was too boring. He was only a freshman, but he learned the trick from some senior sharing their tips online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been much different back in high school. Back then, attendance was mandatory, by the definition of the law missing class was a crime. Quinton had never committed any crimes in his life and planned to keep it that way. However, in university, where attendance was much more flexible, he rationalized that he would only go to a few lectures before he would figure out whether it gave him any added value over just reading the textbook. Unfortunately, university professors are known to be more interested in their research that interacting with the student body. Personally, the real subject that he actually liked in High School was English, but of course, he couldn't just fill all his time with writing classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here Quinton was. In Calculus. At least the professor for this class had a reputation for being a good teacher, so he was cautiously optimistic. Although, since this class was at ten in the morning on a Monday, he needed a very good reason to come here weekly. He looked around at the other students filing into the lecture hall. Pokemon, mostly. Quinton winced as he observed the multi-colored, fantastical creatures slowly fill into the hall. Regardless of whether or not you are a human or a Pokemon, starting anew at another school is always a challenge. And the argument could be made that no one else in Pagewalk City University knew that better than it's newest student foreign exchange student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the far off country of The Northern Isles, the freshman had been in and out of several schools throughout his whole childhood. But not because he was a troublemaker, no, Quinton just had a family that had to move around a lot due to their jobs. He was confident, at least just a little bit, that the move to the prestigious P.C.U would be the last time he would have to start up again. It was definitely tear-jerking for him to have to say goodbye to his family, but the idea of the fabled college lifestyle and the thought of being on his own was far too powerful an urge to ignore. It escaped his mind that Pagewalk was deep down south, in Pokemon governed territory, right up until he got off the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew what Pokemon were, he had seen one or two in all his travels across his home country, but he had never seen so many in one place! He had tried to assimilate, but everything was just so...so different. Thanks to the student exchange program, he was given his dormitory room a month before the autumn semester would start, a month before he would have to share it with a roommate. Today that would end. Today he would meet up with his new 'best buddy'. The Pokemon greeted Quinton with curiosity as they walked by up the stairs, and he forcefully smiled back at them. They all looked nice enough to the human freshman, but he didn't intend to hang out with any of them outside of assignments that required working together. Making friends was never really his strong suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, most of the lecture hall was pretty much empty, so he was able to keep his fake smiles to a minimum. The mathematics department at P.C.U wasn't all that big or well funded, and even then, not many people would voluntarily go into calculus. This meant that he could sit alone, which suited him more than just fine. Everything looked like a perfectly normal (enough) beginning to a perfectly average class that just so happened to be taught by an anthropomorphic frog...up until the point when he walked in. The whole class heard him before he actually entered the lecture hall, his heavy footfalls echoing outside in the main hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Quinton thought that there was an earthquake, and was on the verge of running and screaming out of the class when he noticed the calm, unphased faces on all his Pokemon peers. He had forgotten that the people here could be so big as to shake the ground. Entering through the double doors in the back, saying that he was hard to ignore would be an understatement. The figure that rounded the door caused everyone to stare and there were a few quiet gasped and soft mutterings. Quinton himself blinked in surprise at the figure that entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a Snorlax, a rare sight even in a city full of Pokemon, dressed up in a loose, red flannel shirt and faded yellow tee, both articles of clothing looking way too small on his gargantuan frame. He had greenish blue fur with creamy belly, impossible to contain by his shirt and hanging over his acid washed jeans. He had a prominent underbite with a pair of fangs that protruded up from his lower jaw. However, his most striking feature was that he was... well...Fat. Like enormously fat. Like it's a miracle of science he can still walk fat. Quinton could only widen his eyes and gape his jaw at the massive Pokemon. He knew that Snorlax was supposed to be lard asses, but such a term felt woefully inadequate with this one. Lard Continent sounded more applicable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge teddy bear Pokemon was a veritable blob on legs, each step seeming to shake the lecture hall violently, the solid stone cracking under his paws. Every calm breath blew up a furred belly and caused it to bounce and wobble all over the place as if it had a mind of its own. Just the fact that he was a Snorlax in a calculus class would have been somewhat remarkable, but the reason why everyone in the class was staring at him was that he was the biggest Snorlax that had all ever seen. His lips curled up into a friendly smile as he briskly walked towards the bleachers of the lecture hall. That same smile was reflected in his deep, chocolate eyes as he looked around the hall curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human freshman, along with pretty much everyone else in the hall, watched him as he started to walk up the stairs. The way his bulging stomach wobbled and bounced with every step made Quinton think this was all real, which was just insane. There was no way in Hell that anyone, whether they're a human or a Snorlax or whatever, could ever get so big. It just could not happen. He must have been dreaming, he rationalized. That theory was quickly debunked, as a pinch to the elbow confirmed that he was, in fact, lucid in reality. The Snorlax walked with grace and poise, seemingly not even bothered by all the adipose tissue weighing him down. He also didn't seem bothered by all the stares he was getting. He must have gotten used to them by this point, the human rationalized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton looked away as the great big Pokemon approached his row of seats, not wanting to appear rude. His heart pounded in his chest when he noticed, out of the corner of his eyes, that the Snorlax stopped at his row of seats. He risked more of a direct glance at the behemoth scanned around the room for a place to sit, and he just couldn't believe what he was seeing. He was even bigger up close if such a thing was possible! He continued looking for a seat until his deep brown eyes stopped on one that suited him. Quinton nearly had a heart attack and had to look away quickly when he realized that what he was looking at was the seat right next to where he was standing. The aisle seat of his row. Two chairs to his right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his relatively small looking backpack on the floor by the seat and started to remove his flannel shirt. He sat down into the chairs sideways, his back to Quinton. As he'd suspected, his massive belly was easily visible from behind. He also had the opportunity to look over his backside. Full, big, and so much like a shelf that his jeans could only cover half of it. After sitting down, and making the reinforced seats bend and creak, he began to turn around, and Quinton once again had to avert his eyes, trying to make it look like he wasn't staring. To help establish his cover, he folded the lecture desk in front of him down and began to take his laptop from his bag, all while still glancing surreptitiously over at the Snorlax squeezing into his seat. Squeezing was definitely the right word to use. His immense belly filled all the available space between him and the barrier behind the row of seats in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinton could clearly hear the wood creak as he struggled to get his great bulk into the small space. He looked at the human and said human felt like a Sawsbuck in highlights. Had he seen him staring, was he offended? Yet his smile seemed completely friendly, almost oblivious to all the attention he was getting. \"Hello!\" The Snorlax greeted cheerfully, extending a pudgy paw to the shy freshman. \"You look like you're new here!\" Quinton just sat there, staring at him and unable to speak. His only saving grace was that he was at least staring at his face now. \"I'm Hector.\" he offered gently, apparently not minding his behavior. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Quin\" he stammered slightly. He realized Hector was still holding his paw up, and he hastily took it. The Snorlax shook the Human's hand and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if I use your desk?\u201d He asked him, smiling sheepishly. \u201cI, um, can\u2019t use my own.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Quin looked and front of Hector, and, of course, the big hulking Snorlax's desk was completely trapped underneath his soft stomach. The human couldn't even see it with all the fat flesh in the way. He shook his head hard enough to make his neck hurt. \"N-No, of course not! G-Go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector beamed a wide smile at Quin that made a soul warn up a bit. \"Aw, thanks, buddy!\" The human wanted to keep talking to the great colossus, even if it was just an excuse to keep looking at him. \"Hey, uh...sorry again, but could you share your textbook with me? I would have brought it with me, but...\" The Snorlax gestured to his big backpack, which was filled to the brim of all sorts of fattening snacks and foodstuffs in place of any scholarly items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuin complied with Hector's request, eager to take any chance to get closer with him. The human brought out his textbook, notebook, and pen onto his desk, but before he could open to the introductory page, a three-liter bottle of soda was neatly placed on top the cover. The freshman soon found his desk stacked to the brim with some of the same foods Hector had in his pack, using it as a place to eat them more quickly. \"Thanks again, buddy.\" He playfully smiled as he placed Quin's textbook on his shelf of a belly to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuin the human swallowed a wad of saliva that was building up in his mouth. \"So, uh...w-what else do ya' have in they're, Hector?\" The freshman asked the question before realizing what came out of his lips. All the while his eyes were still glued to his stomach, along with pretty much everyone else in the lecture hall. The Snorlax raised an eyebrow and smile that big damn smile that made his bloated cheeks seem even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to know, lil' buddy~\" He teased whilst gently patting his well-fed stomach. He picked up a foot long Italian submarine from Quin's desk and chomped half of it down in about three bites. The human was blown away, was he actually...flirting with him? He wanted to say something, perhaps even try to flirt back if he worked up the courage, but before he could make the attempt the Greninja professor came into the lecture hall. The early middle-aged amphibian at the front of the room turned on the projector and dimmed the lights down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, everyone, and welcome to Calculus 105,\" he said as he murmurs in the lecture hall died down enough. \"My name is Professor Delacroix. I can see that we have a pretty good attendance today...well, let's see if we can keep it that way for the rest of the semester.\" Quin already knew that he would be attending this class, only if because Hector was going to. In fact, the human was already contemplating if she should try and figure out what other classes the Snorlax was taking, so he could sign up for them. Delacroix began to go over the purpose of the class, but the freshman was having serious difficulty paying attention to what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather impossible to focus on anything else when the biggest living being he had ever seen was sitting right next to him. Quin kept glaring over at him, hoping that he wasn't making it all too obvious. He just couldn't get over how...big Hector was. He had the face of a cherub, beautiful and innocent like a child with dazzling chocolate eyes, ruined only by the wild voracity of the way he ate his food. His smile seemed to make his body warm somehow as if the same energy he put into it was visually projected as cozy heat. Underneath his plush, jiggling flab he could make out muscles hard as diamonds. But to find all those things in one package, quite possibly the biggest package on the planet...well, it was just crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single time Quin looked over at him, his heart seemed to skip a beat as his eyes refused to believe the sight of the mountain of flab and fur in front of him. The vast expanse of flesh bulging out from his clothes, moobs that could rival the curviest of women...the more the human was in his presence, the more inviting he became. \"Hey...you said your name is Quin, ya'?\" Hector piped up after the professor changed slides. The human was taken back into reality and out from his idle fantasies as he realized the hulking mass was now addressing him. \"Long shot, but...are you, by a chance, Quinton Razzroot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazzroot. Quin always hated that name. He knew that it was the family surname and that he was supposed to respect his blood ties, but...really, razz? A sound made with the tongue and lips in order to express contempt, a childish one at that. Root, the fleshy, enlarged underground part of a plant. His name meant that he was a contemptuous plant. A plant...that Hector knows?! \"Y-yeah, that's my name, don't wear it out, hehe...seriously.\" He forcefully chuckled. \"Uh, how, exactly, did you find that out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector blinked, and somehow his already huge smile widened even more. \"Aw, dude, no way! I'm your new roommate!\" The massive Snorlax grabbed the one thing out of his backpack that wasn't edible, a piece of grease-stained paper with a bunch of information on it that pertained to where he was gonna stay. \"You got a form like this too, right? See, there's your name, and here's mine; Hector Yellhat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuin knew that his roommate was coming today, and he knew that his last name was Yellhat, but his form was smeared because the printer was on the fritz today in the library. Suddenly, the human felt frozen. He tried to move, but his muscles weren't responding. He was overcome with shock. For the rest of the semester, maybe even longer...he was going to have to stay with him?! The massive Pokemon acknowledged the look on his new buddy's face and gave a smirk. \"Yeah, yeah, I know...what a stupid last name, huh?\" He patted Quin on the back, making the human collide his face with the exposed bit of his bulging belly. \"Hah, my dad used to tell me that it meant I'm the best at demanding attention. Can't argue with the pops, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuin's face was suddenly in contact with the very mass of fur and fat that he had been ogling for God knows how long. Hector was impossibly soft, his cheekbones pressing into layers of puppy fat, and underneath he felt his taught, almost liquid muscle. This Pokemon felt like he had more power than a crane, yet at the same time gentle as an Angel. His fur was smooth and shiny, long enough to ruffle but still rather short. He was warm, incredibly so, with a slick layer of sweat coating him in the heat of the lecture hall. Without noticing, the happy Snorlax stopped patting on the back to instead just plain hug him into his belly. It was a habit of his, hugging people. People said he had a knack for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector smelled earthy, but not really in an unpleasant way. There was something so familiar and almost enticing about his scent, bringing up memories of playing in the field outside his dad's bar. Quin eventually got over the shock of the hug for the most part and settled into it, not daring to ask his captor to release him. He didn't even know that he was hugging him. Such oblivious was...kind of adorable to the human, in a strange way. With ease, he was able to reach his three-liter soda bottle without his hold on his new buddy easing up. The lemon-lime syrup sprayed forth into his eager maw, slapping on his fat, pink tongue and pooling against his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuin heard the Snorlax make a soft, rumpling coo that he had never heard any person make before. He assumed that it was the Snorlax equivalent of a purr. It occurred to him that he must have been baking underneath all that cozy blubber, combined with the poor air conditioning in this part of the school and the fact that it was late summer. The human's mind was suddenly shattered as his gaze met his, turning down past his moobs to burn those chocolate gems into his soul. \"Oh, sorry dude! Totally didn't even register...\" He was referring to the hug, and Quin thought at this point he would release him from his grasp. But instead, he did nothing, save for stare and smile. \"...uhhhhh...Arceus this is gonna sound so lame. D-Do ya' mind if I can just hug you a lil' bit longer? All the stuff the teacher is saying is over my head, and this calms me down more than you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, go right ahead, man!\" Quin beamed as hard as he could, which still was a bit weak. He understood how much stress could hurt, and although being a human fidget toy was not high on his list of things to do in his life, it really wasn't all that bad. \"Y-You give pretty good hugs~\" After a moment he felt the back of his head cradled by the Pokemon's large mitts. Gently, Hector ruffled his hair and pushed his face into his muscle gut a little, clearly enjoying every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...thanks, buddy.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Because I do not believe that the one hundred and forty-third Pokemon is not properly loved enough on the Internet, I have taken it upon myself to create this Interactive Story, where you play as the titular sleeping Pokemon themselves: Snorlax. There are plenty of Interactive Stories on Writing.com that center around Pokemon, but almost none about Munchlax's evolution. If you share my strange fascination for this fictitious creature, then perhaps this is the story for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you take on the role of a Snorlax, but not one that is particularly representative of the rest of its species. Where the average 'lax stands at 6'11\" (2.1 m) and weighs at 1014.1 lbs (460.0 kg), this Snorlax stands at 11'5'' (3.5 m) and weighs at 2755 lbs (1250 kg). Why have I set these numbers to such suspiciously arbitrary heights? Well, that's for you to decide. It's up to you, the reader, to determine why this Snorlax is so much bigger than others. It could have spent its entire life being pampered by a trainer, or be subjugated to experimental serums by a villainous team. The choice is yours, and you develop the story you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some rules to lay down before the Interactive can start proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule One:<br>\r\nBecause this takes place in the Pokemon Universe and this is a Pokemon that is built for gaining large amounts of weight, the Snorlax is not allowed to be impaired by it's weight gain. All problems that occur with realistic obesity, such as immobility, diabetes, heart failure, etc., are all void under the pretense of 'It's Pokemon'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Two:<br>\r\nAlthough it is not the main subject of the Story, sexual interactions are allowed, just please make sure not to base the majority of your story around it. Also, it is entirely forbidden for these interactions to occur with characters under eighteen years of age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Three:<br>\r\nIn the Pokemon Universe, the gender ratio for Snorlax is heavily skewed towards the male sex. However, that does not mean that there can't be any female Snorlax. You are free to give your Snorlax any gender you want, or even keep it ambiguous the whole way through. On a side-note, if you want to change the ratio, you totally have that freedom. You can place your story in a world where half of all Snorlax are female, where the male sex is the minority instead, the choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Four:<br>\r\nVore is allowed, as long as it is soft. No hard vore will be allowed in this story. Oral as a method is preferred, but others are tolerated as long as they are 'clean'. Cock vore can't have watersports, and anal vore can't have scat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Five:<br>\r\nSlob behavior is allowed, but only to some extents. As stated in Rule Four, watersports and Scat are not permitted, as well as vomiting and farting. However, sweat, musk, drooling, and burping is acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Six:<br>\r\nExcept for choice chapters, every addition must have at least two paragraphs of text. Please put some genuine thought into your chapter additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule Seven: Every chapter must have more than one choice at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is all I can think of for right now. I may update the rules later, but for now, you are free to continue to the story. Please have fun, and thank you for taking the time to add.</td>",
