You hand her the letter and her brow furrows. \"What does it mean by tournament? What kind of tournament?\" Sarah asks. \"I don't know\" you shake your head, \"I think I'll go just to see what it's about.\" Your friends stare at you strangely but say nothing more. </span></div></div>",

After pulling your strawberry-blonde hair back into a ponytail, you grab your suitcase that you packed last night, and head out. Most of the docks are empty, except dock 4, where a large crowd has gathered in front of an old looking boat with a dragon on the front. You cringe at the sight of it. Then, after following the crowd for a while, you finally make it onto the boat. Inside it's very dim and lit only by a few torches here and there. You are led down a passage and into a small cabin where two people are already seated. A stern looking woman with blonde hair and a man with sunglasses who is reading a magazine. You find that the woman is Lt. Sonya Blade, and the man is the movie star Jonny Cage.</span></div></div>",

You notice that his picture is on the cover. <br>\r\n\"He's conceited,\" you think to yourself, \"Like most good looking men.\" <br>\r\nSonya finally turns her eyes to you.<br>\r\n\"You really don't know where we're going?\" she asks. You shake your head, avoiding her intimidating stare. <br>\r\n\"All I know is that it's some kind of a fighting tournament,\" you say, pretending to be occupied with your nails. <br>\r\nSonya lets out a short laugh.<br>\r\n\"Not just any fighting tournament,\" she says, \"The Mortal Kombat tournament.\" <br>\r\nYou stare blankly at her, the phrase Mortal Kombat means nothing to you.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just tell her the whole thing already?\" Johnny says, shaking his head at Sonya. The Lt. sighs.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she says, looking at you again, \"You've been invited to a special tournament. A tournament used for the purpose of defending Earth.\"<br>\r\nYou riase an eyebrow, but she continues.<br>\r\n\"This tournament has been used to protect Earth for thousands of years, but this time the circumstances are a little different.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\" you ask. She glares at you for interrupting her, and you go silent.<br>\r\n\"This time the tournament is not only being held by it's usual host, Shang Tsung, but also by another sorcerer, Quan Chi.\"<br>\r\nYou can't help yourself, you have to chuckle.<br>\r\n\"Sorcerer? This is a joke right?\" You laugh.<br>\r\nSonya shskes her head seriously.<br>\r\n\"No,\" she continues, \"They have uncovered some kind of army, Raiden wasn't spacific about the details. All we know is that they're planning to use this tournament to collect souls to add to the army.\"<br>\r\nYou are staring wide eyed at her, but still fighting the urge to laugh. <br>\r\n\"All right, all right,\" you say, \"But if this is some kind of stupid reality show I better get paid.\"<br>\r\nSonya snorts and looks away again.<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Johnny says, \"I don't do reality shows. They're below my standards.\"<br>\r\nYou still have many more questions, but decide not to annoy them further. You could sit here in uncomfortable silence with these two, or you could check out the rest of the ship. What will you do?</span></div></div>",

You leave your suitcase on the floor and leave the cabin. Outside the hallways are silent, but you can faintly make out the sounds of fighters talking inside the other cabins. <br>\r\n\"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea,\" you think to yourself, then change your mind, \"Stop being such a baby.\"<br>\r\nYou shkae your head and walk down one of the hallways, then another, and another. Soon you have gone through so many hallways that you can't remember where you came from. You take a right turn, and gasp in surprise when you run into something solid. You look up to see a robed man a head taller than yourself. He backs up, taking on an angry stance.<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry I didn't mean to...\" you start to say.<br>\r\n\"Do not apologize,\" he cuts you off, \"Stay out of my way in the future.\" <br>\r\nSomething about his voice sends a chill down your spine. You grunt when he shoves you into the wall and walks past. Without looking again, you rush around the corner to find yourself in yet another hallway.<br>\r\n\"How big is this ship?\" You ask to no one at all.<br>\r\n\"Not big at all, you have been down this hall three times.\"<br>\r\nYou jump, startled, and turn to see who had spoken. It is a man in a long black leather coat. He has raven hair that falls to his shoulders, and slanted black eyes that are glittering strangely at you. <br>\r\n\"I have?\" you ask.<br>\r\nHe nods, \"I have been watching you,\" he laughs, \"It was amusing. But anyway, if you need help getting back to your cabin, I would be more than happy to assist you. Or I could give you a tour of my ship.\"<br>\r\nYour mouth falls open.<br>\r\n\"Your ship? You're Shang Tsung?\"<br>\r\nHe nods slightly, \"None other. Now, what will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

You had actually agreed to take the tour because you want to find out more about the tournament. <br>\r\n\"So,\" you say, following close behind him, \"Where exactly is this island?\"<br>\r\n\"My island is located in the Lost Sea,\" he replies simply.<br>\r\nYou have never heard of the Lost Sea, but don't care enough to ask about it. <br>\r\n\"Can you explain to me about this tournament?\" you ask him hopefully. <br>\r\nHe doesn't look at you.<br>\r\n\"I will explain to all of my invited guests once we have arrived on the island.\"<br>\r\nHe stops in front of a door.<br>\r\n\"I believe this is you cabin.\" he says, gesturing to the door.<br>\r\nYou nod, realizing that he's right.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\nYou open the door to find Johnny asleep with his magazine in his lap, Sonya playing with a pocket knife, and another woman. She has bronze skin and dark eyes. Her hair is dark like her eyes and is tied behind her head in a messy bun. She is sitting near Sonya, her arms folded into a sky blue MUDD sweatshirt. She looks up as you enter, so does Sonya.<br>\r\n\"What took you so long, did you fall off the boat or something?\" Sonya asks. It's the first time you have seen her smile.<br>\r\n\"No,\" you reply, \"I got a little lost, and then I ran into Shang Tsung.\"<br>\r\nThe dark skinned woman's eyes widen.<br>\r\n\"You ran into Shang Tsung and your survived?\"<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Funny,\" she says, \"I ran into Quan Chi on the top deck.\"<br>\r\n\"Well anyway,\" Sonya says, \"Maybe we should get some sleep.

Outside, you step onto the sandy shore and gaze up at a towering castle that seems to stretch into the sky itself. No one sle is talking, so you follow them toward the castle. <br>\r\n   A while later you have all put your things away in your rooms, and are sitting in the dining hall, talking quietly. Amilee is busy chatting with Johnny Cage, and Sonya is talking to some other fighter at the table. Feeling a little left out, you look around the room, inspecting the other fighters. You gulp, most of them are bigger and taller than you. Looking around more you find Shang Tsung standing near the doorway, along with another man. Immediately you realize that the other man must be Quan Chi. You look back at your companions, they are still engaged in their conversations.

As if a group of pathetic mortals from Earthrealm could possibly pose any threat to a renowned sorcerer such as yourself. You make your way around a corner, pulling the hood of your midnight robe over your face. Just as you round the corner you find yourself running into a figure much smaller than you. You back up with an angry grunt, and glare through the darkness at the person who had stumbled into your path. It is a young girl of maybe twenty or so years, with fiery red hair and a panicked expression covering her pale face. <br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry I didn't mean to...\"<br>\r\nYou know that she can't make out your hooded face in the dim light. You take a breath, trying to control your temper.<br>\r\n\"Do not apologize,\" you say sharply. The girl jumps at the sound of your baritone voice. You smile inwardly, enjoying the fear you have caused her.<br>\r\n\"Stay out of my way in the future,\" You tell her.<br>\r\nYou shove her to one side, not giving her another glance, and continue your walk down the hall. Once you reach another turn, you look back, but she is gone. Your smile broadens, she had probably fled in terror. Now you are wondering where you should go next. You could head back to the upper deck, or you could pay some of the fighters a visit, just to inform them of who you are and the fact that they will undoubtably be killed in the tournament. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You have taught yourself never to trust anyone completely.
