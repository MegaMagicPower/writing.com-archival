Your mind was a slurry of confused, muddled thoughts and memories, the only focus being the icy ground below you. Your eyes attempted to flutter open, blistering winds forced them shut, your body fearing loss of vision in the unusually harsh wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft crunching of snow was heard from a near distance, approaching your quaking form, becoming louder, yet slower as the being advanced. With a moment of silence, your body was jarred as a warm, soft surface, carefully encompassed your body, bringing you close to the thick jacket the man wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo had recently been spending time in the frosty peaks of Nepal, avoiding the contact of most locals and the omnics which set temples here. He was merely training in the tundra to better adapt his skills in harsher conditions. His training session was harsh as always, the archer decked in casual wear, masking his appearance and confining his body to the warmth he radiated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his walk to another area to practice, the attuned eyes of the assassin spotted a small writhing form, laying atop the snow. He looked around quickly before approaching the creature, his steely eyes widening at the sight before him. A small human lay shivering in the snow, no more than 5 inches tall. He was dress in very simple streetwear, nothing wearable for the type of weather he had seemingly spawned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the large man carefully picked up the man and pulled him close to his warm chest. Hanzo was a trained assassin, he had done many horrendous things in his life. But he was not a monster, no matter how much he told himself he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I found you. You would have frozen, little one.\" Alone, the archer allowed himself to crack a small smile; possibly in hopes to comfort the small human who was just now opening his eyes, still shivering furiously. The look on Hanzo's face turned to one of though, for this training session, his pockets were filled with spare arrowheads, knives, shuriken and other sharp, dangerous or space-consuming objects. You were clearly freezing, so Hanzo need to think of where to place you.</span></div></div>",

I have to tuck you away somewhere more... Unconventional, until I arrive back to my motel room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shivering nod, your eyes followed as the archer unzipped his thick jacket, allowing a wave of warmth assaults your body, holding a slightly sour tang. Your body begs for that warmth and is gifted more and the archer slowly and carefully pulls you under his shirt and towards the bare, damp flesh trap of his armpit. Your eyes widen as a thick, rank aura of b.o chokes your olfactory system; tainting your lungs with the sour pong of a hardworking man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just met Hanzo, but his willingness to help you sparked trust for him to you. He seemed hesitant to do this, so there must not have been really another choice. Slowly, you were pressed against the shaved flesh, moist with sweat and grime. The reeking scent encapsulated you as you felt the arm lower and heard the sound of the jacket being rezipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again, little one, but this will keep you warm.\" The archer wouldn't admit it immediately, but the feeling of a micro human trapped in an overworked part of his body was something he couldn't help but adore. His humanity and morality still existed, so the idea of torturing the small human was out of the question, but could playing around be so bad? The more he thought about it, the more ideas sprouted to the assassin's mind, the stern, cold warrior nigh giddy at the thought of playing with the smaller man. But perhaps first he should befriend him, a micro in a world like this would be outcast, maybe this was someone Hanzo needed. The start he needed to forgive the ghosts of his past.</span></div></div>",

You looked up and your jaw dropped as a titanic mass of tan skin and muscle towered over you. The tan man was nude, only having a small white towel around his waist which had a pink tip peeking out from below. The six pack and pecs had a robot left arm running over them. On top was a head of brown hair and a handsome face with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well, seems you finally woke up.\u201d, the deep accented voice rolled out as the giant bend down and placed his shadowed face a few inches away. \u201cNow we can finally have some fun~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organic right hand came down and scooped you up in a fist, with only your head peaking out of the warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowboy ripped the towel of his waist, letting his manly glory and large rear breath.

It was heavy but also it was comforting as the pressure made you feel safe and the musk made you feel how strong McCree was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Mcree hummed and slowly swayed side to side and felt his shaft harden as his cheek consumed you. He smiled as he knew he basically owned you and could hold you with just his butt. Still he wouldn't hurt you, he had affection looking at your cute face. Looking over his shoulder at his toned back, McCree chuckled as it was impossible to tell that a human was being sat on. He licked his lips as he wanted to feel your body a little more....west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant grinding above that engulfed you in more of the tan buttcheek stopped. You found yourself being lifted as McCree leaned forward and slightly stood up. You could see the mattress had a imprint from the cowboy's glutes, but your attention was shifted when the tan cheek bounced as McCree ran a organic finger down his cheek and lightly pulled you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fell onto the bed and felt the previous warmth from the cheeks imprints, you looked back up in awe. McCree's large rear hovered over you, it shifted slightly to the side intill the buttcrack was upove you. It slowly lowered and you grunted as the warm cavern consumed you. The musky smell came onto you as the walls of muscles hugged you between thier might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCree ran his hands over butt as he jokingly bounced on the small body beneath him.

Your body was mesmerized by the damp crevice you were trapped in, the feeling of wiry hairs, dampened by stale and fresh sweat. The scent was powerful, a deep musky stench that oozed strength and the epitome of manliness at its core. Undertones of the sour, salty B.O is what kept you from falling asleep in the warm, cushiony crack; every ounce of tiredness being smack away by faux smelling salts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a faint growl that caught your attention, along with McCree's as a playful smirk grew on his lips. \"Sorry pardner', mah lunch ain't sittin' right.\" He explained, his southern drawl sending a shiver through you. It was your only distraction, however, before you would realize what he had meant by that. But by that time, it was too late; not that you could have done something in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growling grew, still quiet and mostly felt through the vibrations. With the little light you had, you watched, mesmerised as the wrinkled hole pulsated and grew before you. You barely even got time to take <i>that</i> in before a dry, scorching wind encapsulated the area where you lay stuck. The rumbling was a bassy sputtering of noxious gas that chugged on for more seconds than necessary. You didn't bother to count as the first few seconds were one of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe release was followed by a happy sigh from the cowboy as he ground his butt lightly into the bed below him. \"You still alive there, darlin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay stuck, the noxious maladour reeking strongly of rotting meats, it was thick and hazy; trapped like a bubble between the two plump cheeks and only leaking out slowly, way too slow for you. You attempted to signal your status by pressing against the giant's asscheek, though your only reply was a chuckle and a short hissing fart; further thickening the toxic aura you were trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, mah bad~ You spooked me.\" McCree had no malicious intent in his voice, he was merely messing about.</span></div></div>",

Then you take your first breath. It was a new layer of hell even Dante himself couldn't describe. The methane laden environment hurts the eyes and lungs. The scent is so strong you can partially taste this McCree's ass. Coughing and choking your body fights for clean air. Yet none will come. You stand up and focus on controlling my breathing. You can make it through this punishment. I just need to focus on escaping. You hear the occasional giggle as the giant above enjoys the feeling of you under him. Turning around you start to walk through the forest of hairs, careful not to get caught by the sticky flesh or entangled in the vine-like fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever each step is more laborious than the last, each breath harder than before. The constant barrage of intestinal gasses slowly draining your sanity. McCree is breaking you down ever so slowly and he isn't even trying. Just relaxing after a long hot day. You can only pray he pities me and pulls me out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue my journey the the giant man's ass, trying to control your breathing as the heady odor saps away your life. Streaks if light shine through the fabric revealing the densely packed fur. It is hard to tell whether you are traveling further into the crack or away; you are completely delirious from the overpowering scent/heat. You try and avoid touching the shit-stained walls yet the coated hair streaks your face and clothes with the vile substance. It is only through pure willpower you are able to retain your previous lunch. After what feels like an eternity, an ominous gurgle echoes above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god please no more\u201d you say in a tremble. Your prays go unanswered as a resounding thundercrack rips above. The loudest and most deafening ass blast so far<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive soundwave hurts your ears and you instinctively cover them. It is of little use but does stop permanent damage. The hot gasses knock you around, partially lifting me up as the fart rapidly escapes the titan\u2019s ass. Your small frame was battered and slammed repeatedly against the fleshy cheeks. If you survive this, it will hurt a lot morning. But that isn\u2019t the worst of it. Whatever this man ate was fermenting in his ass. The first breath caused you to dry heave. The vile gasses burning your throat and lungs . The scent was so heavy you could taste the digested food. The smell so overwhelming it leaks into the secondary senses. your vision blurs and my muscles burn as every breath of the miasma slowly saps away my strength. The otherworldly scent just destroying your fragile form. No mortal should endure what McCree's ass produced. The hot gasses searing the skin and the odor causing you to convulse. Your vision fades in and out as all clean air is removed and replaced with his masculine scent. You can't take it anymore. Your body is done. Yet you survive, after an eternity in hell it slowly dissipates. A lingering smell remains but you get a somewhat clean breath of air. Mostly just his workday musk. You cry out in relief and hope that McCree is done with this horrid game of torment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of them grabs you and carries you over to the commanders shoes. \"Hope you don't mind the smell, because knowing you have it worse than us will make the drill much more bearable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any more acknowledgement you are dropped in Commander Morrison's shoes. Not even a second after none other than Jack Morrison came in, seeing the recruits near his shoes \"What are you doing there?\". The recruits panic for a moment then one says \"With all due respect, your shoes reek and we dared Jeff here to take a deep sniff\" \"Keep your antics for your free hours, let's go get on with the training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their exchqnge you were trying and failing to get out of the shoe, suddenly you saw Jack's foot coming in and smothering you hard. Every step he took is painful and yiu know it is only the beginning. \"Let's warm up with some running\" these words struck fear in you heart. The moment Jack started running in front of the recruits, his steps became much harder and his feet started getting sweaty. Unfortunaltly for you Jack really values cardio and the running continues for an hour, each and every step flattening you further into the sole. Jack is completly unaware how much he is torturing you, but some of recruits that put you in this nightmarish situation are just fixated on the feet of their commander, imagining how you are trapped beneath Jack's sweaty feet feeling the ful weight of every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe running was followed by juming jacks. You didn't know there was anything worse than being trampled by sweaty feet, but now you know being jumped on full force is much worse. Luckily the training ended after the juming jacks, but your torture isn't over yet. Almost all the recruits forgot about you after the though training, and the few that still remember you couldn't be bothered to stop your torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack took off the first shoe the smell hit him, he would never admid it but he liked how smelly his feet would get after a good training. Still not being aware of your pathetic existence under his other foot, he took a sniff after all the recruits left \"the boys are right, my feet reek\". When he took off the shoe with you inside you realize that you are stuck to his sweaty sock and end up in his regular shoes, you were surprised Jack didn't change sock. You hoped that Jack would notice you, but to your dismay he was none the wiser. Jack made his way down the many hallways of the overwatch base toward...</span></div></div>",

You were getting comletly flattened by the huge, smnelly and sweaty foot without even being on Jack's mind. The meeting itself was rather boring so Jack could focus on whatever is in his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the meeting you were in such pain you could barely move, but at least Jack was done grinding you into his boot. \"Hey Jack, a few of us are gonna get a drink, you in?\" Commander Reyes asked. Jack couldn't help but say yes, a few drinks would never hurt. On the way to the bar Jack was talking with the others and enjoying himself, your situation was the complete opposite being repeatedly squashed between an old insole and a sweaty foot. At the bar you were relieved that Jack sat down, so you had only do deal with the terrible smell radiatiating from his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack drank and drank, then to your horror Jack seemed to like the next song a little too much, because he jumped from his chair and made his way to the dancefloor. Your next few hours were spent being stepped and jumped on by a completly unaware Jack. The dancing makes Jack's feet sweat even more and you are reminded of the training from this afternoon. Finally the dancing found an end and Jack was brought home by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Jack's room you fell to the floor and were utterly exposed. \"Hey there little guy, were you in my boot the whole evening?\" Not waiting for your answer he continued \"The night is conna be cold, how about we put you in my sock, it might smell a little but at least it is warm\" Jack couldn't help but giggle when he grabbed your puny body and put you in his sock. That was how you found out that a drunk Jack was not gonna help you. Jack put the sock back on, laughing to himself about a tiny person would have to endure his smelly feet. Soon after Jack fell asleep, leaving you in your misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

The one making the noise was no one other than Gabriel Reyes the Commander of Blackwatch, and it seems he wasn't in a good mood. You hoped he would simply walk by, since you couldn't expect much help from a giant in such a foul mood, but fate wasn't on your side and he stopped right in front of you. You could feel his eyes looking down on you and you couldn't help but feel nervous about the smile that starts to form in his face.<br>\r\nHe picks you up and take you to his office to avoid someone else seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you aren't very lucky. I am one of the worst possible people to find you, from now on you life will be in my control.\" After saying this he thinks about what to do to you first...</span></div></div>",

From time to time he bounces a little or grinds his butt on the chair to make your situation even worse than it already is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one or two hours of him torturing you, a Blackwatch member omes in to inform Gabriel that the cooling system of the building is broken and asks if Gabriel would like to go to a different, cooler room to do the paper work. \"Don't worry I can handle a little heat, I will stay.\" The Blackwatch member leaves, and Gabriel is looking forward to keep the torture going. He bounces a bit to make sure you are listening \"You hear? It will get warm and sweaty down there. I wouldn't wanna be you, my sweaty ass is infamous around here for its terrible smell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day goes by and the crack only gets smellier. You can't understand how anyone could do something like that to anyone, you hold onto the hope that Gabriel might regret what he is doing to you and get you out of there. However Gabriel couldn't be happier about his decision of torturing you, he simply loves the feeling of dominating you so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly... </span></div></div>",

The seat gave off a heavy odor of Roadhog's sweat. <br>\r\nRoadhog's shadow looms over you, only making you more scared. It was only now that you notice the obese man is completely naked. You couldn't tell before because Roadhog's enormous gut blocked everything below it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what Roadhog was planning, until he turned around and gave you a good look at his giant ass and genitals before they began to lower down on you.
