Your mind was a slurry of confused, muddled thoughts and memories, the only focus being the icy ground below you. Your eyes attempted to flutter open, blistering winds forced them shut, your body fearing loss of vision in the unusually harsh wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft crunching of snow was heard from a near distance, approaching your quaking form, becoming louder, yet slower as the being advanced. With a moment of silence, your body was jarred as a warm, soft surface, carefully encompassed your body, bringing you close to the thick jacket the man wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo had recently been spending time in the frosty peaks of Nepal, avoiding the contact of most locals and the omnics which set temples here. He was merely training in the tundra to better adapt his skills in harsher conditions. His training session was harsh as always, the archer decked in casual wear, masking his appearance and confining his body to the warmth he radiated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his walk to another area to practice, the attuned eyes of the assassin spotted a small writhing form, laying atop the snow. He looked around quickly before approaching the creature, his steely eyes widening at the sight before him. A small human lay shivering in the snow, no more than 5 inches tall. He was dress in very simple streetwear, nothing wearable for the type of weather he had seemingly spawned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the large man carefully picked up the man and pulled him close to his warm chest. Hanzo was a trained assassin, he had done many horrendous things in his life. But he was not a monster, no matter how much he told himself he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I found you. You would have frozen, little one.\" Alone, the archer allowed himself to crack a small smile; possibly in hopes to comfort the small human who was just now opening his eyes, still shivering furiously. The look on Hanzo's face turned to one of though, for this training session, his pockets were filled with spare arrowheads, knives, shuriken and other sharp, dangerous or space-consuming objects. You were clearly freezing, so Hanzo need to think of where to place you.</span></div></div>",

I have to tuck you away somewhere more... Unconventional, until I arrive back to my motel room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shivering nod, your eyes followed as the archer unzipped his thick jacket, allowing a wave of warmth assaults your body, holding a slightly sour tang. Your body begs for that warmth and is gifted more and the archer slowly and carefully pulls you under his shirt and towards the bare, damp flesh trap of his armpit. Your eyes widen as a thick, rank aura of b.o chokes your olfactory system; tainting your lungs with the sour pong of a hardworking man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just met Hanzo, but his willingness to help you sparked trust for him to you. He seemed hesitant to do this, so there must not have been really another choice. Slowly, you were pressed against the shaved flesh, moist with sweat and grime. The reeking scent encapsulated you as you felt the arm lower and heard the sound of the jacket being rezipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again, little one, but this will keep you warm.\" The archer wouldn't admit it immediately, but the feeling of a micro human trapped in an overworked part of his body was something he couldn't help but adore. His humanity and morality still existed, so the idea of torturing the small human was out of the question, but could playing around be so bad? The more he thought about it, the more ideas sprouted to the assassin's mind, the stern, cold warrior nigh giddy at the thought of playing with the smaller man. But perhaps first he should befriend him, a micro in a world like this would be outcast, maybe this was someone Hanzo needed. The start he needed to forgive the ghosts of his past.</span></div></div>",

You looked up and your jaw dropped as a titanic mass of tan skin and muscle towered over you. The tan man was nude, only having a small white towel around his waist which had a pink tip peeking out from below. The six pack and pecs had a robot left arm running over them. On top was a head of brown hair and a handsome face with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well, seems you finally woke up.\u201d, the deep accented voice rolled out as the giant bend down and placed his shadowed face a few inches away. \u201cNow we can finally have some fun~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organic right hand came down and scooped you up in a fist, with only your head peaking out of the warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowboy ripped the towel of his waist, letting his manly glory and large rear breath.

It was heavy but also it was comforting as the pressure made you feel safe and the musk made you feel how strong McCree was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Mcree hummed and slowly swayed side to side and felt his shaft harden as his cheek consumed you. He smiled as he knew he basically owned you and could hold you with just his butt. Still he wouldn't hurt you, he had affection looking at your cute face. Looking over his shoulder at his toned back, McCree chuckled as it was impossible to tell that a human was being sat on. He licked his lips as he wanted to feel your body a little more....west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant grinding above that engulfed you in more of the tan buttcheek stopped. You found yourself being lifted as McCree leaned forward and slightly stood up. You could see the mattress had a imprint from the cowboy's glutes, but your attention was shifted when the tan cheek bounced as McCree ran a organic finger down his cheek and lightly pulled you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fell onto the bed and felt the previous warmth from the cheeks imprints, you looked back up in awe. McCree's large rear hovered over you, it shifted slightly to the side intill the buttcrack was upove you. It slowly lowered and you grunted as the warm cavern consumed you. The musky smell came onto you as the walls of muscles hugged you between thier might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCree ran his hands over butt as he jokingly bounced on the small body beneath him.

Your body was mesmerized by the damp crevice you were trapped in, the feeling of wiry hairs, dampened by stale and fresh sweat. The scent was powerful, a deep musky stench that oozed strength and the epitome of manliness at its core. Undertones of the sour, salty B.O is what kept you from falling asleep in the warm, cushiony crack; every ounce of tiredness being smack away by faux smelling salts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a faint growl that caught your attention, along with McCree's as a playful smirk grew on his lips. \"Sorry pardner', mah lunch ain't sittin' right.\" He explained, his southern drawl sending a shiver through you. It was your only distraction, however, before you would realize what he had meant by that. But by that time, it was too late; not that you could have done something in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growling grew, still quiet and mostly felt through the vibrations. With the little light you had, you watched, mesmerised as the wrinkled hole pulsated and grew before you. You barely even got time to take <i>that</i> in before a dry, scorching wind encapsulated the area where you lay stuck. The rumbling was a bassy sputtering of noxious gas that chugged on for more seconds than necessary. You didn't bother to count as the first few seconds were one of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe release was followed by a happy sigh from the cowboy as he ground his butt lightly into the bed below him. \"You still alive there, darlin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay stuck, the noxious maladour reeking strongly of rotting meats, it was thick and hazy; trapped like a bubble between the two plump cheeks and only leaking out slowly, way too slow for you. You attempted to signal your status by pressing against the giant's asscheek, though your only reply was a chuckle and a short hissing fart; further thickening the toxic aura you were trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, mah bad~ You spooked me.\" McCree had no malicious intent in his voice, he was merely messing about.</span></div></div>",

Out of fear, you keep from looking at him to avoid eye contact with the beast. Looking somewhere else, you notice something. <br>\r\nThe place that Roadhog pulled you out of was a shoebox. This made you really scared. The thought that this man shrunk you and kept you in a cardboard box made you feel as if he's going to do whatever he wants with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish thinking, the now-gigantic Roadhog begins to stomp his way over to a couch in front of a TV. Pinching you in between two fingers, Roadhog laughs, covering you in his rancid breath and lowers you onto the couch. The seat gave off a heavy odor of Roadhog's sweat. <br>\r\nRoadhog's shadow looms over you, only making you more scared. It was only now that you notice the obese man is completely naked. You couldn't tell before because Roadhog's enormous gut blocked everything below it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what Roadhog was planning, until he turned around and gave you a good look at his giant ass and genitals before they began to lower down on you. Before you can even think of moving, Roadhog's butt cheek push you down into the seat of the couch. The giant grinds his ass on you just to make you suffer. Roadhog's sweat covers you as the smell of his ass crack surrounds you.</span></div></div>",
