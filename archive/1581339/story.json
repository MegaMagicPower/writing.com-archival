The sights, the sounds, and the knowledge of how to use every Pokemon form and move, and thousands of years of experience, all would have overwhelmed Damon as a human, but as a Mew, handling all this seemed natural.  Plus, he found that he could take human form as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"  Damon said in awe of it all.

In his time as a Rocket Elite, he had captured many rare Pokemon, but the Legendary Pokemon had proved quite difficult to trap, and always got away from him and his squad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this time,\" he thought, clutching a stolen Master Ball, \"things will finally go my way.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was just about to throw the Master Ball, when Entei suddenly turned toward him and let out a mighty roar, blowing Damon off his feet!

Normally, we would only let ourselves be caught to reward trainers with strong wills and pure hearts.  But you, Damon, care only for power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mercy...\"  Damon wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve NONE!\"  Entei shouted, lifting up its paw to stomp Damon again.  Damon braced for the worst.  \"But I will show you mercy anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon gazed in shock as Entei stepped back from Damon.  \"However,\" Entei continued, \"I will not let you simply walk free.  You will be changed to the form of one of the world's weakest Pokemon as punishment for your arrogance and obsession with power.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt himself starting to change as Entei continued.  \"However, if you are found by a trainer, and together, discover the source of true strength, and use that to win the Pokemon League Championship, you may return to human form, if you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, what was Damon becoming?</span></div></div>",

Sighing, Damon started looking for whoever sent him the letter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed like he hadn't taken two steps before a rainstorm started up.  Thinking fast, Damon got his small tent out of his backpack and hurriedly tried to set it up.  Suddenly, he heard a roar that sounded like thunder, and saw a flash in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon panicked.  He knew that trees wouldn't protect him from lightning strikes, but he also knew standing in the middle of a field setting up metal poles was also a very bad idea.  \"Where's a cave when you need one?\"  Damon muttered to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the roar again.  Looking in it's direction, he saw, standing on a cliff, a tiger-like Pokemon, it's back covered by a cloud, it's tail made of a wave of electricity.  Damon was so awed by the sight that he didn't think to get himself to safety.  Then lightning struck, and he blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon woke up in a deep pain.  He tried to get up, but doing so just hurt too much.  He looked around, and saw that he had apparently been moved by somebody into a cave.  Figuring that some person probably carried him into the cave, wanting to help him, Damon called out.  \"Is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're awake!\"  A loud voice responded.  \"Don't move lad.  I've got a Xatu flying over here right now.  He can easily heal you, then you may attend to whatever you came out here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon sighed.  \"So, why are you helping me?  Who are you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tiger Pokemon he had seen earlier walked in front of him.  \"I am Raikou.  And I am helping you because I inadvertently caused your injuries.  Think of it as an apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon froze in terror, but after a moment realized that the tiger Pokemon was the one speaking to him.  \"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you.\"  Raikou muttered, as a Xatu flew in.  Raikou pointed the bird in Damon's direction.  The bird flew over Damon, chanting, and Damon's pain suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name, human?\"  Raikou asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Damon, I would like to offer you another gift for the trouble I've caused you.\"  Damon listened.  \"Your survival of the lightning strike showed me something.  Thrust out your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon gave Raikou an odd look but did as he was told.  As he did, a bolt of light flew out!  \"Woah!  How'd that happen?\"  Damon gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I guessed,\" Raikou said, \"You've gained electrical abilities.  But you may not be able to fully control them.  Damon, if I were to give you the ability to become an Electric Pokemon, you could control this much better.  Are you interested?  You would be able to switch between human and Pokemon forms at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon gazed at Raikou.  \"Are you serious?  Is this real?  I've always wanted to see what it was like to be a Pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a 'yes.'  Now then, which Pokemon do you wish to become?\"</span></div></div>",

Wait is it possible you know moves in this form...\u201d She then pulls out to pok\u00e9dex and scans you to see you know four moves \u201cTransform, Mega Punch, Mega Kick, and Hyper beam.\u201d Oddly enough she has you get dressed and go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she then has you stand in front of a tree and wait a second\u2026 you are soon starting to wonder what\u2019s going on here. As she soon comes back with a notebook and a pencil as it seems she is going to record something. She talks to you and says \u201cDamon you ready?\u201d \u201cFor what exactly?\u201d \u201cTraining.\u201d \u201cAs a human?\u201d \u201cYes use Hyper Beam\u2026\u201d You are thinking no way you know hyper beam as a human\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something in the back of your mind has activated as you lower your hands as they glow with a white energy which is trying to escape you try to hold it back, before realizing that there was no holding it back. So you then go ahead and unleash the powerful attack cutting 1\u20262\u20263\u20264\u20265\u2026 trees in half. You are able to move again instead of having to recharge so you then stand back up to see that Amber is looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 Amber what just happened there?\u201d \u201cYou used a special move while in a human looking state.\u201d \u201cSo I can use Hyper Beam without having to recharge and worrying about the enemies attack?\u201d \u201cYup that\u2019s what I was seeing I didn\u2019t tell you that you could use Pok\u00e9mon moves such as Transform, Mega Kick, Mega Punch and Hyper Beam.\u201d \u201cI wish you would have let me know that more than just had me use a move I didn\u2019t think I could use\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could have told you sooner Damon can you forgive me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know yet I mean that wasn\u2019t really fair though\u2026\u201d \u201cPlease Damon I promise I\u2019ll make it up somehow, Just please forgive me Damon.\u201d Your thoughts are boiling that she used you without much of a hint of the things she was doing, but then again she had been treating you nicely as a lapras. You were confused about your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to do something you didn\u2019t expect you leapt onto the house as she stands there open mouthed and says \u201cHow did you jump that high\u2026 even I can\u2019t jump 7 feet in the air.\u201d You smile and say \u201cJealous a bit that even in human form I can perform higher.\u201d \u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s just please come down.\u201d You smile and decide to test out some of your abilities extremes you find a far tree far away from the house and jump to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon landing in its limbs as she is still amazed you still sit in the tree smiling she comes over and then tries to climb the tree you see her fall and jump down and grab her hand before she lands on the ground about 20 feet off the ground she looks up at you as you slowly let her climb down the tree before jumping back onto the ground by the house before laying on the ground in your clothes on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out the Pok\u00e9dex and then scans you it begins to give off data \u201cDitto Human form. It can leap far distances and excels in several places that humans would never be able to do normally such as Jumping, Agility, Acrobatics, and Strength.\u201d As you hear the part about strength that you had currently not had as a normal human although as a female you never would have expected having Abnormal Strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you go inside where you see she had a weight set as you look at her, she says \u201cI tried to get into it, but it just wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d You help her lay some normal weights on the bar and then fasten them so they don\u2019t fall off. You lift these with ease and then get up and add more coming to 500 pounds still easy\u2026 Double the weight 1000 pounds you lift it like it was a bowling ball. \u201cI do have super strength. Cool that was fun and interesting to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon feel your body shrinking and guess the four hour period was up although as the female human wasn\u2019t as bad as you expected. You soon go back to your ditto form and walk up to her and say \u201cDitto dit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the Dragon spoke, Damon's fear and awe grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon Wright,\" The dragon addressed, \"Welcome to the home of the Legendary Pokemon.  I am the one who has summoned you here.  I am Dialga.\"  When the creature said its name, Damon fell face down before it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dialga, I'm just a kid, I c-can't ask m-much except that you make m-me your servant.\"  Damon had heard enough stories about Dialga and other legendary Pokemon before becoming a trainer to know that if one had had appeared in front of him, he had done something very good or VERY BAD.  Damon figured begging for mercy was the best option if the latter was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga cocked a metal eyebrow.  \"Well, that certainly saves us time.  If you wish, You may be my servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon, realizing the Legendary Pokemon had no intention of killing him, lit up.  \"Oh, thank you Dialga!  It's an honor to serve you.\"  Damon said, full of surprising sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga gave a hearty laugh.  \"Well, Damon, it is pleasant to know that not all humans think of us as tyrants.  But, my servant, I must tell you what I originally brought your to hear.\"  Damon listened intently.  \"Damon, are you familiar with the group known as 'Team Rocket?'\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about them, they were stealing a lot of Pokemon from Kanto and Johto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  But few knew their leader was trying to capture the Legendary Pokemon.  He had come dangerously close to trapping Ho-oh.  Though Ho-oh escaped, he realized how close he had come to his doom.  Thus, he decided that he would find a trustworthy human or Pokemon to be his heir, should something happen to him, and recommended that every Legendary Pokemon do the same.<br>\r\n       \"This is why I have summoned you.  Should you accept this, I will give you a fraction of my power, through which  I can telepathically contact you.  It will also allow you to take the form of a Dragon- or Steel-Type Pokemon, and put its power to use regardless of what form you are in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon Could hardly believe what he was hearing.  Not only was Dialga not going to hurt him, he was offering him unparalleled power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga seemed to sense this, and added, \"Do not take this power I offer you lightly.  The duty of the heir to a Legendary Pokemon is immense, and, if you choose to accept it, should come before any personal goal.  You must aid any Legendary Pokemon in need, including myself, if it should come to that, regardless of anything you were trying to do beforehand.  And if you use your powers for evil, if you are lucky, I will come to you and take them back.  If you are unlucky...\"  Dialga paused, and looked around nervously before quietly finishing, \"Giratina will find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon had never heard of Giratina, but if its name struck fear into the hearts of even Legendary Pokemon, then Damon figured he was probably better off avoiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga continued.  \"Perhaps the most painful part to ask though, is that, if I should die, or am about to be put under the control of an evil human, I will transfer all my power to you, turning you into a new Dialga.  If that happens, you must abandon everything.  Your ambition to win the Pokemon League, your family, your friends, even the Pokemon you train must be given up so that you may keep the flow of time in this dimension steady.  For if time doesn't flow, then all the things you hold so dear will die.  This is the greatest burden of being my heir.  If you do not want this, I will understand.  Are you willing to accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was still amazed that he was even being offered this.  \"Dialga, may have some time to think about this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  You may take as long as you like.  But do not leave the island before giving me an answer.\"  Damon wandered from Dialga.  This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but if Dialga died, then he would have to give up everything that mattered to him in order to keep them all alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching the sunset, Damon made his decision.  He came back to the place Dialga had first appeared, and found the legendary dragon patiently waiting for him there.  \"Alright Dialga, I've made my decision.  I will be your heir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Dialga said.  \"Now what Pokemon would you like to be?\"</span></div></div>",

And who'd send me here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon sighed.  Things hadn't been the same for him since his little brother, Zach, had died one year ago.  He and Zach had been quite close, traveling and battling by each-others side, enjoying the beauty of the nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was no more thrill in battle, no more beauty in nature, and no more reason for Damon to keep going beyond simple biological impulses telling him to stay alive.  Damon constantly felt tired and lonely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ambled around the island, Damon saw an ornate tower in the center of the Island.  Figuring that the person who sent him the letter might be waiting there, Damon headed toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour's walk, Damon reached the tower.  Opening the door, he found an old friend of his, Curt, speaking with several dancers in Kimonos.  Curt turned around when he heard the door open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamon!\u201d  The young boy ran up and hugged his friend.  \u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it!  You\u2019re going to witness something almost nobody has ever seen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d  Damon asked, putting on a smile so that Curt wouldn\u2019t feel bad.  \u201cThis seems like an out of the way place to watch a dance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt laughed a little.  \u201cI think once you see it you\u2019ll see it\u2019s more than just a dance.\u201d  Suddenly, the boy\u2019s face became much more serious.  \u201cIn fact, I think it may bring you much more joy than you can imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon gave Curt an odd look.  \u201cWait, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurt, it is time.  We must head to the top of the tower.\u201d  One of the kimono girls said, before climbing the steps to the next floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later!\u201d  Curt shouted as he started up the same steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon dashed to follow them, but it was a long way up, and he started to get tired two thirds of the way.  Then, he faintly heard a strange melody coming from above.  Something about the song filled him with hope, and with a new energy.  He darted up to the top, where he saw Curt standing in front of an altar, as the kimono girls danced around him in the night air, and music seemed to be carried on the wind.  It was a strangely beautiful sight to behold, but it was nothing compared to what Damon saw next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt held up a feather, glowing in every color of the rainbow, and a light burst forth in the night.  It flew toward the tower, where it could be clearly seen.  A large, magnificent bird, twelve feet high, feathers in every color of the rainbow, landed on the altar in front of Curt, and let out a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt took off his hat and held it to his chest in a display of respect.  Then the child spoke quietly, \u201cHo-Oh, You say you want that you\u2019ve been watching me, and you respect me as a trainer.  That was why the kimono girls here sent me here to you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re granting me a request, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt\u2019s eyes gleamed.  He suddenly spoke with much more confidence.  \u201cThen Ho-Oh, I ask that you bring Damon\u2019s brother back to life!\u201d  Damon, the dancers, and even Ho-Oh seemed to take a few steps back in shock.  Ho-Oh shook it\u2019s feathers and made several noises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the kimono girls approached Curt.  \u201cHo-Oh, says that it is amazed by your generosity Curt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d  Curt asked.  \u201cDoes that mean it\u2019ll help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo-Oh shook its head.  \u201cSadly, even for Ho-Oh, the power to revive the dead is not easily invoked.\u201d  The kimono girl said.  \u201cBut there is one way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d  Curt asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Damon must find the Sacred Ash if you want to revive his brother.\u201d  The kimono girl said.  \u201cHowever, the Sacred Ash is currently\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It seemed silly to give him an expensive ticket to Legendary Island for nothing but a prank, but it was looking more and more like it was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Damon noticed something else in the envelope; a silver feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I have missed this?\"  He asked as he pulled it out.  Something about it seemed to comfort him, and bring back pleasant feelings from memories he couldn't quite recall.  As he looked it over, he saw that no matter what angle he held the feather, the sunlight would always reflect off of it in a certain direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd.\"  Damon mumbled.  Then a thought came to him.  \"Wait, maybe this light is like a compass.  If I follow it, I'll find whoever sent this to me.  If nothing else, it's better than running in circles like I've been doing all this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasing the light, Damon eventually reached a cave and entered it.  Unsurprisingly it was quite dark inside.  Before Damon was about to turn around to leave and get a light, the feather started to glow, lighting up a path in the cave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"  Damon gaped.  He saw a drawing on the cave wall, of the Mythical Pokemon Lugia, cradling a human in its wings.  Not sure what it meant, Damon continued deeper into the cave.  After wandering through the winding passages for some time, he found himself in a cavern with a large underground lake.  And in the center stood the gigantic Pokemon of legend, Lugia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people would've been terrified by the sheer sight of it, but upon seeing it, Damon found himself only able to think of one word as hidden memories surged into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD!\"  Damon shouted, diving into the water and swimming as fast as he could toward Lugia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast of the sea picked Damon up in his wings.  \"I'm sorry to have to have left you Damon, and hid your memories and form from you for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dad!\"  Damon assured him.  \"I'm just happy to be back at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, the danger is over now.

While it hadn't happened often, it wasn't unheard of for desperate wild Pokemon to sleep next to humans during the night, in effort to stay warm.  Damon cautiously turned to look at the Pokemon.  It was fairly large, and covered in red and white feathers, with a little blue triangle on its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt very nervous about being so close to such a big Pokemon, and tried to scoot out of his sleeping bag without waking the Pokemon up.  His efforts were for naught though, as the Pokemon's large, amber eyes fluttered open.  The creature suddenly jumped Damon, hugging him in its claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Damon!\"  The young boy heard a voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who's there?

I've wanted to meet you for so long, Damon.\"  Latias kissed Damon on the lips, to his disgust.  \"Huh... I though you humans liked getting kisses from the opposite sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From other humans, not Pokemon.\"  Damon wiped his mouth.  \"And besides, why would a Pokemon want to talk to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me from a trainer.\"  Latias smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Latias over again, Damon saw that she did look like a Pokemon he vaguely remembered seeing before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeroy was having a fine day as the new Pokemon League Champion.  He never realized how many fine privileges Champs were allowed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong these privileges was a radar that tracked the movements of a number of rare Pokemon across Kanto and Johto.  Currently, it was set to find a psychic dragon called Latias.  And according to the radar, it was in the tall grass, just a few feet away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped into the foliage.  Sure enough, he could see the mythical Latias.  It hadn't seen him yet, so Leroy decided to seize the moment and reached fore his Master Ball.  But before he could throw it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIING!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeroy's Pokegear went off, alerting Latias to Leroy's presence.  It quickly flew off as the one who caused the Pokegear to ring spoke through it. \"Hey Leroy, this is Damon.  Me and my Zubat almost caught a Rattata, but it got away at the last second.  Anyway, I'll talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeroy quickly grabbed his Pokegear and snapped a picture of the fleeing Latias.  He then rang in Damon's number.  \"Hey Damon....\"  Leroy said through gritted teeth.  \"Yes yes, I know about the oh so 'tragic' loss of your Rattata, but look what your poor timing lost me!\"  Leroy hit a few buttons on his Pokegear, sending the photo of Latias to Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an embarrassing day that was...\"  Damon mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a thank you for that, I'd like to reward you, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon's eyes widened.  \"Really?\"  He asked, imagining all the amazing things he might receive.  \"What kind of reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to turn you into a nice, strong, handsome Latios...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Damon's response to this proposition?</span></div></div>",

For a pokemon's pussy that's so old, she tastes like the sweetest Nanab berry ever grown inside. Heck, more like she makes Nanab juice during her heat sessions. \"Hungry Damon?

Drink, suck, eat and chew me out until you're well fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she wrapped my face with her clothed wings of sorts and wrapped her legs at my neck, I'm face to face, I'm all alone with her vagina ready for my  stomach. I licked everything inside her. My mouth didn't let go as I inhale her beautiful scent. I continue this for a bit but I went daring. With my little fangs, I dived a bit deeper to my meal and bite her flesh. I can hear loud moaning outside as she makes more juices for me to drink plus her meat is tasty. For a steel type like her, she's edibly soft yet not very puncturable to my small fangs. during my tasty feast, I bit each side of her lip just hard enough that I could see a small bite mark. I went with the left lip and mark her before she came at my mouth. It happened the same way I did to the right lip of her pussy. Gladly the results are same when I did it the same to the lower and upper part of her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jirachi. I'm full already.\" finally, with some energy from her cum, she lifted her taters. Seeing her deep red blushing face makes me feel hard. I placed myself on top of her as she lays down this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has ever mated with me before Damon. Wanna be the first to mate with me to the fullest?\" I just couldn't agree more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give her immediately a passionate kiss while she wraps her legs and pussy at my hips and dick as she rubs me off and get hard. But I had other hings to play with her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down for a bit milady. Open it wide for me.\" my voice may not be so seducing since I sound more like a cutie this time. but using my bare hands and fingers, I stretched her pussy open. Hearing her gasp is charming. Though I wanted to stretch it up more. So stretch it up I did until I can't stretch much further. Probably as wide as her round feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I plug my tool inside her already. We just went on rutting out each other while we go on with our kisses. The more I rut her, I can feel not only her tightness but I feel getting closer to the treasure spot I want to hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHH! AAAAHHHHH! That's ... where you want it?\" I took a moment of break though. Gotta prep up and not make it too rough on our firs time. Don't wanna have a bumpy relationship later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha Jirachi my girl. Your lovely womb. So cozy for my tool. With your vagina massaging me, you are only making me relaxed and energized.\" I didn't abstain my pleasure ride and go hard and deep inside her small pussy again. \"For me, a small one is better for me. So ... ugh ... I'd make sue that my seed stays inside my cutie's womb. that's where my penis comes in. Prevent my seed from getting out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ... ohhhh .... ahhhh ...... making my womb ... drink all of your seed --- ohh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. i'll be fertilizing ALL OF OUR KIDS cutie, if that is even possible. If not possible, we can always use each other lovingly to release our heat. Perhaps ... ahhhh... every night?\" Oh I'll be glad with either result. Especially the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my vagina and womb Damon. Its all yours to play with.\" she's so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one deep kiss. I got one goal in mind. True loving mating. My hips just went a blur as I slam with even more power. Since her cervix and womb are now wide open, it obeyed to my commands to tighten themselves around me. I find it less disturbing that our smacking hips sounds like they could crack the more we pound at each other's hips. Both of us did not bother holding out.. WE just want to release it. WE just kept cumming non stop before we pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how much did I fill her up? More than her womb's capacity. Hooray. I don't mind if I sleep with my penis inside my one Jirachi's vaginal womb every night.</span></div></div>",

Damon could feel the molecules in his very body respond to the light, wanting to change. Damon was frightened out of his mind, but all he could think about was Keldeo. He was worried that whatever was happening would hurt the Legendary Pokemon. \"Keldeo! What's happening? Are you alright?\" Damon yelled. Blind from the light, Damon took a step toward where he thought the Pokemon was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, Human.\" The Keldeo yelled back. \"But you must leave, something is wrong with that pendent!\" For some odd reason, he felt scared for the boy. He didn't want any harm to come of Damon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon followed the sound of the Keldeo's voice. He took one more step, but found a loose rock. Damon tripped and, literately, fell into the Keldeo. Their molecules shifted and merged, joining the two together. For a brief moment, Damon and the Keldeo were simply a blob of confused molecules, not knowing wether to be human or pokemon. But then, the amulet's light started to give this blob form. In a matter of seconds the blob partially re-took the form of an unconsious Keldeo again. However, this Keldeo was unique and not like any other in existence. And just as abruptly as the light had started, it ended, leaving the transformation complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Damon blinked his eyes open. \"Keldeo... Keldeo, are you alright?\" Damon asked, his voice parched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think We are alright.\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon, confused, eyed the Keldeo. \"What are you...\" Damon then looked down at what he thought was his body, except it wasn't his human body. It was the body of a Keldeo. \"I-I'm like you... a Keldeo!\" You were excited. Being a Pokemon was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not quite. The two of us are a single Keldeo. Apparently, the amulet transformed you into one of my kind and merged us together.\" The Keldeo responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon didn't quite believe him until he noticed that the Keldeo's head was in fact attached to the same body as himself. You and the Keldeo were now one.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Keep focusing our energies together, as one.\" the Keldeo said confidently. \"Focus that energy at the tips of our horns!\" The two of them had their heads pointed slightly inwards, towards each other, and a giant blue ball of energy started to materialize infront of them. \"Now fire!\" Damon yelled excitedly. Together, they fired Focus Blast into the side of a small hill. Their attack completely decimated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yeah!\" Damon cheered. He tried to push off the ground and throw his front leg into the air. Keldeo was used to his other half's celebration tendencies and jumped with him so they wouldn't fall over. \"We are totally awesome!\" Damon cheered again as their feet touched the ground. \"Yes We are.\" the Keldeo agreed. \"It is amazing just how much more powerful we are now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been practicing for about an hour, working on each individual attack. \"Now, it is time to practice the last one we know... Sacred Sword!\" the Keldeo said, unable to hide his enthusiasm. \"Since all of our other attacks were now powerful, I cannot wait to see us in action for this one.\" the Keldeo then motioned with his head for them to turn around. By now, they had gotten better at walking and moving, but it was still a chore. Even though their attacks were incredibly powerful, a silent agreement had fallen between them. If they didn't master walking and just moving around as a team then every battle would end in their defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacred Sword! Yes!\" Damon said as they slowly walked towards the outskirts of a small forrest. \"the Keldeo then pointed with his horn at one of the very similar looking trees. \"You see that one, we should charge at it and strike together with our own Sacred Swords. I'll take the first step, and then you follow.\" Damon nodded. \"Okay, lets do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacred Sword!\" they both yelled together. One long and dazzling white sword appeared out of each of their heads, and then they were charging. They rushed forward, unsteady at first since this was the first time they ran together. They, however, quickly picked up an effective and steady system, but then the problem started. They each started to tug their body in the opposite direction, thinking of different trees to target. \"What are you doing Damon. The tree is over here!\" the Keldeo yelled. \"No, you said it was this one over here.\" Damon yelled back. As the two struggled to pull their other half in their direction, they continued to run forward and ran smack into a tree. They hit the tree at full force right between their heads, which then slammed their heads against the sides of the tree. Falling backwards onto their back, neither went unconscious, but slamming into the tree had severely bruised them and knocked the wind out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several long moments, neither said a word. They only struggled, against each other, to get air back into their shared lungs. Once enough air was back in their lungs, the angry glares and shouts began. \"What were you thinking!\" the Keldeo exclaimed. \"It was that tree.\" he made a half hearted attempt to point it out, but then continue to glare daggers at his other half. \"What tree?! They all look the same!\" Damon screamed back. \"Besides, you pointed to that one.\" Damon copied the Keldeo's attempt at pointing out the tree he thought they were targeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keldeo growled, \"Never mind about the tree. We're going to try this again.\" He tried to stand up, but Damon refused to move. \"No, we're staying right here to rest a bit more.\" The arguing continued back and forth until it finally ended up into a full on brawl. Their body tossed and turned, their heads struck at each other's, and they each tried to pull apart from their other half.</span></div></div>",

They had developed a strong friendship and trust for one another, but they made no progress on finding the connection between themselves and the gem. Keldeo made the suggestion of leaving the island and traveling to the Unova region. The gold marking that encased the gem were from an ancient civilization in the Unova region, but Keldeo was unsure of the location specifically. So now, the two were running across the ocean, making their way to Undella Bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip over had been very quiet thus far. Both were lost in their own thoughts, the only thing they didn't share now. Even though they had a strong bond of friendship now and even enjoyed being merged, being stuck together for every minute of ever day had many difficulties. They never had a giant fight, like the one Virzion had broken up, but they still had minor problems and arguments to solve. Finally, Damon spoke, \"Hey, Keldeo...\" His body partner turned to look at him, \"Yes Damon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we'll ever... become separated again? I mean, don't get me wrong. I think being a Keldeo with you is awesome, but...\" Keldeo gave him a reassuring smile. \"No, I know how you feel. I feel the same way about our situation. I do enjoy your company, but sharing a body like this can be... a pain... but also a lot of fun. Whatever happens we'll---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge blast of water shot out from right underneath them. It was painful, and shot them high into the air. They landed, unsteadily back on the water. Keldeo's back leg was hurt the most. From where they were before, their attacker, a Wailord, rose to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhhh! What an unusually find.\" shouted a women from above. She seemed to be flying on hovering platform. It was technology that neither Keldeo or Damon had seen before. She had lush, wavy purple hair and was dressed all in black with an unusual shield symbol on here left arm. \"A two-headed Keldeo. How strange?\" Damon and Keldeo glared at the women. \"And how easy it will be to capture you. Wailord, my sweet, destroy them with Brine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wailord tilted its head forward, pointing its blowhole at Damon and Keldeo. A powerful stream was water shot out which Damon and Keldeo narrowly dodged. Keldeo's hurt leg was slowing them down, but they managed to counter attack with Focus Blast. The Wailord was pushed back a small distance and now looked very angry. \"Wailord use Bounce.\" Following the order, the Wailord quickly made a shallow dive, and surprisingly shot itself hight into the air. It made an incredible flip and was about to slam head first into the duo. However after a quick exchange, Damon and Keldeo jumped up and to the side, avoiding the attack and setting them up to finish Wailord with a powerful and synchronized Close Combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady was so awestruck that she did not have time to stop Damon and Keldeo as they bounded off in the direction of their destination. Keldeo had wanted to stay and finish off the mysterious lady, but Damon was worried about Keldeo's leg. He wanted to make sure that his other half was okay before they got into more trouble. As they dashed away, neither noticed the large underwater station surface. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am Juweel, the artificial spirit of the gem you wore around your necks. It was my duty to transform you into your true forms and lead you to this room where your true past memories are stored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Damon asked, very confused. He and the Keldeo glanced at each other and then back at the spirit. \"What do you mean by true forms? Our true form is a two-headed Keldeo.\" Keldeo also asked, \"And what do you mean about our 'true past memories'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit smiled sadly. \"Let me explain the whole story first.\" She brushed her transparent hair out from her eyes and began again. \"Hundreds of years ago, all of the lands were united. All Pokemon and Humans lived in harmony in this golden age. However, an evil force came into being and threatened to destroy the world. Both of you, powerful Keldeo warriors, lead the largest army of Pokemon and Humans and managed to defeat the evil and seal it away. Unfortunately, he would not remain sealed forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was explaining, many of the orbs had joined together to form a giant video orb of sorts. Images from the past flashed by as the spirit explained. \"The six lands of the world would again be in jeopardy. With their collective wisdom, the six rulers knew that by the time the evil arose again, most if not all of the world would have forgotten it. No one would be able to stop the evil, and the world would be destroyed. The six rulers asked for volunteers willing to give up the life they had in the united land, so they may fight against the evil far in the future. Only the two of you accepted. So, using their collective power, the six rulers sealed the two of you away, in two parts. Lex or Damon as you are now called, your and soul and body were stored in the Hoen land. Ius, your soul and body was stored in the Sinnoh land. Both of you memories were stored here, in the Unova land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that doesn't make any sense. I was born a human. If I was originally a Keldeo...\" Damon argued. The spirit shook her head. \"No, you were a Keldeo. But, the evil broke free sooner than was predicted. It corrupted the place where your body and soul were stored. When the time came, you reappeared into the human boy you were before. It corrupted you with false memories of being a human. I enlisted the help of Cobalion, Virzion, and Terrakion to help guide you two to meet. So that I could restore you, Lex, to your original form and then lead both of you to here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that obviously did not go as planned either.\" Keldeo, or Ius, responded. \"You didn't do a good job of returning him to his true form. Just look at us.\" The spirit looked a little offended, and quickly retorted, \"I had little choice in the matter. The evil had me in its possession for quite some time. He drew much of my power away. I escaped, thanks to Virzion, and tried to complete my sacred charge. Unfortunately, I did not realize how much the evil took. By the time I started to transform Lex back into a Keldeo, I realized that I did not have the strength to complete it. Lex would have died mid way through. So, I did the next best thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight, so you did the next best thing. Fine. So, now that we are here at our... memory vault... thing. Give us our past memories and finish the transformation so we can kick some evil butt.\" Damon said with a happy smile on his face. The spirit shook her head again. \"I am sorry, Lex. I cannot finish the transformation, nor can I fully restore your memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Both Damon and the Keldeo exclaimed. \"The vault was damaged.\" the spirit pointed to the large crack in the wall that neither had notice till now. \"Your memories are gone, and there is not enough power for me to separate you.\"</span></div></div>",

Are you sure the two of you are up to it?\" Juwel said to them both. \"Of course now that we know what our connection is\" Damon said. \"Were determine to go on this journey so me and Damon could be two separate Keldeo's\" The Keldeo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I wish you two luck then\" Juwel replied as she heads back into the pendent.

The two drop to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could help you two out. It looks like you might need my help\" Damon and the Keldeo looks around. \"Who said that? Who's there?\" said Damon. \"That voice.

Terrakion had a lead on the location of where the evil force had hidden their memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of there newly separated bodies, Damon convinced Keldeo to go on ahead to Black City. Damon needed to visit Twinleaf Town, the home town of his human memories, before going to Black City. Keldeo understood. They planed to meet up in Black City within one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, Keldeo was crossing the ocean again. The Unova region coastline was within sight when a powerful electrical blast was fired through him. The electricity flowed through his body, paralyzing him. \"HAHAHAHAHAHA! I knew you would be back this way. I will catch you now!\" A familiar voice gleefully cried. A cloaked hovering platform materialized into view with the same trainer from before and a Starmie floating beside her. Keldeo just glared at her, temporarily unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer then seemed to get a good look at Keldeo and was taken aback. \"Wait a minute! How... did...? I know you are the same Keldeo from before. The scar on your leg is proof, but... Where is your other head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeldeo, gaining control of his body again, took advantage of her shock and fired a Focus Blast at her. Starme, however, easily overpowered the Focus Blast with another Thunder attack.

I was looking for a challenge.\" Keldeo tried to move, but the paralysis held his body. \"Well either way, a used-to-be two-headed Keldeo is still worth studying. Maybe the scientists of Team Shade can find out what happened to you.\" The women pressed a few buttons on the control panel of the platform. Two orbs shot out from the underside of the platform and hovered on the right and left side of Keldeo.

Instead, he tried to block it with a powerful Hydro Pump. However when the attacks met in midair, the Fire Blast was far stronger. The heat from the fire boiled the water, and the two attacks combined for a devastating effect on Damon. He was pushed into the side of a rock, where he crumbled to the ground from his burns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost consciousness momentarily. When he woke, the pain from the wounds were mostly gone. He examined his body to find his burns covered in a past like substance. \"Its a blend of Iapapa, Rawst, Kuo berries.\" Entei said.

Then we will head off again towards the safe zone that the other legendaries have created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon just dropped his head between his front legs, but agreed to continue with Entei.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the Swords of Justices split up, it was not long before Cobalion picked up on Damion and Keldeo's trails, or trail. He found signs of a struggle, where the two seemed to be fighting. Cobalion pieced together that the fight was short. One of the two broke it off and tried to escape. But that Pokemon was injured. Spots of dried blood followed the same path as the foot prints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion bent forward to smell the blood, \"Damon.\" he stated allowed. He turned his head back and forth to take in the entire scene. His closed his eyes and imagined what the battle looked like. \"Why would Keldeo attack Damon?\" Opening his eyes again, he followed the two trails of footprints, Keldeo was obviously chasing Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon had enough strength to run for awhile, Cobalion noticed. But inevitably, Keldeo caught him. Another struggle, far shorter, and then... \"Curious?\" he commented. The two distinct tracks became one set. It was as if one of them just disappeared. \"Was Damon defeated and drug away?... No, there isn't a sign that he collapsed, let alone any dragging signs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Keldeo have help?\" He looked up at the forrest roof. \"No... its too dense for a flying type swoop in and carry Damon.\" He looked around the spot, and determined that there was no one else there. \"What happened here? Even the drops of blood from Damon's wound stop.\" He put his questions aside and dashed after the one set of tracks. He didn't want to loose who ever these were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was slowly setting as he followed the tracks. If he didn't find whoever these were soon, he would not be able to continue until sunrise. Luck was on his side though. The tracks were getting fresher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few more minutes he came to a clearing next to a refreshing lake. Despite the quickly diminishing light, he could see Keldeo, or Damon, drinking from the lake, he still wasn't sure whose tracks he was following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed in the shadow of the forrest line so the Keldeo wouldn't be able to see him. As he focused on the Keldeo drinking, he was surprised to see that there was actually two of them. Damon and Keldeo were drinking from the lake. The light from the rising crescent moon helped a bit. The light cleared showed to distinct heads drinking. \"Why would Damon go with Keldeo, and where were his tracks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion decided to show himself. He stepped out from his hiding spot and calmly walked to the two Keldeos. His hooves lightly crushed the leaves and grass underneath them. This drew the attention of both Keldeo and Damon. However, Cobalion did not know who was more surprised, them or him. When they turned to face him, it was suddenly clear why there was only one set of tracks. \"Damon... Keldeo... What happened? Why are you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we want to be.\" Keldeo and Damon spoke as one. It was unnerving. Something was very off about them both. \"We are powerful as one. More powerful then you.\" The both grinned devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion decided to change the subject. \"Damon, where are you to heading? We have all been looking for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot surprising, Damon and Keldeo spoke as one again. \"We--I am heading back to see our--my masters. They are in need of us--me.\" Their tone was changing, becoming singular. They were becoming single minded now. \"They are in need of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back.. back to where? No, back to the human base. To those monsters?\" Cobalion was astonished. Something had clearly gone wrong. Whatever those evil humans did to Keldeo now effected them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try and stop me, Cobalion.\" Damon and Keldeo spit out his name in disgrace. \"I will end you if you follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot let the two of you leave. You don't know what you are doing?\" Cobalion tried to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't know what you are doing.\" The single-minded Keldeos spat before lunging at Cobalion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stared at each other for a long moment, before Terrakion dropped his gaze. A sure sign that Cobalion had convinced him, at least for now, not to barge in. Cobalion then turned his focus back to the room where the joined Keldeo's were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurveying the room, he counted a total of four humans. All of them wore white coats, meaning they were all researchers, not fighters. The three of them could take them out easily before an alarm was wrung, but the real issue was Keldeo and Damon. How on earth were they going to free them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could break the joined Keldeos out, but they would still be under control of some hidden machine. And to add further issues, both Cobalion and Virizion knew that if whatever was controlling the two Keldeos was not stopped soon, then both of them would be lost forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion sighed heavily. It was a no win situation. Or it was until Pok\u00e9 luck was on their side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you geeky-brains think you are doing?\" a lady in a dark suit and wavy purple hair walked into the room. All of the scientists squirmed as they say her walk in. She obviously held much authority. \"What have you been doing to my lovely prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh--Madam Veronica... we didn't expect to see you.\" a scientist nervously said. \"We were just about to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it!\" Veronica glared the scientist down. \"I know you Gerald. You were planning all sorts of horrible experimentation on this rare specimen. But I will not have my prize Keldeos tortured by the likes of you.\" The cowardly scientist dropped his gaze and looked at his feet. Veronica walked over to Damon and Keldeo. She gingerly messaged their heads. \"Its okay, mommy is here to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and Keldeo both looked up instantly with the same lifeless stare. They were like robots. Veronica quickly turned back to the scientist, Gerald. \"What have to done to my Keldeos?\" She screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This-this was the only... way to-to control them. We had to implant the device into the one we had so we could...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it still in them then. You were supposed to remove it.\" Veronica glared daggers at him. \"I know that the device does to the minds of Pokemon. I will not have my prize be brain dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but then the Pokemon might attack. We can't control--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about controlling them. That is my area of expertise. Now remove the device, and inform me the moment it is done. I will be taking my prize back with me.\" Veronica then turned on her heels and headed for the door. Stopping in the door frame, she turned slightly to address the coward. \"Oh and Gerald. I wouldn't try any more funny business if I were you. Many of my other prizes are quite hungry.\" With that, she continued on. The room remained silent for a long moment before Gerald quickly exclaimed in a very scared and higher pitched voice for his assistance to prepare the Keldeos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swords stood in their hiding spot stunned at what had occurred, but pleased that at least one solution to their problem was being solved. They would just have to wait a little longer, and they would be able to rescue the Keldeos once the mind-controlling device was removed. The only thing that worried Cobalion was the woman, Veronica. She seemed especially dangerous. They would have to get the Keldeos out of there without crossing paths with her.<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the procedure to the remove the device had been completed. The joined Keldeos had been drugged so as not to wake and cause trouble. Thats when Cobalion ordered the swords to start his rescue plan. They silently took down the few scientists still in the room. Cobalion and Vizirion helped the Keldeos onto Terrakion's back, and quickly made their escape. Thankfully, they did not run into the woman Veronnica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a long distance away from the base, the Swords stopped to rest. Vizirion volunteered to watch the Keldeos while the other two search for food.</span></div></div>",

It was the same woman that they had seen in the base. She wore a skin tight, black shirt with a dark trench coat that touch her ankles. Four pokeballs were strapped to her belt, with a dangerous looking whip at her side. In her left hand was the Azure Flute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirked when the swords walked into her view. \"You three... are going to try and keep me from my prize.\" She placed her free hand to her lips, faking an attempt to hide her giggles. \"You're hardly worth my time... and you're defiantly not worth my gorgeous Pokemon's time. I hate doing the dirty work, but I don't want you do bore my precious dears.\" While she spoke she slipped the flute into her jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrakion took his chance. Cobalion yelled at him to stop, but it was too late. He sprinted towards Veronica, his sacred sword appeared in front of him. But long before he could reach the woman, Veronica unleashed her whip, wrapping it around his front foot. He tripped and imbedded his sacred sword into the ground before it disappeared. Veronica then slash left and right with her whip. Terrakion barely got to his feet before he collapsed, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip was far more than what it seemed. Terrakion collapsed, unable to get his feet underneath him. His muscles were weak, useless. Virizion and Cobalion were stunned. Veronica stared down the remaining two Swords. \"Don't worry, your brethren will be fine. I wouldn't dare kill a pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobalion looked towards Virizion, \"How did she take down Terrakion so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Virizion could respond, Veronica answered. \"My whip is specially made, by me. You only need to know that it is... a bane, to all Pokemon.\" The swords didn't know what astonished them more, the information she gave them, or the fact that she understood them. Before they could react, Veronica charged swept her whip in front of her, slicing both Virizion and Cobalion across their chests. Cobalion then dodge right, to avoid another attack. Virizion was not so lucky. A few more hits from the whip and she too fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from that one hit, Cobalion could feel himself weakening. But he could not back down now. He charged Veronica. She slashed with her whip, and he dodged it. Now within close range, he unleashed his sacred sword. He slashed wide and low, but Veronica easily jumped over the blade and struck him with her whip. Again and again she hit, until he finally fell. She smirked, \"Well that was somewhat fun! Sorry for having to do that dears, but you were in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica continued on to the next room, where she found Arceus, Damon, and Keldeo. Bathed in a white light, she thought that she was too late. But upon closer inspection, it became clear that the two Keldeos were still joined. \"Well hello my dears.\" She greeted them in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked up from what he was doing, ending the light. He was honestly surprised to see the woman. \"Hmmmh... I doubted your ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica shook her head, \"No great Arceus... you doubted the abilities of the Swords of Justice. But... how could you not. I am just one insignificant human after all.\" No one made a sound for a moment. She took the opportunity to glance around the magnificent room in Arceus's domain. \"I am sure you know why I am here. I would like my Pokemon back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not yours!\" Damon spat at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are quite wrong there. You will come to love being with me, but we can let this argument slide for now.\" She turned his attention towards Arceus. \"Now, I do believe you have a choice to make Lord Arceus. You can let me walk out of here with my Keldeos, or you can try and stop me. With your power, I am sure that my team and I will have our hands full fighting you.\" She lightly tapped the pokeballs at her side. \"We would most likely loose to one as powerful as you. And, I hope you don't choose to fight because, well, I would not want to. I am a realistic woman. I would not want any harm to come to ONE of the most powerful Pokemon in existence. The world might not recover if you were hurt and could not perform your duties. So... I have devised a trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica slid the sleeve of her coat up her arm to reveal a computer pad. She pressed a few buttons and pointed her wrist at the ground in front of her. Two small projectors flew from her wrist into the ground. As soon as they stuck, they formed a holographic image. It showed Palkia and Giratina trapped somewhere by two glowing orbs. \"So...\" Veronica continued. \"A trade. Two of your most powerful servants for my two Keldeos.\"</span></div></div>",
