A furry is a humanoid animal, and a demi is, in laments terms, a \"catgirl,\" however replace \"cat\" with any animal you see fit, and \"girl\" with the appropriate gender for the character.  Gender switching is not permitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore in this story will always result in weight gain, and a lot of it.  The amount of weight you would think one would gain by eating another being fully, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may type his name as either JP or Junpei, it doesn't really matter to be honest, whichever you prefer is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGift points are given for additions/reviews, so please,  don't be afraid to add as much as you wish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe author of this story would gladly set up a system with anyone who wishes to do so where he writes a chapter for their story in return for an addition to this one.

Yawning, he stretched his arms up in the air, his jumpsuit-like clothing creaking ominously in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past several weeks, he and the other Digidestined hadn't had to deal with too much trouble, save the occasional rowdy troublemaker. As such, they rested much more often, relaxed far more, and, in JP's case, ate much more. In fact, the area they were currently sleeping in had been their campsite of choice for the past week or so. It was large, but not imposingly so, grassy, and above all, peaceful. Further sweetening the deal were several fruit trees less than a mile from the clearing, each bearing delicious fruit and, in a few cases, even meat apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP, letting his hunger overtake him, had fully indulged in these tasty treats, brushing off the occasional questioning looks his friends sent him. This had, of course, taken a toll on his body, and several weeks later, his clothes were straining dangerously, his cheeks were fuller, and he had an evident double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, JP wasn't hungry for more fruit, even if it did taste like meat. No, he wanted something different, more satisfying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about what to eat, his eyes happened to wander to the group's youngest member, Tommy. He was curled up, a peaceful expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP started as thoughts began to enter his head. No, he couldn't possibly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, this was the Digital World; Tommy would probably come out fine later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP grinned. It was decided: he was going to fatten Tommy up, and eat the boy whole when he was at a satisfactory size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Yawning, he slowly sat up, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, JP?\" he mumbled, a bit irritated at the awakening. \"I wanna sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" JP apologized. Immediately, he set his plan into motion. \"Ya hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy thought about it for a few seconds, still groggy. He was pushed into wakefulness by his growling stomach. \"Yeah, actually.\" Looking up at the older boy, he smiled. \"Can we eat at the fruit trees?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP smiled, glad that his plan was working. \"Sure!\" Helping Tommy up, they set off, leaving the other three members of their group still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, they had reached their destination. Looking up at the trees, Tommy's expression became one of delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, JP, I just realized: I'm REALLY hungry! Thanks for taking me here!\" Immediately, the younger boy began picking as many fruits as he could, eventually amassing them in a sizable pile. As Tommy picked up a meat apple, he glanced at JP. \"You want any, JP?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP shrugged. \"Nah, I'm not really hungry this morning,\" he lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shot him a questioning look. \"Ok, if you say so...\" With those words, Tommy turned to the pile. Eyes gleaming, he set upon it, eagerly munching on the assorted fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy worked through the large pile, JP watched, pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's it, Tommy,' he thought, a bit more eagerly than he would have liked, 'eat, let that belly get big, yeah...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Tommy finished. Falling back onto the ground, he sighed. \"Oh, wow, I'm stuffed...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look of his stomach, JP was convinced; it had grown to the point where the young boy's white shirt had been greatly stretched. Tommy's enlarged gut peeked out from underneath his shirt, just enough to expose the belly button underneath. The large belly was straining against his pants, threatening to give at any moment. Noticing this, Tommy sat up and unbuttoned his pants, allowing his stomach to expand to its full size and allowing even more of the lower part of his belly to show. Tommy sighed in relief, and laid back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, JP, I'm gonna go back to sleep here; is that okay?\" he asked, stomach gurgling as it began to digest the vast amount of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP had to keep himself from chuckling; this was going even better than he thought! \"Sure, Tommy, I'll wait here with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Tommy mumbled in a low voice, already beginning to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boy was fully asleep, though, JP began to reconsider; should he eat Tommy now, while he's vulnerable, or fatten him up a bit more?</span></div></div>",

He'll make a nice first course.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe advanced on the boy. Grabbing his sides gently, JP lifted him up, and opened his mouth as wide as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began bringing the boy closer to his eager maw. He was halfway there when Tommy stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...JP?\" he mumbled groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP briefly panicked, before realizing there was only one possible course of action now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth even further, and, with great difficulty, inserted Tommy's head, which began to emit protesting screams and cries. JP swallowed, and Tommy's head slid down a bit further. Ignoring the cries and calls for help, JP continued swallowing. Bit by bit, Tommy slid further down JP's waiting gullet. First the rest of his head, then his chest, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP gasped as he reached Tommy's newly engorged belly. It tasted heavenly, but he wasn't sure if he could fit it past his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, through much swallowing and jaw stretching, JP finally managed to swallow the large protrusion. From there, it was a simple matter to swallow his lower body and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen JP finished, his stomach bulged outwards, finally ripping through his clothes and exposing itself for all the world to see. Sighing, JP sat down, happily patting his full belly. As the screams began to die down, JP's eyes wandered thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see,' he thought, 'Who's next?'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

JP rested in the other tree, while Takuya ate the fruit. 30 minutes later, Takuya laid down with his large gut. JP took this opprutunity and then lifted him.

JP was at first indecisive. after a while though, his stomach took the better of him. he thought it be better to just choose both of them rather than having to make a long decision. So he decided to carry both of them to the same garden of orchards he found and rested each of their bodies there. He sprinkled a little water on their faces and then ran off to the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprinkle of water caused both Zoe and Choji to be awaken from their slumber. They did not now what hit them. \"Ugh, what just hit me?\" asked Choji. \"I don't know, but look where we are right now\"' said Zoe. They looked around the garden of fruit with mystery, as they have no idea how they got there. \"Let me see if the fruit is safe\"' said Zoe. She took a teeny bity bite of one of the fruit, and said, \"Hallelujah!\" \"What got into ya?\" asked Choji. But Zoe was now on a feeding frenzy and she did not care. Curious, Choji decided to take a very small bite. Then, he soon screamed, \"Yappy dido da!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes have passed by and Zoe and Choji have returned to their slumbers with big, stuffed guys. JP, who has been seeing this from the bushes, knew it was an opportune time to get the bait. He first chose Choji and carried it into a bush farther from where Zoe slept so there would be total silence. JP held up Choji's body up high and began to eat him from the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Choji's head hit JP's mouth, he began screaming for any help. His cries were minimal and barely woke up Zoe. Soon, JP managed to swallow his entire body despite difficulty at the gut. Soon, he spit out his clothes and folded them into a neat pile by his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he grabbed Zoe by her shoes and pulled her to the bush closer to her. Like for everyone else, he started eating her starting from the head. Everything went as well from the devious victim, including putting the shoes and clothes aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Bokomon and Neemon were left in the wild. Like JP, they have gotten way chubbier due to their feasting on more food. JP knew they were already stuffed, but it would be even better when they are way more stuffed. So he picked both of them up and carried them to the same garden of fruit. Both Digimon soon woke up and looked around the garden of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they began to devour almost every fruit around the radius of 3 meters. 30 minutes later. They were as plumped as pigs. Their belly radii rivaled those of the other children except JP. Soon, JP took the opportunity and devoured them. Using his big, stretchy mouth, he put both of their heads first into the mouth. They made cries for help but their efforts were futile. It did not take long despite their waists to consume them. Soon, JP has finished his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he soon collected the Digivices of Choji and Zoe and transferred the spirits to his Digivice. JP soon gathered the clothes of his former companions and soon realized his clothes were also torn.</span></div></div>",

By then, he would be back to his slim self, albeit with a thin layer of new fat added to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thought struck JP: if he could feed Tommy like this over the course of a few days, he'd get bigger, and bigger, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP stopped when he realized he was panting, the idea of the prospective meal getting him incredibly excited. He'd need to be more careful about his cravings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, confident that the plan would work, JP smiled. He was going to eat good, very soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to wait with Tommy, JP sat down, plucking a meat apple just for the heck of it. Within seconds, it was completely devoured. It had been a sizable apple, but did nothing to sate JP's hunger, once again affirming his newfound craving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonchalantly throwing the apple core over his shoulder, JP once again looked at Tommy...or more specifically, Tommy's food-engorged stomach. He licked his lips. Soon, Tommy himself would be much, much bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Tommy woke up, his stomach having gone to back to relative normalcy, as JP had suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did JP do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was small, but bustling, with Digimon going about their daily lives, conversing with neighbors, or just having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more, there seemed to be no shortage of restaurants; there was one on at least every corner, interspersed between lines of buildings, or even taking up a whole area of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one that drew JP's attention, though, was the buffet. It was large, appeared decent, and had the words ALL YOU CAN EAT emblazoned towards the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, of course, did not fail to notice this. \"Wow, a buffet?! I haven't been to one since we came to the Digital World!\" He turned to JP. \"Hey JP, can we go here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP grinned; everything was going as planned. \"Why not? Seems like a good place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something occured to him. \"Oh, wait. We don't have any money. Darn it...\" his own face fell at the prospect that Tommy might not get as big as he wanted him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, understandably, looked upset as well, until he noticed something. \"Hey, JP, look at that!\" He pointed to the small letters underneath the All you Can Eat sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP, now curious and hopeful, squinted. The words read: \"Will give free food for dish duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP smiled; there was hope after all! \"Sounds like a lucky break, huh, buddy?\" Laughing, he clapped Tommy on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy stumbled; there had been an unusually large amount of force behind that hand. \"But JP, what about the dishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJP chuckled. \"Don't worry about it, Tommy. I'll do the dishes; you just stuff yoursel-I mean, get yourself some lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy blinked in confusion, but still smiled. \"Thanks a lot, JP!\" Then, without further ado, he ran towards the buffet, JP following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got inside...</span></div></div>",
