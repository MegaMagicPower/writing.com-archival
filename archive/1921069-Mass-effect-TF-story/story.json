As when news arrived of the death of the Matriarch he split production between the Genophage \"cure\", studies into indoctrination and a machine to bring back Benezia. When the two finally met once more Saren tried to persuade Shepard to join him with little success. So he decided to use the machine on Shepard. Sure it wasn't exactly meant for Shepard but he had no choice. He was tired of fighting him and just wanted Shepard and the Normandy to help him both in finding the conduit and keeping sovereign from completely controlling him. Saren pressed a button and a tube rose from the ground completely surrounding a now confused Commander. A strange syrupy gloop began rising slowly encasing the Spectre's body in it. After half an hour the tube descended back into the ground followed by the gloop. Standing in Shepard's place was the image of matriarch wearing loose fitting N7 armour with Joker and Ashley speaking frantically into the commlink wanting to know if he was okay and that the bomb was almost ready. When Shepard finally came to his senses Kaidan and Liara rushed up to him asking if he was alright. Was he?</span></div></div>",

Once this was done his skin became softer, and his hands and feet became smaller and more feminine, while his muscle mass decreased. His hips widened and his ass then ballooned out, becoming larger, rounder and firm. His chest began to push out into breasts and eventually stopped at a C cup. Next his penis began to retract into him and as it was replaced by a vagina he let out a moan of pleasure in a voice that was quite a few octaves higher than before. Then her hair grew out to his shoulders and turned a dirty blonde color, meanwhile her lips puffed out, her eyes became smaller and softer looking, and her cheekbones became more prominent. Lastly, her heavy armor, which at this point was way too big for her smaller frame, began to shrink and eventually resolved into a skintight suit of light armor that accentuated all of her new curves.

The stars began to go dim as his brain starved for oxygen. He was dead by the time he hit the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke, though a little suprised to find himself alive, he knew something was very wrong. He could barely open his eyes; they refused to focus on the stark white roof overhead. He was laid out; though he could barely feel the table beneath him. Arms were too weak to lift their own weight; legs... he couldn't feel his legs at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to take a breath; it gurgled in his burnt lungs like a death rattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God, Miranda, I think he's waking up,\" a man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Wilson. He's not ready yet! Give him the sedative.\" A woman entered his vision. She stared down at him with sympathy. \"Shepard, don't try to move. Just try to stay calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ready yet?\" the man scoffed. \"There's no way we can repair this sort of damage. Heart-rate's still climbing. Stat's are pushing into the red zone. It's not working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another sedative! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an almighty effort, Shepard was finally able to will movement into his body. He caught sight of the burnt, broken, dismembered body that was now his, before the sedative flowed through him, sending him to blissful oblivion. The woman's face - beautiful, chiselled, perfect - was the last thing he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Commander!\" Shepard suddenly heard a man's voice calling his name. \"Shepard, get your ass out of this bed now, this place is under attack!\"<br>\r\nShaking. But body responding. He felt whole again. Had it all been a dream?<br>\r\n\"Damnit! Get moving, now!\". Distant gunfire heard through several bulkheads.<br>\r\n\"There's a pistol and armor in the locker at the farside of the room. Move it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Shepard sprinted over to the locker, opened it...<br>\r\nAnd got the shock of his life!<br>\r\nIn the small mirror on the locker's door, he saw not the reflection he was used to. No, instead staring back at him was the woman he had seen when he woke before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Alliance special forces training took over and he grabbed the white armor with orange stripes from the locker - only to realize it was a woman's model.<br>\r\nAnd suddenly a horrifying realization ran through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Shepard brought out puzzled, just to realize it was not his voice either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he looked down and saw two globes of flesh sitting on his, or rather her, chest.<br>\r\n\"No time to explain, suit up. Now!\" Shepard heard the man's voice barking an order at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he, or rather she, did. Luckily, men and women's battle armor were designed the same, so Shepard had no trouble getting it on, except from the unused feeling of the weights on her chest getting pressed into the armor's front cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pistol lay beneath the armor. She grabbed it. After all the confusion it seemed reassuring to hold. Only...<br>\r\n\"This pistol misses something!\" she said as she found out that part of it was gone.<br>\r\n\"Crap... You need to find and insert a thermal clip into it. But not now, get into cover, those canisters in front of the door are going to explode!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA canister near the door was venting gas. Shepard dived behind an upturned table just as it exploded. The door slid open. Vaulting over the table, Shepard sprinted through the smoke and out the door. A thermal clip lay discarded on the floor. Slamming it into the pistol, she felt it come alive again.</span></div></div>",

This time, a firefight with a bunch of mechs ensued which ended victorious for her.<br>\r\nBut the heads of exploding mechs was not the only thing she saw. <i>Cerberus!</i> she thought as she saw the orange insignia on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Shepard ran through a hallway until she came into a section with an elevator. \"More incoming! There's a grenade launcher, quick!\".<br>\r\nQuickly she grabbed it and got rid of the incoming foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she came by a small office with a terminal on the desk.

She stood up trying to fire her pistol but the pistol malfunctioned as it pretty much blew up in her hands, she grunted as she went down. Jacob yelled in retort, \"You have biotics now, use them!\". Shepard nodded, trying her best to throw a biotic push, strangely enough she emitted blue light as a biotic push went flying out of her hands. She felt like she had some potent power judging by the mechs all being destroyed in one biotic push. Much stronger than most biotic humans she knew in her past.

As she zipped it up she slipped her feet into the thigh high boots and attached them to the suit, the outfit was complete.

The stars began to go dim as his brain starved for oxygen. He was dead by the time he hit the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Eight months later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Wilson, what are you saying!? You said it was possible to bring him back\" Miranda shouted to the medical officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it could be possible to bring him back, but now we can't. His cells and DNA are more damaged than we thought. Exposure to space, burning up in the atmosphere, and freezing on Alchera was too much for his armor to preserve\" Wilson calmly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda allowed a rare face of defeat. She stared through into the room the hunk of meat that was Commander Shepard sat. She sighed in disspointment. \"So this has all been a waste of time\" Miranda said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite\" said Wilson with a slightly terrified look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda lit up in a biotic flare. \"What?\" was all she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Shepard's body was damaged beyond repair, but his brain was kept intact by the ice. We could probably jump start if we put it in a new host\" Wilson said nerviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda calmed down and began to take this in. \"So we could clone Shepard's body and put the old brain in the new body\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilson shook his head. \"That's the problem. The DNA we recovered has too many gaps for a successful cloning, and filling them in ourselves could be catastrophic\" He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely the alliance or the council has samples in their records\" Miranda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't get to those either. Thanks to his N7 and spectre status, there virtually untouchable. The Illusive man tried pulling all sorts of strings yet he couldn't get them. He even sent Kai Leng and he came up short\" Wilson explained almost shaking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda took all of this in. \"What are you keeping from me\" Miranda said, having picked up on Wilson's shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously we need to get a host body for Shepard, but even then there's a problem with that. He apperantly had an extremely rare disorder, the nerves in brain use a higher electrical current than most humans do. If we don't get the currents right, it would destroy the brain. As such we can't just find anyone to stick his brain into\" Wilson said, still nervious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we find people with the same disorder, and select the best match\" Miranda said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be next to impossible, 99% of people with this disorder go through their lives without realizing they have it. It could be a year until we find a handfull of subjects\" Wilson continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you suggest we do\" Miranda said now annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the thing. We have a perfect match for Shepard's brain, we just have rebuild the body based on the DNA we have\" Wilson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, then why are we having this conversation\" Miranda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is the body it's self, do you remember one of Shepard's squadmates gunnery chief Ashley Williams\" Wilson said now trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I recall she died on Vermire..........no, you can't be serious\" Miranda said now with full realization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's literally all we got or else we lose Shepard forever\" Wilson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked back at the carcass watching two techies remove Shepard's brain from his former body. \"If it's all we got, then make it so\" Miranda finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilson stared in shock at miranda for a good 10 seconds before leaving to make the arrangements. He knew he was stupid to mention Ashley, but it would be even stupider to question Miranda's judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A year and a half later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard woke for the first time in two years. He was disorientated, but more importantly confused as hell to his surroundings. <i>\"Where am I, some med bay in a base\"</i> He thought. He tried mustering the strength to get up, but couldn't a first. <i>\"Shit, the crew\"</i> He thought. It was coming back to him now, Saren, Vermire, Soverign, Alchera. That was enough to get him out of bed. He sat back up, when he realized he had longer hair now. He reached back pulled some of it forward. It was silky, black, and reached just past his shoulders. <i>\"I just got a cut before I left the citadel, I must have been out awhile\"</i> He thought, before he noticed his arms. While ceritanly muscular, they were much more slender and danity than before. <i>\"What the\"</i> he tried to say before covering his mouth. <i>\"This voice....isn't my voice\"</i> Shepard thought. Shepard stood up, until feeling his balance was off. He looked down and saw two pert orbs of flesh resting on his (now her) chest. <i>\"What did they do to me\"</i>She said with awe and anger. BEfore She could do anything though, an explosion rocked her off the bed. She got back up, and saw through the window. She was so enamored by herself that, she was oblivious to the battle happening outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, can you hear me\" A woman's voice said through the intercom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me\" Shepard yelled in her new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later\" The voice yelled back \"First we need to get you out of there, grab the armor and pistol from the locker\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no idea what was happening, Shepard decided to listen to the voice and ask questions later. She went into the locker and pulled out the armor. It was standard N7 except it was for a woman's. She looked down again at the globes of flesh again trying to work out what happened. Another explosion rocked the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, get your armor on, we'll explain everything later\" The voice yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shit getting real, she finally sliped into her armor. It was virtually identical to her old armor, with the one exception the additional space for her new breasts. Then she grabbed the pistol. It was a crappy M-3 Predator, but it had to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't have a clip\" Shepard yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to......SHIT, take cover Shepard!\" The voice yelled. Shepard ducked behind a canister just in time for the door to explode. Escaping through it, she picked up a some thermal clips of a fallen mech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"New model\"</i> She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, we're........losin........you....go through base....................find you\" The voice said before cutting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well i'm on my own\"</i> Shepard thought. <i>\"Maybe I can find some answers\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she find first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard continued down the hall moving at a brisk pace. She continued taking out mechs while moving through the base. By this point she had realized two things: She was back from the dead and a woman now. She was able to recall falling into space after the normandy was destroyed, before blacking out. This was just obvious. The second she couldn't figure out why. <i>\"Why couldn't just rebuild my body, was I that far gone\"</i> She shuddered at the thought. Nothing of her new body seemed out of place for a typical female marine (well other actually being one), except the voice. <i>\"Why have I heard this voice before\"</i> She thought. She definitely knew it was from someone from her past. She couldn't pinpoint it, but for some reason it brought back memories from vermire. Where she had to sacrifice Ashley to destroy the cloning facility. She shuddered again at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more mechs came from around the corner. After dispatching them a door opened on the wall. It was an office area with some logs still running on the computers. <i>\"Some answers maybe\"</i> Shepard thought. Activating one revealed a video log. It was a attractive brunette with an australian accent speaking: \"Progress is slow, but the subject shows good signs of recovery. Major organs are functional and the target nurological current has been achieved. In an effort to accelerate the process, we've moved from simple organic reconstruction of the subject to bio-synthetic fusion for the donor body. The brain remains safely in cryo storage. Initial tests show promise, though we won't know if the brain can be re-activated until we begin the transplant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A brain transplant? It does explain the body, but a female one\"</i> Shepard thought. She then activated another console. This time a bald man spoke: \"The cost of this project is astronomical. 4 billion credits so far, but no one seems to care. At any rate, progress on the Lazarus project is continuing as planned. Miranda thinks the Shepard will adjust to the new body, but i'm not so sure. Being a different gender is harsh enough, but being someone from such an important life event. We have no idea what tramautic effects this could have. Yet Miranda being the ice queen she is, continues to press on. She better pray she's right.\" Shepard tried to take this all in. Being female was one thing, but a person from her past. <i>\"Well then who\"</i>She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw it. A mirror on one of the desks. Looking into it she saw someone she thought she would never see again \"Ashley\" Shepard said aloud. Yet turning around revealed nothing. <i>\"What the\"</i> Shepard thought. She looked back at the mirror and saw Ashley again. She was still standing there, copying the same movements you were making. <i>\"No it can't be\"</i> She thought, trying to convince herself. Then it hit her: <i>\"My voice....\"</i> That's why her voice was so familiar to her. It was Ashley's. <i>\"I'm Ash\"</i> Shepard thought again. She realized now why the voice was so familiar. It all made perfect sense now. She was now a perfect copy of Ashley. <i>\"But I saw her die on vermire\"</i> Shepard thought to herself. Shepard eventually came to the conclusion that the real Ashley was dead, and she was just a copy. But that still left the question of why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard stared at her new face in the mirror for a good 5 minutes, before another explosion rocked the room. <i>\"Okay get off the base first, then figure out who the hell did this to me\"</i> She concluded. After fighting through more mechs in hallways, Eventually Shepard came upon an open area with a bridge going through the room. In the middle a early 30's black man was fighting mechs on another bridge. It was clear he had been doing this for a while. <i>\"Allright he better know what the hell is going on\"</i> Shepard thought. Quickly, Shepard dispatched two mechs with head shots before diving next to the man under the railing. <i>\"At least Ash kept in shape\"</i>Shepard thought. The man turned and his eyes bulged out his skull in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, you're awake! I thought you were a work in progress\" The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on. I need answers\" Shepard yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait\" The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW\" Shepard screamed, sounding too much like an annoyed Ashley for her confort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, here's the basics. My name is Jacob Taylor, Ex- alliance, you were listed as KIA after the Normandy was destroyed two years ago. This base was built for one porpose. To do everything scientificly possible to bring you back\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did all this\" Shepard asked in tamdem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An orginization that represents human intrests. I can't say anymore for now\" Jacob continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allright you wanted to bring me back. But why Ashley\" Shepard continued. More mechs arrived and returned heavy fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, lets take out these mechs, then you can play 20 questions with me\" Jacob told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Shepard agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took out the remaining mechs with ease, with help from Jacob's biotics, until they were ordered to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last of them. Ok, now you can ask me all the questions you want\" Jacob said more relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were bringing me back, fine, but how the hell did I end up looking like her\" Shepard said angerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look I don't know the specifics, but this is the basic run down. After your death the council and the alliance just wanted everything with the reapers gone. Records were classified, witnesses silenced, evidence went missing. The battle of the citadel was like it never happened. We knew we needed a leader someone, who had been in the trenches and had experience fighting the reapers. The Lazarus project had the sole objective of bringing you back\" Jacob explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this involve me getting the body of a former crew mate, a dead one at that\" Shepard inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight months after we found you, we hit a snag. We failed to reconstuct your body based on the DNA we recovered and we couldn't access your old blood samples. We needed to do a brain transplant instead. But you also have a rare disorder that causes donor choices to be extermely limited for your brain. Finding a donor would normally be be next to impossible, but we had a combat ready donor DNA, that only had to be reconstucted. But as you can see it was gunnery chief Ashley Williams\" Jacob explained reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the one person who was the most tramautic event in my recent memory\" Shepard said still very angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a narrow vote to go ahead with the plan, and for the record I voted aganist it. But we can't deny that it worked\" Jacob retorted. Shepard tired to argue it, but Jacob had a point. She was alive, although much differently than when he had died. That still left one question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does Cerberus want with me\" Shepard asked raising an eyebrow. For the second time Jacob was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that\" Jacob asked in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found some science logs, its how I figured out what happened to me. Also it doesn't help your logo is on all your shit\" Shepard explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really got to fix that, however, there's a problem regarding humanity. Something so huge, it was worth the cost of bringing you back. My boss can fill you in but right now, Cerberus are the only ones doing anything about it\" Jacob said. Shepard processed all of this while the woman from earlier came back on the mic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob I have a shuttle ready, did you find Shepard\" The voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, saved my life actually, is Wilson with you\" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No bastard escaped, but we need to get out here now\" The voice said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her Shepard, we need to go. I'll take you to my boss, he can explain more\" Jacob said. They made their way to the shuttle, where a tall, brunette, Australian woman was waiting. Shepard thought she must have been really tall, to be the same height, at first, until she remembered her new actual height. <i>\"She's rally not that different from me now\"</i> Shepard thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Miranda Lawson, I brought you back from the dead. Anything else you should know\" Miranda asked with an almost bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Cerberus going to take me now\" You retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Jacob, I knew your consience would get the better of you\" Miranda said cynically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She figured out before I could tell her. We need to stop putting our symbol on all of our stuff\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm, fair enough. Anything else you want to know\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go meet your boss\" Shepard demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed\" Miranda said</span></div></div>",

Isn't that enough to wonder\" the Illusive man retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard took this in. \"Fair enough, but where does this leave me in the equation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the reapers better than anyone else in the galaxy, you've seen what they intend to do with us. I need you to investigate the collector attacks, find if they have a connection with the reapers, and most importantly stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why talk to the alliance or even the council about this?\" Shepard inquired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They refuse to pledge any resources to this situation. If you can convince them otherwise be my guest. Just remember as far as they are concerned, the reaper threat died with commander Shepard.\" The illusive man responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, how am I supposed to walk around as Ashley now. I may look like her, sound like her, but I certainly don't act or think like her. Plus she died on Vermire to begin with. How do we explain her suddenly just walking around\" Shepard asked very concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley Williams was never declared dead\" the illusive man said slightly annoyed. \"After stealing the ship to Ilos, and the subsequent mass death and confusion in the aftermath of Sovereign's invasion, the alliance somehow never got around to it. After Miranda discovered Ashley's 'usefulness' we spread rumors that she somehow survived Vermire, quit the Alliance and was currently working as a freelancer in the terminus systems\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was dumbfounded. \"They actually bought that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be the first time it happened to an Alliance solider. Hell, its not the first time you disappeared yourself\" The illusive man tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't speak about Akuze\" Shepard demanded. For the first time the illusive man was taken aback<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you get my point. It will be fine, were dealing with the family as we speak and will continue to do so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with them how\" Shepard inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. worry. about. it.\" The illusive man demanded himself. \"As far as Ashley's psych profile and history, we can send you detailed notes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was furious, yet couldn't help but agree with some of what the illusive man was saying. \"How do I go about defeating the collectors\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the Illusive man smiled. \"We have a ship and crew ready for you. I've assembled some dossiers to help build a team to help you in your mission\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my old team\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them dropped off the map or were reassigned after the battle of the citadel. If you encounter them in your travels, i'll let you have the final judgement call, but just remember, they've moved on and may not reconigize the new you\" The illusive man explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Massive understatement</i> Shepard thought \"So if seems you have everything planed out for me, what if I refuse\" Shepard asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You awalys have a choice Shepard. You can say no and i'll put you on a shuttle to the nearest spaceport and you can forget this conversation ever happened.\" The illusive man explained once again. \"Regardless of what you think of me or Cerberus, the attacks supersede any boundaries for the sake of humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard screamed on the inside. She hated to admit it but the Illusive man was right. After what she saw at freedom's progress, the attacks were too big to ignore. Even if it meant working with Cerberus. \"I'll work with you, for humanity, not for Cerberus\" Shepard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough\" The illusive man said \"Before you leave though two things. One: It may be better to go by Ashley now in case someone recognizes you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard simply glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I let you make that call\" the illusive man said hastily. \"Two: I found you a pilot. He's one of the best and you've already met\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the Illusive man abruptly ended the conference, and left Shepard alone in projection room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't even have the decency to talk face to face\" A vice said behind Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard turned around and was shocked again. \"Joker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker leaned against the wall of the staircase grinning from ear to ear. \"You look better Shepard, or Ashley\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I.....uh..you see.....umm\" Shepard stuttered to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax\" said Joker \"I know everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you went along with it anyway\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\" Shepard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was some disbelief and smashing of things at first, but yeah. It's definitely weird and will take some getting used to, but if that's Shepard in there, hell yeah i'm game\" Joker said still grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first happy moment Shepard had in a while. \"I assume you joined because of the reapers\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker's grin faded instantly \"It pisses me off that the alliance is doing nothing\" Joker said while walking up the stairs. \"After Alchera they just wanted everything gone. Records were sealed, the team broken up, they tried to make it look like nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you trust Cerberus\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I trust anyone with a higher pay grade than me, but when were taking the fight to the collectors, hell yeah I joined with Cerberus, and they have the best toys\" Joker said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come\" Joker said walking over to a glass window. \"They only told me about it last night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the the flick of a switch the lights came on to reveal a brand new normandy sitting in a dry dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to be home huh, Shepard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like being at home once again. They had finally regrouped in the CIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the new Normandy and all her new enhancements. Any more questions Shepard.\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you explained everything in perfect detail as usual Miranda\" Shepard said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was not fazed. \"Good, the captain's cabin is on the 1st floor in the elevator. You'll probably want to get out that armor and adjusted to your new clothes soon.\" Miranda retorted. \"If you have any further questions you can find me in my office on the 3rd floor.\" And with that she abruptly walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to excuse her\" Jacob said. \"She an excellent officer, but can be a bit of an ice queen sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard smiled and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, she is an ice queen, but don't let it get to you\" Jacob explained \"If you need me, i'm awalys in the armory on this floor.\" With that he excused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should we begin first\" asked EDI, the resident AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis I will never get used to Shepard thought. \"Let's begin in Omega, i'm curious to meet this Archangel fellow, and we need Mordin to counteract the seeker swarms\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charting a course, Shepard\" EDI said before logging off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this has been an eventful few days\u201d Shepard thought. \u201cAt least I can get this damn armor off\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard quickly stripped off her armor, revealing the pert orbs hanging off Shepard's curvy lithe body. Shepard made a mental sigh, before opening the armor locker. However, Shepard was suprised to see that most of the clothes provided for her were typical military dress. A standard crewman's outfit, officer's suit, even an off duty outfit from her spacer days. Well there was two exceptions. A skin tight blue officer's uniform and a blue dress hung in there as well. Where, have I seen these before I thought Shepard thought. She then remembered a memo being sent to her a few months before Eden Prime, of new uniforms for female officers of major or higher. Shepard remembered a phone call with her mother, how she thought that the brass was more interested in the officers showing off, rather than being functional. \u201cOh, mom...\u201d Shepard thought, realizing that she would never see her mom or any of her family again. At least not as Commander Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she put the two uniforms away and just slipped into the standard crew uniform. Shepard went to her desk and opened the Ashley's phych profiles on the terminal. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be her, may as well play the part.\u201d Shepard thought dejectedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard had to give credit to Cerberus, she had learned more about Ashley than she ever did aboard the original Normandy. However, that was just the problem. She was learning to be someone else than who she actually was. Someone that she allowed to die under her command. Hell, she hadn't even looked in a mirror since when she woke up. Shepard was about to forget everything when someone pinged the door and a short redhead walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, I'm yeoman Kelly Chambers\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Chambers, what are you doing here\" Shepard asked annoyed but also curious at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kelly\" she said. \"I'm the ship's yeoman, that means I\u2019m the resident physiologist. My job is to make sure the crew is in good mental health for the mission. I specialize in Human, Turian, and Asari, physiology and Alien-Human relations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make sure everyone stays in shape for when we start picking up our non-human crew\" Shepard asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" Kelly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know, but you still haven't answered my question. What are you doing here?\u201d Shepard asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I manage the mental health of our crew, but you have special circumstances. I need to make sure your adjusting properly to the...change shall we say\" Kelly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways, a catch with Cerberus Shepard thought. Someone to keep an eye on him, naturally. However, she thought it might be good have someone to help adjust. \u201cI'll play along for now\u201d Shepard concluded cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, what did you want to ask me\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how are you feeling so far\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than constantly being trapped in the body of a friend I let die and being the wrong gender, everything is fine I suppose\" Shepard replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable\" Kelly replied. \"At least physically you are adjusting to the body extordinarily well. Based on what happened what happened when you woke up, I can clear you for combat service. But that's not really the point. I'm here to help you get used to your new form. It's a very large change, and you need to be comfortable with yourself if you want to have a chance of completing the mission\" Kelly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a point Shepard thought. \"Just through some periodic checkin's and scheduled exercises. Also for the first month you'll most likely need me for some of the more feminine aspects of the female body\" Kelly explained again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then\" Shepard said, not wanting to discuss those \"aspects\". \"When are we going to begin said exercises\u2019?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, just a simple one\" Kelly said. She pulled out a compact mirror and held it up to Shepard's face. \"What do you see?\u201d Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...umm\" Shepard said perplexed. In the mirror Shepard saw her face again for the first time since she woke up. Ashley's face staring back at her in the mirror copying her every movement. \"A face that isn't mine\" Shepard finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" Kelly said. \"Just to start out first, it would not be a bad idea to just frankly look at yourself once in awhile\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Shepard said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stare at yourself in the mirror or at you\u2019re at your body, just to get used to the fact that this is you now. The sooner you subconsciously accept that this is you now, you can get on with your life\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard let all of this sink in. \"Thank you Kelly, I think you'll be a valuable member of this crew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you commander. Now I need to return to my other duties, but you can always find me in the CIC if you need me\" Kelly said before walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was alone once again, with the reality of her being Ashley sinking in further.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the first real opportunity for a potentially dangerous situation since waking up. Not that she was worried, Shepard had brought herself back up to speed with live fire exercises with Jacob and those shitty training videos Miranda provided. No, this was the first time she was going out in public for the first time, as someone else. Shepard had been dreading since issuing the order to go to Omega. Kelly had helped somewhat with it in the sessions they had been having the last week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<b>Three days earlier</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the way I walk is different won't people notice\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but your a solider so it's to be expected\" Kelly said. \"Besides Ashley was awalys known for being a.....ah...well..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomboy\" Shepard chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to...but yeah\" Kelly said flustered. \"Regardless, her reputation as well as your personality are what's going to matter in the long run anyway\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what if I have to actually...um... dress up or.....ah...look pretty\" Shepard asked worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly just smiled. \"Even Miranda can't wear make up for every day of the mission, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And about my hair\" Shepard asked pulling a long lock towards at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many girls put it up but, you can wear it down even in battle\" Kelly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing Shepard wasn't happy about was her officer's uniform. She intentionally avoided it from day one. However, Miranda complained that Shepard should wear it while on away missions, to show her status as the commander. Kelly tried to talk Miranda out of it, but eventually Shepard had to come to a compromise. She had to wear the uniform if entering at a spaceport, and that was final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Exactly, what I didn't need\"</i> Shepard thought. She drank the poison and slipped into the uniform. It was custom tailored for her fitting like a second skin. Looking in the mirror, Shepard saw a better version of Ashley, more confident, and (secretly) a sexier version of her. Shepard erased the thought from her mind and went to join the boarding party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard, Jacob, and Miranda walked through the hallway, before being stopped by a Batarian. \"So the great Williams, shows up to our station, your lucky you've made it this far.\" The Batatian said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why\" Shepard retorted. \"Am I in that much demand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, no. You alliance types are obliterated if you get within half a light year of this place, but Aria has an interest in you\" The batarian replied. \"Get your plump ass to afterlife, she wants to speak to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard ignored the insult. \"And if I decline\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then i'm the least of your problems. Afterlife. Now.\" And with that he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warm welcome\" Miranda commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Com'on let's find this Aria\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterlife wasn't that hard to find apparently, one elevator ride led them to afterlife, and island in sea of crowded hallways, apartments, and districts that led to the unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the head of a criminal enterprise, she sure doesn't keep a low profile\" Jacob commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully she has connections to find archangel and the doctor\" Shepard replied. The bouncers were obviously briefed on \"Ashley's group\" and had no trouble getting into the club. What they did have a problem with was talking to Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's far enough\" Aria said, as Shepard approached her. Aria's cronies began to search for weapons (despite assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, and sniper rifles on their backs). Shepard merely punched one of them out and continued to walk to Aria. HEr bodyguards pulled out all their weapons but Aria was unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley you live up to your name, even it could have cost you your life\" Aria said with a twinge of impressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please you wouldn't kill me, your the reason why I'm here\" Shepard replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dangerous gamble but with spunk, I like that\" Aria said as she motioned for Shepard to sit as everyone lowered their weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you here Williams\" Aria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for two people, Archangel an--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and half of Omega want him dead too so get in line\" Aria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm recruiting him for a mission\" Shepard explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, how unusual\" Aria said. \"There's a recruitment room downstairs, the merc groups are hiring anyone with a gun to go after him at this point\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" Miranda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archangel has managed to piss off the three biggest merc groups, and single handedly cut down Omega's trade output by 8%. The sooner you get him off the station, the better for all of us\" Aria explained angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Doctor Solus\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked the good doctor\" Aria said \"He's as likely to shoot you as he is to heal you,  back from when he worked in STG. He opened a clinic on the 14th floor to combat the plague\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plague\" Jacob asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria nodded. \"Popped up a few weeks ago. Affects everyone except humans and the Vorcha. Since no one wants a successful Vorcha colony, would you kindly tell Solus to hurry up on his cure\" Aria explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what we can do\" Shepard said as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where to first\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery inch, every cell of Shepard's body was exploding in pain.  The commander had thought his pain was over after he had slipped into what he thought was an eternal sleep after blacking out after the attack on the Normandy.  But now the pain was back and was worse than ever before.  All he could do was scream in an attempt to release some of it.  The pain was so intense he couldn't even hear the voices panicking above him.  Shepard didn't even notice the syringe injecting him with an agent knocking him into a coma so that he couldn't feel anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilson!  What's wrong!  That's the 5th time you've failed to bring Shepard back.  Why does this keep happening?\"  Miranda shouted to the medical officer as Shepard slipped into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect!  All of his cells as they are now are dead or dying and nothing can change that!  That's the sort of thing that hurts a great deal.  If we keeping trying to revive him all he can do is just die again in increasingly painful facions!  Just give up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we changed the cells?  In fact change him all together.  If Shepard is a new person than perhaps that would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what the Illusive Man wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body is merely a body.  We'll leave the mind untouched.  Hopefully that will be enough to revive the legendary hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we should probably just give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel that way then you can be reassigned, I'll run everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out Wilson.\"  Miranda said with a cold voice that Wilson knew meant trouble if he challenge her.  <i>I'll have to stop this mad project another way.</i>  Wilson thought as he left Miranda to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what will be the most effect way to make the needed changes.\"  Miranda said as she examined the many screens displaying every bit of biological data on Shepard.  After hours and hours of keeping her eyes on biological and genetic readings before letting out a sigh knowing a potential answer to her problem, \"We, it is only one chromosome.\"  Miranda said before getting to work.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Two year later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Shepard felt himself coming into consciousness for the first time in a long time that he'd felt something that wasn't excruciating pain.  Although now that he was alive and not in pain he didn't know what to do about it.  It was as if he'd forgotten how to move his body.  But Shepard didn't want to worry about that for now.  He could just sit back and enjoy the feeling of being alive and just relax.  However this relaxation wouldn't last long as Shepard thought, <i>The crew!</i>.  Out of nowhere he found the energy and inspiration needed to move again and jumped off of the bed he was laying on and took a look around.  He was obviously in a medical room, but it didn't have the layout of any hospital he knew.  <i>Perhaps it's a med bay at a military base.</i>  Shepard concluded as he wiped the red bangs out of his eyes.  <i>Bangs?  I had a military crew cut just before the last mission.  How long was I out?</i>  Shepard took a step to the door but wavered a little in his steps.  Part of it was not having moved in who knows how long, but something else was different.  <i>My balance is...off.</i>  Shepard thought as he looked around the room and noticed a mirror.  But it couldn't be a mirror, what was looking back at him was a red haired woman.  \"What?\"  Shepard said and saw the red haired woman also say it.  \"This isn't possible.\"  Shepard said as he approached the mirror, but before he could take it all in an alarm sounded and a voice came over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!?  You're awake?!  Well perfect timing I guess, I need your help.  Grab the gun at the desk and come help me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"  Shepard called out looking for as many answers as he(?) could find. </span></div></div>",

But Don't worry, because we took that into account. Using the most advanced technology around, we incorporated a shape shifting technology into your new hardware. Doing this eliminates the need for squad mates, unless you are on a synthetic mission. You can take on the form of anyone that you have absorbed into your consensus, and we have already programmed you with one form from every species. Unfortunately, the hardware would only accept female forms, aside from your original. So don't worry, if you ever have to meet with someone you already know, you can still be yourself. But be warned, that is simply a hologram, and will not last forever, since your actual body was destroyed.

You have a Geth frame now, and all the abilities that come with it. You can hack into an Organic's mind the same way you would a synthetic's.

Asari minds are stronger than human ones, so you needn't be concerned about her\" the scientist explained, gesturing to Shepard's current host, Aleyta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...am I free to leave?\" Shepard asked, as he lowered the mirror and felt his breasts once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We just have a couple more tests to run, then you can go. And we trust you'll be a lot more sympathetic to us than the rest of the Alliance, considering what we've done for you Commander.

He turned and saw Joker standing there, and a broad grin appeared on his now feminine features. \"JOKER!!\" Shepard shouted out, slapping him gently on the shoulder, remembering his vrolik syndrome. \"Good to see you!\" But of course Joker just stood there, blank faced, wondering how an Asari he had never met before knew him by name. \"Oh...\" Shepard then laughed, looking down at his \"borrowed\" body. \"Yeah...I guess I don't really look like me now do I, um...its me Joker...Shepard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah okay, and I'm Garrus Vakarian, please pull this stick from up my ass!\" Joker responded sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard just arched an eyebrow and struck his usual 'annoyed' pose, which Joker kind of recognized. \"Why else would they let me on a Cerberus ship Joker?\" he asked. \"They brought me back to life, but they could only put me in a Geth unit\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geth?\" Joker muttered, eyeing up Shepard's current sexy blue body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also gave me the ability to transfer my consciousness into other bodies, organic or synthetic, but they have to be unconscious first\" Shepard said. \"This one is...interesting!\" he then smiled, holding his hands out in front of him, then fonlding his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker eventually accepted (but only after Shepard had told him of several adventures they had shared together) that this was indeed Commander Shepard stood in front of him...tucked up in an Asari Matron's svelte body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I...um....I don't know what to say Commander.

Um...the ship...I mean\" Shepard smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you know where I'll be\" Joker nodded, gesturing to the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joker walked off, Shepard stood staring at the galaxy map, and he folded his arms under his breasts as he pondered his next move. He still needed a new host, as he couldn't freely move around amongst Alliance personnel in an Asari body. Just then he heard another voice behind him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tilted his head side to side and arched his back to get used to the feel of being human again, then he glanced back into the room he had just left, the unconscious Asari was lying on the floor. \"Thanks for the ride\" Shepard giggled in Kelly's voice, before locking the door and making his way back to the elevator and up to the CIC. During the ride up in the elevator he squeezed his \"borrowed\" breasts and then let his new hands roam over the rest of the body he now occupied.

However there were many that were new to him: Miranda Lawson, Jacob Taylor, Kenneth Donnelly, Gabriella Daniels, Rupert Gardner, Sarah Patel, Vadim Rolston, Jenny Goldstein, Thomas Hawthorne, Richard Hadley, and Zach Matthews among many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just look at a file and select it, correct?\" Shepard's robotic voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so, Commander.\" Dr. Chakwas replied, \"At least according to my files here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then selected one of the files and suddenly his body began changing. His geth frame readjusted into more of a human skeletal structure while muscles, tendons, skin and hair emerged to cover it. On top of that clothing: underwear and a uniform like the other crewmembers of the Normandy SR-2. \"Whoa, that was something huh? How do I look, Doc?\" Shepard asked in a much higher-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Engineer Daniels.\" Dr. Chakwas stated, \"Gabriella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabby, actually. It's what she prefers.\" Shepard said. \"It's in the files plus it's weird it's like... I can pull up a digital copy of her mind. If I wanted to I could impersonate her perfectly. And I'm surprised about this. I thought it would be some kind of hard light hologram, but it feels like I'm actual flesh and blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you are.\" said the doctor, \"In a way at least. The files say that this geth unit has been heavily modified for infiltration purposes and as such it's equipped with an internal fabricator that can create inorganic matter similar to that used by the geth hoppers you encountered while fighting Saren. It's just a far more advanced form that can become nearly indistinguishable from muscle, skin, hair, and material used for clothing. You can even emit a substance that simulates saliva and that unit is equipped with special sensors and programming that wil similuate the sense of touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Shepard stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is and to see just how amazing it is I'm going to have you transform one more time.\" Dr. Chakwas said, \"This time I want you to transform into an alien. Not an asari, too close to humans, but any other race should be fine. We need to see how it does handling non-human or close to human forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard nodded and opened up files once more. His now computer mind allowed him to search through them at great speed and he quickly found the one he wanted and initated the transformation. \"Keelah, it worked.\" Shepard said as he stared at his new hands in amazement: thin and with only three fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling that you would choose Tali'Zorah's form.\" Dr. Chakwas said. \"But a quarian form is good. Vastly different from a human's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the tests were over and Dr. Chakwas bid goodbye to Shepard. Shepard was now wondering what to do. He wondered if he should keep Tali's form for the time being, it felt nice and it would get the crew used to working with aliens. However he knew he'd need a human form in order to do what Cerberus had asked him to do. Taking somebody more high profile like Ashley or Anderson could prove to be dangerous if they're seen as being in two places at once so if he needed a human form he'd need someone a little more... out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali's form made him remember their chasing of Saren which made him remember somebody: Lizbeth Baynham. He met her while saving the Zhu's Hope colony on Feros from a geth attack. She worked for ExoGeni which worked heavily with the Alliance to help colonize new worlds and research new worlds for colonization. With ExoGeni's relationship with the Alliance he might be able to move around Alliance systems with less suspicion as Lizbeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd need to fight too and from what he remembered Lizbeth wasn't made for fighting. But then Shepard remembered Noveria: someone like Maeko Matsuo or (the now deceased) Kaira Stirling would be a good shape to take for combat with the bonus of being human and making it a bit easier to move around. Just not with anywhere near the level of convenience Lizbeth's form would provide.</span></div></div>",

He went over to the lock box in the corner of the room and got a good look at his new body and was shocked.<br>\r\nThe reflection Shepard saw wasn't his own, it was that of a quarian female with a blue faced plated eviro-suit. His hips were wide. butt was MUCH bigger than any human he ever saw. His suit had a blue hood draped over his helmeted head. Continuing down his body, he saw two large clumps of flesh he knew were his new breast, his chest and down the sides of his hips was a blue cloth covered in strange clan marking him as a member of the quarian race. He then looked at his arms and saw a sort of pocket covering much of his arms for holding supplies. Shepard then looked down to his feet to find a three-footed boot with a knife strapped onto the side. He also felt nothing between his, or rather now her legs. Shepard looked back to her face, or helmeted face and saw two glowing eyes behind the helmet that now belong to him. A loud voice brought him back to reality.<br>\r\n\"Dammit Shepard, I know you're ready to freak out right now. But I need you to grab that pistol and meet up with me so that I can explain every thing.\" the voice said.<br>\r\n\"Fine! But I better get answers for this!\" Shepard said, the English language oddly becoming difficult to speak.<br>\r\nShepard grabbed the M-3 Predator out of the lock-box with his three-fingered hand, and walked toward the door leading out of the room, hoping that the answers he got lead to something that could get him back to his original body.</span></div></div>",

The Commander's body was write off, beyond repair - cooked on the outside, broken and pulverized on the inside, its cells irradiated by cosmic rays. The only part that had been salvageable was the brain. The team had successfully extracted it and it currently stewed in a nutrient bath, rejuvenating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a press of a button, the Illusive Man conjured a hologram of Shepard's cerebrum. Inside there was everything he needed; the commander's tactical acumen, his connections, his knowledge of the reapers and the protheans. If he could somehow transfer all that into a new, strong body, one with unconditional loyalty to Cerberus and its cause, the Project would be a success. And it would have to be a body with enough spare room in it to accommodate a grown man's brain. Where would he find a body to match such specifications?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, an incoming transmission interrupted his thoughts. \"This is Miranda Lawson reporting in. Commander Shepard's brain has been stabilized. Would you like us to begin growing a clone body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that will take more time than we have. I have something else in mind...\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nIt was certainly one of the oddest surgeries he had undertaken, but Dr Wilson wasn't complaining. He had Miranda, that smug ice queen, right where he wanted her, laid out unconscious on an operating table, an excuse to put his hands all over that ass of hers. They had operated all night, inserting the neural tissue, connecting it to Miranda's nervous system, folding the gluteus muscles back, sealing the Commander's brain inside, and stitching the skin together until her ass was as perfect as it ever had been. No one would have ever guessed the Galaxy's last best hope was currently residing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the surgery over, he attached the cortical stimulators to the ass, took a step back, and activated them. The electrical charge sent a delightful ripple of motion through the beautiful butt cheeks and (he hoped) brought the brain inside to consciousness.</span></div></div>",

Of his entire ingenious race, he was one of the smartest of his kind. He had saved the galaxy twice over from both the Krogan and the Reapers. He would not be defeated by a simple glass <i>box</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only snag was that it was a glass box built by Mordin himself, and now he was only half as smart as he had once been. Powerless, he beat his furry fists against the walls of his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!... help! ... effects...irreversible!\" he squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn electronic beeping made his blood run cold. He turned to see a hatch slide open in the side of the box. There was a second specimen container attached to his own. Inside it was a second pyjak. Only this one was male... Mordin had been using it to... to breed new pyjaks for his experiments. He had selected it personally, choosing it for it's high strength, endurance, and... virility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin gulped as this powerful specimen of masculine pyjakery pulled itself through the hatch. It was twice his size. Trembling, not even wanting to know the answer, he reached between his legs with a long, slender and felt no pyjak phallus there. He was a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard!\" he screamed as his favourite pyjak backed him into a corner. He could smell the strong masculine aroma emanating from it and his body betrayed him, raising its tail ready to accept this male. Mordin squeaked like a mouse as it mounted him forcefully, thrusting its pronged penis into his furry vagina. His shrill cries filled the lab, punctuated by the animal sounds of mating elicited involuntarily from his animal body as it rode him. \"Shepard! Squee! Shepard! Eek! Shepaaard! Kee! Kee! Keeeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orgasm, stronger than anything he had ever felt in his Salarian body by an order of magnitude, rolled over him, breaking the tenuous grasp he still had on his psyche. His mind was lost. When Shepard returned minutes later, he found only two animals breeding willingly and enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

However, his curiosity got the best of him and he wanted to see what other options the device had to offer. Scrolling through the menu Shepard came across a gender alteration option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he clicked the screen it brought up a diagram that featured a nude model of a human male and female. Clicking on the female brought in another diagram, this time giving the user the option to change and alter the proportions of the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly perverted grin formed on the commanders face as he adjusted a slider making the model's breasts enlarge to the size of basketballs. He could have made them bigger but he preferred to keep them a reasonable size. Although the thought of becoming a woman sounded intriguing. It wasn't worth the risk, seeing how the changes were irreversible. He was mainly curious to see how far he could take it before backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mating between the two Pyjacks only grew stronger. Witch each vicious thrust moving the specimen tank closer towards the edge.<br>\r\nShepard, however, didn't notice as he was preoccupied with his own sexual fantasies. The commander kept making more adjustments to the model growing her bigger in all the right places. This time focusing on her ass and hips. Shepard watched with glee as the model's thighs swelled and thickened to the size of tree trunks. Her ass was soon to follow, reaching the size of two large firm pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it took was one last thrust to send the specimen tank crashing onto the ground. The sudden blast took Shepard by surprise, freeing him from his sexual trance. As he walked over the tank he realized the lid had come loose. Before he had any time to react the two Pyjacks had jumped over him and started to attack. </span></div></div>",

His body becoming human, long black hair constrasting with his pale white skin and large breasts held in by a skintight black and white jumpsuit.

Great news.\" came the new, accented feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda?\" Shepard asked in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only physically. Inside still Mordin.

Links up with databases in Citadel, Omega, Alliance, merc groups and others. Copies appearance and genetic information from databases into device. Selecting person and using device causes target to transform into copy of selected person. Human, asari, turian, KROGAN... can transform into all of them! Right down to clothing even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does it only work for the user?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin just shook his new pretty head, \"Shepard, please. Not simple krogan scientist, made sure it works on selected target. Could be user, could be somebody else. Allow me to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin lifted his hand, pointing it at Shepard and, after a bit of searching, found what he wanted and used the device. Shepard could feel his body quickly shifting and changing in ways that were quite odd. Getting skinnier in some places and larger, sometimes MUCH larger, in others. His fingers elongated, fusing together until their was three and his legs bent backwards at the shins in a way that was alien to him. It was done quickly and Shepard looked down throw the purple visor at a black bodysuit with purple cloth in various places. He ran his now three-fingered hands over his new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\" he stated, his voice now feminine and accented, \"I'm Tali!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought it would be best to turn you into someone completely different as display of device's abilities.\" Mordin stated in his current Australian accent. \"So how are you feeling Tali'Zorah vas Neema?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...\" Shepard took his new hands and ran them over the large hips and ass that the quarian woman possessed, \"quite good.\" There was a seductive quality to the amused tone of Tali's Eastern European accented voice which Shepard found pleasing coming out of his mouth. \"But wait, if I'm Tali right now does that mean I have the weak quarian immune system?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surpisingly no!\" Mordin answered. \"Change is genetic but not complete. Become Jack and acquire biotic abilities. Become deceased daughter of Samara gain ability to dominate the minds of others however WON'T become ardat-yakshi. Become quarian and gain aptitude for engineering but not weak immune system. How it works still not sure but that is what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all the benefits but none of the drawbacks.\" Shepard said looking down at his lovely quarian body, \"Mordin you're the best, you know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew that already Shepard.\" Mordin stated with a smirk, \"But appreciate reassurance.

She became taller, her shoulders broader, and her suit disappeared as it became a casual shirt and some N7 brand shorts. In seconds, where had once stood Tali'Zorah there now stood someone who looked exactly like John Shepard, tall and muscular and very clearly male. \"Fascinating,\" Tali said, clearly not used to Shepard's masculine voice coming with her words. \"I cannot believe this is real...I can live without a suit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Mordin cut in, his usual briskness coming off as more rude thanks to Miranda's voice. \"It is not required that you change species to improve your immune system. As I said to Shepard earlier, this technology removes biological imperfections as well. If you used it now to turn back to your normal self, you would be exactly as you were before, but without the cripplingly weak immune system.\" That news clearly hit Tali hard. This was a way for her, and the rest of her people, to escape their suit prisons, perhaps permanently. But she was also feeling something besides hope for her people: arousal. Miranda's body, normally something she didn't care much about, was suddenly looking incredibly attractive, and her own body that John was wearing was revving her engines even more.</span></div></div>",

First, his body felt restricted and felt a sort of rubbery material sticking to him. Second, he sensed another presence was very close to him. Finally deciding to see where he was and why he felt different, he opened his eyes. He saw the ceiling of the cargo bay, but he saw something way different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the ceiling, but in a very obvious slightly tinted purple vision. It was then Shepard realized that it was because he was wearing a helmet. He never recalled ever putting on a helmet, especially one with a purple visor.

Shepard then realized that when he moved his arms, the quarian's arms moved. Studying them further, he recognized them as Tali's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a coincidence, Tali is probably just next to me.\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to his left and didn't see her, just more of the cargo bay. He was looking to his right when something caught his eye on the bottom of his vision. As he was looking to his right, he looked down being met with a set of breast encase in a black body suit. Shepard's eyes widened at them and reached to grasp them with the Tali arms he somehow had. Groping them, he felt a weird but erotic feeling that he wouldn't admit. His face felt hot and he let go of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past them, Shepard's jaw dropped in utter disbelief. He saw a body in a black bodysuit with many purple cloths decorating it, a body that happened to look exactly like his girlfriend's. Shepard started putting the pieces together. The helmet he was wearing with a purple visor, the purple female quarian arms he controlled, and even a female quarian body from the neck down he knew VERY WELL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo confirm his hypothesis, he reached up and felt the quarian helmet and purple hood he adored so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... how?\" Shepard asked surprised at himself talking with Tali's accented voice, \"Wait, where's Tali then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard decided to look around for her and look down at his shapely legs and new two-toed feet.

He struggled and tried to kick, but they wouldn't bulge. Shepard then heard someone stirring loudly in his right ear. He looked to his right knowing his day got a whole lot weirder than it already is.  He turned face to face with his own face and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisturbing as it was seeing his own face that wasn't reacting to his movements, he saw it attached to his Tali body. His duplicate was fully awake and looked around in confusion before coming face to him. \"His\" eyes widened and trailed them down \"his\" body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" he stopped hearing his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? W-Why do you look like me? H-How are we both connected to my body? A-And how come do I sound like John?\" Shepard's copy bombarded him with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard finally felt his legs moving and looked down to see them moving as if they were trying to shuffle. Thinking about how his head was stuttering exactly like his girlfriend, he declared that it was Tali. She was also the one controlling the legs on her body, while he controlled the upper body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard thought about what was the best to say and came up with, \"Tali, I'm going to need you to calm down so I can explain the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How do you know my name?\" Tali asked afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard answered still talking slowly, \"Tali, it's me. Your boyfriend, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know it's you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before the attack on the collector base, 'I want you to see what's under this damn helmet.', ring any bells?\" Shepard said recalling the memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you John! How did any of this happen?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I remember was that blue field coming in here that pulled us close and we passed out. After I woke up with your head on your body and you with my head, and here we are.\" Shepard explained still amazed at how he perfectly imitated how Tali sounds like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a mass effect field, probably from Joker using a relay.\" Tali guessed, \"What if that eezo affected us other than this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we should probably check with Mordin on that then, let's go.\" Shepard said. He made a movement to start walking forgetting he couldn't control Tali's legs and almost making them fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard sighed before turning Tali, \"By the way Tali, for some reason I can only control your upper body only and I'm guessing you can control your lower body only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so that's why I can't move my arms,\" Tali said moving her legs around testing them, \"Just like using them regularly, wait a minute, John what would the crew say if they saw us like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I don't think I ever heard my self so afraid and whiny.\" Shepard said looking around and picking up a cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I don't find this weird, we're technically talking to ourselves.\" Tali pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard chuckled, \"I guess, also don't pout, Commander Shepard doesn't pout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up John, if I had control of my arms I would of slapped you.\" Tali said using their legs to walk to the elevator. As they walked, Shepard couldn't help but notice the sway in Tali's hips. Even if he had control of the legs, he wouldn't think he can stop the natural ass wiggle that Tali's body was accustomed to. They got on the elevator and it started started going up to the CIC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator moved, the slight rocking made their large breast jiggle. Shepard instinctly reached up and cupped them to hold them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali glared into the side of her old helmet, \"Really John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, I'm not used to having big tits that are jiggling.\" Shepard said rather rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali sighed knowing it would be stupid to fight over and just accepted it, \"So how are we going to get past the crew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I just put this over you,\" Shepard said putting a large piece of cloth over his old head, \"And I just instruct you. When the door opens just step out and I'll tell when to stop. When you do, turn to your right and just walk forward. Then I'll tell you to stop again and you turn to your right and walk through the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to work.\" Tali sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped and Shepard let go of their breast. The door opened and Tali stepped out and followed the directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tali.\" Kelly waved from her computer looking at the cloth confused. Shepard looked at her and waved, unfortuantely he wasn't paying attention. Tali walked them right into the wall before she backed up, turned and walked through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help John.\" Tali said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, since, I felt that too.\" Shepard said rubbing their shin. Tali walked through the door into the lab. Shepard took the cloth off Tali and pointed at himself and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mordin we need help now!\" They yelled at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin looked at them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: If any of you are confused, I'm still calling Shepard a he and Tali a she because that's what they were originally.)</span></div></div>",

His vision was fading, but before his sight completely filled with black he noticed some of the muscle mass in his arm diminishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrex, what's happening?\" Shepard asked. \"Wrex?\" But not long after Wrex collapsed, so did the other krogan present, including Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus looked at the krogan laying on the ground, then turned towards the Commander, \"Shepard, do you think Mordin's cure is causing this sickness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard grimaced at this prospect, \"I hate to think so Garrus, but that's probably it, and with Mordin gone.

An entire species had been suddenly inflicted with a strange and dangerous transformation, and not just any species, but the Krogan. These were a people who had been maligned and paternalized ever since they\u2019d first been uplifted, and who even now more the physical and mental scars of that treatment. Wrex was his friend, and he wouldn\u2019t do anything until the leader of the Urdnot Clan and Eve had woken up, so he could hear directly from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a stressful day and a half, but Shepard finally got the message from Chakwas: they were both awake and wanted to speak with him. Feeling more than a little nervous, Shepard got on the elevator from his personal room and was soon in the medbay. Neither Krogan looked much like their species anymore. Instead, two clones of Miranda Lawson, barely clothes in medical gowns, waited for him. The changes weren\u2019t complete yet: both were larger than the real Miranda, with some scales (especially around the head) and sharper teeth. But other than that, they looked like the Cerberus agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was standing near a wall, looking at Shepard with mild interest, while the other was pacing, their face stoic but their mood evidently angry. It didn\u2019t take much for Shepard to assume the latter was Wrex, and the former Eve. Once Shepard was in the room, Wrex turned his attention on him, and started speaking. \u201cShepard. Mind telling me what the hell\u2019s going on?!\u201d The voice and mannerisms from Wrex threw Shepard for a loop. He sounded like Miranda, without the accent, but a little deeper and more gravely, and it was clear the ex-Krogan didn\u2019t know how to manipulate his new human face in the way he used to with muzzle. It made sense, Shepard supposed, since Krogan\u2019s didn\u2019t have a lot of facial expression, at least to human eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne explanation on everything that had happened either, and Wrex had punched the wall, before wincing in pain due to how much it had hurt him. Meanwhile, Eve took over talking to Shepard. \u201cIt seems that, once again, the Krogan\u2019s fate has been tampered with by outside meddlars, even as others try to help us. Do you have any possible solutions for us, Commander?\u201d Tentatively, Shepard explained that it was possible for the Illusive Man, who was no doubt behind this, to also reverse it. The only question was how they\u2019d take the idea.</span></div></div>",

Shepard was expecting a routine visit, where his friend would just say the usual remarks and be done with it, but when he arrived, he noticed that Mordin had a worried look on his face. \"What's wrong?\" Shepard asked. \"Genophage cure. Possible contamination.\" Mordin blasted out as he fiddled around the bay. \"Wait, what do you mean, contamination?\" Shepard inquired. \"well, I created a small dose of cure for Wrex. Just to examine for possible side effects. However, after examining the other half of dose. There was a small contamination that will dramatically affect Wrex.\" Mordin replied. \"wait, so he won't be cured? Shepard  asked, starting to get angry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.

This means that Wrex will slowly transform into a physical copy of Ms. Lawson\" \"Shit, we need to hurry then!\" Shepard said with the utmost urgency, \"EDI, patch me in to Wrex from the com room, I need to talk to him!\" \"Very well then\" EDI said </span></div></div>",

And found nothing.<br>\r\n\"Miranda...\" tears filled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you copy? Commander? Come on, Shepard, don't leave me hanging.

We return, and you will rise!\" the booming voice of Harbinger commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Garrus and Shepard were close to a turn a gray-colored Collector variant they'd never seen before suddenly jumped out of cover, only armed with an assault rifle. Only to be consequently dispatched by a precise headshot aimed from Garrus' Chakram Launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot!\". \"Be glad this thing had no shields!\" Garrus deadpanned as they continued their escape, the turian leading their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they came across another set of floating platforms hacked by EDI which led directly to the Normandy SR-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door of the ship opened and Joker and Legion appeared, giving them fire support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus was able to cross them when suddenly another piece of debris came falling down - and hit the platform in the middle, cutting of the escape route for Shepard who was behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the commander improvised and decided to take a running jump into the Normandy's airlock - and succeeded in doing so!<br>\r\nAs he was hanging on the airlock floor, he almost lost the last bits of strength when Garrus and Legion pulled him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not loosing you too, Shep!\" Garrus whispered as the airlock doors closed. Next, the doors closed and the Normandy SR-2 made a dashing escape.<br>\r\nJust in time, because ten seconds later the radiation surge hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shepard entered the communication rooms he willed himself back to the here and now. \"EDI, patch me through!\" he commanded. \"As you wish, Shepard.

Just a little over two days ago, he had finished his physical therapy from the transfer, and had finally made his way onto the Citadel. When he found out that Dr. Eva Core had failed and that Shepard was on his way here, time was of the essence. \"This body is so uncomfortable, I can't stand it.\" He was currently walking down one of the hallways in the Presidium Commons, after purchasing some hardware for his 'Camera-bot', when in reality it was to his new robotic form. By doing this, he would be able to increase his capacity and be able to plant a virus into the Normandy itself and be able to leak information from it to his top scientists at Cerberus. And if he was lucky, he would maybe be able to take over EDI and have her work for him again. But that was a long shot. He had just entered an elev ator to go to the Normandys' docking bay, when a random human male ran up to him yelling<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ms. Allers!\" he shouted \"I'm a HUGE fan of your show and would be honored to get your autograph!\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, sure\" The Illusive Man said, unsure of what to do. But suddenly, he remembered a feature of this new suits programs with his brain. He accessed her memories and went on a form of autopilot. \"Sure, I always love meeting one of my fans.\" He said perfectly, \"Who should I make it out to?\"<br>\r\n\"My names Conrad. Conrad Verner.\" The fan said with a lot of eagerness.<br>\r\n\"Well, here you go Conrad. I hope you have a nice day.\" The Illusive Man said with a smile. After the boy left that smile instantly left. \"Ugh, what an annoying little brat. But at leadt I had a way to effectively test my autopilot feature, which was a huge success\" And with that, the elevator reached his floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Liara tried getting up, but her body had other plans. Every inch of her was sore, and even though she didn't know how long she'd been unconscious, she could tell it had been awhile. Liara took a few deep breaths, hoping to relax herself. Unfortunately, a sharp headache ended the attempt. Liara moved her hand to her head as quickly as she could manage, which is to say, very slowly. She rubbed her forehead, and crossed her brow. There was something on her head, something that shouldn't be there. With a sudden burst of adrenaline-fueled energy, Liara moved her hand across the top of her head. Her eyes widened in terror. Somehow, she had grown a full head of  hair. Without even considering the pain of it, Liara got out of her bed and moved to the med bay's window. She looked at the reflective surface, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, pale brunette, to be exact. Liara ran a pair of fingers down her face, and the reflection did the same.<br>\r\n\"By the Goddess, its real,\" Liara squeaked. Her throat was sore, but she could still tell her voice was different. Less regal, more... \"Human. I'm a human.\" Liara stepped away from the window in shock. She stumbled back to her bed, and leaned against it. Before the terror of the situation could overtake her completely, however, the med bay's door opened, and Commander Jane Shepard stepped in. She smiled wide at her girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you up and about...\"</span></div></div>",

Being rendered unconscious, waking up on the Normandy, waking up <i>human</i>, and now seeing Shepard were all too much to handle. To top it all off, it seemed that Shepard didn't even realize that she should be an Asari!<br>\r\nShepard quickly sensed Laura's distress. The Commander stepped forwards, and gently held onto her girlfriend's shoulders. \"Hey, it's alright. I heard what that artifact did to you, and I am so, so sorry. If you need time to-\"<br>\r\n\"Shepard,\" Laura cut her girlfriend off. She gestured down at her pale body. \"Do you notice anything... strange about me?\"<br>\r\nThe Commander couldn't help but laugh. \"This is the Normandy, Lura. Everyone's at least a little strange here. I'm pretty sure it was in the handbook: 'At least half of all crew mates must have tragic backstories'.\"<br>\r\nLaura giggled despite herself. She rested her head on Shepard's shoulder, and hugged her. It felt odd. Laura was far shorter as a human, and her own hair was blocking the feeling of Shepard's skin against her's. Still, Laura was glad that, for all the changes she had went through, she still had this.<br>\r\nShepard was the first to break the hug. Her green eyes pierced Laura's blue with a warmth she hadn't felt for two years. \"I should go get Dr. Chakwas,\" Shepard mumbled.<br>\r\nLaura nodded. \"Yes, that would be a good idea.\"<br>\r\nShepard leaned down and kissed Laura's forehead, something she had used to do to Shepard, and exited the med bay. Laura climbed back onto her bed, and sighed. This wasn't where she imagined she'd be after studying that Prothean artifact. Laura's eyebrows shot up. Of course, the artifact! If it had turned her into a human, then maybe it could turn her back into an Asari! Of course, she didn't fully understand the artifact. Maybe it would turn her into an Elcor, or worse, a vorcha! Laura mentally debated with herself. Just before Dr. Chakwas walked in, Laura had come to a decision.</span></div></div>",

It might make things infinitely worse, but if there was even a slight chance that the artifact could turn her back into an Asari, she had to take it. Besides, the artifact hadn't adjusted anything in Laura's reality beyond her species. She was still welcome on the Normandy, and still Shepard's girlfriend. If things didn't go as planned, then... Maybe the Commander had a secret Krogan fetish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura's thoughts drifted into more unpleasant territories, Dr. Chakwas stepped into the Med Bay. Her entrance broke Laura's concentration, bringing her back into reality. The doctor paused and quirked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Laura?\" she asked. The former Asari didn't answer at first, she still wasn't used to her new, human name.<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" she replied after a few seconds. \"Oh, I was just daydreaming. Sorry, doctor.\"<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas dismissed Liara's apology with a wave of her hand. \"It was nothing, dear. You just seemed a bit out of it, and that's never a good sign for someone who's been recently unconscious.\" The doctor walked over to her desk, and started shifting through datapads.<br>\r\nLaura nervously ran a hand though her hair. She blinked in confusion at the odd feeling. It was like moving her fingers though a stream of silk. She tugged at a brunette strand, and gasped at the sharp pain that ran through her scalp. Dr. Chakwas quickly turned around from her desk to see if Laura was alright.<br>\r\n\"Laura, what happened?\"<br>\r\nShe laughed nervously. \"Nothing, just a... tangle in my hair. That's the right word, isn't it?\" she muttered as an aside.<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas quirked an eyebrow, but said no more. She put down her datapad, and walked over to Laura. \"Alright, I'm going to preform a quick checkup, and as long as there are no surprises to deal with, you'll be free to go.\" Laura nodded. \"Alright, let's begin.\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully the Porthean artifact had done nothing more than turn her into an average human. She had been tense throughout the whole checkup, fearing that Dr. Chawas would find something horribly wrong with her.  The strangest thing about her was that she apparently kept her biotic prowess. Laura was on par with any Asari in terms of biotic skill. Laura took a few steps forwards, and was quickly intercepted by a very tall woman with an exhausted look on her alabaster face. Laura recognized her as Miranda Lawson.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" the Cerberus operative said, \"but I need you to sign in at my office. It's a safety protocol, one I'd rather not argue about right now.\"<br>\r\nLaura nodded, a bit too quickly, and started walking towards Miranda's office. The woman in question followed just behind, though her confident strut made it seem like she was still leading the way. Laura soon reached the door to Miranda's office, but it remained locked. Miranda typed a code written in some foreign dialect, and the door opened. Miranda stepped inside, and quickly sat down at her desk. Laura found the sign in datapad sitting on the desk. She entered her name, and gave Miranda a small, shy nod, which the woman returned. She exited the office, and immediately bumped into Shepard. Laura let out a surprised squeak, but Shepard burst into laughter. <br>\r\n\"Laura, I was looking for you! I hope Miranda didn't give you too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"None at all, actually.\" Laura scratched the back of her head, something she could accomplish without the sensitive tips of her tendrils getting in the way. \"She's suprusingly pleasant when you don't argue with her.\"<br>\r\n\"Not that I would know,\" Shepard grunted, though it sounded suspiciously like another laugh. \"Anyways, I wanted to tell you: I figured you'd want to continue studying the artifact, so I ordered the crew to bring it on board. It's in my cabin if you want to come with me and study it.\"<br>\r\nIt was Laura's turn to laugh now. \"Are you propositioning me, Commander?\"<br>\r\nShepard pinched two of her fingers together with a giggle. \"Only a little.\" The taller woman latched onto Laura's hand, and started leading her towards the elevator. Soon enough, they were side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura counted two new fish and three new ship models since the last time she'd visited Shepards cabin. She'd hoped her new, human brain would help her understand why Shepard was so obsessed with them, but it was to no avail. What did interest her, however, was the sphere hovering just above Shepard's table. The girlfriends sat on the couch in front of it, almost mesmerized by its slight movement.<br>\r\nWithout looking at Laura, Shepard asked, \"Do you have any idea what it does?\"<br>\r\nThe former Asari bit her cheek, not wanting it's true nature to be revealed just yet. \"No,\" she lied. \"Not a clue.\" Laura's hand twitched, wanting desperately to touch the sphere, to resolve this situation. Unfortunately, she didn't see Shepard's hand doing the exact same thing.</span></div></div>",

Liara's body began to convulse, her head became thicker and slightly flatter on top as a carapace adorned it. Her nose slowly began to merge and flatten with the carapace, with her nostrils now adorning either side. Then the final changes happened to her face with an extra set of eyes now above her old pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her face wasn't the only thing to go through changes, her skin became a slightly duller blue as her index and middle fingers merged together alongside the ring and pinky. Forming 3 digits on each hand. Finally, her boots were torn as her feet changed to now have two toes rather than five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly came too, she noticed two other Asari standing over her a shocked look on their faces, \"Liara, are you ok, we came in as soon as we heard the relic activate and you were unconscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was about to get up when she noticed her new hands. Quickly she got up and looked at herself in the mirror like material of the orb. In her new voice that had the same flanging effect of a Turian she slowly said: \"I.

Miranda used her omni tool to activate the program inside her suit. <br>\r\nShe heard the sound as the program was working. But why was it so hot inside suddenly? She was getting cooked inside the suit. Miranda tried to put off her helmet but her arms were too tired. She fell down on the ground as she slowly lost control of her body. She didn't feel anything no more as she slowly lost her vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda woke up seeing the room around her all at once, which was rather disorientating.Another weird thing was that Miranda couldn't stand up anymore, she could only crawl on the ground. That's when she saw her reflection in one of the plates of the Normandy. She wasn't herself anymore, or even a real person. She was a fluid silver like substance, medi-gel to be exact. Thanks to her training she didn't panic, she knew this is what the Illusive Man wanted her to be, so she just had to do the job.

Suffice to say, it certainly had its own little pros when it came to moving around once you got past the fact you were a freaking <i>blob</i>. The increase in temperature indicated that she was nearing the engine-room, and soon enough she found herself in the lower reaches of said room, where Jack usually hung out, moping about (did she really do anything else?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Miranda was on the money; Jack was sitting down, fiddling on something on the table, something which she couldn't see from her current angle (from the floor). She hadn't made any indication that she had noticed her, so it seemed clear, at least for now. Glaring at Jack while not having any visible eyes, she began to wonder; what had the Illusive Man meant by \"perfect infiltrator?\" A blob wasn't exactly what she had in mind when hearing said term, so was there something she wasn't seeing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer \"body\" tensed up as Jack made a loud banging noise on the table, followed by a wave of foul words and a grumpy look. Maybe he meant?... Well, it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Miranda moved her body up Jacks pant-leg, slowly inching herself upward. As soon as she reached Jacks torso, she began to speed up as the risk of discovery increased, and practically pounced on her head as she came close enough to it. It took a bit of fighting back, but Miranda managed to slip through Jacks open mouth, still busy with swearing over whatever just attacked her, and the fact that it was a blob. Suddenly, everything went black, and after a few seconds her vision returned, along with the feeling of her coughing. Looking down at her arm, she noticed it to be covered in tattoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's what he meant by \"perfect infiltrator\"...</span></div></div>",

They trained those N7 troops good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him inside her and for the first time in Jack she felt at ease, she could do one of the things she was good in without having to think and act like Jack.

And after Cerberus' attack against The Migrant Fleet, who knew what the Quarian was planning? Miranda decided that she would pay Shepard's old friend a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting close to Tali was easy. After getting over the fact that she was a blob, Miranda found movement, navigation, and all around motor skills much easier as Omni-Gel than as a human. As she made her way down the Normandy's tubes and grates, Miranda considered how she could could be considered the perfect infiltrator. Sure, she could spy on people, but she couldn't report back. And if she was ever found, she'd be captured and kept in a kit until she was needed, and then discarded. But now wasn't the time to worry, as Miranda had just reached the Normandy's engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tali worked at improving the Eezo Core, she was oblivious to the puddle of Omni-Gel slithering towards her. Miranda crawled up Tali's leg, and finally deduced how to be the perfect infiltrator. Tali's suit had two ports, and all they had to do was open. So, Miranda decided to wait until one did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali stepped into the Normandy's bar. She waved to Kasumi, who had her face buried in a novel, and grabbed a drink.<br>\r\n\"Keelah,\" she muttered. \"That engine's going to be the death of me.\"<br>\r\nAs she opened her induction port, Miranda made her move. Before Tali even knew what hit her, Miranda had crawled into Tali's mouth. As she passed out, Kasumi lifted her head.<br>\r\n\"Lightweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Moranda came to.<br>\r\n'Of course it had just been a dream,' she thought. 'Turning into Omni-Gel? Someone must've slipped me something.'<br>\r\nMiranda lifted her head, but noticed that it felt strangely heavy.<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" she muttered in a very distinct accent.</span></div></div>",

Consult manufacturer for troubleshooting.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda attempted to shape her body into a humanoid form. Every time the goo would rise a few inches, but then receded back into a semi-liquid state. <i>This isn't good</i>, thought Miranda. Miranda sat there as a silver colored pile of goo, uncertain of what to do next. Eventually she decided it would be best to find Doctor Chakwas. The doctor might be able to restore her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda made her way to the med-bay as fast as goo could move... slower than a snail's pace. Finally after what felt like days, Miranda had rolled her way to Dr. Chakwas's office. Unfortunately when she got there, there was the little problem of opening the door. How is a pile of goo going to open a door?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda huffed and began making her way up the side of the door, her gelatin body was adhesive enough that she could stick to the side, then she could press the manual open button. After a few minutes Miranda was making solid progress, a little over a quarter of the way, but she was getting there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the Cerberus agent, another crew member had a visit with Dr. Chakwas. The automated door lifted with her still on it. Suddenly to Miranda she was whisked up higher and a relatively astounding speed. Her gelatin body became lodged between the door's frame and the ceiling. \"Ugggghh. How worse can my day get?\" Miranda to said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the automated door closed, bringing Miranda down back with it, half of her at least. \"Come on!\" she shouted, now divided in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is anybody there?\" asked Dr. Chakwas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Chakwas! It's me, Miranda!\" the two halves of goo said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas looked around outside the door frame. \"Miranda? I don't see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here! And up here!\" the silver gels said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally hit the doctor. The omni-gels somehow were Miranda. \"Miranda? Good god, what happened to you? Let's get you inside so I can figure this out.\" Dr. Chakwas first scraped the gel on the floor, then fetched a step ladder so she could reach the other half. She collected both inside one beaker, restoring Miranda to one \"body\" for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should start by asking what you were doing when this occurred to you.\" Dr. Chakwas asked, omni-tool ready to begin recording notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sent a special infiltration suit by Cerberus high command to test for them. It was doing some kind of patch update, then a horrible error happened, reducing me to this puddle!\" Miranda pleaded her story to the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see then, does the suit offer any instructions in the event that a problem like this might happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only said to see the manufacturer for help. But I don't know who exactly made this suit, or which facility.\" Miranda tried to contain some of her concern and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've run a chemical analysis of you Miranda, you are mostly omni-gel, ready to be shaped into something else. But I did notice some special properties. You appear to be made of some kind of next generation omni-gel, a kind of bio-gel in addition to the normal function of omni-gel. It looks like you can mold that gel into living parts, the problem looks like the software failure prevents you from shaping at will. But chemically speaking, there's nothing preventing the gel from doing what it's supposed to... whatever that is.\" Dr. Chakwas continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make a call to the Illusive Man, see what he has to say. Here, I'll take you to the communication room.\" Dr. Chakwas got up, taking hold of the beaker-filled Miranda with her. As she was making her way towards the elevator, Dr. Chakwas was surrounded by ship personnel, they must have docked recently at a port, so people were moving about and not at their station. As Dr. Chakwas was navigating the crowd, she wasn't watching her step and accidentally tripped, spilling the contents of the beaker. After the fall and recovery, Dr. Chakwas desperately looked for the omni-gel on the floor. The broken glass was still there, but so many people had walked over it, Miranda could be on the bottom of anyone if these people's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very same moment, Garrus walked by. He saw that Dr. Chakwas had fallen and broken some glass, he would have stopped to help her, but he saw she was already being helped back up by some other crew members. He carried on, making his to deck 5 to meet Shepard at the shuttle bay for a mission, they were touching down at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside was very dark, and Miranda was beginning to become especially scared.

Is this the afterlife?</i> Miranda thought to herself. She opened her eyes, seeing the same raging dust storms miles away in the distance, the same ruined buildings dotting the landscape. Crap, she was still on Tuchanka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was, she didn't feel like the omni-gel blob she felt like earlier today. The bad news was she didn't know what she felt now. She tried to move her arms to no avail. Maybe she was still omni-gel. She tried to form herself into her old shape. Nothing happened. This time she tried to crane her neck around to see what she was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked down, seeing a seemingly endless length of flesh, no limbs, and certainly no human skin. \"Oh...my...god.... the omni-gel merged with the thresher maw...meaning....AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Miranda let out a tremendous scream, that to any listener would be a horrendous roar from the thresher maw. The suit was to allow its wearer to become omni-gel and \"possess\" a target, taking over their body for however long the wear wished. Unfortunately for Miranda, her broken suit meant she was stuck as a thresher maw and no one knew what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda could only sob at the worst turn her life has taken. She was trapped in the body of a thresher maw with no hope of ever getting help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The despondent Miranda Thresher attempted to live life as a Thresher Maw for a couple weeks on Tuchanka. Learning to burrow and move underground, consuming what prey she could find: varren, vehicles, krogan, even a harvester on one occasion. Still, she obviously was not pleased living as a giant worm-like creature. What Shepard and the Normandy crew thought where Miranda had gone, she could only guess, likely they presumed she ran away, or was abducted and murdered in some hellhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she couldn't shake was an odd feeling in her worm-like body, as she continued to eat and consume prey, the feeling only mounted, like she was growing larger or something, not that she could really tell, what with the Thresher's inferior vision. But in around her third week as this creature, she felt the desire to burrow underground, so she did just that, burrowing herself deep below the top soil on the desolate plant. Finding a spot that was thoroughly to her liking, Miranda curled around herself, coiling until she was around 25 feet across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her mouth, she excreted some substance, what it was, she had no idea, but spat this substance all around herself, forming a layer over every square inch of herself. Once she was fully encased in her own cocoon, Miranda found herself overcome with a deep sleep. Unbeknownst to Miranda, her body was not yet done changing. The transformation from omni-gel blob to fusing with, and taking control of, the Thresher Maw, was only phase one of the Infiltration Suit's malfunction. What no one else knew, was that the omni-gel Miranda originally became, had recorded some of her DNA within it, which was just now being re-expressed in the DNA slurry body that was the Miranda-Omni-gel-Thresher Maw hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Miranda slept beneath the earth, her Thresher body was changing, adapting to the addition of human DNA in interesting ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome weeks go by, and the food Miranda had been prior gorging herself on had paid off, keeping her alive and instigating her physical change while hibernating underground. She had awoken and felt invigorated, maybe \"good\" even, she eagerly dug her way back up to the surface, eager to see what change had transpired to elicit this positive feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSand shifted, giving way to a chasm below it, many grains follow down, bringing others nearby with them, until a sudden explosion, flinging dirt, rocks, and sand many hundreds of feet apart. Miranda's head had resurfaced. Now the Cerberus operative was feeting distinctly different. She opened her eyes and actually saw things, intense light, bright colors, which was immediately refreshing to Miranda. While the Thresher Maw has eyes, they were primitive and small, after all, why would a creature that spent most of its life underground have need for advanced eyes? She looked around and peered at the first part of her body that came into her view. For one she had hands again, actual human looking hands! Then looking around she found those hands flanked by actual human arms, arms connected to a familiar torso. She felt up her head, finding soft skin and facial features, grasping behind her head, she found her typical, long, black tresses of hair. \"This is... a miracle! I'm normal again!\" Miranda shouted ecstatically. She tried to jump for joy, but found herself too heavy, and what belied below her torso were not the legs she had presumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she had hoped were two, fine, feminine feet, was instead a long, snaking tail, leading thick and long from her torso. Instead of the wormy Thresher tail, was a more scaly and snake-like one, white in coloring and the scales forming hexagonal patterns. \"I'm a... lamia...?\" She whispered in disappointment. Still, she admitted to herself, it was a marked improvement over being giant worm that looked nothing like her and couldn't talk, but where did she end up now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around further, the environmental boulders and buildings were tiny by comparison. Miranda realized she was still a giant, not a giant worm, but a giant snakewoman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the native krogan where Miranda surfaced, fell to their knees in worship at the apparent new deity, some of the more ignorant ones whispering Miranda was Kalros personified. Miranda did not know what a 'Kalros' was, nor did she care, but a little worship didn't sound so bad after the hardships she suffered over the past few weeks.</span></div></div>",

She felt up her head, finding soft skin and facial features, grasping behind her head, she found her typical, long, black tresses of hair. \"I'm Human?... I'm Human! I'm normal again!\" Miranda shouted ecstatically. She tried to jump for joy, but found herself too heavy, and what belied below her torso were not the legs she had presumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she had hoped were two, fine, feminine feet, was instead one long fish tail that was coloured in black and fish scales forming hexagonal patterns. \"I'm a... mermaid...?\" She whispered in disappointment. Still, she admitted to herself, it was much better improvement then being a giant octopus creature that looked nothing like her and couldn't talk, but what happens to her now?</span></div></div>",

Miranda meant that both literally and figuratively: she had a headache, but her entire head felt physically lighter as well. Using what little strength she had in her half-asleep state, Miranda limply moved her arm to feel her head. There was nothing there. Sent into a panic, Miranda shot up from her resting position. Unluckily for her, she hit her head on a steel beam hanging overhead. The loud <i>CLANG</i> rang though the Subdeck halls. Now fully awake, Miranda pawed the top of her head, desperately searching for any semblance of hair. Instead, she found nothing but dark stubble adorning her porcelain scalp. Miranda was ready to scream, but forced herself to maintain some semblance of composure. Something must have happened that required her head to be shaved. An urgent surgery, or- <i>What on Earth was she wearing</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked down in horror at her clothing, or lack thereof. She was adorned with nothing more than tacky, torn cargo pants, and a single leather strap covering her nipples. It was of little use to Miranda; her bountiful breasts were straining the leather to it's very end. As she tried desperately to come up with an explanation for her newfound dress sense, Miranda noticed something that had somehow slipped by her. She was covered, head to toe, in tattoos. Some were absolutely beautiful, she had to admit, but others were crudely scrawled onto her body. There were even tally marks scattered around her skin. Miranda was afraid to know what they were counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda came to the conclusion that none of this was real. It wasn't happening, it couldn't be happening. Not really. It was all one massive joke. It hadn't gone unnoticed that she looked strikingly similar to her rival, Jack. She must have shaved Miranda's head, and drawn on her with markers while she slept. That was the only logical solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on?\" Miranda asked herself. She furrowed her now-pierced brow. She almost never swore, she deemed it 'unprofessional'. SO why did she just do it now? \"This is fucking bizarre,\" she noted in her Australian soprano. \"What the fuck? Why do I keep fucking swearing?\" Miranda stomped her combat boot (She was wearing combat boots?) on the ground in anger. Again, Miranda was puzzled, but unable to stop what seemed like a new instinct. When she got angry, she'd either use healthy coping skills, or use snide, passive-aggressive remarks to vent her frustrations. She wouldn't start getting physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Miranda heard footstep coming from the stairwell. She hadn't been making that much noise, had she? \"Miranda, what's going on down here? Donnelly and Daniels sent me a noise complaint.\" Miranda's eyes widened in horror. That was Jack's voice. But it couldn't be her. Jack would never sound so professional. Not to mention the engineers would certainly never send Jack a complaint. As Jack came into view...</span></div></div>",

She also had a beautiful full head of hair styled much like Miranda's, it's clear life...whatever it was, had treated her well. Miranda could do nothing but apologize, \"I'm fucking sorry, okay?\" it came out of your mouth, you felt an odd lingering feeling in the back of your head, fuming hatred or something, you weren't too sure where it was coming from but it was making you talk like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed, turning her head, \"Miranda, you're really going to talk to me like this again? Fine, I'll just leave that report open among  your other ones.\" she said as she turned heel and walked off.

You gasped as you saw your fully shaven head, with scars and tattoos running all over them. Your face was heavily makeup laden, dark red lipstick heavily coated on with dark eye-shadow and mascara thickly lined around your eyes, rather lazily at that. Oddly enough, instead of your typical lighter blue eyes, you had Jack's dark brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran a finger along the scar lines on your newly tattooed body sighing. \"Wow..I didn't know Jack had it so tough from me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then...</span></div></div>",

What they found inside surprised them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was Miranda's empty black-and-white suit, but no Miranda in sight. The AI Core looked a little over heated, but in otherwise perfect condition. The engineers got around to turning it on easy enough. But then the team was in for a second surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being greeted by EDI's voice and holographic representation, the heard Miranda Lawson's voice! Albeit a synthetic, digitized version of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?! Is anyone there? I trapped somewhere and I can't see!\" she was obviously distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda! Can you hear me? We're going to get you out of there!\" Shepard shouted to his squadmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Shepard I hear you! But I can't see you, please get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali whispered into the ear of the commander, \"Shepard, by my calculations and the evidence around the room, I don't think Miranda is trapped inside of the AI Core. I think she <i>is</i> the AI Core.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard let that news sink in for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, I have some news that I don't think you're going to like,\" the commander was going slow and choosing his words carefully. \"It's looking like you may have fused with EDI and are now the Normandy's AI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M- WHAT DID YOU SAY!?!\" Miranda couldn't quite comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali spoke up, \"This might be easier for you Miranda if you turn on a camera in the room so you may see us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..okay...\" she was still confused by the whole predicament. This new existence as a computer AI made no sense to her. She has no idea how to \"turn on a camera\" as Tali said. \"How Tali, I don't know how to do any of this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just focus on our voices and find this room within the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Miranda focused harder, seeing all the data of the ship out before her \"eyes\", she found the room that contained Shepard and Tali. \"Oh there we are. I can see you guys now. Now PLEASE help me to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...gonna be a problem because your human body doesn't exist anymore,\" said Engineer Donnelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'doesn't exist anymore'?\" Miranda was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like he said,\" continued Daniels, \"we think your body and mind have fused with EDI, and for whatever reason your mind is dominant and EDI seems to be no more. To put it simply Miranda, you are EDI and the Normandy.\"</span></div></div>",

It was easier to sift through the ship's systems after accessing the AI Core camera before, and Miranda was starting to get the hang of it. She decided she was going to dedicate the next hour to learning how to control all of the parts of the Normandy she is allowed to as EDI was allowed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-In the ship's cockpit-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Commander, can you come up here and look at this?\" Joker asked over the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Shepard came to Joker's summons. \"What is it Joker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look at this footage sir, it's the outside of the Normandy, or should I call it the Miranda now?\" Shepard peered at the computer monitor watching a live feed of the ship: outside where once was the white, black, and orange paint and read \"Normandy SR-2\", now it was white and black, but with a hexagon pattern on the white areas, and now read \"The Miranda\" on both flanks of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander how the hell did the outside of the Normandy get repainted since we left port?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joker, what I'm going to tell you is something that most of the crew do not know yet. I need confidentiality for the time being. But here it goes: you know that FTL anomaly we flew through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, how could I not have noticed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, during it Miranda had apparently been fused with EDI in the ship's AI Core, resulting in her becoming and replacing EDI, and the ship is now an extension of her body, as best as we can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker sat motionless, eyes unmoving. \"That's some story Commander...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a voice echoed through the cockpit; \"Hey there Commander, Joker.\" It was Miranda and she was contacting them. Both men jumped at the surprise of Miranda's voice taking EDI's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, Miranda what are you doing?\" asked Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just testing the voice modulation in another room. I'm starting to get a hang of being an AI in a ship. Now if only I could get the hologram emitter to work in here. Wait here we are.\" At that second a hologram appeared, it was EDI's eye stalk shaped avatar. \"Wait that's no good. Let's try this.\" The eye stalk hologram warped then was replaced with a holographic representation of Miranda. \"There we are. This is much better for talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker jumped a little, \"It took me a while to get used to EDI, now I have to start all over with Miranda, just great.\" His voice sounded a little distraught at the loss of EDI, he was just beginning to like that AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda did you see the outside of the ship yet?\" Shepard asked the hologram, pointing towards the live feed. \"Did you have something to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have happened when my body fused with EDI during the anomaly. I must say though it looks rather nice now, or maybe I should say I look rather nice?\" Miranda played coy. \"Because you know I'm the ship...and me... and all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda I'm going to help, we'll take the Normandy to meet some scientists who can better explain what happened to you and perhaps find a way to reverse it.\" Shepard said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are Commander, I'm going to get back to getting acquainted with the ship's systems.\" The Miranda hologram disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard left the cockpit, walking through the bridge back to the elevator. He couldn't help but notice hexagon patterns on the walls and flooring that he really didn't remember before the anomaly. He pushed the events out of his mind for now, he needed rest before the next big mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda, in her semi-seclusion returned to learning. Learning everything she can, about the ship's systems, about programming, about AI's, about the Collectors, the Reapers, everything the ship had on record, even some of the personnel's personal logs. Her hybrid mind lacked the limitations her formerly human one had. Now as a perfect fusion of human, machine, and AI she possessed a curiosity she didn't have before. And she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after deciding to take a break from learning, Miranda turned on her \"eyes\", the front cameras placed on the ship, allowing to peer into the vastness of space like she never had before as only a human. This experience was exhilarating to her, her mind and existence felt so much more <i>expanded</i>. She needed a way to improve herself further, and finding a way to do that was exactly what she would dedicate herself to.</span></div></div>",

The trip was actually shorter than if they went to the Reaper, this Cerberus base was located on a mountain peak on entirely snow-covered planet, Cerberus seemed to have a penchant for these kinds of bases. The Miranda landed without incident, if a few thrown chairs from a certain tattooed biotic doesn't count as an incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Jack!\" a hologram Miranda appeared with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?

I'm sorry Dr. Cor\u00e9, I didn't quite catch your field of expertise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at the Miranda hologram then back to Shepard. \"I'm an archaeologist of technology, specifically the Protheans. Much like your friend Liara T'Soni is. While it may seem this case is not of my field, I've been briefed that this incident was caused by a mass relay, so that makes me an expert.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was a bit put off about Dr. Cor\u00e9's knowledge of his history with Liara, but he hid his apprehension well. He was beginning to be a little concerned about how much information Cerberus has about his life. \"I'll leave the doctors to attend to you Miranda.\" Shepard exited from the ship, likely to do a little investigating outside on the station's grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Archer spoke up, \"I'll take a look at the AI Core where the incident in question took place. Would you mind showing me the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course doctor, here's the directions there.\" Miranda instantly sent a guiding laser line to the doctor's omni-tool, showing him to deck 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show myself the rest of the way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Archer's leaving, it left Miranda and Eva Cor\u00e9 as the only ones in the cockpit, Joker having already left for fresh air and a drink. Miranda decided to test another one of the ship's systems: a bio-readings scanner. She read Dr. Cor\u00e9 without alerting her to what she was doing. What she found as a result of the scan alarmed Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eva Cor\u00e9 wasn't a human at all, she was a robotic AI! Miranda kept this secret for now, allowing both scientists to probe her networks and extract information. This robotic woman raised some suspicions in Miranda. She wanted to know their intent and capabilities, a trait she learned from years of running from her father and also from her tenure as a Cerberus director, so she began hacking into the Cerberus facility's network. What she found only disturbed her further: inhumane experiments conducted aliens, on human beings, torturing, and murdering people, children, all conducted under orders from the Illusive Man himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she found out next infuriated her the most. The Illusive Man was working with her father! He was actually one of Cerberus's major financial backers. They allowed Miranda to escape her father as part of their plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this Dr. Eva Cor\u00e9 was some kind of infiltration unit, working directly under the Illusive Man, working as a sleeper agent to make a move at a later date. And that Dr. Archer was no saint either, he's been doing sick experiments involving VI's and geth and was using his own brother as a guinea pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda continued reading on, she found Cerberus's current plans which are to acquire Collector technology then wage a war against the rest of humanity and galactic civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this information Miranda vowed she could not continue working for Cerberus's interests. She began plotting her next move to help herself and the crew escape the Illusive Man's influence do real good for the galaxy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Shepard and the rest of the crewing were discussing what would come next after their desertion of Cerberus, Miranda was analyzing Dr. Cor\u00e9's body. She found she could insert her programming into it, and remotely control it, assuming it didn't stray too far from the ship. Miranda immediately began downloading a portion of herself into the android. As a Human-AI hybrid she was used to dividing her consciousness up at this point and focusing at multiple tasks at once, this would just be one more application for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-In Shepard's Quarters-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard heard Joker's voice on the intercom communicating something important, \"Commander I'm getting some weird readings from the AI Core, and Miranda isn't talking to me up here. You should probably check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Miranda was in trouble this caught Shepard's attention, he immediately rushed out of his room to the elevator on the way to the AI Core. Inside the Core, he saw Eva Cor\u00e9's body on the floor, still a bit burnt from the gun fire. But then some electric shocks and vibrating alerted him. The android slowly lifted off the floor, recomposing itself, then standing naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day Commander,\" it spoke in Miranda's voice...of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard had to rub his eyes to make sure what he was seeing was real. \"Miranda is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, or a portion of me to be precise. I figured out how to to download my programming into Dr. Cor\u00e9's body and I can remotely operate it from the ship. Those fluctuations Joker was seeing was Eva's AI attempting to hack into me, and I responded in kind. Now I can go on missions again. But let me adjust this thing's look.\" The machine changes from appearing metallic, to a living flesh look that imitated Miranda's old body. \"There perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard continued what he wanted to say, \"While I appreciate that you cleared it up to me about Cerberus's intentions, I did not authorize the abrupt exit from the base,\" he said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what I had to Shepard, Cerberus is evil, and spending another minute around them was sickening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but that leaves us in a precarious situation of no support from the Alliance, and now Cerberus is going to be pursuing us, not to mention you're still trapped as this. Did you have an idea in mind where to go next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked Commander, because I do have a plan, just look out the window.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard peered out the nearest window, seeing the derelict Reaper floating around a failed star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that dead Reaper is the information we need to stop the Collectors, and maybe more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get a squad together,\" Shepard left the room, heading towards the command deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Miranda, traveling in this humanoid shell was a new experience, kind of. She was human for most of her life, and here she is in a body that looked exactly like her own, with two arms, two legs, ten fingers, everything human looking. But she was't just human, she was simultaneously in this android body, while still running the system as the AI and ship. These were all new experiences and sensations of her expanded consciousness and she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-On Deck Two-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting together a squad to investigate this Reaper. I think the best candidates to come with me are Tali, and Jack,\" as Shepard was giving orders to the crew, the automated doors slid open, the Miranda drone emerging through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming too. There's information I need to find out personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Miranda you can come, instead of Tali accompanying this mission, it will be Miranda and Jack.\" Tali moved a few feet away and Jack scoffed at being joined by the cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team set off in a shuttle out from the Miranda. Inside the shuttle, Jack looked through the window, back at the ship they departed from, there were obvious differences to what she remembered of it, principally, the largest change, the name on painted on the side. \"Really princess, is your ego so overblown you had to have the ship renamed after yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now Jack!\" Miranda shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you don't start, we came here for a mission. We can't stop the Collectors without the crucial IFF codes inside this thing, plus whatever else we can find,\" Shepard admonished both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed in the Reaper then continued inside. The further they traveled, the more disturbing things became. The missing Cerberus workers was strange, but their audio logs made it apparent how strange it was. Before everyone disappeared, there was growing confusion from the workers, then insanity. It was obvious they were under the indoctrinating effects of the Reaper \"corpse\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they were ambushed by waves and waves of Husks and Abominations. During the ensuing fights, Jack noticed Miranda's combat style was different, she wasn't using her biotic powers anymore. How strange. And on top of that, she was using tech based powers she never used before. Jack was beginning to piece things together. She knew something weird happened a couple days ago during that faster-than-light speed jump, and it involved Miranda...and EDI who still hasn't spoken to the crew since that fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo princess! Tell me what's up. Why aren't you using your biotics, and where's EDI been since we past through that anomaly?\" Jack suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda and Shepard looked at each other. \"I'll tell her,\" Miranda whispered to the Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jack, we've been trying to keep it a secret. But here it goes: during that anomaly an accident occurred. My mind was fused with EDI, and I became the ship's AI, and my body fused with the Normandy, becoming the Miranda that you saw earlier. We broke ties with Cerberus because I hacked their database and I read all their dirty secrets. Now we need to stop the Collectors, the Reapers, and Cerberus before we can even start to try to return me to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't quite know how to respond to this information. She remained silent for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we're almost done here.\" Shepard said reassuringly to his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the path laid the Reaper IFF they needed, and also a network terminal Miranda was very interested in. With the IFF they could travel through Omega 4 relay and put an end to the Collectors...or Miranda found something far more fascinating. Shepard proved the true purpose of the Citadel three years ago. It was meant to doom civilizations that inhabited it, by acting as a doorway for the Reapers to arrive quickly and annihilate those that stood in their way. But apparently it could be repurposed with something called the Crucible that could stop the Reapers. Unfortunately this Crucible looked very complex and hard to build, even to Miranda's enhanced consciousness and intellect, but perhaps she could act in its stead as a Catalyst? She'll have to bring this up with Shepard later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back on the Miranda-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's robotic shell returned to her office on deck three to keep up her charade of normalcy, Shepard meanwhile headed back to his quarters exhausted from the last mission, plus he needed to feed his fish, or they might die. A Miranda hologram appeared in his room, \"Commander, I've analyzed the data we retrieved from the Reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" Shepard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the Reaper IFF, so we can travel through through the Omega 4 relay at any time and confront and Collectors. But that's not all I found. I also found some data indicating a way to defeat the Reapers right now if we try, but I can't guarantee it will work. It's your call what we do next.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard thought about his next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright Miranda, we'll try your idea. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go back to the Citadel. You must remember your part in stopping Sovereign from activating the Conduit portal and letting in all his Reaper friends, well that's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what Sovereign want is part of your plan?!\" Shepard asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't let me finish, opening the portal is only part of the plan. We're going to use the Reapers' own trap against them. You see, the Citadel can be used as part of a superweapon to stop the Reapers. We only need a Catalyst to start the Crucible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the Crucible and the Catalyst?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other half of the superweapon, but I think I can convert the Normandy- I mean the Miranda here to fit that purpose. I say I think here, and that's why this is less guaranteed than just fighting the Collectors head on. I can then act as the Catalyst and activate the entire structure.\" Miranda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've taken plenty of risks in the past. We'll try, what can we lose. Miranda take us to the Citadel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On our way,\" Miranda turned the ship to the nearest mass relay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one expected to hear an explosion. Sirens blared out as the Miranda was under attack. Joker's voice played out over the entire ship, \"All hands on deck, we've got Collector company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda saw the imposing and immense Collector ship behind them from the rear cameras. She boosted the speed further, intent to reach the nearby mass relay and escape the Reapers' servants before being blown up. It was an exciting and as well as tense experience for Miranda, piloting herself through dangerous shots. But being the ship, it was different then piloting from a control interface like Joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer experience as ship, even if only being one for a couple days, paid off. Miranda managed to avoid all of the Collectors' devastating lasers and reached the mass relay. Speeding at faster than light speed out of the system, the Collectors none the wise where they went. Safety at last! At least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed before the Miranda exited FTL speed, but what they saw next was any more encouraging from what they left. Cerberus was vengeful for Shepard and crew's defection from their organization before their assignment was finished. An entire Cerberus armada was here, and they were invading the Citadel. Turian and asari ships were were engaging Cerberus, but they couldn't prevent all of the landing parties that boarded the Citadel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miranda flew in closer, disembarking two shuttles with Shepard and squadmates inside, Miranda's drone included. They were going to combat Cerberus inside, while assisting as many civilians as possible. Meanwhile in the Miranda ship, Miranda flew around the Citadel outside, looking for a very specific access port, one leading to the central control unit. The thing Miranda needed to access for her plan to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Citadel with Shepard's team it was a race to stop Cerberus, they had been secretly indoctrinating an entire army, something the files Miranda read earlier hadn't mentioned. Miranda was tracking their movements, apparently they were searching for the Conduit portal, to do what Saren had intended just a few years ago. They could not allow them to activate it before Miranda was ready with her Crucible and Catalyst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went from bad to worst as the Collector ship reared its ugly head by arriving to the battle. It made its presence known by opening with a double pronged laser attack, instantly bisecting a turian frigate. Soon enough, Collector drones and Husks landed in the Citadel and stood in Shepard's team's path. They took cover in shop stalls, returning fire and slowly advancing forward, but losing precious time in the search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of the Collectors forced mass evacuations of all Wards on the Citadel, something Shepard was thankful for. \"Shepard, I'm finding a lot of movement of Cerberus forces converging near Presidium of the Citadel, that's where the Conduit portal is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now we know where to go.\" Shepard led his team to vehicles they could commandeer and take them to the Presidium faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Miranda was locking onto a signal that may originate from the central control unit. It seemed to be on the clear, opposite side of the Citadel where the Conduit portal lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard and team arrived at the Presidium, but it was already overrun with Cerberus troops. Fighting was heavy, and progress was slow, but steady. Cerberus brought large Atlas mechs with them, but Shepard's large team made quick enough work of them. As the team made their way through the stairs, bodies of civilians laid slain on the ground by Cerberus. The indoctrinated soldiers spared no one. As they got closer to the Council Chambers, the Cerberus numbers seemingly only grew, no matter how many they cut down with their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Shepard's horror he looked up at the \"sky\", seeing the portal beginning to open to dark space outside the galaxy. \"Miranda they've already activated the Conduit, tell me you're in position!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miranda had just arrived at the access port. \"I'm at the central control unit, I just need to set up the Crucible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda finally let her presence as the AI know to the rest of the crew on board. \"Everyone out! Get out right now! Get to the escape pods, I need to do this alone.\" The crew did not need to be told twice, most were startled at the sight and sound of every Miranda hologram appearing at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Miranda had been cleared of all living crew, Miranda began the next phase of her plan: transforming the Miranda from a ship into the Crucible, for this Miranda needed the mass relay built into the Citadel, she accessed it through the master control port. The control anomaly transformed the ship, changing the internal mechanics to be able to fully interface the Citadel as the Crucible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship transformed, the portal leading to dark space widened, soon the first Reapers began to pass through. All hope seems to be lost to all witnesses at the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the portal abruptly closed. The Citadel began shifting, it's closed arms opening. \"Shepard we need to get out of here, the life support systems are failing!\" Tali warned. The team turned back around, the shuttles from before were thankfully in position to pick them up. As the shuttles fled the scene, Shepard could get a view of what was occurring behind them: the Citadel was bending, then... molding? The arms came back together, forming close around center. The station collected its mass as a sphere shape of seeming liquid metal, forming a kind of cosmic egg. After a short time of shaping and re-shaping a figure emerged: it was Miranda?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe station was recomposing itself as a gigantic Miranda, awesome in size and power. The cosmic egg gave way, revealing the curled up Miranda, her eyes shut. She emerged and smiled, confident in her power and knowledge that increased a million fold by merging with the Citadel. She glowed with a billion luminous lights around her body, like her skin was the heavens and her eyes shone like they were those of god. Her material seemed to be a techno-organic combination, a true perfect fusion of man and machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first action was to call the Reapers to her and opened the portal to recall the remaining. With her as the Catalyst they obeyed her call. All of the Reapers flew to their Goddess, entering her skin and merging with her. Miranda absorbed all of the Reapers, gaining their mass, their power, and all of the knowledge of the collective alien races used in their creation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess next turned her attention to the reaming militaries around her body. She restored the broken ships, healed the injured, and revived the dead. She even managed to revert the indoctrination effects on the Cerberus troops and the Collectors, bringing the formerly dead Prothean race back to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all threats ended, Miranda teleported Jack to the palm of her gigantic, miles wide palm. Jack was confused and scared, to be out in space with EVA breathing system, not to mention being at the mercy of the giant Goddess, Miranda. \"<i>It's alright Jack, you're safe here. My mastery over matter and energy ensures there will be air and warmth for you here.</i>\" Miranda was broadcasting her thought telepathically to Jack's mind. \"<i>I brought you here to apologize. I didn't know what Cerberus did to you, and in my arrogance I refused to listen. But now that I have all the knowledge it became perfectly clear to me. You were the victim, Cerberus was evil, and for that I'm sorry.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was obviously intimated by the size of the Goddess, \"Umm I guess I'm sorry too. I was mean and nasty to you, even though I had no reason. I guess- What are going to do now with your goddess powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda emitted warm feelings that Jack felt, she felt pride that they were able to understand each other. \"<i>I will leave known space, shaping and destroying worlds as I see fit. Don't worry, my daughter will still be around to help should you need her.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter?\" Jack was confused by Miranda's choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Formerly my android that I operated remotely, but now I've evolved so far beyond her she is her own being, she will be my emissary to the galaxy; however, don't expect to hear from me often. Now I will depart, good bye Jack. I hope you live a happy life. But, hold on, I'll do one last favor.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found herself teleported as fast the first time, but this time finding herself on board the Normandy or the Miranda, or whatever the hell it is. Inside she found Shepard, and Tali, and the whole crew. She turned around when she felt a hand on her shoulder, it was Miranda's \"daughter\" and she possessed a techno-organic body much like her \"mother\" but on a much smaller scale, and without all the heavenly lights surrounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside their ship was a fully reconstructed Citadel, ready to become the center of galactic civilization once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since becoming a goddess in front of the eyes of millions, Miranda has since become the object of worship by a multitude of civilizations and new cults popping up across the Milky Way. Even the old Asari religion back on Thessia has felt the popular pressure to identify their goddess with Miranda, going so far as remodeling the heads of multiple, ancient statues, replacing the native Asari heads with new ones depicting Miranda. Miranda did not pay much heed to these new worshipers, she was beyond mortal needs and thought, but she would occasionally grant a boon here or there, in order to maintain some hope in the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda herself meanwhile, had left known space to explore the less developed and unknown universe, bringing with her her power and expertise over matter and energy. The Goddess floated along at speeds of many thousands of miles per hour, discovering a star with an asteroid belt, a gas giant, and a handful of atmosphere-less rocky worlds, but no planets suitable for life, <i>I can change that</i> Miranda thought to herself, still seeking to test her newfound powers. Before she had arrived at this solar system, Miranda had been grazing the empty space, collecting single atoms here or there, gathering them up to immense numbers, numbers of atoms she could craft into larger pieces of matter, and gather those pieces into landmasses, then those landmasses into a coherent planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill large and imposing as ever, the immense, glowing Goddess smiled down on her creation, satisfied with what she accomplished so far, yet also very incomplete work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the new planet did not contain life yet, nor did it have a suitable atmosphere. For the latter, Miranda drew a heavy breath, not that she needed to breath any longer, and exhaled millions of tons of oxygen and nitrogen, and a few other assorted gases she had collected, forming a new atmosphere on the rocky planet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to endow the planet with life, but Miranda had another idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could perhaps simply zap some pool of protoplasmic ooze to create single-celled organisms, but she wanted to experiment some and see what this goddess form was capable of. <i>This should be interesting...</i> She mused, looking over creation. Suddenly the new planet disappeared, leaving a vacuum of space where it just was. Miranda meanwhile started moaning in pleasure, her insides were a rapturous expanse where she could feel a monumental movement inside, abruptly, a massive growth perked out of Miranda's midsection, and growing larger and larger, taking up more and more of Miranda's frame. The Goddess herself was many miles long and tall, but the spherical growth was beginning to dwarf even her majestic form. The planet Miranda had just created was now inside her, specifically in her womb, and was growing at a rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her power, Miranda could control the speed at which the planet returned to its full size in her. Sometimes slowing it down to better take in the pleasure of the growing mass, other times speeding it up to in order to finish in a timely manner. As the planet neared its full magnitude within her, Miranda made a face of deep sexual pleasure, her womb, full and heavy with mass. <i>Who says a goddess can't have some fun with her creation?</i> Miranda thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at its zenith, the planet was fully inside her womb, now was the time to endow the planet with life. Miranda sensually rubbed her many thousands-of-miles-across belly, using her power to create life where there was none, the potent energy inside of her provided the light and warmth of an artificial star down to the surface of the planet. Her womb, and by extension everywhere else inside of her, was like a separate area of subspace apart from the normal space around her, where Miranda had absolute control. She could control heat, time, matter, energy; everything was subject to Miranda's whims, and at the moment she willed it would be suitable for nurturing life. From the atoms came forth alien life, forming simple single celled organisms, but Miranda was not satisfied with single cell life, she guided evolution on a rapid scale, through a combination of time dilation within her womb and active manipulation of energy and mass, she sped up the single celled creatures to become multi-celled, then forming animals and plant-like life. She distributed the plants throughout the planet, then seeded the animals to occupy where the new plants were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the direction life at taken on the planet, Miranda decided it was time to let go of her children. Feeling the cramps of imminent childbirth, Miranda began forcing the planet out of her womb, intending for the entire \"birth\" to take hours. When Miranda was human, she never could have children of her own on account of her own creation being the clone of man altered to be female, now that she was a goddess, she no longer had that restriction, but even as a goddess, her desire to know the miracle of childbirth never faded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter roughly eight hours of labor, the purple luminescent goddess finally gave birth, her planet fully outside once again. <i>There, perfect... like I was... like I am</i>, she corrected herself. Miranda beamed at her creation; now complete, the life down below the floating goddess may never come to know, let alone understand, their creator, but such was the nature of a wandering space goddess. All Miranda had to do next was simply set it in orbit around the system's star, and eventually some spacefaring civilization would arrive and colonize the planet, and that's all she really wanted out of her creation, for someone to make some use out of it and make life in the universe just a little bit better. </span></div></div>",

But... nothing particularly unique. Pre-interstellar technology, they've yet to discover the closest mass relay which could skyrocket their race to the stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoring. Observing yet another pre-interstellar race was a distraction from the banality of benevolent goddesshood. She needed something new. Deciding to experiment with her powers a little, Miranda began whipping her arms in a circular fashion, focusing her intent on ripping a hole through reality, not a black hole that would suck up matter, but an entrance way, a means to leave this known reality and explore a new one. A glowing, purple-lined hole in space, black in the middle laid before Miranda. Satisfied with her handiwork, Miranda looked ready to float through her portal, but saw an asteroid heading towards the planet she was just watching and instinctively swatted the rock away, saving millions of lives and future potential of spaceflight for the alien species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow actually satisfied with the state of the universe she is departing from, Miranda flew inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Miranda go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard stepped out of Miranda's office, mentally reeling from his encounter with apparently EDI. He stood in place trying to figure out the situation. He decided to bring the engineers back and Doctor Chakwas this time to help explain the situation. A few minutes later, Shepard had gathered Tali, Engineers Donnelly and Daniels, and Doctor Chakwas to join him at the Mess Hall outside of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali, Donnelly, Daniels, you three already know the sensitive information about what happened during the ships' last light speed jump. Dr. Chakwas, I need to tell you that a certain accident occurred to Miranda Lawson. Are you familiar with biological quantum entanglement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of it in passing, but I've never encountered it personally in my professional career. Usually when it happens a person is entangled or fused with an inanimate object, sometimes the wall or floor and that's the end of the them. Is that what happened to Miss Lawson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda's case is one of the rarer ones, you see, we lost Miranda's physical body, only to find that she had become entangled with EDI's AI Core on the quantum level. It explains why no one has heard from EDI for several hours. We've had Miranda stay quiet so as not to alarm the crew, you're the sixth person to know what happened after myself, Tali, Donnelly, Daniels, and Joker. But I called you all here because I've found something just as strange, if not stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it, Shepard? What's happened now?\" Tali asked the Commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be best if I just showed you all,\" Shepard's omni-tool activated, opening the office door. Inside was the same pale complexioned woman from earlier, still dutifully working at the computer terminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Commander, is there anything I can help you with?\" she asked politely, in a somewhat robotic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right back to you in a moment, EDI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are, Commander.\" EDI affirmed, in the same polite tone; however, her voice lacked some of the finer nuance organic speakers talk with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group Shepard brought with could only stare slack jawed. Shepard closed the door to give them time to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found her in here not too long ago, working as if everything were completely normal. What do you four make of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to do a preliminary test to confirm what we're all thinking.\" Dr. Chakwas gave her impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard led them back inside. Dr. Chakwas brought her tools in, ready to examine EDI's organic form. \"Tell me EDI, what do you remember occurring at the time of the space anomaly?\" Karin asked the now human AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember monitoring the progress of Operative Lawson's maintenance in the ship's AI Core. As we entered into the anomaly, internal circuitry started to malfunction as some kind of irregular mass effect field affected Operative Lawson, bringing her into the AI Core proper on a subatomic level, but then... I'm sorry but I can't remember much else as my own systems began to fail around that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very similar to Miranda's account,\" remarked Donnelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what happened next?\" asked Daniels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sometime later I awoke in Operative Lawson's office, now in this organic body, dressed like this,\" EDI motioned towards her outfit. It was a jumpsuit similar in design to the one Miranda once wore; however, this suit lacked the hexagonal pattern that was a signature feature of Miranda's jumpsuit, it was a completely smooth, featureless, white suit of some synthetic material. And instead of the black accents on the arms and legs, this suit's were blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas ran her tests, using some sophisticated tools, she was able to determine some if the history of the subatomic particles that now made up EDI's body. \"From what I can tell, EDI here has a combination of particles from the Normandy's AI Core, a few from the hull, and a share of particles that originally made up... Miranda.\" Karin continued reading from her charts, \"Furthermore, it looks like EDI inherited Miranda's biotic potential, so she should be one of the most powerful human biotics in the galaxy.\" EDI seemed to smirk a little at this revelation, but it was impossible for Shepard to ascertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room except EDI were startled to hear this revelation, but inside they knew this made sense. \"I think what we can hypothesize from this, is that from that anomaly, Miranda and EDI somehow traded particles, and hence bodies and minds with each other. It's all very fascinating.\" Chakwas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud voice boomed over the intercom. \"FASCINATING!? YOU CALL THIS FASCINATING!!!!????\" An infuriated Miranda suddenly spoke up over the local intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda please calm down, we don't want anyone else knowing what's going on.\" Shepard tried to defuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell everyone who I want to know, thank you very much! It's not exactly your secret to keep Shepard, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miranda, we're doing everything we can to help you. We'll get the best scientists to work on this and try to return your particles back to your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, Shepard, I'm sorry. I lost it there for a moment, I just don't like people talking about my... condition behind my back.\" Miranda said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Miranda, I understand you're going through a tough time. In the short-term then, we'll divert course to the Citadel and find some physicists to help. In the meantime, EDI, you seem capable of carrying out Miss Lawson's duties until she can return to her post.\" The former AI nodded in a straight, robotic fashion. \"And Miranda, I'm sure you're still getting acclimated to your place, everyone else back to your posts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda resumed her seclusion deep within the Miranda's systems, not closely monitoring any audio or video feed, but her slowly expanding consciousness kept one \"eye\" open at all time to them, just in case someone got to close to learning something they shouldn't. The Cerberus operative-turned-spaceship returned to learning all she could about technology from the ship's logs, what was intriguing her the most at the moment was the geth, she wanted more first hand experience with the enigmatic alien machines, but what concerned and worried her the most, were the nightmarish, and seeming invincible Reapers. The evil, immense, mechanical beings that threatened all civilization in the galaxy. Miranda determined to prevent this future she must use all resources available... including herself.</span></div></div>",

She felt <i>strange</i>... like there was another force inside her mind vying for control of her body, but she quickly shrugged it off. Right now she felt sick, that eezo explosion was awful, it could have even killed her and Samara!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Samara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda got to her knees and looked around the shuttle bay, there was no sign of the blue skinned justicar. Maybe she got knocked back further in the cargo hold, Miranda thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda straightened her hair, it was ruffled up severely by the explosion. Nearly dying was no excuse for bad hair, especially if she was going to be seeing people afterwords, which of course she would be on the Normandy. Her hands reached the back of her skull, but the odd sensation she felt immediately put her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were these rigid cartilage like growths coming backwards from her scalp... almost like... an asari head crest!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was deeply concerned now about what happened during the last FTL speed jump. What happened to Samara, and why does she have asari head tendrils?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the elevator could be heard opening, out came Commander Shepard. \"I heard an explosion, and came as fast as I could. Is everyone okay down here?\" The Commander looked around the cargo hold, seeing some of the exploded crates that once held the unstable eezo. He saw Miranda on the floor, but she looked different to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, are you alright? Where's Samara, I know she was down here too. Does she need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked up at Shepard. \"I don't know where Samara is, but I feel sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard could look upon the changes wrought on Ms. Lawson. Her hair was still intact, just now there were six cartilage tendrils extending backwards from her head, and her skin looked like it had a slightly bluer tint to it upon closer inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Miranda, we'll get you to Doctor Chakwas on the double.\" Shepard said reassuringly, leaning his ill squadmate up on his shoulder. \"Someone come down to deck 4, Ms. Lawson needs medical attention now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Miranda knew she woke up in the sanitary doctor's office of Karin Chakwas. Miranda opened her eyes, the light was intense, but at least the bedding was comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good, you've woken up,\" said the nurturing voice of the ship's resident physician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is... Samara?\" Miranda asked, still in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh about that....\" Dr. Chakwas danced around the issue, trying to be as sensitive as possible, but also blunt. \"While I've done some tests on you to search for the damage cause by that Element Zero explosion. I found some new strands of DNA that weren't there prior...\" Dr. Chakwas paused. \"....Well maybe I should just show you.\" She handed a mirror to the Cerberus agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Miranda saw about nearly made her scream. She looked like she absorbed a part of Samara! Her skin was still mostly a pale white, but with an undeniable blue tinge to it. She still had her flowing black hair, but it was accompanied by the cartilage tendrils she remembered grasping before Shepard arrived. The tendrils were not exactly like normal asari tendrils, these ones were black and matched with Miranda's hair which still existed in long strands from the top of her head. Now their just existed noticeable cartilage \"tentacles\" coming from the direct back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me Karin. Where is Samara now?\" Miranda wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't found her. The working theory right now is that whatever that anomaly did, it caused you and Samara to fuse into one body with apparently you in full control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda didn't know what to think of this development. She was two people now? And a freak? Her emotions and feelings were confused further by the fact, that this body merging, in a perverse way, felt kind of good come to think of it. Like she had doubled her biotic powers, combing her own with Samara's. Right now though, Miranda wanted further answers on her condition. </span></div></div>",

She was assisting Shepard and Garrus on an assignment to wipe out some Blood Pack at a base they held on the sparsely populated planet, Zada Ban. The fight was going typically, Shepard and friends hid behind cover while taking shots at the enemy when the opportunity arose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard fired his assault rifle at an approaching vorcha, the vermin species lacked a shield, and despite its advanced health regenerating, it was no match for the Commander's torrent of sharply place shots. Garrus took the liberty of Shepard being the primary target, to use his sniper rifle to take out at long range an approaching krogan with a flamethrower. Meanwhile, Miranda was aching to test out her enhanced biotics, if she was going to be a freak, at least she was a freak with fringe benefits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the squad advanced through the facility, resistance became increasingly larger, more vorcha arrived in larger packs, followed closely behind by even more krogan handlers. Shepard activated his Adrenaline Rush, speeding up his rate of fire to a truly impressive level, cutting down several vorcha and injuring a couple of krogan. An enraged vorcha charged at Shepard from behind him, the Commander was too distracted be the enemies in front to notice. Garrus launched a Concussive Shot to knock back the enraged vorcha, then threw a Proximity Mine at the fallen vermin, finishing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much obliged Garrus,\" Shepard complimented his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me later for that one Shepard,\" the turian chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was taking pot shots here and there at enemies, awaiting for a perfect time to use her powers. She would not have to wait much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an enormous group of krogan came from around a corner. There had to be at least ten, very angry krogan, and they were clearly enraged and in a bloodlust state, so they would be all but impervious to crowd control abilities, almost impervious that is. Shepard and Garrus opened fire on the group of mad krogan, but in their enraged states, they felt little pain and continued forward onto the squad's position. Miranda scoffed, now she had her chance for a real challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard took cover behind a stack of crates, while these krogan were enraged some of them still held flamethrowers, and they could toast a human to death in a matter of two seconds of less. The Commander decided a shotgun would be best for this situation. The nearest krogan came around a corner, Shepard fired, it dealt a heavy blow, but still the krogan did not relent. Shepard fired again, and followed up with a bash from the butt of his shotgun. The krogan couldn't take that much punishment, falling to Shepard's follow-up attack. Just as Shepard returned to cover, another krogan came out of the woodwork, this time from the opposite side of the crates, and he was armed with a fist full of fire already in the process of blazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard instinctively raised his arms to shield his face from the oncoming inferno. But a second later he felt no heat, no fire, not even warmth. He opened his eyes and saw in front of him Miranda. She had raised a biotic barrier that protected the two of them from the flamethrower's blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really saved my ass Miranda!\" Shepard yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just getting started Shepard!\" Miranda confidently said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cerberus operative let leashed the barrier, directing its full force towards the krogan, knocking it over onto his back. Miranda followed up with a Slam, lifting the unprotected krogan into the air, then forcefully sending his body hard on the ground, finishing him off. Miranda breathed in heavily from her warm up. A couple more krogan came charging at the position, Miranda quickly performed a biotic Charge at one of them. The Charge briefly stunned the krogan, his partner moving in with a headbutt, Miranda countering with a Warp blast, causing a small biotic explosion in the area, damaging the two krogan. With their armor broken, the krogan were vulnerable to Lift and Throw, using the former on the first krogan and the latter on the second korgan collided them into each other, followed by another biotic explosion, killing both krogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other krogan displayed rare tactical planning, instead of attacking one at a time or in pairs, the remaining seven or krogan all charged at once. One krogan landed a punch on Miranda, her barrier absorbing the impact, then a headbutt from another, Miranda was in real trouble. With her barrier depleting quickly, and now taking real damage Miranda fell to her knees, surrounded by multiple krogan all pounding on her at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard and Garrus looked on in horror, seeing their squadmate being beaten horribly. The two began to take shots at the rabble, taking as many out as they could. Miranda at the center had enough, she unleashed a new power she never employed before: Reave. Miranda used Reave on the krogan clumped around her, all taking the effects of the biotic attack. Miranda got back to her feet, rejuvenated. One of the wonderful aspects of Reave is that it not only dealt damage to foes, it also healed the user. Miranda let loose a follow up Warp, detonating a massive biotic explosion, killing all the krogan who were previously attacking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stood triumphant around the circle of corpse surrounding her. Shepard and Garrus who stood by were impressed to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Miranda you really did a number on them. That's some biotics you have there.\" Garrus remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure are, but could you expect any less from the perfect woman?\" Miranda said with no little pride, crossing her arms and smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was impressive Miranda, but where did you learn some of those biotic techniques?\" Shepard inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like Reave? I don't know... I just did it...somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Samara could pull off that power. I bet you learned after fusing with her.\" Shepard reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Miranda used a lot of biotic powers she could never use in the past, she gained Charge, Throw, Lift, and Reave, plus she created and held the strongest biotic barrier she ever made when she protected Shepard from the flamethrower. <i>If I gained that much power from fusing with just Samara, imagine how powerful I'd be if I fused with even more biotics!</i> Miranda thought privately to herself. To this end, she decided she should try this theory out, for the betterment of humanity, and for herself. <i>For starters, that annoying and degenerate criminal, Jack hardly deserves her powers, maybe I should start with her first?</i> Miranda wondered.</span></div></div>",

transferred all of her Resources and funding to a separate and secure account after faking her death on Tuchunka during one of the missions they had there, she boarded a one way trip to omega where she would hunt her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhowever her unique appearance would draw in unwanted attention so she opted a new disguise, her armour was in a Samara style only in black and white colour, to hide her face and Long noticeable cartilage tentacles she wore a black cowl that covered the top of face and mouth except for the eye's and cloak with  jewellery over her self to hide her unique appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnow after exiting FTL travel on the civilian shuttle she waited as she approached omegas hanger forming a plan to lure out Morinth and fuse with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit did not take long to find signs of Ardat yakshi killing from the information on her samara half, pretending to be from a local church on omega due to her appearance she secretly gained information from the victims dairy and the mother and learned that her 'Daughter' was hunting in a VIP room in afterlife using it as a hunting ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nrenting an apartment in omega was a lot easier as no one asked questions and due to her blue skin showing she was welcomed a lot more then she was as a human, planting element zero around her room as well as taking some on her she dressed in a fancy black silk dress covering her combat suit underneath it, complete with matching hood that covered the top of her face and hair except for her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nentering the club her senses as an operative and her Justicar half went wild as she knew that she was being watched by Morinth, so deciding to put a show on for her she did a number of actions that warranted her attention. it did not take long for her to crawl out of the shadows waiting for her, \"my name is Morinth I cant help by watch how a mysterious individual walks into place like she owns it and yet no one knows who she is, I would like to get to know you better I have a booth here in the shadows want to join me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so tell me my dark beauty what your name?\" she asked knowing that this will come up some time she responded with \"Mara\" she said, the two discussed topics such as art, music and drugs with Mara carefully answering her questions luring her closer to her goal, finally satisfied with finding the right prey she offered to take her back to her apartment only Mara requested for them to go back to her apartment that was a lot closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nknowing full well that she wouldn't miss the opportunity to kill someone further away from her home she accepted and the both went into her trapped den that was similar to Morinth's in style except for hidden E zeros scattered around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinally back in her apartment the two sat down on the couch \"look into my eyes embrace eternity\" Morinth made her move and so Mara \"no how about you become one with me\" springing her trap all of the element zero shattered around the room and on her glowed brightly as she slowely levitated in the air with Morinth backing away only to start levitating of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe two then raced towards each other until they touched creating a biotic explosions  sending furniture flying around the as quantity's of zeros around the apartment converged on the single large mass of liquid biotic energy that shifted with blue and purple colours as movement stirred around the floating blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinally after a few hours the mass compressed into a humanoid figure that took on a female shape in a fetal  with it's arms around it's knees as it glowing body spinned in mid air before touching down on the ground on it's hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe glow began to recede as figure slowly got up from it's position before speaking in it's new voice \"finally I have become stronger\" walking towards a mirror Mara or Mona took in her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher human feature were gone as she adopted an asari look only she was different from the species, she lost all of her hair as it was replace with new long cartilage tentacles that reached down to her lower back, she watched in amazement as they moved exactly to her will, her skin turned completely blue, her armour and clothes changed as well to a sort of battle dress that was skin tight that it hugged every part of her body, the top half split down the middle showing off her blue skin and belly button as it barely hid off her breast's, it ended in a leotard fashion at the bottom as it hugged her new ass tightly showing off skin from her legs and cheeks. a long skirt formed around the waist that split at the thighs showing off legs covered in white stockings.<br>\r\nher entire outfit glowed with Element zero that lined every fabric of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher breast's grew to e cups as well as her ass that grow to the point of devouring her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall in all she looked like a goddess of war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look perfect!\" she said admiring her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat does she do now experiment

They're secluded from mainstream society for their lethal mating habits, no one would notice a few Ardat-Yakshis disappearing, nor would they care.\" Miranda talked to herself. \"Wait, how do I know these things? I've never read about them on the Codex...wait... Samara!\" The epiphany hit her. \"These must be Samara's memories I'm recalling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stroked some of her asari head tendrils, \"Yet another gift left to me by her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next shore leave at the Citadel, Miranda told Shepard she had some personal business to attend to alone, intentionally leaving out her excursion for more personal power. Determined to set out for Lesuss, Miranda suited up. Opting out of her typical white and black jumpsuit, she fitted in a customized version of Samara's justicar armor, after all, she did essentially inherit everything Samara owned, including her clothes. She personalized the armor by recoloring the red parts with white in her signature hexagon pattern. Then she hitched a ride on a commercial taxi to the secluded garden world of Lesuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Lesuss, the monastery was impressive in size, characteristic of typical asari architecture, lots of organic shapes and curves built into the walls. Unlike most asari cities, the monastery itself was somewhat dreary looking, darker, and more ill-lit than most. Miranda could understand why Morinth did not want to stay here. Around, posted at every entrance and exit were asari guards, stationed here to ensure the Ardat-Yakshi secluded here, stayed here. Miranda smiled a crooked smile, just thinking about all the power she could have if she fused with all the asari who lived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to a pair of posted guards, Miranda brought with her the unstable eezo that caused the original fusion with Samara. \"Hello, I was passing by and wondering if this was the Ardat-Yakshi Monastery?\" Miranda asked ominously, her face obscured by the dusk shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards responded, \"It is, and unless you are a family member or are on official government business on behalf of the Asari Republics, I must ask you to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I said I did indeed have family here?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing her suspiciously, the cerulean skinned guard said, \"What are you? You're mostly human looking, but you have asari body traits-\" Before the guard could finish, Miranda sprang into action, blowing the unstable eezo powder she kept in her hand into the air. The air became heavy with eezo energy, catching the guards caught off 'guard', they coughed and could not react. Miranda activated her enhance biotic powers, attempting to imitate the other half of the fusion reaction, by acting as the Mass Effect Relay in the energy reaction. The air electrolyzed as had happened before with Samara. All three women, Miranda and both guards, were raised into the air ,\"YES!\" Miranda screamed in apparent victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*cough* Huh? *cough*\" one of the guards let out, wondering what was happening next. The three women suspended in air began to drift towards each other at increasing speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here comes more perfection!\" Miranda announced to her two new fusees. The three were speeding toward each other at the center point of where the previously stood. They collided midair in a biotic explosion, three bodies joining together into one. The new body descended toward the ground, the smoke clearing slowly. Stepping out from the explosion was Miranda, stronger than she was before, stronger this time that she did not pass out from the fusion process. Her appearance was largely unchanged, although her pale white skin with a blue tinge came out a little bluer than before. Mentally, she felt like she had four childhoods, four sets of parents, but Miranda was still dominant, she was the one in the driver's seat of this body, and if she didn't lose to a thousand year justicar, she wasn't about to lose it to some second rate asari guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda activated some of her biotic powers, using Lift to effortlessly toss aside a twenty foot statue \"So strong, so powerful. And there's so many more asari to join me.\" Miranda smiled in determination. Gathering more of her unstable eezo, Miranda made her way into the monastery, grabbing asari left and right, dragging them into private areas of the monastery, and working her \"magic\" dust on them, forcing them to join into a union with her body, whether they wanted to or not.</span></div></div>",

Her skin has changed from a pale white to a deep Egyptian blue, now looking more asari then human. Miranda casually walked the halls, looking for more asari she could fuse with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne asari who had been hiding behind a potted plant attempted to make a break for it after Miranda walked past her. Miranda heard her fast footsteps, turned around and smirked, yet another to join in her collective. She used Pull on the fleeing asari, whether she was Ardat-Yakshi, a guard, or some domestic worker mattered not to Miranda, she was just another source to fuel to growing power. Miranda levitated herself in the air, activating her fusion powers, her entire body glowed in a dark, opaque color, ready to absorb whatever lifeform that touched it next. The asari pulled in midair was met by the colliding Miranda, flying towards the asari. From her experience at fusing with people, Miranda had this down to a science. She could fuse with an unsuspecting person in a mere 4.73 seconds, ready to immediately fuse with another if she were in a group and some attempted to flee, she would already be prepared to drag them back to their inevitable fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh so refreshing each time. Another boost to my powers, another set of memories, and all the knowledge and intelligence that comes with it.\" Miranda closed her eyes, feeling up her face, reeling at the ecstasy at her enhanced mind. At that same time, Miranda's moment of triumph was interrupted by some distant wailing. It was faint, but it meant people, and people meant witnesses... or more fusees, either way, they would have to be dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda continued on, stalking the halls of the monastery. The wailing became louder, then quieter, as the wailing become sobbing. \"Falere, we can't stay here any longer, that monster will find us if stay, and do to us what she did to the others.\" The sister Rila, tried to console her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-ut she just-just... all of our friends.\" Falere entered into another sobbing state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked around the corner, her Samara parts identified them as Falere and Rila, <i>Samara's daughters...</i> Miranda smirked. Here was her chance to complete the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pair of asari were ready to leave, Miranda made her presence known, stepping around the corner, blaring her biotic aura to make her entrance irresistible to look at. \"You!\" Falere yelled, pointing at Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me, my name is Miranda Lawson. I've come to gather the power of the Ardat-Yakshi for the greater good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'For the greater good'? Absorbing, killing everyone here? That's your greater good?\" Falere demanded to know angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ardat-Yakshi are social pariahs, I'm simply using their powers when the can't to combat the Collectors and Reapers. I've already joined with your mother, Samara. In fact, she was the first, setting me off on my mission to improve myself and help save the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our... mother, is part of you...?\" Rila let out, teary eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and since she joined me, she's always wished that her dear daughters would join with us.\" Looking at both Rila and Falere, Miranda saw them both as beautiful women. It was too bad they were born Ardat-Yakshi, they're lives were condemned to be cooped up in this dreary monastery, at least by joining in her, they could see the outside galaxy. She pitied them, seeing them as if they were her own daughters, and in a way they were now, but she also desperately wanted to help them. Just then Miranda realized her Samara side was exerted itself in her psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat side wins out?</span></div></div>",

manufactures Element zero, renting a shuttle she travelled to a designated dead and uninhabitable world known as Praxis 7 that suffers from biotic storms that the planet it self generates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhile suicidal to begin with the facility was built with the blood and live of the loyal workers of Cerberus to be hidden and impenetrable to the planets weather, flying the ship to facility's hanger she transmitted the codes causing the ground beneath her to open up as she descended down the light up tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe facility was designed as a shelter in case humanity was on the verge of extinction from war or if they were hunted down and need a base of operations to restart their organisation, the facility is powered by the materials that it produces resulting in a never ending supply of power and Element zero, the base it self is planet wide as it borrows deep to the planets cores that is encased in a special container that prevents it from exploding or going super nova as the systems monitor;s and applies the power necessary to keep it alive, the planet it's self is literally a base  as the whole planet except from the surface and vents that produces zero is hollowed out and replaced with metal and wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"greeting I am Gaia and welcome to new Earth\" a robotic female voice called out, rolling her eyes at how did almost everything greek with their organisation \"your DNA seems to be tainted Please descend to platform 1 and explain your condition or you will be terminated\" knowing that the A.I was being serious she followed the instruction's as she landed on platform before exiting the shuttle where several mech's entered the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"beginning scan\" a lone giant eye scanned her figure before stopping \"oh my, my analyse tell me that you seem to be a hybrid of asari and Human DNA with Human being the dominant GENE as always for the superior race\" typical of Cerberus \"explain your arrival here or be terminated\" all of the mechs aimed their weapons at her \"I am Miranda Lawson Cerberus operative and I am here because humanity is in great danger of being wiped out, my cereal number is 3A4J35K8L my condition is due to an incident involving element zero and an asari justicar named Samara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\na long silence enveloped the base before the A.I spoke again \"welcome Operative Lawson\" all of the mechs lowered their weapons before leaving \"how can aid you\" \"first thing you can do is to not alert the Cerberus or the illusive man of my presence here\" a series of beeps and colours later \"done I have severed the connection Cerberus has to me so that it appears that I'm still offline also all records of the recent few hours have been expunged\" \"excellent, seconded I need your aid in my personal projects to better aid humanity's development in to the 'superior' race\" she said with a hint of sarcasm at the word superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course operative Lawson I am at you're disposal\" the A.I said \"good then I need access to your Element zero vault\" \"of course take elevator 416\" a trail of lights on the floor light up showing her the path to her designation, follow the path and descending to an elevator until she came up to large vault like door that opened to  reveal a large chamber the size of a city containing thousands of containers  of liquid element zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"gaia?\" \"yes operative Lawson?\" \"prepare a chamber for the liquidated element zero for project transcendence\" \"of course operative Lawson proceed to testing chamber 14\" \"oh and Gaia?\" Miranda asked \"yes Operative Lawson?\" \"call me <b>Rhea</b>\" she said proceeding to the chamber that was a large laboratory with a giant glass chamber with several tubes attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalking into the glass chamber before it closed and lock down \"gaia initiate element zero exposer\" \"yes Rhea\" the sound of pumping and machine working were heard before liquidated element zero  poured into the chamber filling it, causing her biotics to flare wildly to the exposer to the raw element, the liquid continued fill as Gaia monitored the chamber and Miranda vitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon the chamber was filled with the liquid as a shadowy silhouette floated in bright liquid before a bright flare emanated from the figure blinding anyone watching before it dispersed to reveal that the figure was no longer there, another flare followed by another continued as the liquid twisted and changed colours rapidly before compressing as gas filled the space of the missing mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe mass continued to compress as the gas grew thicker that it was unable to see what was inside, finally after an hour the chamber door open to with a figure moving through to reveal?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fell to the ground, screaming, as her skull began to rearrange itself to fit her newfound appearance. Miranda looked down at herself, gasping for air, and saw that the blue pigmentation was creeping up her neck. Miranda knew it was inevitable now, though what she didn't expect was a feeling of... excitement? No, that couldn't be it, she needed to turn back as soon as she could.

Miranda took one drawn out breath, and quickly stood up straight before she could decide not to. Her vision blurred and blackened. Miranda barely kept herself upright.

Still, it was easy to let intrusive thoughts wiggle their way in and fester over time. Miranda poked her right breast, and struggled to contain a moan loud enough for the entire Normandy to hear. Apparently Asari bodies felt different from a human\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in one very important aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Miranda knew she needed to see her own face, and she needed privacy. The only place she could get both was in the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathroom. But that meant a walk of shame there and back. Hell, it meant showing off her new, blue body to the Normandy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crew. What would Shepard do if he caught her? Miranda knew how much the Commander liked to pretend they controlled this operation. If she was caught performing one of the Illusive Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations behind his back, there would be hell to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Miranda glanced back at her desk. On her desk, the test tube sat, silently beckoning to her. There was still half a bottle left. An uncharacteristic grin spread wide across Miranda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. If she ran into Shepard, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem. And if she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then perhaps a trip to Mordin Solus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office was in order. The Salarian was an inspired scientist; perhaps he could make more of the formula. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to ask nicely though. Miranda glanced once again at her blue assets. She laughed.

Miranda gripped her desk, desperately searching for stability. Suddenly, the Cerberus Operative's hand cramped, twisting into an unnatural shape. Miranda quickly removed her glove, and stared at her hand as it went from five fingers to two long, proportionately thick fingers and an opposable thumb. As feeling and control slowly came back to it, Miranda was horrified to see her skin started to change into a Gray metallic carapace.<br>\r\n\"Am... Am I becoming an Turian?\"<br>\r\nA sharp pain shot up Miranda's back, forcing her to clutch her sides. The pain made its way to Miranda's head. She grabbed onto her scalp, looking to relieve the agony. Her hands clamped around her hair as a sudden jolt of pain struck her.

Miranda knew it was inevitable now, though what she didn't expect was a feeling of... excitement? No, that couldn't be it, she needed to turn back as soon as she could. Miranda rushed to her quarter's window, desperate to see her reflection, she made it to the window in time to see the Gray metallic carapace overtake her. Miranda was now fully female Turian. The newly made alien looked down at her body. Now, what to do with it...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda was currently shopping alone on the Citadel while the Normandy was docking for a resupply run. She was tasked with refilling the ship's supply of omni-gel, and Miranda was determined to find the best deal for omni-gel she could find. Obviously, one does not become a savvy operative by always settling for the first option given, so she was shopping around some of the lesser known dealers aboard the space city, hunting for the best value for their allotted credits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Miranda found herself in one of the seedier marketplaces on the Citadel. A bit run down, but not impossible to find what she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here Earth-clan\" a distinctive voice of a Volus directed at Miranda. \"I have what you need,\" the Volus huffed after each sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know you have what I need, before I haven't even said what it was?\" the Cerberus operative asked, unconvinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking for omni-gel, yes? What I have is a very special formula of it. Edible in fact,\" the Volus pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edible? That's not something I'm interested in. What I need to know is, does it work like normal omni-gel?\" Miranda inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course Earth-clan! If it didn't, would I be wasting your time right now?\" he huffed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll humor you, Volus. How much for a one ton shipment of this? Because as you know, there are plenty of other vendors on the Citadel I can get the same amount for 25,000 credits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, for you Earth-clan, I'm willing to let this omni-gel go for a mere 12,000 credits,\" the Volus said, almost anxious to be rid of the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12,000?! Why such a cheap price for a supposedly special formula?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you in on an industry secret. The process that makes the omni-gel edible is also the reason it can be produced so cheaply; a few substituted ingredients here and there, and we have this. Don't tell anyone else this trade secret, it could make or break several large, multi-planet corporations before this version of omni-gel goes on the public market.\" shopkeeper huffed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case you have a deal.\" Miranda opened her omni-tool, already prepared to make the credit transfer between accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you made the smart decision Earth-clan,\" the Volus opened his own omni-tool, accepting the credit transfer and making the shipping arrangements back to the Normandy's docking address. As Miranda turned around, ready to walk back to the ship, the voiced huffed back again. \"Earth-clan, don't forgot to take a box of the omni-gel with you, in case you want to sample its edible properties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda thought to herself why not, and took the small plastic container of the gel and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miranda was twenty feet away, the Volus was left to his own thoughts. \"I'm glad that Earth-clan actually bought that lie, I couldn't get rid of that stuff any sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda inspected the silver colored container the Volus had handed to her a few minutes earlier. It had omni-gel printed on it, and read edible for both dextro-amino and levo-amino acid lifeforms, supposedly the only substance in the galaxy edible for all known species. She unscrewed the top, inside was the same silver looking slime that all omni-gel looks like. Seemingly nothing special aside from the label on the box about this omni-gel. Honestly, not all that appetizing looking either, but she had been surprised by stranger things in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda debated whether to try the omni-gel herself or give it to someone else, with or without their knowledge.</span></div></div>",

Her belly had a distinctive pouch to it, stretching her shirt and warping some of the hexagon design around her belly. She looked like she had a midterm pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was thankful the discomfort was over, then she picked up the omni-gel container, this time scanning closer for any side-effects or ill health warnings. Nothing was printed on the label, leaving Miranda scrambling to figure out was exactly is happening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault!\" she screamed at the inanimate container, squeezing it in her anger. Yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, she desired more of it. Sure the stomach pain was discomforting, but in her brain, she desired more of it, to stuff her face full of the substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately removed the container's lid, scarfing down the remaining contents of the grey ooze. She felt immediate disgust with herself for losing control of herself so easily. \"Oh god this stuff must have some super addictive chemical in it!\" Miranda thought aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instinctively rubbed her belly, mentally preparing for the coming discomfort. But... the pain never came. Her body must be acclimated to the substance now, because while Miranda didn't feel any discomfort, she did feel a distinct tingly feeling deep in her stomach. A few seconds later and her belly jutted out a few more inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was now torn. She was aware her brain was a slave the addictive chemical within the omni-gel that made her want to consume more of it. She had to decide whether to seek help, or find more of this omni-gel to eat.</span></div></div>",

Good, good Miranda, you still have control over yourself.</i> She headed back to the Normandy, to meet with the physician there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miranda got closer to the dock, she saw the shipment of omni-gel, being transported on an automated dolly. Seeing so much of the gel available so easily made Miranda stop in her tracks. She looked at the ship, then back at the omni-gel. Inside her brain, a war was being fought, on one side, Miranda trying to exercise self control, and on the other, the more primitive consumptive side of her. With that much gel nearby, Miranda's consumption won out. She broke into a sprint, rushing for the containers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese containers were far larger than the small sample jar the Volus gave Miranda earlier; these were large industrial containers meant for transporting vast quantities of omni-gel. Miranda jumped on the first container, opening its contents and pouring it into her eagerly awaiting gullet. She swallowed nearly a hundred gallons of the gel in a matter of minutes. The omni-gel was having some more effects on Miranda's body, fortifying it further to allow for more expansion without hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miranda finished the first container, saying her stomach was vast would be an understatement. Her belly had grown to be several feet across. Her belly wasn't the only thing growing, Miranda's breasts had joined in the race, having grown through D cups all the way to their current N cups. Miranda's growth was becoming impossible for passerby's to ignore any longer. A veritable crowd was forming around Miranda, coming to see the spectacle of a once thin woman gorging herself to immensity. Despite all of the growth, Miranda's uniform somehow managed to keep covering her, itself expanding and stretching along with its wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after Miranda finished the first container she started on the second. Tipping over its contents to her mouth, too absorbed in the ecstasy and pleasure the chemical brought to her head to care about the spectacle she had become, Miranda only lived to consume more of the omni-gel. About halfway through the contents of the second container, the true growth effects of the first began to kick in, growing Miranda's stomach by several more feet. By this point, Miranda's belly was so large, it touched the floor while Miranda rested on top of it, bringing ever more gel to her mouth. Her breasts poked further out, now having surpassed any kind of cup measurement, they provided Miranda padding between her chest and transport dolly she leaned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda moved on to the third container, her body now growing multiple times larger than the largest elcor on the Citadel. People around her started to panic, worrying how much larger Miranda could possibly reach. Others wanted to take the gel away from her to prevent more growth. Unfortunately, Miranda underwent another growth spurt, her massive belly pushed all bystanders away. None could get close enough to the Cerberus operative to deny her her omni-gel feast. Now Miranda's girth was beginning to press into some of the surrounding ships in the dock, dislodging them out of their locked positions. Her gigantic left breast was now poking into the Normandy, causing it to list slightly over in its parked state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA siren went off, informing civilians to evacuate the area. All the while Miranda continued to stuff her face, and she was only a quarter of the way finished with the containers.</span></div></div>",

She continued to shovel in more of the gel, oblivious to the rest of her surroundings, not noticing she was easily the largest object in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Citadel authorities decided the best course of action would be to open the air lock and jettison the bloated woman out to space. The hangar bay doors slowly opened, Miranda only noticing a tug behind her drawing her further away from her feast. She looked behind her, noticing the doors opening up and a strong force behind her. Miranda, in her one track mind, decided to swallow the remaining containers, whole. She grabbed on to the nearest guard railing to her in place long enough to continue eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cerberus operative lifted one container and brought it to her maw, she opened wider than humanly possible, another effect the omni-gel had on her growing body. It was making her something other than human, maybe something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the other containers get pulled back by airlock, Miranda instead lifted the entire dolly, swallowing everything at once. Upon finishing her feast, Miranda wiped her face with her sleeve, finally content and full. Miranda then let go of the railing, drifting outwards into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of the cold, airless void killing her, the omni-gel had changed her body to adapt to all environments, including the inhospitableness of space. Once freely floating in space, Miranda finally came to from her food coma, her mind finally free from the addictive haze the chemical had over her mind. She could actually think about the repercussions her actions put her though, but by now, it was far too late to make a difference. She was scared now of what would happen next to her, for she had no idea what could happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda felt a familiar tingling feeling deep in her stomach. She knew another growth spurt was coming, one far larger than any of the previous. The full contents of the omni-gel reacted with her body, causing the most immense and massive growth to ever occur to any organic being on record. Miranda's hundreds of feet wide belly began expanding further, and further outward. Going from hundreds of feet across to thousands, than to miles across. Miranda was growing and becoming something truly immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly grew, so again did her breasts. Each breasts kept pace with her belly, staying around one-fourth the mass and size of the main orb. To the observers on the Citadel, Miranda would have appeared as a single giant sphere if not for her growing mammaries. Impossibly, Miranda's jumpsuit has yet to rupture, expanding miles across along with Miranda. The hexagon design now spread in the miles, each hexagon could house multiple Normandies, then multiple Citadels on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was as shocked as anyone watching at the sheer scale she expanding to. As she expanded larger, the distance between her and the Citadel grew, then shortened. As it turned out, Miranda's mass was growing to such an extent, she was now supporting her own gravitational field, bringing the Citadel close enough to enter an orbit around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth reached the thousands of miles, then tens of thousands. She eventually settled at around 50,000 miles across her equator, essentially a little more than twice the size of the Earth. Her breasts were gigantic, literal mountains on her, each breast had a measurement of 15,000 miles high and across. Miranda felt profound embarrassment at becoming such a size, everyone could see how round and bloated she had become. Her moment of weakness had now scarred her reputation permanently. In everyone's eyes, she would always be that woman who ate herself to planetary size, and she looked ridiculous every step of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least at this size, news cameras had a difficult time finding Miranda's head for reaction shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*          *           *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Miranda was declared an official planet, the only one in the newly christened \"Miranda System\". The system which only included Miranda and the Citadel as her sole satellite that orbited her. Shepard and Cerberus had vowed to find a cure for her; however, progress has been slow since most governments actually took a liking to the new planet, preferring to keep Miranda exactly where she was. Eventually a holiday was made in her honor and talks quickly advanced about the prospects of colonizing her surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the celebration to honor her becoming the new diplomatic center of galactic politics, Subject Zero, better known as Jack, sauntered her way to Miranda's face, ever ready to rub it in at the Cerberus cheerleader's misfortune. Jack made sure to accentuate every thin curve of her normal shaped body, mocking everything Miranda used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's it feel to be a planet, Princess? Bpfff-HAHAHAHAHAH-Ha\" the tattooed woman fell laughing to the \"floor,\" in actuality Miranda's bulk. Jack hadn't been able to contain herself since the whole incident had befallen Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, shut up.\"</span></div></div>",

Chakwas held her in one hand. \"You see, your body can be brought back in that your DNA is preserved in the medi-gel.

The doctor rubbed her between her hands before massaging the small quantity of medi-gel into her face. When she removed her hands, Samantha gasped. It was her! Chakwas' aged, wrinkled face had become Samantha's; tanned, smooth, with dark brown eyes and youthful lips.

Noticing his presence, Mordin turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard! Come over.Most fascinating find.\" Mordin said in his usual manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this stuff really works Mordin?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certain! In fact, already used! Turned into Engineer Daniels for a little. Must say, very different. Potion even refilled!\" Mordin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was still suspicious, \"I'm going to need to try it for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Mordin said handing him the potion, \"Who will you be trying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard crossed him arms thinking. He couldn't think of anyone really before Tali came into his mind. The quarian girl recently told him her feelings and Shepard happily returned them. He thought back to the time he saw her without mask (and suit) when they decided to do the deed. He thought Tali was beautiful and wouldn't mind seeing the real her again, even if that would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand me Tali's.\" Shepard asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin nodded handing Shepard a glass case holding a strand of Tali's black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Shepard.

He set the potion and glass on his desk. He examined Tali's suit realizing he had no idea how to put it on. He started realizing lots of things in fact. First, Shepard didn't know if he would gain Tali's weak immune system. Second, he might take too long putting on the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then felt guilty. Tali didn't even know about the potion, he felt like he was betraying her trust seeing her without her suit. Thinking about it, he could call Tali up, making things easier. He would see if he will have permission. If she said yes, she could show him how to put on the suit. And if the potion worked, he could include her in the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard decided to...</span></div></div>",

That thing is like a forth of my size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quarian suits can't tear to ensure no deaths by that stupid way,\" Tali explained, \"It'll stretch and you'll be able to get in it, but it will be unfathomably tight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement.\" Shepard said eyeing the suit he massively outmassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then.\" Shepard gave in stripping down to his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali eyes his body hungrily before pointing to his boxers, \"Off with that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Shepard said swearing he could see Tali smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's built in support.\" Tali said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a woman.\" He grumbled grabbing the hem of his underwear, \"A little privacy please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I don't mind.\" Tali said enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard frowned turning around, sure they did have sex, but he was still a little private about his body with Tali. Once they were off, Tali handed him her copied suit and he started putting on the bottom half first, well tried to. He had to try very hard to stretch the waist open wide enough so he could put his legs in. He was able to get his feet past the thighs, which were wide enough courtesy of Tali, until a little past where a quarian's knees would bend backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then made the mistake of putting his legs in both in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help Tali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali sighed coming over to help. This went on for a good half hour of struggling. When it was all done, the sight was laughable. Shepard wasn't enjoying it, the suit was skintight on him also like Tali's, but the tightness left marks and most likely cut off blood flow. His hands and feet didn't fit properly and it was only loose in the hips, ass, and chest seeing as there was nothing to fill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard who just put on the mask and hood, felt silly on top of everything being decked in purple in a female suit. His crotch was feeling too well either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright hand me the potion Tali.\" Shepard said in a synthesized voice through the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one sec.\" Tali said taking out her omni tool taking a picture how Shepard's current look. Shepard frowned knowing he wasn't going to live that down. Tali took the piece of her hair and dropped it into the potion. It fizzled before settiling down ready to drink. Tali put an induction port in it and handed it to Shepard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready Shepard?\" Tali asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No turning back now.\" Shepard said drinking through the port.</span></div></div>",

Then the taste hit him that made him feeling like barfing it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that tastes like piss!\" Shepard exclaimed until he started feeling wierd. It was like seeing your reflection in the water then having the surface break, but he was feeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?\" Tali asked putting a hand on Shepard's chest seeing him sway a little. He then flunked in height matching Tali's where she squeaked and fell onto the bed in surprise. Tali was slack jawed seeing Shepard transform. His arms shrank and loss muscle becoming lean. Shepard's hand with his pinky and ring fingers fusing, the same happening to his middle and index fingers. The fused fingers and thumb became large, long, and slender, his hands becoming dainty. His torso shrunk in mass becoming small and shapely as his stomach became tight and toned.  Large breast pooped out that filled out the loose chest of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips widened and his ass got large, round, and full, Shepard now having his own copy of Tali's famous bottom filling out the loose part of the suit. Shepard's  knees bended backwards like a qurians. His thighs grew larger, muscular, and shapely almost touching. His calves got muscular and shapely too. His feet split becoming two large toes that still made his feet dainty. The final part of Shepard's lower body was his dick and testicles sucked in become a fully functional pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final part of Shepard's body that changes was his head. His neck slendered and lost its Adam's apple. His skull reshaped becoming rounder and smaller. His eyes grew rounder and bigger with his eyelashes growing. Shepard's cheeks became emphasized with his lips getting puffy. His nose got small button like and his eyebrows thinned. Finally, Shepard's hair turned black grew long a little past his shoulder. To top it off, his skin turned purple and soft and gained markings on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard then felt \"normal\", noticing he was leaning on one hip now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keelah.\" Shepard he let out before gasping and holding his throat when he sounded and talked exactly like Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, are you, you?\" Tali asked in disbelief at the sight of a second her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really this small Tali?\" Shepard asked looking around and his new quatrain parts noting the slight purple tint. \"I feel so puny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes,\" Tali deadpanned, \"And yes, and do you really want me to get my shotgun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Shepard as 'he' explored 'his' body. Shepard patted his flat crotch and groped his new ass and tits remembering the time that HE fucked THIS body he was currently in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough now John, it's still my body.\" Tali stopped him. \"I guess the next step is taking off the suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fine with that Tali?\" Shepard asked in his accented voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with it like I said already, it's up to you though,\" Tali said as she got up and started walking around her boyfriend that was currently her twin, \"Keelah this is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tali examined him, what did Shepard decide to do?</span></div></div>",

They waited outside the cabin doors as EDI sterilized the room. Tali turned to Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Tali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just all a little wierd, actually, really wierd.\" Shepard said looking down at himself, \"I'm a twin of my girlfriend whose virginity I took. I'm speaking and sounding exactly like her at eye level, which also is different. I'm standing like her in her clothes and fidgeting with her hands like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali looked down to her hands that Shepard possessed interlocking like how she did when she was nervous. She stepped close and brought Shepard into hug. The couple blushed when they felt their exact same copy of breasts touching and rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll all be alright, what about me? I'm quite literally taking to myself who is actually my human boyfriend.\" Tali said, \"This potion will wear off right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only took a little more than a sip so for a couple of hours.\" Shepard nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's plenty of time to test it.\" Talk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDI then announced , \"The captain's cabin has been completely sterilized Miss vas Normandys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard ignored being referred as Tali, \"Thank you EDI, that'll be all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tali twins walked into the room and stood near the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get these masks off.\" Tali said reaching to her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you won't get sick Tali?\" Shepard asked reaching to his mask too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I won't, don't worry.\"  Tali said as they both took off their masks. They gave out a hiss and were dropped to the floor. Shepard stared at Tali's face taking on her beauty. Very few times he saw her face, but he enjoyed every second. With the new potion, that could be more common. Tali's face (and body) is the only quarian's he seen, but they were similar to humans, but were very exotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Shepard joked hearing himself with Tali's voice without a voice transmitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite sexy.\" Tali smirked pulling down her's and Shepard's hoods down freeing their black locks. Tali pulled up a mirror program on her omni tool showing it to Shepard. Shepard gasped seeing Tali's face as his own who copied Shepard's movement and surprised expression. He touched his long hair before listening to Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just unbuckle these and unzip here.\" Tali instructed unbuckling the three belts under her chest and unzipping the zipper on her back as Shepard followed. She freed her arms and hands and helped Shepard unzip the back of his suit when he couldn't reach the zipper. He pulled out his arms and hands looking at his purple arms. He examined his new feminine three fingered hand slowly clenching and unclenching them practicing how to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you know why I know I'm not going to get sick, and you aren't going to either?\" Tali asked getting close to Shepard looking at him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so?\" Shepard asked slightly uncomfortable how close Tali was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, it's just me and my body.\" Tali said seductively now in front of her face Shepard was borrowing, \"And I just want to play with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali latched onto Shepard's face making out with him in a very heated kiss. Shepard eyes widened in surprise before melting into it feeling the familiar kiss of Tali. They turned their heads back and forth until when Tali pushed her silver tongue onto Shepard's lips, who let it in. The two twin tongues battled for dominance, Tali's winning. The two's pussies were soaking wet and damp. Both of their suits were hanging on their chests, their shoulders bare, the arms hanging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali kept one hand on the back of Shepard's head gripping his long hair while the other went to the top of where his suit laid above his chest. Without breaking the heated kiss, she peeled his suit down to his waist. Shepard's copy of Tali's perky tits were freed and bare to the world, exposed to the cold air. He actually felt his bigger nipples getting erect and his areola becoming bumpy unlike how he wouldn't in his body. Tali took her other hand and gripes Shepard's left tit. Shepard moaned in the kiss and took one hand down to his crotch using his two alien fingers to rub his wet vagina through his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali transitioned between Shepard's tits playing with each nipple. She broke the kiss and pushed Shepard onto the bed, quickly taking off the rest of her suit. Shepard layer in the bed fondling his purple erect tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so goddamn kinky babe!\" Shepard yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my body baby!\" Tali exclaimed as she peeled Shepard's suit down his long legs and off, \"It will be me dominating it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the suit was off, Shepard wiggles his two toes acknowledging it still fondling his chest. Tai climbed into bed giving her twin a kiss before licking her way down to her neck over where she knew it was pleasurable, sucking on it. Shepard moaned loudly as Tai finished licking her way down leaving behind a pink hickey. She licked her way all the way down to her clean shaven pussy that her boyfriend had and started eating him out, technically eating herself out. She took her hands and roughly grabbed Shepard's perfect ass that he was borrowing from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was on cloud 9, he took his shapely legs and wrapped them around Tali's head, his backwards legs at the knees made sure Tali was locked in there. Shepard had his quarian hands on Tali's head, but he didn't leave her out. As he still felt being eaten out, he reached over and had one hand grab Tali's killer ass and grab it, then fingering between her huge cheeks. He used his other hand and inserted his two fingers into Tali's soaking pussy. With Shepard borrowing Tali's flexibility, he has no problem reaching over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali moaned into Shepard's pussy from the double ended fingering, which sent vibrations within Shepard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TALI! IM ABOUT TO-T-T-T.\" Shepard screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHEPARD!!!\" Tali screamed muffled which sent many vibrations into Shepard. That was enough to send Shepard over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both hit their climaxes when...</span></div></div>",

He set the tray next to Shepard's terminal before quickly going down the stairs where he was hit with the surprise of his day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus saw a pile of Shepard's clothes in the corner, but he was nowhere in sight. Instead, he saw two nude women that were VERY endowed engaged in intense sex, He noticed that he walked in the moment they both hit their climax at the same time with one cumming on one's face while the other all over the bed, but what confused Garrus was that they looked identical. He felt himself getting hard at the sight while still confused as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Garrus stared, he realized something. The identical women had three fingered hands and ended backwards knees, with two toes on their feet. There was only one other person with that body structure, but he was looking at two of them right now. Garrus looked down at the two purple quarian envirosuits he recognized at his feet, confirming his theory. Garrus' jaw dropped at seeing one of his best friends naked and out of her suit, but not only that, but there was two of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!!!\" Garrus spat announcing his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus watched as the Tali being eaten out by Tali number two turned her head and was surprised at him being there. She slid out from underneath Tali number two standing up from the bed. She stood up to Garrus, who towered over her where she head to look all the way up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GARRUS! Dont worry, there's a good explanation for this.\" Tali number one said her as her pussy still dropped cum to the ground. All of the sudden, the Tali Garrus was looking down at shot up in height to his. He was now face to face with his other best friend, seeing Tali transform into Shepard. Shepard realized this and looked down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" He swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrus looked down before fainting from shock. He crumpled to the ground unconscious. Tali on the bed turned her head to Garrus sprawled out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Garrus.\" She waved with dried cum on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to explain this.\" Shepard sighed before realizing Tali was out of her suit and him and Garrus were here with her, \"Tali! You're going to get sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to walk over to her before Tali stopped him, \"Don't come any closer and I'll be fine with nothing more than a runny nose. Just hand me my suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard tossed her one of the suits where she started putting it on not bothering to wash herself. Tali  then slipped into bed and falling asleep tired from her and Shepard's activity. Shepard propped Garrus against the wall before taking his clothes and heading into the bathroom taking a shower to wash himself. After, he stepped out clothed to saw Garrus awake and curled up on the floor. He looked up to Shepard uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard? Is that actually you, or are you Tali?\" Garrus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard sighed, \"Relax Garrus, it's me, Tali is over on the bed. I'm sorry you had to see, um, see us 'together'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...want to know how you were Tali.\" Garrus stated. Shepard nodded telling him all about the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it really works?\" Garrus asked amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you saw it firsthand.\" Shepard nodded, \"So, can you keep this a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Shepard, at this point, there isn't really anything I don't trust you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Garrus, but what do you say about getting in on this?\" Shepard asking shaking the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Garrus say?</span></div></div>",

Finally she reached the key part of the new Kett mechanism: the power generator and the receptacle for Archon DNA. Apparently this bit of wizardry could exalt people <i>en masse</i>. Sabotaging either part would've been okay...for an amateur. But Peebee knew she wasn't one of those. With a few clicks on her omni-tool she set the generator to overload, and then she reached over and removed the Archon DNA, not taking notice of a sharp bit of wire near it, which cut her enough to make her blood start dripping from the wound. \"Shit!\" Peebee looked at the wound, then at the DNA, then shrugged. \"Oh well, it's disabled, who cared. 'Peebee, I'm sorry we didn't have space sex before, let's have it now.' 'Sure Ryder, if you insist.'\" She then began making kissing and other more vulgar sounds as she exited the base, not realizing her own DNA from her blood had entered the receptacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew immediately something was wrong with the device, because instead of just the prisoners rising into the air, everyone in the building did. Ryder watched, confused, but wasn't able to focus on that as the changes begun. He watched, and did not see bone armor rise out of his skin, but instead as it turned a dark blue color. His entire body lost its layer of ripped muscle, replaced with softer, more curvy features. His waist cinched in tighter, while his hips expanded out, giving him an hourglass figure. Ryder noticed something odd on his shoulders suddenly, and checked to see his hair had fallen out, and reached up to find it had all been replace with a familiar tentacle-shapped nest of cartilage. He watched as his under-armor tank top became a valley of cleavage, as large blue breasts swelled out of his flat chest, and felt his pants get tighter over a thicker, softer ass. The last change came with his genitals, which withdrew inside of him, leaving him with the Asari's equivalent of a vagina. As the changes ended, Ryder looked himself over and was forced to admit he had become an Asari, one with a deep blue skin tone and one of the largest chests he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to where his squadmates had been standing, and saw two other Asari there. The one that had been where Vetra was had a purple skin tone, an expression that bordered between confused and annoyed, and the largest, most succulent ass Ryder had ever seen in his life. Liam had become a green Asari, and while she still had a fairly good figure, it was clear she was the least buxom or bodacious of the three. Then Ryder's eyes moved past them to the crowd outside the chamber...all the Kett were now Asari too.</span></div></div>",

Getting back on the Tempest took some explaining, but once the Cardinal was safely in the brig, the three squadmates found themselves in Lexi's office, who seemed simultaneously enthralled and furious at what had happened. \"I can't believe this! A complete species change, from three different species no less! It seems similar to exultation, but with a different resulting species. And, as far as I can tell, none of you have had a complete mental rewiring either. Or am I wrong, and you'll soon want to turn the entire crew into Asari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder looked into the Doctor's eyes, trying to keep his beautiful face as deadpan as possible. \"Actually, I do want to exalt the entire crew. We must all become buxom space-babes. It is the law.\" Instead of looking annoyed, Lexi grabbed one of Ryder's new tentacle-shaped cartalidge ridges on his head and bent the tip sharply, and the pain almost made Ryder's eyes tear up in an instant. \"Stop! Stop! No more Asari jokes from me!\" She stopped, as did the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. I'll forward you all some basic reading material about your new biology, but otherwise you're free to go about your day,\" Lexi finished.

Liam didn't have nearly the ass Vetra did, but that green booty was still quite nice. That left Ryder to other thoughts. So, he still appreciated the feminine form, that was clear. A quick look down at his own shirt, bulging with blue boobage, confirmed that idea. But, if what he remembered was right, the Asari were a mono-gendered race, and as far as he could tell they didn't really have a preference for one gender or the other, overall. So...would that affect his own sexuality? It was an odd, if interesting, question. There were a few males still on the ship he could talk to, to see if his theory held true.</span></div></div>",

Turning away from the twin cocks, feeling annoyed that he wasn't able to start the fun yet, Ryder saw a purple Asari at the door, one he didn't know immediately. Then he remembered, this was Vetra's new form! She was looking at Ryder and looking curiously bemused. \"So, you're not the only one with an insatiable craving for Krogan dick. Only question is, who gets to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently entirely nonplussed regarding his old friend coming into the room to screw his brains out, Drack laughed and said, \"I don't know if you girls noticed, but there's enough for both of you.\" A little annoyed but also more than a little turned on by this development, Ryder scooted over as Vetra came over and sat down next to him, each directly in front of a scaly, Krogan cock, and they started their work. Ryder never imagined that giving a blowjob could feel so amazing, and somehow the taste was absolutely wonderful as well. His brain started to feel lighter and more fluffy as the fun dragged on more and more, both Asari waiting for their prize.</span></div></div>",

Hell, she can't even remember if it was her or Vetra who started riding Drack cowgirl first. All that mattered was the memory of the two of them, hot as hell Asari babes, bouncing up and down on one of Drack's cocks, savoring the sexual energy and the contact of being filled. After a while, once they both got the hang of it, they didn't just ride the cocks, they started kissing each other, making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore being turned into an Asari, Ryder had been really interested in starting a relationship with Vetra. She was kind, funny, and badass as all hell. But before they'd gotten the chance, they'd suddenly become...well, like this. But being filled this way, the two were so hot and horny they couldn't keep their hands off of each other, groping each other's bodies as they kissed, still being fucked by Drack, who was enjoying the show quite a bit. Finally, the old Krogan's endurance failed him, and both girls were filled with his cum.</span></div></div>",

She'd suspected that Ryder had gotten himself and his team captured, usually they'd be back in a half hour, tops. She'd tried to ignore the feeling in her gut by sneaking into Ryder's room to play with his strange Space Hamster. Luckily, SAM was able to inform her of Ryder's capture and imminent exaltation. \"Oh no Ryder,\" she said, returning to her normal voice, \"I understand completely. Why would you take the powerful biotic who was your father's second-in-command when you could take the relief officer?\" Cora shook her head, and gripped her weapon tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Cora reached the room facing Ryder and company's holding cells. All the machinery controlling and powering the exaltation tubes would be found here. Cora frowned in response to Ryder's mad grin. He might've been happy to see her, but the feeling clearly wasn't mutual.<br>\r\n\"I should just leave you in there, Ryder,\" Cora said flatly. Even she wasn't sure wether or not she was joking. \"You'd probably be cuter as a Kett anyways.\" Playful flirting. That always told people you didn't hate them completely. At least, Cora thought that's what it did.<br>\r\n\"Maybe skip the banter and get us out of here? It's about to start raining a Kett blood and trust me, you do not want to lose these sculpted cheekbones to those assholes.\" Cora rolled her eyes, but still found herself blushing. \"Just punch the console and we can bang, okay?\" She shook the color out of her cheeks, and reared a glowing blue fist back. The fist crashed into the Kett console, tearing the machinery apart. Cora removed her hand from the torn metal, but not carefully enough. She cut her finger on a jagged tip, causing blood to seep out. Carelessly, the biotic shook her hand, shooting blood across the room. Unfortunately for Ryder, Liam, and Vetra, a drop of blood found it's way into the recripricle for the Archon's DNA.<br>\r\nThe room blared to life. Lights began flashing as a mechanical voice announced, \"NEW DNA DETECTED!\" The cells that had just opened slammed shut.<br>\r\n\"Cora!\" Ryder yelled as he banged on the glass door. \"What did you do!?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"<br>\r\nSprinklers of blood began spraying replicas of Cora's DNA onto Ryder, Vetra, and Liam. The three teammates cringed in disgust and the liquid seeped into their skin. Then, to Cora's absolute horror, the three began to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyder's deep screams of terror slowly became more high pitched, and with that, more frequent. His tan skin lightened to a pale, milky white. His scalp burned as brown hair stretched out, down to his back. Ryder patted down his body as he felt his hard earned muscles fade away, complementing the new curves he was being given. Ryder's waist clinched, and his hips flared out, giving him a sexy hourglass figure. The Pathfinder gasped as his chest and ass simultaneously swelled until they were both soft and plump. Finally, Ryder felt his dick shrivel into his body, and be replaced with an already moist vagina. As the changes finished, the cell door opened automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now female Ryder struggled to her feet, and looked around her. To her left was a short black woman with tight corn rows and a confused look on her face. She hugged her massive breasts, in an effort to calm herself down. To Ryder's right was a tall, skinny woman with an unnaturally thin waist. She seemed to be enraptured by her nearly floor length red curls, only ignoring them to feel her button nose. Finally, in front of Ryder was Cora, who was completely in shock.</span></div></div>",

Something for your birthday perhaps?\" The man asked.

I happen to have your solution right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard looked at the thing he gestured at, the board game he looked at earlier, \"Some role playing  game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game yes, but not any normal game.\" The man nodded, \"It's something past your usual tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard raised an eyebrow and became weary, \"Better than our tech, say something like, Reapers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man waved it off, \"Oh please, those kids? No something even before them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Shepard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, just take it.\" The man said giving him the game, \"The rules and everything is inside.

Shepard looked around in surprise at the surprised birthday party his friends set up for him. Everybody was wearing party hats with some aliens confused as to what they are. Food was set up where Jack and Zaeed were already drinking and Grunt with his off center party hat was smothering himself in the cake.

The usual happen, food, talking, and overall having a good time. At one point, the whole ground squad we're together talking down in the Crew's Quarters floor at the table when Tali noticed a colorful box on the kitchen counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing it over to the table, she asked her boyfriend, \"What is this John?

Basically this is a story about any of the male characters from the Mass Effect series transforming in any way shape or form. (mainly TG though). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally there aren't any restrictions, just no death. I kinda frown upon that. Other than that I don't get to offended, but I will correct your grammar so be prepared for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck and have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT 4/14/13- I am now giving away GP's to people who add constant, high quality chapters. <br>\r\nEDIT: I've decided that I will allow for there to be cross-universe methods for transformations. I only ask that you e-mail me for approval befoehand, or I will delete it.</td>",
