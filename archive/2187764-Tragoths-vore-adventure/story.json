You both arrived in the vore friendly Captial of Aligarh in desperate need to find work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place looks like my kind of feast\" Food says as he licks his leather lips as he stands over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to work. First, let's get some Gold or whatever is used a currency here, Then we can indulge\" you say with a firm tone yet are somewhat intrigued at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk down the dock and your eyes wander over the stores and shops before you hear Food calling out the names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon Belly Inn, Vore and More Emporium, Devil's Luck...Work Regester\" he finishes before you turn and make a beeline for the Registry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and little bell chimes. You then here crashing and screaming as a Minotaur stumbles out from upstairs and lands behind the desk. He springs up and greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and Welcome to my shop. My name is Tag how can I help you today?\" He says and you can't help but notice what he is wearing. A chest harness, some leather straps around his biceps, and a blacksmith apron tinted purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi, The name is Targoth and my stallion's name is Food. We just got off the recent ship and now looking for work\" you say as Food squeezes into the room with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, I have a few contracts waiting right now one moment,\" he says cheerfully as he ducks under the table for a brief moment before springing up again holding three contracts. \"The first is to take care of a dragon who is occupying the northern village, the other is to find out where travelers on the east road have been disappearing to, the last is to help me find my assistant Fex, he has been gone for hours and I am starting to get worried\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will...</span></div></div>",

You walked passed it when you arrived.\u201d Tag says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say with a hint of embarrassment before stepping out of the shop. You and Food backtrack passed Vore and More before you both are upon Dragon\u2019s Gambit. The building has the look of a Spanish Villa with some hints of Cyberpunk. You open the bronze wooden door and enter. Inside heavily played on the villa vibe, which reminds you of your orc homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Food then approached the receptionist's desk and sitting there was a blue and gold eastern dragon in a tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Travelers, what can I help you with?\" He says without looking up from his ledger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, We request...\" you are cut off when he finishes your sentence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two rooms, some food, drink, and something \"fun\" for tonight,\" he concludes before snapping his fingers. just then three creatures rush to the front desk. Thrak and Drogo are for your leather horsetaur to eat or have fun with. Scales is for you to do the same with and before you ask I knew who you both were and what you wanted when you placed your hands on the entrance doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Food grabs Thark and Drogo before climbing the stairs to his room. You follow suit though when you reach the Plato of the staircase you turn left instead of right. You and Scales pass two doors before you came to your room. Inside was a hefty meal of steak and meed. As you finish your meal, you hear Scales' voice for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find everything to your liking?\" he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, though I am surprised you can talk. I thought you were a mute\" you say as he slowly slithers closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can hear, I am not mute,\" he says before he stretches and continuing \"What do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",
