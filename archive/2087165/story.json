The E even has a dragons tail in it. The city looms not far away. Suburbs surrounded most of the city. A rural and forest area covered a small quarter. Sky scrapers towered dead center of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter can be heard all over the place. From buildings, cars. Heck even in the park. Used as prizes and punishments. Kids using it in games. Several national sports are nothing but tickling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurs and scales wander freely. Some by car, some by bike, some by flight, some by paw. But what about you? Are you a native of the town? Or are you brand new? (Brand new go to immigration)</span></div></div>",

Covered in red and purple scales from head to toe. Two semi large wings on his back and a 5 foot tail. Normally he wears a t shirt, jeans and red high tops. He has a tendency of wearing knee high socks as well. It's quite hard for him to find clothes that fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: A fun spirited guy. Loves to joke around. He's protective of those he cares about but isn't afraid to screw with those around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdult: yes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicklishness: 12 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy tickling?: yep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickle spots: Everywhere. Just not all spots are easy to reach with him being so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info: Cielly loves being on the recieving end. In all honesty, he gets jealous of others. Being so big, most just run in the other direction. So when ever he picks on someone, it's in hopes that they will attack him.</span></div></div>",
