Her job is to help people reach their full potential physically and mentally, mostly broken people that doesn't know how to bounce back in life. She give them relaxations classes, yoga classes, teach them how to be healthier and to push them to the extrem to meet their limit and in the end fullfil their expectations.<br>\r\nUntil that day, she had absolutely no problem with her clients, she always found a way to show them their true self, but their last class was the exception.<br>\r\nNot that the cases were different or harder than usual, but the clients made absolutely no effort to change the way they were.<br>\r\nFrom the lazy slob that is always an hour late, excused himself a thousand times, promesses to change \u00e0 million times, but keep acting the same because \"that' s how he always was, and you can't change someone in two weeks. \" Or the unemployed mother that is so afraid to leave her children home that she can't even try to make an effort to change her lifestyle. Or a stubborn girl, that everybody encourages to lose weight because her health is at stake but she can't seem to care about it and always talk about body positivity. <br>\r\nAudrey is always on the verge depression when she finish her day with them, hopefully she got her sport classes to take out all that frustration out of her body and mind. <br>\r\n\"I don't know how much I can take anymore?\" she think to herself before entering the classroom. \"This time, I'll go hard on them, that's not the best solution, but it seems like the only solution. Desperate mesure for desperate time...\". <br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath and push the door, entering the room with a firm step. </span></div></div>",

You have a...<br>\r\n- I wouldn 't say it if I were you! <br>\r\n- Don' t ever cut me off again! Alright! I'm your teacher, I'm here to help, you have to show me the respect that I deserve. Your medics told me about your problems.<br>\r\n- Last time! <br>\r\n- Lola, you have a weight problem! You are morbidly obese, and it won't get better with time.
