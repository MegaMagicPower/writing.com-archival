            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was deeply ironic that the current topic of debate was about the dress code of campus, because Bryan Coffey had just lost all of his clothes and something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat something else was his opacity. Bryan\u2019s body was a transparent and translucent white light denied from laws of physics. It had been a sudden and completely unexpected process that should have left most of the public in utmost awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their reaction was completely the opposite. They laughed and mocked the white ghost partially because of Bryan\u2019s known attitude towards Were-Somethings, but mostly because the ghost currently hiding behind the podium had retained Bryan Coffey\u2019s human body in all his naked splendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s exposed ghostly skin was porcelain white all over, even his nipples and the tip of his currently shrinking penis now looked slightly grayscale as if the naked young man was posing in a grayscale photograph. The cowardly ghost shaking in fear behind the podium also discovered that all his body hair had fallen out among his clothes, making him feel more exposed than ever.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, heavens! A student is completely nude on stage! We banned those kind of modern performances a long time ago!\u201d Complained a teacher among the public. A public who mostly consisted of young and bored classmates yearning to laugh at his peer\u2019s exposed and completely hair-free buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you Bryan was a Were, he always seemed to have issues with them.\u201d A gossiping girl whispered to her nearby classmates. \u201cHe must have been hiding it all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiding it?!\u201d Joined up a male student who had overheard the conversation. \u201cI swear he was just waiting for the best moment to *BARE* it all to us! He must be jerking off behind the podium right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan had heard enough. He hadn\u2019t been hiding anything about being a Were-Something, what\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t learn of that fact until two minutes ago! And he definitely wasn\u2019t some perverted exhibitionist who got off on showing himself indecently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shivering, the ghost\u2019s nervous face leaned off from hiding. He had to clear things up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, when Bryan opened his ghostly mouth, no audible sounds came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s sticking his tongue out at us! The bastard!\u201d Said an accusing student misunderstanding Bryan\u2019s attempts at speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost went back into hiding. How the hell had he managed to turn everything for the worse?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole situation was getting out of hand. Everything culminated with one of the teachers ordering everyone to get hold of that ghost \u201cbefore he causes anymore trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Bryan heard that correctly? Why was he being treated like a delinquent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were-ghost noticed a security guard approaching him from behind. Where could he escape to...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, he was a floating ghost. He could just fly away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet over here you nudist vandal!\u201d Cried out the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never. Bryan impulsed himself upward, which to his surprise worked amazingly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he felt a painful tug on his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha! You\u2019re not going anywhere Mr. Ghostly Exhibitionist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been like a slapstick cartoon. After the guard had yanked Bryan\u2019s penis the ghostly organ stretched to comedic proportions until the inevitable happened and Bryan flew down with a slingshot effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost was now hanging upside-down. He looked up, and saw the guard\u2019s fist unceremoniously clenched against his vulnerable sexual organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his obvious panic Bryan tried with all his might to liberate himself from the humiliating grasp, but whenever he touched the guard\u2019s body his ghostly hands just when through and popped out from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s ghostly form was incorporeal, but living beings were able to touch him. The ghost had no way to know why this happened, but ghosts and spirits have always been a step lower in the life ladder compared to organic beings, so it was just only natural that organic beings were able to manipulate him but not vice versa. It\u2019s just pure logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan\u2019s face was pale as a ghost, as if it could be any other way. He struggled and screamed but no sound came out from his ethereal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr...Looks like the show\u2019s cancelled kids.\u201d Said the chairman taking Bryce\u2019s place in the podium. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we got the were-ghost under control. We\u2019ll have a meeting tomorrow to decide the best course of action regarding his punishment but for the rest the day, the were-ghost will...\u201d</span></div></div>",

This time, he was eighteen inches long so as he hung between Steve's legs, his head was just below Steve's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve decided to helicopter his new cock so he swung Cody around in circles making Cody dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Coach Johnson stormed in. \"What's going on?
