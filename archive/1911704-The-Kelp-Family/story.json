That family was the Kelp family. Adam Kelp was the father and the driver of the vehicle. It had been awhile since he got a vacation.  As they continued driving down the street. Adam heard police sirens and pulled over at a corner. He then saw the car the police were chasing and the police not far behind. The unmarked black car then drifted at the turn. Hitting Adams car just enough to knock it off the road and into the lake. Thankfully everyone managed to survive. What Adam didn't know, was that chemicals were being illegally dumped into they lake. These chemicals would change each family member in a different way giving them superpowers. The only question is who would be the first to discover there powers? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: This basically chooses which Character the story will focus on.

He even ignored to some extent as he got up out of the bed and headed directly towards the shower, he broke the door off his hinges and mistook it for just a bit of bad luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Great, the house is starting to fall apart.\"</i> Adam thought as he looked at the now unhinged door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    He then went into the shower without breaking anything. As he exited the bathroom and entered back into his bedroom with nothing but a towel on him, Adam unexpectedly broke the door of the bathroom off it's hinges as well. This got him a bit suspicious of what was going on but he had still thought it was just his run of the mill bad luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Just what I need another door to fix, why do these doors keep breaking apart so easily?\" Adam asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Adam went into the bedroom and got his work clothes on. Luckily for him he didn't manage to break any of the drawers while moving them. Once he was dressed he went out into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee. He had yet to figure out that he now had Super strength. He would eventually find out, but how long would that take him?</span></div></div>",

As the morning continued, he discovered that those thoughts weren't his. He then went to his wife Maria. \"Maria, I think something happened to me.\" He said. \" Why do you say that? \" She asked.  He then quickly responds. \"I keep hearing things in my head, and I think they are other people's thoughts.\"  Maria then asked. \" Really, then will you try to read mine?\" Adam nodded and agreed. He concentrated on the thoughts of his wife Maria. <i>\"Take out the trash, Adam.\"</i>  That's the thought that was on the surface at that time. \"Alright I'll take out the trash.\"  Maria was surprised that he got it right. Adam went and took out the trash, while Maria discovered her own power. \"Adam, Come quick!\" She yelled. \"What is it Maria?\" He asked. \" I just discovered I have a power too!\"  He looked at his wife as she demonstrated by lifting spoons in the air. \"That's impressive, but why don't you try something heavier?\" He asked. She then responded. She then tried for something heavier, Adams favorite chair. Maria struggled with it. But only managed an inch off the ground before she was exhausted. \"That's all I can do with the chair it's too exhausting.  Adam do you think if we developed powers then do you think our kids might have too?\"  Adam and  Maria soon hear a scream from one of the kids...when they go to the room they find..</span></div></div>",

You need to get out of my room. \" Adam took the hint and left the room. \" This is going to make me a freak isn't it?\" Chelsea asked. \"You're not a freak, you're my daughter and a loving one at that.\" Maria responded. \"Why do you think that concentrating will help?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Maria then responded. \"It seems to help me and your father.\" Chelsea then concentrated herself on making herself bigger. She then grew from her six inch size to twelve feet. Which caused her to hit her head on the ceiling. \"OUCH! Oops, I think I made myself a bit too big.\"  Chelsea then concentrated and after a few minutes was finally back to her normal size. \"Mom, you said concentrating helps you and dad. Are you saying that...\" Maria then interrupts. \" We have abilities to although mine and your fathers seem to be more mental. I can lift objects with my mind, and Adam has the ability to read minds. \"What about Katherine or Mason do they have any powers?\" Chelsea asked. \"We don't know yet.\" Maria answered. Chelsea by now was calm and finally getting dressed before she left her room. \" Adam then asked Chelsea as she came out of her room. \"How are you feeling?\" Chelsea quickly responded. \"I'm fine, but dad since you can read minds, mind if I ask you something?\" Chelsea asked. \"Sure.\" Adam responded. \" Could you not read my mind unless you have my permission?\" She asked. Adam then responded. \"I'll try, it may be hard at first.\"  Chelsea nodded as she said. \"Thanks, Dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Adam if Chelsea has a power it's quite possible that Katherine and Mason have one as well.\" Maria said. \" I think you're right, but we wont know what to do until we know what powers they have.\" Adam responded.

She wasn't exactly excited about the idea, I mean if she had powers what if her kids had got them too, and decided to do something dangerous. She wouldn't be much of a mother if she let them do that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After Maria was done in the bathroom and had gotten out of the shower.

How did you get so small?\" He asked. \"That's what I'd like to know, I just woke up like this today.\" She then continued. \"Do you have anything you can measure me with?\" Adam nodded. \"I believe I have a ruler in here somewhere I'll go get it.\" Adam then took off pajamas and went to his dresser and put on some of his clothes. Once he was dressed he went and searched the room for a ruler, when he finally found a ruler he put it up on the dresser as his wife Maria stood next to it. \"Well it seems your two inches tall.\" Adam said.  \"What?! Two inches How am I going to get the kids to take me seriously with this kind of problem. If only I was bigger!\" Maria yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once she stated her desire to become bigger she suddenly feels a strange sensation all over her body.

She then knew that her daughter wasn't hallucinating about seeing herself she just had somehow created a duplicate of herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Greetings Chelsea, I think I know what might of happened to you two. Come on in.\"  Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yeah, Whatever can we just get this over with I've got lots to do.\" Chelsea said. Maria soon discovered that this Chelsea wasn't just a duplicate but also a part of Chelsea's own personality had been split from her as well.

We all came worried about what happened to him and his daughter Chelsea quickly called 911 shortly after.\" Her Mother lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The wounds on his body do suggest he could of fell from that, but according to our X-rays Mr. Kelp has some big wounds in the front of his body which are even worst then the ones in the back.\" The Doctor told Katherine's mother. Shortly after that Katherine decided to add to her mother's little lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's because he hit a tree as he was falling, It didn't look like he was hurt at that time but when he fell he flipped over towards his back. Dad tried to tough it out because Mason and him usually play Superhero a lot and he probably didn't want to concern him too much until he fell.\" Katherine told the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I Think I get the picture now, Mr. Kelp was out on top of the roof adjusting a satellite, when suddenly he slipped and fell into a tree. Then his youngest daughter and son saw him there pretending to act alright. Until the tree branch snapped and caused him to flip over onto his back. This is when his eldest daughter saw him and then called 911. Which brings us to where we are at currently.\" The Doctor explained repeating the story Katherine and her mother had just told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But I thought it was Katherine's New found Super power that hurt daddy?\" Mason asked with a confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Katherine brow began to sweat as she began to shake nervously from Mason's response. \"Mason you know that Super powers don't exist for real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Mason  crossed his arms as he looked sharply at his Sister Katherine. \"Liar! You know your power knocked dad into the roof and caused him to be hurt!' Mason exclaimed bluntly.  Katherine began to worry that the doctor would believe Mason more then her or her mother. Will the doctor believe her or will he believe Mason and discover the truth?</span></div></div>",

At first I was too nervous to even get close to her. Then one day when I saw her alone and crying I went and asked her to tell me her problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Doctor before we go strolling down memory lane, could you at least tell us your name?\" Chelsea asked the doctor interrupting his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh I guess I should do that. My full name is Kyle Fudge. So you can call me Dr. Fudge. Dr. Fudge responded to Chelsea's interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Mason, Why did you have to go and blow our cover anyways?\" Katherine whispered to Mason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Mason then looked to Katherine and gave her another raspberry with his tongue before answering. \"Because it's wrong to lie!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her Mother then simply shrugged her shoulders and was no longer nervous no that there cover. \" Well I can't argue with that. Now Dr. Fudge would you mind resuming your story?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Very well.\" He responded as he began to continue his Story. \" As you can expect at first she didn't console to me in the slightest, even used almost every excuse she had at her disposal to convince me that nothing was wrong. Eventually I discovered her power on my own her ability to bring her drawings to life was the most astounding thing I had ever seen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's an awesome power!\" Mason exclaimed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dr. Fudge then continued to tell a story with an obviously captive audience. \" I though so too. In fact I often wondered why she didn't use it more often. When She finally heard I knew about her power she began to talk to me more and I did my best to console her. Unfortunately as I became more immersed in her world I found there were others out there just like her, but with different abilities. One day I thought that perhaps she should get together with these people and use her powers to fight evil. Her thoughts weren't exactly the same as mine though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Let me guess she didn't want to use her power to fight evil. But you tried to convince her anyways am I right?\" Katherine asked Dr. Fudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That's precisely it.\" Dr. Fudge responded to Katherine question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What she told me was that everything that she creates is alive and she couldn't just let them risk there lives like that. Her Drawings were like children to her.\" Dr. Fudge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I wouldn't like the thought of losing my children at all, which is why I am against any fighting crime business in the first place.\" Katherine's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Eventually I convinced her which proved to be my most fatal mistake. It was several months before I heard from her only to learn that one of her drawings she used to fight a criminal organization bent on creating the most powerful super villain ever seen had killed one of her drawings she had brought to life.\" Dr. Fudge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What does that have to do with this story?\" Mason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm getting to that.\" Dr. Fudge quickly responded. \" What I didn't know was that when a drawing of hers gets shot in the heart. She also got shot in the heart it was the weakness of her power. I was infuriated with myself for not realizing just how important those drawings of hers really were. After that trauma I decided to become a doctor so I would be able to save lives. I even ran to some of the people with powers again and when I did I studied them thoroughly and even offered to become there personal doctor so that there identities would be kept a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I get it now, you recognized that anomaly from all of your other patients.\" Katherine's mother guessed correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The doctor nodded. \"That is correct, now I believe I have your trust now right.\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes!\" Mason, Katherine, Chelsea and  their mother responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Very good, now would you mind telling me what powers each of you have?\" Dr. Fudge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can run Super Fast!\" Mason exclaimed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I believe what my power is called is something along the lines of Shape Shifting.\" Katherine's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well my power isn't all too great just yet, all I can do is change my size, but my current practice I can only reduce myself to half my current height, or enlarge myself to double my height.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Katherine took a quick look at the doctor before explaining her power. \"What's to explain about my power? Super Strength that nearly killed dad just cause I disagreed with his idea. I hate my power I want to be normal, not some freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You should try to enjoy your power.\" Dr. Fudge said to Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Enjoy being so strong that I nearly kill everyone I ever like! Ha! I would be better off without it!\" Katherine exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know about that Katherine, but perhaps there might be a way that Dr. Fudge knows that might help you control you strength a bit better.\" Her Mother suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine.\" Katherine mutters before turning towards Dr. Fudge. \"Do you really know of  a way you can help me?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Doctor responds....</span></div></div>",

To fit the latest styles?\" Their mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Of course, All that matters in this world is fitting in and Standing out. My power to change my size allows me to do both! It's the best Super power ever!\" Chelsea confidently responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katherine then grunted and turned her attention towards her sister. \"If you liked your power so much then why did you side with us, when dad was suggesting his Super Hero idea?\" She asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Simple, One is because right now we aren't ready like you said, and the second reason is because we barely know about our powers. We know what they can do and that there perhaps getting stronger each and everyday. Except we just found ourselves with these powers, so it's too soon to just go out and play vigilante. Not to mention not in style right now either.\" Chelsea responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their mother was watching there father while they were discussing about recent events that happened to them. As she watched him she noticed that he finally began to open his eyes. \" Quiet Everyone, your father is waking up.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their father moaned and smiled jokingly as he woke up. \"Ugh..Get the number of the bus that hit me Maria?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Adam! You know that's not what happened.\"  Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that your awake Mr. Kelp. It may be hard to understand but you will have to stay here a few days before you are allowed to be released.\" Dr. Fudge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Katherine was relieved after hearing her father speak. It meant that he was alive and well and she was glad for that. Her Sister and brother were also relieved. Dr.Fudge did a few more test on there father now that he was awake. Once he was finished with his test he once again turned towards Katherine's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've called the person I know and told them of your address, he will help you with your strength.\" Dr. Fudge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can you at least tell me his name?\" Katherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He prefers to keep his identity a secret. I only told him yours because you want his help. He will come to your house tomorrow.\" Dr. Fudge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, I'll see him tomorrow then.\" Katherine said. The family then left the hospital everyone except their father Adam. Who would be staying a few days to rest up from his injuries.  The Drive home was quiet and uneventful. When they finally arrived home it was dinner time and they ate then went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The next day was a Saturday so no school was necessary and everyone was at home. Katherine woke up earlier then everyone else when she heard the door bell ring at five o'clock in the morning. She went and answered the door in her pajama's. \"Who is it?\" She asked while half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Are you Katherine Kelp?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shouldn't you give me your name first?\" Katherine responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Very well, Call me Sydney and this here is my twelve year old son Steven.\" Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Katherine.\" Katherine said.

We wont do too much today just to discover how strong you really are Katherine.\"  Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How are we going to that?\" Katherine asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Simple first by lifting objects, and then a little game of tug of war.\" Sydney responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine the heaviest object I know I lifted so far is a couch.\" Katherine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Very well then, Why don't you try the family car now?\" Sydney asked Katherine. Katherine nodded and then went outside and attempted to pick up the family car. Much to her amazement she was able to easily lift the car with only one hand! Unfortunately doing such a stunt caused her to lose balance in holding the car causing it to flip upside down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oops.\" Katherine said looking at the now crushed car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Your strength is amazing Katherine, but let this be a lesson to you. When picking up objects make sure you can keep them well balanced. \" Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll try can we go to the tug of war thing now? Though with my strength wouldn't the rope break?\" Katherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"No, this rope was specially made so that both of us could tug at one side to discover exactly how strong you are.\" Sydney responded.  Sydney then set up the special rope and each stood at one side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What exactly will we discover doing this?\" Katherine asked Sydney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We will discover if your Super Strength is stronger than mine.\" Sydney responded. Both Katherine and Sydney grabbed one side of the rope with Steven in the middle. Steven gave the signal for both of them to pull as hard as they could.

As She laughed her height unexpectedly shrunk herself by three feet. Katherine,Sydney and Steven all watched as her sister height suddenly became much closer to her little brother Mason's. The Clothes she was wearing unfortunately didn't shrink with her and now were too big for her to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Chelsea, you changed size again.\" Katherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chelsea looked and noticed her over sized clothes before responding. As she looked her face turned red and had an embarrassed expression. \"Great, it happened again. I'm sorry you had to sea this Katherine.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What exactly happened again?\" Katherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" We'll you see my power to change my size from what I know so far is based upon my emotions. But unfortunately I don't know which emotions make me smaller or bigger yet. Apparently however when ever I begin to laugh I seem to shrink.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess I'm not the only one having trouble with my power.\" Katherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It does give me an idea though, but first I believe we should take our leave now, morning practices are now over. Come meet us in the park this afternoon alright Katherine?\" Sydney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katherine nods. \"Alright I will,  but wouldn't the park kind of be a bit too public?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry we're don with powers today, this afternoons lessons well let's just say it's going to be a bit of a surprise. Steven you can't come this time.\" Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? Why not?\" Steven asked his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I want some one on one with Katherine.\" Sydney responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I can understand that.\" Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With Katherine's morning lessons now done, she goes and takes a shower and gets a quick change of clothes. Steven and Sydney then head on home. The rest of the morning goes a bit more easier for Katherine.  Even though Mason is up he doesn't seem to bother Katherine which to her seem to be unusual. Katherine curious to know why Mason hasn't exactly bothered her decides to bother him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello, Mason how are you doing?\" Katherine asks as she gently pats him on his head. Katherine was shocked as Mason then tells her...</span></div></div>",
