            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ilyana ducked her head back behind the bush that seperated her from the patroling guards beyond. The recent months had been hard on the young mage, as one could tell by how filthy her outfit had become and how her once bright blue hair had been drowned out by splotches of brown and green. As the war against the forces of the godess Ashera had finally been brought to a close with her defeat at the Tower of Guidance, the soldiers returned to the fields and a massive reconstruction effort had begun. Since trade caravans were in such high demand as overland transports, a wealthy Baron in Begnion had bought out the caravan that she had relied upon as her primary source of food for a while now; and, being the ruthless cost-cutter that he was, had kicked the freeloading mage out of the wagon train. Now alone, Ilyana had been forcing herself to try and work up the courage to ask random strangers either for a job or a small handout, and since niether of those options provided her with the unprecedented ammount of food she required to ease her hunger pains, the mage had recently taken up stealing her breakfast. And her other breakfast. And her pre-lunch. And her post-lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain shot through her midesection, reminding Ilyana that she hadn't eaten anything for atleast five hours. Five hours! That was an ungodly long time for the poor mage, and the reason why she was currently trying to infiltrate this military base she had spotted a few hundred feet from the coastline. Although judging from the dark gray armor the passing soldiers wore, they weren't apart of any army she had seen before. No matter, soldiers required food; and Ilyana needed that food even more than they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the latern light carried by a trio of soldiers passed suffeciently far enough and had once again left her alone in the darkness, the thunder mage made a break for the wooden palistide infront of her. After a few frantic moments of searching, she managed to find a gap in the hastily constructed wall that was wide enough for her to shove her tiny frame through. It took some effort, but Ilyana managed to push her way past the constricting logs before anyone took notice, before creeping over to the nearest building and pushing her back against the wall. She really hadn't gotten a really good picture of what the layout of the base looked like- in fact, she hadn't given this little mission of hers much thought at all; somehow believing that the food would just fall into her lap if she made it this far. No such luck as it turned out, forcing the blue-haired mage to try and figure everything out on the go as she crept past a series of sentries while making her way towards the opposite side of the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the smell hit her. Bread. Ilyana shivered slightly with excitement as her nose directed her onwards towards a small, one room building where two escorted men were storing bags of freshly made rolls. Just as she made her approach, one of the men started to speak, causing her to slam herself against the nearest wall in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear something?\" One of the unloaders mentioned to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" one of the escorting soldiers said with a nod, before slaming the door closed as the last bag was placed inside the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. That should be enough to last us a week or two. Atleast until the next shipment comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure commander Vivian would be pleased to here that.\" One of the other soldiers said with a nod as the group began to disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlyana remained standing stock still until the sound of metal boots clanking against the ground beneath faded off into the distance. Taking a moment to calm herself down, the mage poked her head around the wall to notice that the storeroom was no completely unguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what luck!\" llyana cheered in her head. Feeling all fear of being caught melt away by her wonderous good fortune, Ilyana practically sprinted over to the storeroom and quickly made her way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlyana couldn't believe her eyes. There was easily enough bags and boxes of foodstuffs in here to field a force five times as big as the one Ilyana had roughly guessed was stationed here. She was practically overwhelmed by the shear volume of food that she didn't no where to begin. Instinct took over quickly, however, and the young mage found herself reaching into the nearest bag and shoving whatever it was into her mouth without even noticing what had been in her hand. As soon as the balled up dough made contact with her tongue, all abstract thought the mage entertained was immediately quashed by a tidal wave of desire. She needed to have more. More to quell the horrible pain that wracked her midsection. And more to insure that it didn't return for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first roll was immediately followed by another, and another, until the blue-haired mage had emptied the sizeable bag. Despite this, the pain still persisted, driving her to begin grabbing chunks of salted meat from a nearby barrel and shoving said chunks down her throat. After the first pound or so of meat that the ravenous mage had consumed, it suddenly dawned upon her that salted meat made one rather thirsty. Breaking herself away from her feast, Ilyana loked around the storeroom for any sort of drink. As luck would have it, against the opposite wall was a keg of some sort of liquor; fixed with a convienient spout. Normally, Ilyana wasn't a big fan of alcohol, but she really needed somthing to wet her mouth enough to continue eating, so she walked over to the barrel and formed a cup with one of her hands as she turned the spout with the other. Almost instantly, a small stream of strong smelling liquid began to flow, easily overflowing the boundries formed by the mage's small hands in a matter of moments. Slightly panicing over the mess she was making, Ilyana quickly brought the handful of booze up to her lips as she tried to flip the spout off with her free hand. Her grip slipped, forcing her to try and pool more and more of the liquor in her hands to avoid it spilling everywhere. After two or three more handfuls than she had probably intended to drink, she managed to clumsily shut the valve off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I really hope no one notices...\" Ilyana thought nervously to herself as she returned to the plethora of food infront of her. Opting to try to find something other than meat, the thunder mage pulled a small wodden box open to find a selection of candied fruit. After wolfing the sugary morsels down by the handful, and proceeding to do the same with the contents of two or three similar containers, Ilyana noticed that her vision was starting to blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... guess I drank too much...\" The blue-haired mage thought through a minor headache that was forming. \"I should sit down and rest my eyes for a moment...\"</span></div></div>",

Illyana had trouble placing it at first, but then a moment later she recognized the silver haired Trueblade across the table from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Zihark! You brought me food!\" she gushed in excitement as she noticed a feast fit for a king before her. Immediately she tore into the meat and bread and stuffed it down her gullet. Zihark laughed a bit, when a second voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm here too you know.\" said a blonde rogue. Still devouring food at a rate that would put Ike and many laguz to shame Ilyana saw Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heaver, wut ur you an' shir shiharg doing ere?\" the blue haired spellcaster asked with a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were recruited by Begnion to watch over this group of mercenaries and make sure that they protect a few nearby villages.Their army was spread thin and they needed to recruit outside help. They picked me because...Well you know I have a way with people. Even though I told them I wouldn't be cheap.\" Heather explained. \"Zihark was asked because of his ability to negotiate with laguz. They also needed a figure head that wasn't too pricey, but could keep folks in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well put.\" Zihark said smirking. \"I was glad to be able to see a familiar female face, but now we have two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather nodded gazing at Ilyana. \"Yes, and a beautiful one at that. So can you tell us how you came here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not a very good tale. Just thinking about it makes me even hungrier....\" Ilyana said looking at the now emptied table. Only bones on a few plates showed that anything was ever there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get you more. As high ranking members of this outfit we get whatever we require. We'll get you some food and you can tell us.\" the blonde went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after several servings of food that would feed a normal person for a week Illyana finished her woeful tale of starvation, loneliness, and general misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And one time I had to go for a whole 12 hours without food...I was very lucky there was an apple tree or else I would've died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Ilyana. Well we'll make sure you're cared for consistently. We could always use another person in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean I'll get food, pay, and whatever I need from the people working here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Zihark said, \"I know you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you both.\" she said hgging them both. Surprisingly her stomach had a rounded shape. Beore no matter how much Ilyana ate she remained svelte, but this was a first that went unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal Ilyana was showed to a room and was to be given new clothes in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunlight fell through a nearby window onto Ilyana's pale face, causing her to stir and awake with a yawn. It had certainly been awhile since she had slept in a good-quality bed; and this one was particulary plush and comfortable. So much so that not even her usual need for a late night meal or two had been strong enough to wake the blue-haired mage from her perfect slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that it was morning however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-food...\" Ilyana said with a pained grown as she pulled herself upright into a seeting position. At the foot of her bed, someone had been generous enough to leave a tray (although to be honest, it was atleast the size of three normal trays) with her breakfast on it. The metal slab was absolutely submerged beneath plate after plate of fruit tarts, fresh apples, cakes, sausages, and two huge pitchers of milk with a matching glass. Infront of it all was a little handwritten note, which Ilyana quickly grabbed between her tiny hands and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\nIlyana,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had breakfast prepared for you this morning, Sweety. I convinced Zihark to cut you a little slack on your first day to help you recover from the horrendous ordeal that you've been through in the past months. If you need anything, feel free to ask the soldier that's been assigned to be your guide, his name is Cyrus. Or, if you're feeling a little shy, you can always come find me in the quartermaster's office, and I'll make sure you get everything you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith love,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hank ou Heaver!\" Ilyana said to herself as she sprayed a dusting of sugar all over the bed; apparently she had started eating before her eyes had processed the entirety of the message. Casting the paper aside in order to free up both hands, the thunder mage began shoving as much as she could possibly fit into her mouth at once. Starting with the assorted pastries, Ilyana would grasp ahold of two or three at a time and start chewing on them all at once. Their various sugars, juices, and jams would all run together in the mage's mouth, to the point that she couldn't tell where one pastry's contents ended and where another's began. Once the concoctions of sweet sugar and glaze had been consumed, Ilyana poored herself a glass of milk with one hand while attempting to take a bite out of an apple at the same time. Since this only resulted in a slight spillage, the mage opted to place the apple down long enough for her to fill her glass all the way before attempting to shove the entire red-fruit into her mouth at once. Draining her first glass in only moments, Ilyana returned her attention to the fruit she had stumbled on earlier and proceeded to eat it whole; core and all. The first apple was quickly followed by a second and third, until only the plates of finely roasted sausages stood before the insatiable spellcaster. Like all of the plates of assorted foodstuffs before it, the suasages stood no chance against Ilyana's hunger, and were one by one transfered into the mage's taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels so much better,\" Ilyana said with a moan of delight as her now engorged stomach proved to be enough to cause her hunger pains to subside. She leaned back into the soft cushions beneath her, once again feeling her still realitively slim body become emmersed in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door, which caused the bloated spellcaster's body to jump upright in fright. Instinctively, Ilyana reached for her trusty Elthunder spellbook- only to remember that she had pawned it off in a town a few days ago so she could afford to purchase all these aboslutely wonderful looking pies a merchant had been selling. They really seemed worth it at the time, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehem- uh, Lady Ilyana, are you awake?\" An unrecognisable voice said from behind the wooden barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who is it?\" Ilyana sheepishly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Cyrus. Lady Heather had me stationed to be your aide for the day. If you'll allow me to enter, I have an outfit that she sent for you to wear today. She said your old one was... 'unsutiably dirty for one such as yourself'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Cyrus entered into the room, bearing a silver robe that was far to formal to be wearing while staffing a mercenary encampment. Not that Cyrus had argued the point too strongly after some... insistence on the rogue's part. Judging by the style of half-plate armor and the curved helmet he wore that came down to conceal his eyes, it seemed to Ilyana that Cyrus must have been an offical soldier in the service of one of Tellius' many lords and ladies and one point in his life. Why he had decided to switch to mercenary work was a question that the thunder mage felt too shy to bother him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, t-thank you,\" Ilyana said as she brushed the mess of meat, fruit, and sugar off her face and took the robe from the appointed aid. While the robe was indeed nice, it proved to be a few inches too long for the rather small spellcaster, and came with an unexpected tightness around her midsection. Still though, since her normal outfit had been disposed of, this would have to do till she had time to ask Heather to order something else for you to where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you require, Lady Ilyana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you mention it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large black bird soared over the makeshift battlements in the dead of night, it's powerful wings extinguishing a few nearby torches with the gusts they caused. After circling above the camp a few times, the enormous bird came to land at the back entrance to the living quarters of the mercenary commander, Vivian. With a low pitched squak, the bird's talons suddenly extened downwards towards the ground and formed legs. It's beak suddely dulled and rounded, and it's eyes began to take on the appearence of a man's. Once the transformation was complete, the crow laguz quickly flattened his wings to his back and made his way through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Koza, your early for once,\" A stern voice met the raven at the door, originating from a pale, dark haired woman wearing enough armor to crush a horse, who was currently flipping a gold coin between her fingures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't possibly keep my meal ticket waiting,\" The laguz said as he settled himself down in a chair opposite from the knight's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care for your reasons, just give your report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Yeesh. Haven't you ever heard of making conversation with someone? Anyway, in the capital, it's pretty clear now that the public isn't going to be electing any of the aggresive types to the senate for the next century atleast thanks to their little mishap a few months ago. That should buy you some time for your little move in opperation. As for your little boat party that's heading our way from the east, I can assure you that your side as paid the fee most genorously, and has a guaranteed escort of our finest corsairs. They should be landing at the nearby coastline in a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Vivan said as a smile broke across her face, who then proceeded to toss the nearby bag of money at the crow laguz. \"Keep up the good work and I assure you the empire will reward you most handsomely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm lookin' forward to it. You just keep sending this stuff my way, and we'll be goin' places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we will. Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. I'm leavin'...\"</span></div></div>",

Because of her insatiable appetite the mage had another oversized tray which she ate from liberally. A few men watched in awe as she ate raw amounts of food that would put many Laguz or even the legendary Ike to shame. Heather spoke up after handing the lavendar haired woman a boiled potato that nearly fell off her tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She. And her name is Vivian. She's a cute one, but so anti-social and gruff. I prefer company like Zihark or even that Gatrie person over women like her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but she is our partner for now, we'll just have to tough it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally, but if she says one bad thing about Ilyana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If who says a bad thing about who else?\" asked the serious voice of the mercenary commander. Looking behind herself Ilyana saw the beautiful yet imposing figure of Vivian. For a moment their eyes met, the mysterious woman saw the mage's food stained face and looked at her with minor disgust.She tore her eyes away when the blonde Rogue captured her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say a negative thing about Ilyana, our old friend from when we worked with Ike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Greil's boy.\" Vivian sighed rolling her eyes. \"quite frankly I'm tired of hearing about him, but I suppose you'll be telling us another story about how great he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're just here to introduce her and talk about any business that needs to be taken care of.\" the silver haired man replied before looking at Ilyana gently, her cue to talk. Gulping down her mouthful of food and feeling her new dress become a bit tighter she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you Vivian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise. Now then let's talk business...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Uncharacteristically for the region we're in, the town -which is known as Grey Haven by the way,- has a rather high population of L-\" here Vivian paused for a moment, apparently unable to find the right word. \"-Laguz, which is constantly harrassed even when the nation's army isn't spread so thin. Now that Begnion has a staffing problem, the inhabitants of the village are being attacked by slavers-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible!\" Illyana blurted out, causing bits of sugary mush to crash into the granite surface in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do. Not. Interrupt.\" The commander said coldly as she glared at the offending thunder mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlyana stiffled a wimper and subconciously scooter her chair closer to Zihark's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was completely uncalled for!\" Heather yelled as she bolted up from her chair. \"She clearly meant no offense, you didn't need to bite her head off like that! Didn't anyone teach you how to properly talk to others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather...\" Zihark muttered to himself as he placed his hand over his face. While it was true that the Knight's response was rude, the Theif wasn't exactly helping with the situation either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quartermaster, your objection to my conversational skills has been noted; however, the more time we spend arguing, the more time the slavers have to get away, so i suggest we stop this pointless chatter and get down to dealing with the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde cutpurse scowled at the armored woman across the table from her, but said no more and returned to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The commander is right,\" Zihark said as diplomatically as possible. \"We need to be worried about the townspeople. Now then, what would be the best way to deploy our men...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're okay with me riding your horse?\" Ilyana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear, don't worry about it,\" Heather responded softly as she gazed up at the thunder mage's somewhat awkward riding position. \"Now, could you move forward a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Theif took a few steps back, then nimbly jumped and landed cleanly in the remaining saddle space behind Ilyana. She then wrapped her hands around Ilyana's surprisingly soft middle and rested her face in the mage's lavender hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Heather purred. \"Well, I'm ready to head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivan rolled her eyes at the scene that had just occured, and ordered her asembled men to begin the trek north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand it,\" The commander mused as she watched Heather reach into an overstuffed saddlebag and hand snack after snack to Ilyana as their journey progressed. \"That Ilyana girl is undisciplined, and so frail and soft looking; she is clearly not a warrior. Not only that, but she also insists on eating enough food to feed a platoon of soldiers each day- and I'm starting to believe that she's the reason my dinner disapeared last night. No soldier in the empire would tolerate such an unhelpful resource sink- and yet the representitives Begnion attached to our camp are practically catering to her every whim; especially the Quartermaster. It makes no sense... unless-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's normally stone-faced demeanour cracked just enough for a quick smile to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's rediculous. There's no way that she could be some sort of noble- No,\" The commander's trademark frown returned again. \"I shouldn't discount such things based on appearence when there's evidence to support it. I hadn't expected to run into any of this nation's nobles before the rest of the army arrived, but winning the support of a local aristocrat would greatly ease our attempts to get a foothold on this continent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander,\" a Soldier approached Vivian's horse and saluted. \"We're approaching the outskirts of the village, and our scouts have reported signs of an ongoing conflict within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Vivian said with a nod as she dismounted her horse and took hold of a spear and a tower shield handed to her by an aide. \"You all have your orders, the slavers are to be slain at the slightest display of resistance. Form up, and move out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen soldiers moved in behind the Knight and brought their spears and bucklers to bare and began advancing towards the main entrance of the town. Behind the wall of spears, a half dozen or so archers drew an arrow from their quivers and matched pace with the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, where do I stand?\" Ilyana asked as Heather helped her down from the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere. We're Irregulars, we basically go in on our own and help Vivian's group the best way that we see fit.\" Zihark said reasuringly as he drew his trusty silver sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be sure to stick close to us, and I'll make sure that you stay safe.\" Heather said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female cat Laguz was smacked over the top of the head with the blunt side of an ax, and collapsed to the dusty cobblestones that made up the floor of the town square. She was then quickly given a set of cuffs around her hands and feet and thrown into a makeshift holding pen with thirty or so other Laguz of various species, ages, and genders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahaha!\" A brown-haired man clad in a fighter's uniform laughed boisterously as he turned to face his fellow slavers. \"Men, I believe that what we've got here, is a haul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the slavers, a motley collection of fighters, pirates, and myrmidons joined in their boss' good mood and laughed along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir,\" the boss said as he wiped his ax on his boot. \"Chasing after heron Laguz is a fool's game- Quanity over quality I say! A few more catches like this delivered straight to the capital, and our grandchildren will be able to retire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arrow struck the ground a few inches away from the boss' boots, completely ruining the good mood the slavers were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt,\" an almost monotonous tone flew through the air. \"Drop all of your weapons and surrender immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, the slaver band turned towards the entrance to town, and caught sight of the armored woman who had just adressed them flanked by a squad or two of soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the army's here, what a buzzkill.\" The boss said as he pulled out a rather large bag of coins. \"Look, I know you're all professionals, but i still have more guys then you do, girly, and I'd really hate to have our catch ruined by a gigantic fight, so why don't you accept this parting gift and report to your superior that you arrived too late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss tossed the bulging bag to a swordsman, who walked out towards Vivian and offered the coinpurse to the Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the blink of an eye, Vivian had impaled the hapless myrmidon with her spear, before casually tossing the blood-spouting body aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how rude,\" The boss muttered, before both commanders led a charge against the opposing force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrows flew. Spears stabbed. Swords slashed. Shields clashed. Axes smashed. Within minutes, however, the leader of the slaver band realized that his significantly larger force was no match for the much better equipped and trained enemies; and if he didn't act soon, then all could be lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fraking army,\" The boss cursed. \"Well, there's nothing else we can do, time to cut our losses and run. Rolf, give the signal for everyone to split up, there's no way that bitch can chase down all of us-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighter heard a body hit the ground. Turning around, he saw the face of the very man he had adressed split open by a throwing knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I do that?\" A blond woman said as she emerged from behind an alleyway. \"Sorry, that was meant for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, more of them,\" The boss signaled to a personal cadre of guards. \"Gut her,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards rushed towards the Thief, only to find their weapons intercepted by a silver sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off,\" The Trueblade glared at the slavers, who staggered back at the sight of the man's skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just two of them!\" The boss was losing his cool now as he called on the last of his reserves and lead a despreate charge to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mauraders clashed with the two mercenaries, tying them up long enough for the boss to skirt around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, made it past them, now there's nothing that can stop my esca-\" The fighter's words died in his mouth as he caught sight of a lavender haired girl sort of hiding a ways behind the other two. \"Oh, come on! What's a guy gotta do to- wait, she's unarmed! this'll be easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss drew his ax and sprinted towards the panicking girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do I do? I don't have my tome,\" Ilyana's darted around for anything with which to defend herself, when she heard something land with a thud next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\" The mage managed to say as she noticed a large book laying in the middle of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spellbook! B-but i've never seen one like this before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the very sharp axe getting closer by the moment, Ilyana decided that it would be best to question this later. She quickly flipped it open, read out an incantation, and watched as the man charging her was suddenly stopped dead in his tracks by a sudden five inch thick layer of ice coating his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" A figure said from around the corner. \"She's gifted with magic, the force that has ruled my land for centuries. This proves that she must be a noble, I'll have to find a time to speak with her later...\"</span></div></div>",

Lara ran an orphanage, Henry worked at that orphanage and was suprisingly good with children. Lon Qu became a potato farmer for reasons no one knew. But today we talk about Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the war Morgan realized since there were no more battles Morgan had to find something for him to do. So he experimented with different things piano, (which turned up Morgan was a beast at but that's for another time), juggling,  writing books and parkour. Turns out all those attempts failed except for the piano which Morgan played for guests. Morgan decided to go into the kitchen and make something and had his mother and sister trie his first meal. Turns out Morgan was Magician in in the kitchen and Robin and Lucina became obsessed with his cooking to the point where if he didn't make it they wouldn't eat Morgan didn't mind however and wanted to please them. Turned out however the things Morgan cooked were rather fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome months later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Morgan I'm hungry!\" Lucina called out for her younger brother. \"Almost done with these pancakes Luce then\". Morgan called back making another dozen pancakes if there was any downside for Morgan cooking for his mother and sister it would be that because of their appetite it would make making a filling meal long. \"Okay Lucina two dozen pancakes for my beautiful older sister\". Morgan said walking in with plate that had 2 dozen pancakes. \"Morgan you know I'm not beautiful because I'm fat now.\" Lucina said slighly embarrassed. \"Sure you are Luci all of the weight went into all the right places.\" Morgan said patting her stomach. This was true because to make up for Morgan's food being so fattening it all went into the stomach and breasts. So Lucina even if she weighed a lot didn't have a second chin or flabby arms or behind she just had three massive soft orbs her stomach and breasts. \"Lucina your belly is so nice soft\". Morgan said while continuing to rub his sisters stomach. Lucina liked the arrangement she had with her mother and brother. Morgan makes them wonderful food and he gets to rub their soft bodies. \"If you think your sister is soft just feel me Morgan.\"  Robin said entering the room. After the war Robin gained more weight out of her and her daughter if you compared Lucina to Robin it makes Lucina look skinny. Both Robin and Lucina gained so much weight they only wore bras for their tops unless it was an important meeting. Robins was three times bigger than her daughter and somehow some of her weight transferred into height causing not only to have a stomach and breasts three times bigger than her daughter it also caused her to tower over the rest of the sheperads. \"Good morning mom I already know how soft you are I made pancakes for you and Luci..\" Morgan said cheerfully while nuzzling his mothers bloated gut. \"Hey, you stole my brother.\" Lucina pouted. \"Well he's also my son so he should be rubbing me.\" Robin said smirking. \"Mom, Lucina I can cuddle both of you just stop arguing and eat your pancakes.\" Morgan said playfully.</span></div></div>",

Morgan nodded with a smile on his face and went to work. When his mother and sister became fat Morgan was the only one who didn't seem to mind at first saying there's just more to love. Robin just moaned in pleasure at the feel of her sons soft and gentle hands going along her body, she was so lucky to have such a wonderful son. \"Morgan can you rub me too?\" Lucina asked jealous of her mother. \"Mom can I go rub Luci?\" Morgan asked with a adorable smile on his face. \"Sure kiddo show her the true meaning of pleasure.\" Robin said ruffling Morgan's hair. Morgan ran over too his sister and jumped on her her. I'd Lucina wasn't fat this would of been a problem but since Lucina was bit more \"fluffy\" Lucinas stomach was actually able to allow Morgan to sleep on her stomach which he did when he had a hard time sleeping.

She had been failing to attract the attention of Robin, the infamous male tactician of the Shepards. When the black haired woman first laid eyes on the man with the mysterious past, she could tell that there was something about him, a certain spark that caused her to go wild whenever he was near.However it seemed that all of her advances were failing. In fact, she had recently seen the tactician blatently flirting with Panne, the sole survivor of the rabbit Taguel species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cursed bunny. I should come up with a hex to make her turn into a tiny bunny rabbit instead of that hulking monster. Ha, I hope you like being extinct.\" said Tharja under her breath, much to the fear of those around her. The Mage was currently searching for Robin, having lost track of him around an hour back. She had to come up with some new plans. Hexes wouldn't work as she wanted him to fall in love with her naturally. Besides that would make things too easy for the witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Tharja!\" Turning around at the sound of her name, Tharja saw that it was Lissa who was calling her. Lissa was the younger sister of Chrom and knew Robin quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh great, another rival. Maybe I should place a hex on her so she'd grow a frog tongue.' thought the sadistic woman as she watched Lissa walk over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja, do you mind having a little chat? I wanna talk to you about something.\" said the cleric with her an estatic tone to her words. Letting out a sigh, Tharja agreed and followed the younger girl back to her tent. As the Shepards comprised of a large company of soldiers, tents were a necessary for privacy. As Lissa was often spoiled by Chrome, her tent was double the size of the standard. Entering, Lissa motioned her friend to sit down at the small tea table while Lissa prepared some tea as well. Settling, Lissa tool a sip, letting the fruitful flavore of the particular blend dance around in her mouth. Tharja did the same, mostly to not come off as rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tharja, the reason ai brought you here is that I want to help you. I want to help you win Robin's heart!\"</span></div></div>",

Are you looking to sabotage my efforts with Robin? I'll have you know that I know hexes that could turn you into a newt.\" said the older woman with malice in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, no no. Nothing like that. It's just, I see how much you love him and a know that he deserves someone like that.

Maybe with someone to support him in a different way, he can get better.\" explained the girl, taking a sip of the freshly made coffee.

As Tharja observed this secretly she began to seethe. That useless Taguel was acting far more interested in eating her food than enjoying Robin's company. The dark mage put Robin before all things, including herself, and felt that others should as well. Feeling annoyance overtake her, she began to mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damnable rabbit, she's always stuffing herself, she doesn't see how truly intriguing Robin is.\" She muttered to herself darkly, a shadow covering her face as her thoughts grew similarly darker. \"She's more pig than rabbit, I should hex her to pay for how much extra she eats, pound for pound...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tharja continued to talk to herself, a sinister idea entered her brain.

Focusing with her hex, she concentrated to remove these, to lead to an even greater fattening for the other woman. Feeling the hex's power at max, she stealthy said the incantation and directed it to the overgrown bunny, seeing a clear aura surround Panne and slowly dissipate. Of course, a hex of this caliber would take a few hours to take hold, but Tharja was a patient woman, she would wait a few weeks for Panne to become the obese glutton that she was inside. Quietly leaving the tent, Tharja made way her way back to her own tent to study up on some more hexes in case this one went awry. With Robin and Panne, the tactician was discussing a rather pressing issue he had, but the Taguel had tuned him out ten minutes ago, placing her attention of the delicious food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think I should do?\" he asked, a confused expression on his face. This was rather rare as the young man almost always had all the right answers. Looking up from her stew, she did recall what he had asked her to the tent for, which was dealing with Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you did things like a Taguel, this issue would have been settled ages ago.\" Robin let out a sigh, Panne was often difficult to deal with at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry we all can't be like you Panne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you should be.\" said the bunny-woman, finishing the last drops of her stew. She presented the empty bowl to Robin and he got up in order to refill it. While she did enjoy the man's cooking, she also enjoyed his company as well. Very few soldiers took interest in her beyond being 'that bunny-lady,' and she greatly enjoyed his friendship. If it wasn't for one issue, she would have taken the tactician as a mate long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he see in that woman anyway?\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Tharja woke up bright and early like any other day. After the events of the previous day, she was feeling much better and was able to think of many ideas to spend time with her 'precious' Robin. Making her way towards the Mess Hall area, she passed many soldiers, feeling them recoil at her sight. As she was proficient with hexes and had a rather low 'boiling point,' many were quick to get out of her way in fear of being cursed. Reaching the area, a spry blonde haired girl ran up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja! How'd it go yesterday! C'mon, tell me during breakfast.\" exclaimed the ever energetic Lissa as she grabbed the dark Mage by the arm and dragged her to get some food. </span></div></div>",

What's happening over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoldiers were trickling out of the mess tent, pale-faced and fleeing something.  The shouts of \"run, run!\" And \"by Naga she's gunna blow!\" Weren't entirely descript enough for Lissa who proposed \"Let's go check it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja had a pretty good idea of what to expect, but was still pleasantly surprised by what they found behind the canvas flaps; Panne's backside had long since destroyed her seat at the long table, having ballooned out four feet in every direction.  Her tail was like a tiny tuft sitting between two overfilled beanbag chairs.  Beanbag chairs Lissa and Tharja noted with respective horror and delight, were still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both dared to venture around to better examine their ally, Tharja barely able to contain her delight.  Panne's belly was naught but a pale dome propping up her massively swollen breasts, which retained a semblence of perkiness through what Tharja could only guess was monstrous internal pressure.  Panne's legs were pneumatic cones, and her steadily tightening flabby arms still found some use, stuffing biscuits into her mouth with one hand, and pouring sausage gravy down her throat with the other.  Truely a skillful display, not a crumb or drop wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa launched into the standard form reactions; \"oh my god, what happened, panne stop, blah blah blah\" while Tharja admired her handiwork.  She made her way around the side, and out of Lissa's line of sight; which wasn't so hard, given Panne's state.  She pinched the Tagul's rear, trailed her fingers along her packed thigh, hefted an overfull breast, and abandoned any pretense of scholarly curiosity as she embraced Panne's tummy and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't love she was feeling.  This was something more primal, animal, sinister.  She rubbed her cheek against Panne's belly, ground her hips against her tighening flesh, squeezed and massaged the slowly vanishing folds of fat.  She contemplated running her tongue over Panne's breast, when a rumble shook her back to the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne's entire body was pulsing and throbbing and thrumming with pressure.  Tharja could feel the taugul's flesh break out in goose bumps as stretch marks began rapidly spreading over every swollen inch.  Tharja remained painfully aroused, but fear got the best of her.  She stepped away, and froze.  The hex was a mistake.  A pound per morsel?  That was too far.  /no/, that was far enough.  It worked flawlessly, Panne was just such a glutton, that this was all her fault!  Tharja looked behind her at the table to confirm her passing of the buck; two leftover pots of carrot stew, bones from a picked clean ham shank, and a syrup-smeared platter that had to have once contained the whole camp's supply of flapjacks.  Yeah, Panne's fault!  This appetite was not part of the hex!  Was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distinctive chime that made Tharja jump.  Lissa's mending staff.  Panne was surrounded by a gentle halo of light, the stretch marks receeding.  Panne's body still shook and creaked and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa!  Get out of here!  It's too late!\" Tharja barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The healer protested.  \"I can hold her together!\" She gripped her staff with both hands, sweat beading on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne still had a mouthful of food, her cheeks bulging as she chewed.  Her expression was abject apathy.  Her only reaction to everything around her was to heft her breasts, prod her belly, and pinch her rear.  In fact, she seemed awfully pleased with herself.  Especially when her inny became an outtie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa, she's too far gone!  You'll run out of charges first!  For Naga's sake, she's still /CHEWING/!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa squeezed her eyes shut, breathing growing labored, the light at the end of her staff and surrounding Panne began to falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...\" Tharja wrapped herself around Panne's belly, and held on.  \"Please dont pop please dont pop pleasedontpop pleasedontpop!\" She chanted.  It was so stupid!  She was immediately kicking herself!  Cover, find cover!  But she didn't.  She ignored every selfish instict for this futile effort.  Panne swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa's staff snapped, and she fell to her knees.  Tharja raised her hand, and threw Lissa from the room with a hasty spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne's belly groaned, the stretch marks coloring her body an angry red.  She finally spoke; \"I'm fu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tharja spiralled through the air, she noted a strange taste, like strawberries, and how the world around her was suddenly pink.  Then her head smashed into the central post and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin... Robin... feed me, Robin...\" Tharja muttered weakly from the gutter, thin as a rail, and trembling like a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin!  Robin!  Feed me!\" Echoed all of the women from the camp in unison, each one fatter than a house, and bursting at the seams.  Robin stood, surrounded, armed with only a tray of cake.  One by one he gleefully stuffed a slice in their mouthes.  Sumia, Cordellia, Mirabell, Olivia, Lucina, Murial, Sully, Nowi, and lastly Panne all chewed, swallowed, moaned orgasmically, and burst into confetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear rolled down Tharja's boney cheek as she was left to waste away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there!\" Robin's voice shocked her, she moved to recoil, but the sharp pain in her shoulder gave her the new priority of yelping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now... Mirabell fixed up your head with her staff, but her and Lissa had to go into town for some more supplies.  Your shoulder was in bad shape, you've got a sling on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I do...\" she also noticed she was wearing a massive white tunic and not much else under the covers.  \"Is this... your shirt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook his head.  \"No, you were coated in pink goo.  Your outfit's being cleaned.  We just found that one hanging around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Kellem mumbled, not that anyone noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well...\" unused to being alone with, much less face to face with the Tactician, Tharja had to pause to collect your thoughts.  \"So... why are you here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled.  That dumb goofy smile that on anyone else would drive Tharja mad, but in this case, drove her wild.  \"I volunteered to take care of you.  Lissa said how you daved her, and tried to save Panne,\"  Tharja felt a pang of regret, \"...her theory is some new weapon or spell from our enemies.  Lucina never saw anything like this in her time, and Muriel's stumped too!\"  By Grima Robin seemed almost excited.  Tharja knew better than to take his giddiness as a lack of care or remorse.  He wanted to solve this puzzle, find a counter, and make the enemy pay gor taking his friend.  But for now Tharja took pleasure in imagining a true sociopathic glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so I volunteered to play nursemaid for you so we could go over ideas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja's pale skin flushed red, as so many healer/patient fantasies flashed through her head.  But one stuck out the most: Robin feeding her, stuffing her with more and more and more until she couldn't hold another bite and then yet even more, then bursting all over him like his massive love-balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook that out of mind.  \"Yeah, sure, but right now I'm hungry.  Could you feed me?\" She fluttered her eyelashes, shifting to the side to display her broken arm with a pitiful pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I do not wish to include any spoilers, but to avoid the editing or disregard for this chapter, I want to point out that I have a twist in mind regarding Panne's fate.)</span></div></div>",

That would be definitive proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that week, the camp uprooted to head north towards the longfort.  There had been reports of Risen in the area.

Home to one of the most influential noble houses in Ylisse, Themis was also the home of Maribelle, the biological daughter of the former Duke of Themis. Ever since the events that led up to her father being put up on trial and losing his rank as the Duke of Themis, Maribelle took up the title as the Duchess of Themis, as well as being a magistrate from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as for her fellow comrades, Maribelle still retains a good relationship with some of her fellow Shepherds, including her fellow Noblewoman and best friend Lissa, who had shared what she discovered outside of Ylisse with brother Chrom. But even though the war with Grima has ended, there was still one thing, or rather, one person that Maribelle kept thinking about for the past few weeks; the female tactician known only as Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning when she was first introduced to Robin, Maribelle was barely interested in the silver-haired woman, especially when the blonde Noblewoman was appalled by the apparent lack of manners when praising Vaike's burping. But slowly over time however, Maribelle became intrigued about the Shepherds' amnesiac of a brilliant strategist, right up to the point where she couldn't stop thinking about Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she came across a problematic situation; Maribelle didn't know what Robin actually likes! She wasn't sure if Robin was into dating men or women, and she wasn't sure what sort of preferences Robin has. So, in order to counteract this conundrum, Maribelle decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Around a week ago, Maribelle hired the 'thief with a sweet tooth' known as Gaius to spy on Robin, who was still in Ylisse's capital city, Ylisstol, being Chrom's advisor in both politics and military tactics. When Gaius met with the newly appointed duchess, he still called Maribelle by the nickname \"Twinkles\", due to the blonde Noblewoman's mannerisms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the awkward nickname, Maribelle tried her best to ignore what Gaius called her by and got down to business with the candy-craving thief, explaining what she wanted him to do and why. But in exchange of his services, Maribelle would give him both a good sum of money and a large bag of candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Gaius and his unusual habits, the thief did what was asked of him in exchange for the sugar-induced sweets. However, a full week has passed, as Maribelle almost impatiently for Gaius to arrive with the information at hand, sitting on the Themis throne while twirling one of her long blonde curls with her finger out of boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, after waiting for half a day, Gaius had returned, as he stealthily made it to the Throne Room where Maribelle was waiting in, then walked up behind her and said, \"Missed me, Twinkles?\" This quickly caught Maribelle by complete surprise, causing her to jump and quickly turn around to face the candy-loving thief and said, \"How dare you sneak up on me like that, Gaius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's a force of habit for us thieves, Twinkles. Anyway, I got the 'info' you wanted on Robin, it's not like I can forget what she looks like.\" Gaius replied, ready to put up with his end of the bargain, just so he can get that child-sized bag of candy. In a response of slight doubt, Maribelle crossed her pink gloved arms and asked, \"Hmph, how do I know that you're not lying to me? After all, you're a thief, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius could somewhat understand Maribelle's doubt. After all, being a practiced liar is one of those requirements needed to be a thief, besides being sneaky and knowing how to lockpick a door or chest open. So, Gaius looked at the blonde Noblewoman and answered, \"It is true that stealing things is part of my profession. But when the job I was hired for having the reward being a large bag of candy, consider me sold, Twinkles. You sure you still want the info on her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing his obsession with candy, Maribelle lowered her guard some and said, \"~sigh~ Yes, that is the reason why I hired you in the first place to begin with, Gaius. Now, what have you learned from spying on the famed tactician?\" \"Uh uh uh, first you give me the candy, Twinkles, and then you get your info.\" Gaius replied, tempting Maribelle to hand over the bag of candy first before revealing what he knew from spying on Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding the information gathered on Robin, Maribelle let out a disgruntled sigh, as she snapped the fingers on her right hand once, prompting 2 butlers to haul in the bag of candy into the Throne Room. Judging from how the butlers were carrying it, the candy bag must have weighed over 50 to 60 pounds, which grabbed Gaius's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he could go after his reward, Maribelle stopped him and said, \"First, the information, then your compensation, Gaius.\" Figuring that Maribelle was being very persistent about what he found out on Robin, Gaius mumbled a bit and replied, \"Fine. If you want it that badly Twinkles, I'll tell. Turns out....\"</span></div></div>",

I did what you hired me to do, kept my distance to avoid being spotted by her. Next thing I knew,  Bubbles was flirting a bit with Cordelia at some bakery she opened up!\" Gaius replied, telling the newly appointed duchess what sort of information he gathered, not to mention calling Robin by the nickname he gave her. In response to Gaius and his words, Maribelle raised an eyebrow toward him, as she put her gloved hands on her petite hips and said, \"Cordelia? But isn't she a Pegasus Knight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but when the war with Grima ended, Cordelia opened up a bakery and ended up gaining weight from tasting her own sweets, not to mention her breasts are bigger now, about as big as two watermelons. Look, that's all I managed to find out, Twinkles.\" Gaius answered, giving out the remaining information to Maribelle, forcing a sigh out of the Duchess of Themis, as she ordered her two butlers to hand over the large bag of candy to the candy-loving thief, since she could now that was all that Gaius could report to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the reward, Gaius slung the bag of candy over his back and left Castle Themis, leaving Maribelle with the recieved information he gave to her, wondering what the Noblewoman was going to do next.</span></div></div>",

And when we mean by large, we meant that Maribelle's mother was a fat woman. She weighed a bulky 490 pounds, as it showed in her breasts, butt, and belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her own daughter, Maribelle's mother had long blonde hair that put in large curls, only it reached just below her waist. And like her daughter, Maribelle's mother wore a Troubadour outfit as well, only it was heavily modified to fit with her fat physique. The pink puffy pant legs were longer and puffier, as they reached down toward the Noblewoman's ankles, where she wore these extra large low-heel shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as for the upper part of her mother's outfit, Maribelle noticed how it was very similar to her outfit, only the corset that wrapped around her stomach wasn't present on her mother's jiggly belly in the portrait.

I'm.....I'm in love with another woman. I know that you might be surprised at this, but.....you see, she's.....she's into, um..... women of *gulp* larger physiques.

Once the maids delivered a large, fresh-from-the-oven multi-layered chocolate cake covered in vanilla and strawberry frosting, Maribelle began to consume the mouth-watering dessert, whilst still performing the necessary table manners in the process, digging her knife and fork into the calorie-filled cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, due to no prior physical experience with binging, Maribelle's became quite stuffed fairly easily, consuming only a meager 1/3rd of the large cake. Sure it wasn't what she had expected, but it was a start. However, she knew she had quite a long way to go before she could easily devour an entire cake in one sitting. So, in an effort to reach her bed to digest the pieces of cake inside her stomach, Maribelle attempted to stand up on her own, but struggled due to her bloated abdomen stuffed to brim with chocolate and cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the young noblewoman, her two maids were willing to give their lady a plentiful amount of assistance, escorting the stuffed Maribelle to her bedroom, which was a daunting task in her current physical state. While another group of maids transported the cake remains to preserve it for a later time, Maribelle and the two maids finally reached their destination: Maribelle's bedroom, as the young noblewoman was gently laid out onto her queen-sized bed to rest her body, along with aiding in her stomach's digestion process.</span></div></div>",

The first time they met was when King Garon was having her executed and Corrin saved her, and then they met again when Rinkah saved him from the wind tribe. Corrin has also managed to break Rinkah of her aloof disposition and in turn she has become more friendly with the rest of Corrin's allies, however Rinkah still feels rather uncomfortable around Corrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you up.\" Corrin said as he held out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Corrin, but I can handle myself.\" Rinkah said as she pushed his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinkah, it looks like you fought an entire army. You can tell me if there's something's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! There's nothing wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Rinkah, you've been running yourself ragged lately and it's starting to affect you in the field. You've been so worn out that in our last battle, the enemies were walking straight past you without you noticing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinkah suddenly froze in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! No that's not true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for being the bearer of bad news, but it is true.\" Corrin said as he braced for an angry response from Rinkah, but instead she just sat back on the ground looking depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at a loss for what to do. If I keep training like this I'll be less effective in battle, but if I don't keep up the training I won't be able to get stronger.\" Rinkah thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for upsetting you, Rinkah, I just wanted to help you.\" Corrin said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want to get stronger.\" Rinkah muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I want to get stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin stood in silence, unsure of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may think it's childish, but I want to become the strongest women in the army. I've been trying to surpass Effie, but no matter how hard I try I can never surpass her incredible strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the first time Corrin has ever seen Rinkah so vulnerable, she's usually so independent. As Corrin kept thinking to himself he eventually got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rinkah, come with me. I think I might know something that can help.\" Corrin said hoping that this would help his brawny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rinkah asked hopefully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive it'll help, now let's go.\" Corrin said smiling and holding his hand out to Rinkah again.</span></div></div>",

The magical objects are why Corrin and Rinkah are there now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Corrin, what is it you wanted to show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a strange man gave us some things the other day for saving him from bandits. He said that they would give the person who used them incredible strength, he then started to do a small dance and kept saying incredible...he was a pretty odd guy.\" Corrin remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin then got out a wooden box the man gave him. The box was about as long as a man's arm and was painted orange with a yellow dragon on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man was insane! I'm not going to use anything he gave us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair I guess, I'll just put these candies up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um yeah, he called them dragon candies.

Rinkah saw her sweet tooth as a weakness and tried her best to hide it, but when she's alone, Rinkah stuffs herself with as many sweet tasting foods she can. If it wasn't for her near constant training, she wouldn't be the same muscular women she is today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the man said that they're supposed to make a person stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but he also gave us some other stuff if you want to use them instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...</span></div></div>",

After all, he knew how long it could take someone, especially a with her proportions, to reach his bedroom at times. A number of other reasons would explain away the lateness, but none of them would have been able to apply here tonight. Corrin checked the pocket watch he kept so dutifully close to him. The one that Corrin wished to see was going to be his betrothed, the woman he would soon marry officially before the royal courts themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir rendezvous in his personal chambers was relegated to briefness. Corrin wanted the chance to see her before he would be forced to return to his regal duties, where he would continue his supervision over writing out the peace treaties between the formerly-warring kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Even though that was far more important, he still wanted to waste a few moments with his wife-to-be. He had his own needs to attend to as any other human would have. He was not going to ever claim he was above such things, just because he possessed royal status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later and Corrin watched the door open, which prompted him to straighten his posture out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinkah was a former \"savage\" of the Fire Tribe, an Oni woman who had come to join the Hoshido side to help protect her people from the invading Nohr armies. However, over the course of the war, Corrin had fallen in love with her raw power and endearing personality, which ultimately resulted in him asking for her hand in marriage. Rinkah had many reasons to accept, one of them being her own growing affection for the young prince, so she voluntarily agreed to his proposal. But when the peacetime began, the Oni moved in with her lover at his castle home. Surrounded by opulence of the likes she'd never known before, Rinkah was initially overwhelmed. This was a world that was leagues above anything she could have imagined, the world of the wealthy and powerful. Although she never quite took to having to wear all of those fancy dresses or attending conferences, the delicious food on the other hand, was something she welcomed with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, over the past several months, Rinkah's eating habits had done a heavy number on her body. What was once firm and lean on her body had gradually turned fleshy and bulbous. Abs dissolved as her stomach lurched further and further out in front of her, the skin around her abdomen becoming stretched and tender as a result. Even the bulging muscles that once coated her arms and legs, granting her the strength to lift the maces she wielded so high, were now gone. Nowadays, they had all sank and drowned underneath the sea of blubber cascading over her. Dimples, creases, rolls, and folds were in abundance; every time Corrin saw her, there seemed to be another few on her somewhere. Although her clothes were currently tailored to fit her increased widith, the struggle between Rinkah's bodily girth and her clothes was still undeniable every day. Her shirt had gotten caught underneath her enlarged breasts, leaving her whole big belly hanging out. Hard to believe that one woman could let herself go so badly when she had a pedigree like hers. And yet somehow (and maybe with a little encouragement on the side from Corrin), Rinkah had done it.</span></div></div>",

Now then, here are a few story ideas that can work well as to how the buxom Camilla packed on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 1: Sumo-Sized Camilla<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her marriage to King Ryoma after the war between Noir and Hoshido had ended, the marital union between the beloved Hoshido ruler and a member of the Nohrian Royal Family was considered highly controversial by most, even blasphemous by some. However, in an attempt to rid herself of such animosity from her citizens, Camilla made a point of learning Hoshidan culture and ingratiating herself to her newfound subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had little success. But one day, she soon discovered the perfect way to gain the respect and adoration of Hoshido's citizens, which came in the form of a rather intriguing sport that nowadays was mostly obscure to Hoshidans:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumo Wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she had decided that her next project will be to put Sumo Wrestling back on the map, Camilla found herself to be rocking the world...and in more days than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2: Too Much Pampering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the war finally over, Camilla could finally relax and indulge. However, when she indulges too much, she'll soon be finding herself some bigger britches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, which story will you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
