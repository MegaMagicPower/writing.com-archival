            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dreaming while asleep, it was a full day and in the afternoon a hike across the lower foothills behind the house required a stop to greet and speak with Mrs. Smyth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Smyth was an elderly woman who lived in her 1880 Victorian style, white painted house. Her house was the farmhouse built by her grandfather, owned by her father, and she being the only child it was willed to her. She was usually friendly to visitors, and offed some ice tea or hot tea mattering upon the weather or season. Her house and the seventy acres of property were the whole of what once a 1200 acre farm. During the years she received handsome offers for the cleared fields, where builder built many fancy houses for the rich folks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house was like a southern mansion, with two corn cribs still standing, a large barn and a smaller building with a workshop, as it she let her six cows and one bull use as shelter from the weather. It happened that with my arrival to her house, I knocked but she did not answer the front door. I thought to look around and as i came near the old garage and workshop, I heard angry words said by Mrs. Smyth, and equally upset words said by a very low tone voice, as it sounded like a man but he tended to slur his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to intrude, I waited outside the garage entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Smyth seemed to end the conversation with her blustery bold voice, she speaking what I faintly recalled as Latin; she spoke and all was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe foolish, but I waited for her to come and greet me, but when she saw me, her eyes widened and she acted as if insulted by my being there, or overhearing what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was then, she pointed her left hand and index finger in my direction and demanded as I swear an oath of silence if I heard what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered well my right hand held palm facing her as I promises not to tell. It was then like a true smart-fool I asked her from where she learned to speak Latin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and turned to face me, her eyes wide as they looked red and full of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she yelled, \"As by Decatur, my familiar and companion, as come the morning of tomorrow you shall awaken to a new life and lifestyle in order to keep your promise of silence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the afternoon was but a blur of her talking to me, and of me meeting a strange black man with yellow eyes and had horns growing out of his head that reminded me of a Pronghorn deer. He spoke with a manner of authority, and scared me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke come morning with a big yawn and some urge to stretch my arms high above my head. I yawned as I then tried giving a stretching to my legs, and then shook from head to rump. A yucky taste in the mouth sent me to brush my teeth even before having breakfast. When I flicked on the bathroom light and stepped or strode with long stride steps to stand before the bathroom mirror, what was looking back at me was not the me who I saw there the previous morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..., oh no, Mrs. Smyth, please no...,\" I moaning said. As there looking back at me stood a mostly the torso of a twenty-two year old man, but as his head I had the head, face, muzzle, ears, and mane of a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell with a closer look I was of the equine species but more a shaggy pony, my head and the beginning of a stouter neck. My whole body,  arms, to legs, hocks plus hind feet with hoofs was shaggy late fall or a wintry coat. I looked, and yes I had a tail. My arms were human but covered with fur. I had hands, sort-of, as a thumb with two black hoofed fingers, enough too use to pick up bulky items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in me suggested I should be fearing what I saw that was me, but I felt calm, accepting my situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tummy growled and the thought of breakfast was still bugging me. I exited the bathroom, finding that walking as a pony on his hind legs only, tended to be an unsteady stance. As I entered the kitchen I felt glad I lived alone. Breakfast, as I thought about it and what I became, a heaping bowl of oat cereal, Cheerio's did the trick. Just dry cereal in a big salad bowl, as most of the full box did I eat and felt full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the remembered order for me to report for work at the Smyth farm, and rather than drive there, or ride a bike, I trotted to work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I paced my trotting toward were I was as forced labor due to my changed body, I felt amazed as to my stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then 9:00 am when I arrived at the Smyth farm, but Hazel Smyth was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the devil Familiar named Decatur was standing, leaning at the entrance to the garage and workshop. He said nothing, just pointed for me to continue my pace to the bigger barn. As I was two strides from the barn door, in a swoosh and Decatur was there to open the door for me to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No gripes,\" Decatur asked of me, as if I did what I was and my first day being mostly a pony stallion, could get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brushed my furry pony self past the devil, his body heat so warm it felt nasty. As I entered the barn that evil devil led the way, to where he pointed to a wood plank walled box stall with a name plate nailed above the door, it read as, \"<b>Mike</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me,\" I asked, as I summarily walked inside the stall. I stood there turning, giving a look around, wondering if this devil and Hazel had plans to keep me permanently residing there in that barn and stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazel said she thought you knew too much about her business dealings, and that made you as a danger. I protect Hazel, and since you were a friendly sort, she ordered me not to cause your death. As such, you are not dead, but not your true self either. My plan for you is with the final changes to your pony self as lease you to any travelling carnival as a pony to give children fun rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your being a pony giving rides was more Hazel's idea. I thought to sell you to the curious carnival owned and operated by a Greek woman of great renown, her name is Circe. Her carnival has the most interesting sideshow of Anthropic creatures, and a pony-human would make an interesting exhibit. You might in time end up there yet, as on occasions Hazel gets so busy that some of her non-human protege's get sold to Madame Circe anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the present you are here to complete your transition of species. What future uses Hazel or I might conceive as profitable by making use of your strength or general talents, you will do as told or that human mind, memory, and intellect will fade away. Now for your benefit as Hazel wished that I should return to you the ability to speak, with a warning as not to talk too much, or openly to other people.\" Decatur said, and with a quiet manner he swung closed the lower half of the Dutch style door to my new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI coughed and hacked with my throat, trying to clear the crud sliding down from the equine size sinuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-huh, say there as pray-tell Mr. Decatur, could you inform me as when my whole body will complete the changes, and I become for any to see as just another pony animal?\" I asked, as feeling nervous while quite sensual from my furry self, and a whisking, swishing tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecatur the devil suddenly lurched forward as if he were struck by a great pain. \"STOP, as please Mike, do not say, as never refer to saying anything by starting with the word, pray-tell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray-tell, pray-tell, pray-tell, as does that hurt your devilish majesty?\" I said, and felt a sense of delight to demean his comfortable horny devilish self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a black cloud appeared in my stall. The cloud was a swirling black mass that rustled like desert sand blowing in the wind. That cloud then approached me, and engulfed me from about my head to along my furry torso. I felt my own level of discomfort then as quickly it began, the black cloud faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what,\" I said as suddenly realized I was standing there as on all fours, having four legs, pony legs, and two pair of pony hoofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we getting along,\" said Hazel as she burst into the barn. She looked at a sickly looking devil Familiar, and at me, being then all pony and nothing facing outward to let people looking think I was anything but a healthy pony stallion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, that all was a re-accruing dream that when I would awaken from it, I looked all sweaty as if this pony had trotted a mile while pulling a pony cart. Now if asked I would then try to answer any question posed, but my vocal cords were changed with my bodily self into being as if born a pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Decatur and even Mrs. Smyth would laugh or grin when I would struggle, as try to give a reply whenever asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubtful that most any human would take the time to consider someone with  a plight like was mine; becoming an animal, thought of as are animals, as given to long spans of time without much movements. Whether in my box stall, or wearing a harness and standing, waiting for when next call on to move, a human mind trapped in an animal's body, tends to become bored. As an example of my first full day being a pony stallion, I spent ninety percent of that day standing in my stall, listening to my gut grumble as it digested what I had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGut grumbling sounds are like a leaking, half-way stopped bathtub drain gurgling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatural urges come with any day as did when human, but when a pony those time become as short-lived thrills, and some with target practicing. When a pony and bored there is nothing more fun than to let go and give Mr. Decatur some reason for him to clean and shine his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy morning meal and a bucket of fresh, as clean water holds some fond delights for any boring day. As well there is much tail flicking, especially along in the afternoon. Bothersome flies like to lite down and mattering as to their size, the spindly legs can, mattering to where they would walk, tends to tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny visitor happening to enter the barn becomes for me as a good distraction form the mundane pony lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA regular visitor was young Mister Allen Tobit, he in his teenage years held for me affectionate feelings. Allen knew something was odd about Mrs. Smyth, and he would sneak into the barn, or if I were out to the pasture, he would whistle and beckon me to come to him for his visiting with me. When in the barn, Allen would enter my box stall, he remaining seated as not easily seen by Decatur or my owner Mrs. Smyth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my cozy stall friend Allen would like to pet my furry body, he stroking me, arousing in me reasons to protect him from likely harm if discovered. One afternoon and Decatur seemed overly interested with checking my stall; he forcing me to have Allen lie down and cover himself with my bedding straw. Decatur kept checking and asking me questions, but I played dumb, lying down, covering Allen with my bulky body; leaving his face free to breathe, it tucked close to my groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Allen, as Decatur kept returning to check of my stall, the dear boy stayed tucked away, barely able to move, breathing my musky maleness smell, as he was good and did not try to move or squirm. I kept alert and from need to protect Allen, it so happened that he needed to remain tucked cared for as under me, that whole long night through. As come the rising sun, I let Allen get up, he brushing his clothes clean from straw but he smelled like the sweaty, urine tainted musky scent of an unwashed equine groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sniffing of Allen, and to me he smelled quite nice, but he held a different opinion, as said his mother would not like he stayed out all night. I guessed that in part was the real reason that Allen failed to return for a visit during the rest of that season. As Allen did make an appearance, but came with his mother, she wishing to talk with Mrs. Smyth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, while his mother had words with my owner, Allen paid me a visit. Somehow, I believe Allen knew I was more than an ignorant pony stallion. As much I knew if he knew my past, such knowledge would be dangerous. Dangerous if Decatur suspected that Allen thought of me as what I am, a cursed individual, forced to live his lifetime being a pony stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Tobit and Hazel with Decatur along as being my trainer, all came to see the pony stallion, to see he was a dull beast and nothing more. I stood like a statue, barely swishing my tail, looking straight ahead and not paying any attention to what was said. As Hazel seemed pleased, and did Mrs. Tobit, but Decatur suspected something, of what he was unsure. Before Mrs. Tobit returned to her car with Allen, Decatur suggested that since the boy liked being near a working farm, maybe he would like for the summer months as stay at the farm, and work, training ponies with Decatur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foolish young Allen reacted as liking the offer, and what surprised me as well, was that Mrs. Tobit thought the idea as very nice. Two days later and Allen arrived for his 12 weeks of summer vacation, he staying and working there at the farm. Mrs. Tobit was just ten minutes away from the farm when Decatur told Allen to get me, and using a pail of special wash water, to sponge and rinse me clean for an upcoming pony show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hearing that of Allen washing me, was fine with me,if at the least it would decrease my troubled times with insects and especially horseflies. As such began for me a cold water hosing wash of my furry self, with Decatur urging Allen to wash then my lower self. When Allen heard his job included washing me down low, he smiled at the idea. Something about keeping Allen there residing at the farm seemed unsettling to me. I liked and appreciated Allen as being nice to me quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered about Decatur checking on Allen that devil familiar squirting into the wash bucket some dark green colored liquid; of what he said was a special cleansing agent. Some three hours of hard work and I felt cleaner than I had in a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen looked as weary from his efforts, asking to retire to his bedroom after his taking a needed bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecatur was in agreement even as the day was still young. I watched and was unable to suggest nothing, overhearing Decatur telling Allen to use in his bathwater some of the special blended soap, as it cleansed a body well!</span></div></div>",

You look in horror to see that you've turned into a hippo for real. \"Oh no,\" you say. \"What will everyone think.\" As if things weren't complicated enough, you hear your mother calling. \"Nellie!\" she yells. \"It's breakfast time.\" You bite your nails nervously. \"Coming Mom.\" You say. This was going to be either a very interesting day or a very bad day.</span></div></div>",

You try to swing at the clock and turn it off but you can't reach it for some reason. \"Huh?\" you ask. \"What's going...?\" You then gasp because your bed seems longer than usual and appeared to be stretched out to the size of a football field. \"What? Why is my bed...?\" You stand up and then you look and see that the bed still seems to go on forever. \"Oh no,\" you say. \"I must've shrunk in my sleep... how did...?\" You then see that your hands appear to be covered in white fur. \"What the?! Oh no!\" You look in the reflection of your alarm clock and you see that you were transformed into an anthropomorphic mouse and you were now only 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a mouse!\" you yell. \"How did...?! What did?! Oh no!\" You give out a squeaking scream as you grab your bigger ears. You don't know how this happened. You distinctively remember that just last night you were an average-sized 15 year old human teenager but now you're a tiny mouse boy. \"Well,\" you say. \"At least my pajamas shrank with me. But how did this happen?\" Before you could even figure out what could've caused you to turn into a mouse, you hear a scream. It was the voice of your mother. \"Oh my gosh! What happened to me!?\" \"Mom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear loud shaking and you see everything in your room rocking. The noises sound almost like somebody is stomping around. Was that your mom making those loud sounds? Sure your mom was very fat and overweight and sure you were now a 2 inch house mouse anthro and she'd be a giant compared to you now, but she sounded too big even for that. \"Mom?\" you ask. \"Mike,\" says your mom in an anguished tone. \"I'm having a crisis. I want you to promise me that when you open this door and look at me you won't be afraid.\" You give a gulp. \"Uh, Mom,\" you say. \"I'm having a bit of a crisis myself and I can't reach the door.\" \"Can't reach the door!? What's going on in there!? I'm coming in.\" You're now very afraid. How would your mother react to see that her son has turned into a tiny mouse boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could answer, you hear the doorknob and you step back as your mom comes in. But then your jaw drops because you look up and see your mom and she's undergone some changes as well. She had long red hair like she always did. She had the same green eyes you remembered and the beauty mark on her cheek. She was wearing her favorite pair of pajamas but to your surprise, your mother was bending down to enter your room because she had somehow been transformed into a 20ft high anthropomorphic Asian elephant. She had E-cup breasts and a huge 20ft wide belly that is hanging over the foot of your bed as well as an enormous 25ft wide butt that is currently tearing apart your doorway. \"Mom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother trumpets and looks around for any sign of you. \"Mike? Where are you?\" \"Down here!\" you yell. Your elephant mother looks down on your bed and then gives a look of horror as she sees the 2 inch tall anthropomorphic mouse with her son's hair wearing her son's pajamas. \"Mom,\" you say in surprise. \"You're an elephant.\" \"Mike?\" asks your mother in fear. \"You're a mouse!\" Your mom gives a trumpet of fear and then raises one of her legs. \"Mom!\" you yell as you run up to and climb her belly. \"Calm down!\" \"I can't help it, Mike!\" yells your mom defensively as she holds up her trunk. \"Elephants are afraid of mice! Wait! Why are you a mouse! Why am I an elephant!? What the heck happened!?\" As your mom panics her head goes through the ceiling and she groans in pain.</span></div></div>",

Where'd you go?\" \"I'm still down here, Mom.\" Your mom sees you as the 2 inch high anthropomorphic mouse you had become and trumpets in fear before she stomps down and crushes your bed, kicking you screaming into the air in the process before you land on the tip of her trunk. Your mom screams as she sees you before she leans back and her left butt cheek breaks the door to your room off the hinges. \"Mo-om!\" you yell. \"You could've crushed me to a pulp!\" \"I'm sorry, Mike,\" says your elephant mother. \"But you're a m-m-m-mouse! I hate mice!\" \"That's just the elephant talking!\" you say indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother lets out a sigh as she holds you in front of her massive eye. \"How did this happen? Why did this happen? I was already a blimp but now I'm a 20ft tall pachyderm! Just look at me, Mike! I am so fat that I need to hire a journalist just to see my feet!\" \"You think I like this?! I'm a mouse! In 7 months, the car would've been mine but now I'm going to have to see if you can get a learner's permit to drive a Hotwheels!\" \"My butt is so big, it could kill the dinosaurs! My butt is in fact, so large that I could rent it out as a billboard! I actually look bigger than an elephant should be!\" \"Well, I'm sure I'm even smaller than a mouse should be! I'm so small that the only sports team I can try out for is the foosball team! It's bad enough I have to worry about getting a date for the prom! Now I have to worry about cats and owls!\" Your mother then trumpeted loudly. \"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, Mike! This situation is bad enough! I think we're stuck like this. We need to just get through this without losing our sanity too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother then tries to squeeze her enormous elephant bulk through the door. She grumbles and grits her teeth as you hold on tight to her trunk. \"Not one word about my butt, Mike,\" warns your light gray-skinned mother. \"Or else.\" You let out a groan. Not only had you been turned into a tiny mouse, but your mother has been turned into a great big elephant. She was scared to death of mice and had just tried to stomp you out of blind fear. This was going to take some serious getting used to. Suddenly there was a huge creaking sound and you see that the doorway was still stuck to your mom's butt but it and a large chunk of the wall had been ripped out. Your mother blushes as she wiggles her butt and shakes off the piece of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was embarrassing,\" the red-headed elephant says to her bite-sized rodent son. \"Let's just get downstairs. Maybe some breakfast will put us both in a better mood. I don't know about you, but I could go for pancakes slathered with peanut butter.\" You give a squeak and sit on your mom's long trunk as she raises it in the air. \"Can I have a cheese omelette instead, Mom?\" You and your mom laugh nervously at this development when your mother takes a step on the stairs. Immediately the stairs collapse under your mom's enormous weight and she trumpets loudly as she falls and lands on her large butt and causes the entire floor to crack apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom gets up and lets out a trumpet but then notices you aren't on her trunk. \"Oh my gosh! Mike! Mike! Where are you!? Please tell your mother right now. I promise I won't freak out and try to stomp you when I see you.\" Your mom's elephant ears twitch and she hears a muffled scream and realizes that you're now trapped in her enormous...</span></div></div>",

I'm having a little trouble.\" Your mother tries to stretch her meaty arms out to collect you, but she can't reach and instead grunts a few times. \"No use, baby,\" says your mom. \"I can't reach you. Aha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom suddenly gets an idea and the 20ft high, 10 ton elephant giantess stuffs her trunk into her mouth and blows into it. This causes her to release a loud fart that blows you into the air screaming. Fortunately you land safely in a potted plant on a nearby table. As you land, you're covered in dirt and you shiver at what you had just gone through. \"That was <i>so</i> nasty. Urk!\" Your mother lowers her trunk and then picks you up by the tail as she hoists you into the air and gets a good whiff of you. \"Ugh. Looks like we both need to wash up. Maybe if we splash some water on ourselves, this whole nightmare will end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long until your mom carries you into the bathroom, murdering the doorway with her enormous hips. Because you're a mouse, she places you in the sink and turns the water on while she squeezes her own hulk into the shower. The elephant is so enormous that the shower curtains simply can't cover all of her and her stomach and rear are hanging out of the shower as the water comes down. You scrub yourself with the bar of soap from the sink and watch as water drips on the floor due to your mom's elephant body preventing the curtain from being completely closed. Your mom trumpets and sprays herself with her trunk as you look in concern. You even pinch yourself and grunt but then you see that you're still a very tiny mouse and your mom is still a titanically huge elephant. \"Okay,\" you think to yourself. \"This isn't a dream. But if it isn't, what exactly is happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you and your mom are washed up, you both get dressed. Luckily, when you turned into a mouse all of your clothes shrank for some reason, whereas your mother's bathrobe along with the rest of her clothes, became <i>almost</i> large enough for an elephant woman her size. \"Well,\" says your mom as she grunts and tries to tighten her bathrobe. \"At least our clothes changed size when we did. But why did you become a mouse and me an elephant.\" You begin to wonder when you turn your head and gasp. You see a photograph of your mom's grandmother and from the looks of it, she was an Asian elephant as well. \"Mom,\" you say. \"Isn't that a photograph of Great Grandma.\" Your mother lowers her head and gasps. Then she looks at more of her family photographs on the wall and she sees that in every single photo, all of her relatives are elephants like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" she asks. Then your mother accidentally sits on the remote control for the television and turns on a news report. However, the female reporter on the television was not human, but an anthropomorphic white tiger. \"Oh my gosh!\" yells your mother. Your mom flips the channel to the weather channel and sees that the weatherman has turned into an anthropomorphic frog and was just as big as a frog. Mom changed the channel again and it displayed a rock concert where the lead singer was an anthropomorphic gemsbok. \"Unbelievable.\" Says your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mom then look out the window to see an overweight anthropomorphic cheetah girl jogging down the street before an anthropomorphic armadillo man was mowing his lawn down the street. Everybody had transformed into an anthropomorphic animal and every single one had their size altered to be close to their respective animal, if somewhat exaggerated such as the 2-inch high squirrel man riding on the shoulder of his 15ft tall manatee wife. However, what really surprised you was that nobody was acting as if them being anthropomorphic animals was anything unusual or anything to be worried about. In fact, they were acting as if it was perfectly natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody has turned into an anthropomorphic animal,\" you tell your mom. \"And they're acting as if they've always been like this.\" Your mother trumpets in surprise. \"But how come? And why did...?\" \"Wait,\" you say. \"I'm adopted, remember? Since we're not related by blood, Mom, we turned into different animals.\" \"But if I was always an elephant and you were always a mouse, why don't either of us remember it? And if I'm an elephant, why would I have adopted a <i>mouse</i> as my son? Elephants are afraid of mice! <i>I'm</i> afraid of mice!\" \"I don't know! Something really weird is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you and your mom can give the matter any thought, you both remember...</span></div></div>",

Nobody will be able to ignore this elephant in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you and your mother go downstairs to the kitchen to have some breakfast before going to school and work respectively. Your mother was wearing a bathrobe that apparently the only thing she could find that remotely fit her big elephant body and even then, it left her big behind that looked like it could fill the entire table exposed. You were on the table munching on a piece of toast that was bigger than you were as your mother fixed herself a cup of coffee and sat down on five chairs at once. Your mother sucks in the coffee through her trunk and then she screams in pain before she spews it into the air and splatters it on the ceiling. You shake your head as you crawl up and nibble onto a piece of cheese omelette on your mom's plate. \"Mom,\" you say. \"I don't think elephants are supposed to drink coffee. Especially through their nose.\" You then step out of the way as your mother takes a fork to her omelette and stuffs it into her massive mouth that looked as big as a cave to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant woman in front of you lets out a sigh. \"I'm sorry, Mike,\" she says. \"But for some reason, everybody else has gotten used to being an anthropomorphic animal. They're acting like they've been that way for their entire lives. How come we're the only ones who don't remember being animals.\" You shrug your shoulders and then grunt. You look back and see that your mom accidentally picked up the back of your shirt with her fork. You then look forward and yell as the elephant is unconsciously lowering her mouse son into her mouth. \"Mom!\" you yell. \"Wait! Whoa!\" You then slip into her mouth as she shuts it and you land on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, as your mother swishes her tongue, you put up such a fight in her mouth that she realizes her mistake and spits you out. \"Oops,\" she says. \"I'm really sorry, Mike.\" You let out a groan as you shake elephant drool off of your body. You and your mom then hear a knock on the door and large footsteps. \"Hello!\" yells a voice. \"Mikey! I've come to take my very cute little mousey to school.\" You recognize that voice. It was the voice of your girlfriend. \"Nicole!\" you yell. You're about to answer the door when your mother grabs you by the tail. \"Mike,\" she says. \"You're too small to answer the door.\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"Right.\" Your mom gives a trumpet. \"Not only that,\" she says. \"But she seems to remember you being a mouse. She's become an animal as well. We have no idea if she's an herbivore or a carnivore.\" You gulp. Your mom had a good point. Perhaps you had better be cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that your girlfriend Nicole comes in and from the looks of it she's....</span></div></div>",
