            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All around Amadeus the winds tore at the mountainside. Great crags already ripped by centuries upon centuries of wind and snow were finally beginning to collapse, yet the collapse was unnatural, for atop the peaks stood a group of figures that were gray blobs thanks to the snow in the air. All Amadeus could tell was that they were humanoid in shape, and that they had to be standing at least seven feet tall, with arms thick as tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, as if I haven't gone through enough today,\" complained Amadeus to himself as he continued to grip the side of the cliff, pulling himself nearly flat as yet another large chunk of the rock above was hurtled down at him by one of the figures. Swearing at the figure Amadeus considered his options, which were limited due to his lower position compared to their's. Tactically they had a sound advantage over him until he could get up to their level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, going up,\" he said to himself, pulling the bulky fur he wore tight around him. The fur, designed to resemble Fenrir, the great wolf, son of Loki, made his usual 2 meters of human male stand at nearly 2 and a half thanks to the added height of both the fur clad cloak and the metal mesh helmet which was shaped like a wolf's head. Pulling everything around him as tightly as he could Amadeus dug the toes of his boots into the mountain's side and then literally jumped upward, using his feet for power and his arms to guide his flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily his strength had been improving for some time now and he was able to just make it over the rim of the outcropping on which the figures stood. Grabbing at the bottom edge of the small jut in the mountain he swung over the edge and was now face to face with the four figures that had been hurling rocks bigger than his torso down at him since he and his team had reached the mountain's foot almost an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the figures now Amadeus could make out the details of his construction, and wasn't very impressed. They were standard Kzinti warriors, though their fur was white with gray stripes rather than the orange with black that was used more common among their kind. The one directly before him was still trying to heft a boulder up over its shoulders when Amadeus rocketed over the edge of the cliff and up to the outcropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately its neighbor already had a huge rock handy and tossed it directly at Amadeus with the power to crush him like a bug. Calling upon the skills honed through dozens of such encounters Amadeus dove out of the way of the stone, which struck the place where he'd been kneeling with enough force to crack that side of the cliff off and send it hurtling down the mountain to the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus, recovering from his dive rolled until he was in a position with his legs behind him and his right arm holding the ground before him while his left reached behind his back and pulled a large weapon from out of the folds of his fur. The huge thing, crafted shaft and head from a single piece of silverish metal, gleamed even in the dull light of the mountain's storm. Swinging the weapon over his head Amadeus showed the humanoid tigermen his skill with the weapon as well as blowing the stray hairs from his attire off the double headed axe's blade, and then slamming it into his back to force his cloak closed again and cut off the numbing chill that had been seeping in through the gap between the neck and helmet of his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kitties, let's see what kind of claws you've got,\" he shouted over the howl of the winds, and though he knew the Kzinti couldn't understand him, the way he said it must have been enough for one as it charged headlong at him. Laughing at the foolishness of his opponent Amadeus waited for a moment as the creature rushed forward claws first. Just before it reached him Amadeus leaped, using his strength to jump over twice his height in the lighter gravity of the mountain, and then coming down with his axe under him so that it drove itself into the kzin's head, sending a spray of blood into his face, and ending the creature's life with a finality the resounded in the noise of the metal meeting rock as his axe literally cut the catman's in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next,\" he said to the other kzinti as he swept his blade up in an arc that threw off the majority of the blood covering it right at them. The others, seeing the challenger now as a true warrior dropped the rocks they had been holding and instead took up weapons. One held a fighting nail, a glove with a meter long clawlike blade coming from it, while another held in his hands a bat'leth, its crescent shape and many prongs unmistakable to a veteran fighter like Amadeus. The third pulled out something that very closely resembled Amadeus' own axe, but was almost twice the size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, let's see which of our toys break first,\" he said, more to himself than to the tigermen as the wind's howl made anything but a shout impossible to hear. Despite not being able to hear what he said the Kiznti still roared in animalistic fury, and ripped their way through the snow drifts. With the white powder flying before them their vision of Amadeus was obscured, and the human warrior used that to his advantage, ducking down just as they got near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kzin holding the bat'leth was the first to reach Amadeus, and the first to fall as Amadeus literally drove his axe's head into the ground, and just as the kzin reached the spot where he had been standing the catlike humanoid found the ground rise up under his claws. Putting all his strength into it Amadeus literally tossed the kzin over the edge of the precipice, where he would fall for many minutes before slamming into the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir brother's cries alerting them to the human's tricks the two remaining kzinti stopped rushing forward. Where they had planned on overwhelming the pitiful creature with their numbers they now realized they would most likely fall to some kind of trick. Taking more cautious steps they approached the now standing figure of Amadeus, who knew that such tricks were useless against the now wary foes he faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kzinti came on as one, each brandishing his weapon before him. Amadeus, not one to be outdone by his foes swung his axe at them, forcing the tigermen to keep their distance from his as he worked out a plan. Unable to come up with anything, he decided that his one hope was surprise, and instead of waiting for the kzinti to make their move, he charged forward with a roar of rage that could be heard even over the wail of the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tactic, as spontaneous as it was, allowed him that one moment of surprise he need, and with a triumphant feeling insde he slammed his foot down on the dull side of the fighting nail worn by the larger of his two foes. The kzin, unable to compensate fast enough for his opponent's new aggressive stance was forced to watch as Amadeus slammed the flat of his blade into the side of the creature's head, causing the nail to break with an echoing snap of metal, and the kzin himself to spin twice in the air before falling to the snow and laying still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one remaining warrior, despite the fact that his brothers had fallen, remained unfearful of the human, and showed it by charging at him, taking care to note where the man held his weapon and swinging his axe in an overhead arc to prevent him from leaping up as he had done with the first kzin. The axe, coming down with more force than he could hope to block, forced Amadeus to roll out of the way, and then leap to his feet again only half a meter from where he'd been. By that time though the kzin had recovered from his blow and was already coming around for a horizontal slash, though this time with much less power behind the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his axe in a vertical position Amadeus blocked the blow, parrying it aside with all the grace of a master, and then launching a counter attack which the kzin blocked by spinning his weapon and knocking Amadeus' axe out of its path. So it went fr many minutes as the two axe wielders grappled atop the snowy peak, their blades ringing together and causing sparks that lit the storm darkened mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Amadeus, who had seen many battles of this type, it was easy to follow the routine of his opponent, who like most who wielded an axe, relied on the weapon's sheer power to break his foe. Few who used the weapon like that would ever know victory when they came up against a master of it, for like the sword, the axe could be subtle, moving in midswing to fall wherever the user wished it to, and cutting through an enemy's defenses with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling upon that skill Amadeus pushed the kzin warrior back, forcing his opponent to adjust to an ever more intricate series of strikes which came ever closer to contact with his flesh, until in a final sweeping blow it pushed the blade of the kzin aside and drove the axe head home into his chest. For a few seconds the kzin just stood still as a statue, staring down in disbelief at the wound in his front that pierced his heart, and then without cry or sound the creature fell to the snow with a dull thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thrill of battle done with Amadeus wiped his blade on the snow, removing the green streaked blood of the catman from its silver surface so that it shined once more. With his weapon cleaned the warrior returned it to its resting place on his back and walked to the edge of the precipice, to look and see if the rest of his party had caught up yet. Gazing over into the infinite darkness he did not hear the crunch of snow as a figure rose from beneath a layer of powder, and walked with feline grace until it was right behind him, prepared to push him to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out, Deus!\" shouted a female voice from below, and then, out of the darkness a gout of blue fire shot. Rolling aside Deus spun on his heel to find the kzin with the broken fighting nail standing right behind where he had been. Surprised by the voice as well as his targets sudden movement the kzin was caught off guard as the flame hit him and began to burn his white fur in its heat. Before it could recover from the shock of the hit Amadeus ran beside it and smacked the catman with the side of his axe, sending it over the edge to join both the rocks it had been throwing as well as it brother whom Amadeus had knocked over the edge earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, that was a fine mess you got yourself into,\" said the female voice again, this time coming from above this time. Looking around Amadeus found the source of the voice easily, as the woman it belonged to hovered over him riding her staff which sent a jet of blue flame below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna dodge him,\" lied Amadeus, and obviously the girl knew it was a lie as she clicked her tongue at him while slowly descending to his level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Deus. You didn't even know he was there. Without me you'd be the one falling to your doom,\" said the blue flame witch, her attire seeming to be much lighter than Amadeus' own considering the temperature of where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I would of caught myself. Jazz, you know me,\" responded Amadeus, already walking over to the cliff and beginning to search for handholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deus, wait. Thee others will be here in a few minutes, and then we can go up together and get the Yggdrasil planet from the dragon,\" protested Jasmine as she placed her hand on Amadeus' shoulder. Sighing thee man in furs turned to the scantily clad which and looked down at her, his form towering over her one and a half meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, I can't wait. I have to go in a few minutes and I really want to win this time,\" he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well you aren't going to be able to beat a dragon of Asgard alone. If I remember correctly it ate you last time,\" she responded to him, bringing up memories of the last time they'd played this particular game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say it ate me, I say I was trying to attack it from within,\" he said, turning away and back towards the cliff. Just as he reached it though the whole world seemed to freeze in place as a new layer of gray passed over it, this time due to static rather than the snow fall. When the world reset he was now laying face down in the snow with Jasmine hefting him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deus, what happened?\" she demanded as he slowly picked himself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some kind of sync error, let me check,\" he told her, pushing at something on his arm and causing a screen to appear in front of him. Looking at the red blinking warning he screamed in frustration and turned back towards Jasmine, forcing himself to calm down despite his agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I gotta go. There's something wrong with my Terminal. Same time tomorrow Jazz?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've got duty tomorrow. Maybe next week,\" she responded, waving goodbye. Amadeus returned her wave before touching a part of the screen before him that caused the whole world to shift again, this time going from a ful environment to something like a flat picture painted on the inside of a globe which he now floated in the center of. Feeling disoriented Amadeus watched as squares of the picture began to go dark, and his view of the globe shifted as the Terminal set him right side up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again he felt bad that he'd left Jasmine alone on the side of the mountain with their party far below, but he was confident that she would get them all to the top safely, though beating the dragon might be beyond their skills. Another battle which he should be at, but wouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" swore Amadeus, both at the circumstances of his life, and at the return to Dedros gravity. The Terminal which he had been playing on had kept hm at about .97 grav during the game, but as the Terminal shut down the local gravity of 3.28 reasserted itself, causing him to fall to his knees in surprise. He had defiantly been playing too long, and was already imaging a nice peaceful slumber when he began to curse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him the normally bright street was dark. Above the skyscrapers, which should have been abuzz with the nightly comings and goings of their occupants were black. Looking at his Terminal Amadeus realized that some kind of power surge must have hit his city, which caused the sync error in the game he had been playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, the mechanics will fix it tomorrow,\" he said to himself, pulling at his furry garments so that they would allow air into them. It was a hot night, and though Amadeus was used to walking home in odd raiments due to his late night gaming habit he still hadn't that he was sweating so profusely, and that he would now have to get sweat and blood out of the suit before he could play in it again. Looking down at it he observed that the kzinti's blood, which had splattered on the front of the suit, was already growing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I might just leave that in,\" he told himself, feeling that the green blood added to the look of a Norse warrior. It was at that moment that he felt a slight tug at his person, and he instantly dropped down into a fighter's stance, placing his hand at the belt he wore under his furs and on the butt of the pistol holstered to it. A quick scan of his surroundings showed nothing pulling at him though and he relaxed a bit, before he felt another tug, this time hard enough to tell where it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the stars?\" he swore as he looked up to behold lightning streaking across a clear sky, and not more than a few yards from where he stood. The bolts were so close that he could feel the hairs on his arms raising in response to them, and then with a thunderous concussion several of the bolts struck together, forming a hole in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap!\" he yelled as the tug he'd been feeling became many times greater. His hands acted out of instinct, grasping for anything to hold him down, but they found nothing on the smooth ground of side walk. Scream obscenities Amadeus rose slowly into the vortex, and the moment he made contact a flash of light could be seen. When it cleared Amadeus and the vortex had both vanished.<br>\r\n____________________________________<br>\r\nOn another world a hole in the sky was ripped open for a moment, belching forth a single figure before quickly sealing shut again. This figure, clad in furs fell to the ground three meters below screaming out curses at the various gods he knew the names of, and several ones he was making up on the spot. His stream of foul language was cut off suddenly when he slammed into the ground in a beautiful face plant that left him sitting still for several minutes before rising to his feet somewhat woozily. Placing his hand on his fore head to steady himself he looked around, gauging his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have got to get a new travel agent,\" he said to himself as he found himself....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His body feeling like he'd just taken it through a blender set to obliterate, Amadeus looked at the pristine, if somewhat creepy forest that surrounded him. Not finding much of interest he began to look over his body, checking for obvious signs of interdimensional travel stress. Finding nothing wrong with his body that didn't have to do with the abrupt landing, Amadeus decided to count his blessings and not voice a complaint about the fact that his body felt like dren and stared off into the darkness which stretched before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he said, not really loudly enough to be heard except by himself. He realized his foolishness a moment later and nearly hit himself for being such an idiot. After all he was in the middle of the woods, even if he shouted it was not likely there would be anyone around to hear him, or if they did it would be just another animal noise unless he was close enough for the Translator Collar to kick in and put his words into a language they would understand while it did the same to their words for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already confirmed that his body was still human Amadeus began checking his possessions for any sign of alteration. Pulling the axe out of its sheath on his back he looked it over and found it to be just as shiny as ever, if a bit cold due to temperature difference between the snowy mountains from before and the forest where he now stood. Slipping the axe back into place beneath the fur cloak he was glad to feel its weight, which reassured him that he was not helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he checked was the skin tight suit he wore. Pulling open the front of his cloak we was relieved by the sight of the dull gray mesh weave of his suit, which if what the ads said was true would keep him safe and at a comfortable temperature in almost any environment, though he doubted the makers of the suit had intended on the user to be wearing a fur overcoat on top of it, which caused him to sweat in the balmy air of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging his view from the suit to his belt he looked down to find that the holster was intact, and drawing his Startec pistol he found it to still be in working order, at least according to its scans of itself. A test firing at low power created a small tongue of flames in a dried out bit of grass, proving that the gun was operational, though according to the read out it was at twenty-five percent power, mostly because he hadn't bothered to fill its hydrogen chamber in a week. Looking around he tasted the air and was pleased to note a hint of water in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I can fill it up when I need to,\" he said to himself, putting the weapon away until a need for its power arose. Hopefully he could get some help without having to pull a gun, but it was always better to have something and not need it, than to not have something and die from a lack of it. Satisfied at the pistol he put his hand on the pouch on the other side of the belt, finding the weight of his various knickknacks  to still be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the gear intact, if not fully charged, Amadeus placed his hand behind his back, and pulled something off the very rear of the belt. In the darkness of the overcast nighttime forest it was hard to see what he held in his hand, though it wouldn't have been an impressive sight at all in the state it was in now. The thing, which looked like a PDA, was chirping oddly, sometimes a word or two breaking through the static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee, you in there? I could really use some help here,\" said Amadeus to the small computer. The response was a few blaring noises followed by cut off words which he took to mean Zee was not functioning right at the moment, a theory that proved correct as the static filled screen blazed blue and a small clock icon appeared in front of Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logic circuits scrambled. Recompile will take approximately 1.2 cycles,\" said a mechanical, female voice, before the screen went dark. Swearing again Amadeus struck the side of the device with his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Zee. Don't do this to me now. I need you,\" he told the device, striking it twice more before giving up on it and placing the small computer behind his back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so Zee's gone bye-bye for now, and I'm all alone on an unknown planet,\" he told himself assessing the situation. He looked around, and finding no one around to see him he jumped up and down several times before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gravity appears to be about 1 grav, though I'd need Zee to know the exact measurement,\" he said, going through each bit of the Combine's guide for interplanetary travel in turn. His next action was to take a deep sniff of the air, drawing in several deep breathes through his nose and then breathing them out through his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atmosphere is at about seventy percent nitrogen and twenty percent oxygen, with trace elements added in. Carbon content is less than one percent, indicating a pre-industrial society if any,\" he said, and then stopped, taking another wiff of the local air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oddly there seems to be a large ethanol fume content. Naturally this is not unheard of, but within a forest?\" he told himself questioningly, filing away each bit of data inside his memory for future reference. He knew that even the tiniest bit of info could come in handy in an E.T. event, where he encountered a sentient species while visiting a planet, and even if there was no sentient race he might find another use for the data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nothing more to study n the immediate area Amadeus was faced with a choice. He could stay where he was in the clearing and wait for Zee to reboot so the little computer could tell him where he was, or he could leave the clearing by any one of the three paths he could see. Looking up provided no clue as to where he was asa thick layer of clouds obscured the sky, making it so that he couldn't even tell if the planet had moons or not. Facing forward he designated the way he stood to be 12 o'clock, with the paths at the positions of two, five, and nine. Looking around he decides...</span></div></div>",

Until his companion was operational again Amadeus didn't feel like getting himself lost on the planet's surface, because there was always the possibility, however small, that the phenomenon that had dragged him from Dedros to this strange forest would reopen and send him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest air hung still and quite all around him, giving Amadeus a chance to think over the game he'd been playing, and finally come to the realization that Jasmine had been right, he should have waited on the ledge for the others, as the dragon had beaten him twice, one of those times using his digestive tract, which had oddly been an arousing experience. He would have to have a psych profile done later to analyze why, and maybe get a hypnotic reprogramming to get rid of that personality quirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee would probably just tell me I was being a human,\" commented Amadeus to himself remembering the CAP's opinion that all humans were in some way mentally ill, though he felt that was an improvement over the other races he'd met, who all seemed dull when compared to humans, who's reactions were as random as that of two free flying electrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting alone in the darkness Amadeus felt himself drifting off to sleep, probably because he'd been up the last five days straight in the Game, finding clues that had led them to the mountain path which would lead eventually to the dragon's lair and the Yggdrasil treeling within. The point of the Game was to get the treeling back to Asgard so Odin could grant it new life so it could replace the failing World Tree, though in five play throughs they had yet to even make it up the mountain, let alone back to Asgard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound alerted Amadeus to company, but before he could react something slammed into his back, sending him forward to the ground. Feeling stupid for being caught in a daydream Amadeus tried to move, but found his body refused to cooperate, remaining frozen despite his will to move. Searching his memory he realized the blow had connected with the base of his neck on the back, probably shattering part of his spine, rendering him unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he down?\" asked a voice, oddly enough in a language that Amadeus could understand. Moving his eyes he looked over towards the place where he thought the words had come from and saw two figures moving in the darkness, though he couldn't make out anything other than vague outlines of two humanoid shapes, one possessing a tail. The tail whipped from side to side as the two figures approached, and Amadeus realized that he was caught be some kind of enemy, and that he was probably going to be dead within the next few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trained warrior of the Combine Amadeus did not panic. His skills had not availed him, and he had no intention of allowing whoever it was who had slain him to get away with it. Waiting he allowed the two figures to slowly approach him, and just as they entered range he pushed on one of his molars with his tongue, revealing a small panel, and then he bit down as hard as he could, hearing a satisfying crack as the tooth broke in half, and then everything went white hot as he and everything within a dozen feet were consumed by an azure orb of light. Never would Amadeus know where he was, or who had killed him, but his actions ended the life of two villains, and that was enough for him.</span></div></div>",

With that thought firmly in hand Amadeus began his trek through the alien woods, his destination an unknown to him, though he had a good hope that he would find something that might help him at the path's end. After only a few dozen meters Amadeus was forced to stop and tug at his left leg, whose boot had gotten tangled in the underbrush of the area due to the fact that it was supposed to be used in mountain climbing and not forest walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope whoever runs this planet has a decent pair of shoes that I can borrow,\" he said to himself as the root on which his spiked boot had become caught broke with a great cracking sound. Shaking his leg to get the loose bit of root of the tip of the spikes he continued on down the path, looking at the forest floor beneath his feet for other hazards that might catch on his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path went in a straight and unerring path through the woods, which told him it had to have been made by sentients, due to the fact that like electrons, animals typically followed the path of least resistance when running, meaning a trail made by an animal would follow meandering route through the woods, walked around any steep inclines rather than going straight through them which his current path did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I know there's a sentient race on this world,\" commented Amadeus as he broke through the path's last piece and into another clear area of the forest, this one defiantly unnatural as it had a long, smooth asphalt road running off into the distance two different ways. Amadeus, a xeno-history buff had ben taught that the greatest indication of a civilization was not the cities or towers it built, but rather its roads, for the better kept the roads, the more travel they had put up with, and thus the more movement of a population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better about the sight of a road, Amadeus began looking left and right for some sign of a car or lights which might indicate the way to the local population's city or town, but oddly he could see nothing in any direction, meaning two things. Either the local population was nocturnal, and thus required no light even in the darkness of the starless night, or that they were without power for some reason, which ranged from a local blackout to a nuclear war. Willing to take either risk Amadeus found neither way to be that inviting so he pulled an old coin out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowledge I go left, sight I go right,\" he said, looking at the coin, which was decorated with an ankh representing knowledge on one side and an eye representing sight on the other. With a sigh he flipped the coin into the air and caught it in his flat palm, looking down it landed with the...</span></div></div>",

With a grace and ease built up by dozens of years of training as well as personal experience Amadeus walked forward at a steady clip, and was surprised to find that he saw not one car or vehicle making its way down the road, though he felt that he should have as the road seemed very well used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's some kind of holiday,\" he observed, thinking of reasons for traffic to stop. If it was indeed a holiday than he would have to be on his toes when he found a local, as holidays on most worlds tended to make any insult ten times worse than it usually was, causing the person insulted to tackle the insulter even if the insulter had no idea what he'd just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that charming thought in mind Amadeus began to look around the highway for any light or other sign of the civilization which had built the roadway. Finding only darkness and woods he was feeling more and more that he should have taken the other path when he suddenly saw something that made him do a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the trees suddenly blossomed with light out of what looked like a window. Not believing his eyes he rubbed them and then looked again. This time the tree was dark, and he could no longer make out a window of any kind. Believing that he might be seeing thing he began to walk on when two light came on, this time clearly outlining bipedal humanoid forms in their glow, which was soft like the light shed by a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candles?\" he asked himself questioningly, not knowing why a culture that had roads would be using candles for a light source at night. Shaking off his feelings of unease he decided it was best not to question fortune's grace, and ran across the highway towards the tree which he now knew was a home to some form of intelligent life. Looking at the tree from the road he was surprised to find that no way lead to it, but as he moved off the road he realized that the tree had to be quite large, and thus was much farther away than it had appeared at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo stranger to work he closed the distance quite fast considering his footwear was designed for climbing mountains, and seemed to catch on every root or loose rock that stood between him and the tree. Still his headlong flight did not slow, as his goal was so close and he wanted to make contact with the locals as soon as possible. Coming up on the house's driveway he saw a sight that filled him with a sense of hope, a mailbox marked with strange letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he slowed his run to a brisk walk and began going up the drive something clicked in his mind. The strange letters on the side of the mailbox, he could read them. For a moment he stood frozen to the spot, not sure what he was seeing, but turning back and running his fingers over the letters he recognized them as the old English alphabet, specifically spelling out the name Dewclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the neutron?\" he swore, making sure that he wasn't seeing things by raising his helmet and rubbing his eyes. Despite this the letters stayed the same, and he was forced to admit that he was looking at a language he knew, which should have been impossible. Shaking his head against the thoughts that threatened to overwhelm him he decided that for now making contact was important. He'd figure out the mailbox later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanishing the mailbox from his mind he fingered the collar around his neck, making sure that it felt warm and was active. The device felt pleasingly warm to his touch, showing that it was still functional and would translate any speech sent his way into something he could understand, while at the same time translating his speech into something the other person would be able to comprehend. Even if the letters of this world were in an old human language that didn't mean spoken speech was. Sighing he walked up the rest of the drive to the door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to seem like an outsider,\" he told himself, looking for a doorbell. Finding none he decided to knock with his mailed fist, which made a very nice boom as he struck the wooden door. Hoping that knocking really was a universal thing like his old xenopsyc teacher had told him he waited for a moment before the door opened up to reveal...</span></div></div>",

It took Amadeus only a moment to recover from the shock of hearing English being spoken at him, which was something the mailbox had indicated. He wondered for a moment how long he'd have been standing in front of the female looking like an idiot if he hadn't noticed the writing on the mailbox. Shrugging off those thoughts he looked down at the smaller figure and smiled under his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be able to. My car broke down a bit up the road and I was wondering if you could let me use you phone?\" he asked the rabbit woman, trying to speak her language as best he could as he fingered the collar at his neck and deactivated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to tell you this but our phones went out with the power. I don't think Kevin's house fared any better but you can try,\" she told him, opening the door all the way. Now in the dim light of a candle she could see him in his entirety, and for the first time since seeing the house Amadeus remembered he was still in a blood soaked fur coat with a helmet, which probably explained the odd look the woman was giving him as her eyes went up and down his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't happened to be related to Kell by any chance?\" she asked him after a few moments of awkward silence between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but do you have a place where I can hang this stuff up?\" answered Amadeus, pulling the cloak off of himself and then reaching up to grab the helmet as well. Tugging at the heavy metal mesh covering he was able to rip it off with one great exertion and finally stood before the rabbit woman wearing only the skintight polymer weave body suit which was standard issue for Combine Gamers, though the boots ruined the look thanks to the fact that they were designed to go with the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head to get rid of the sweat that had built up in his hair he opened his eyes to find the rabbit woman pointing behind him, a look of horror in her eyes. Turning, he expected to be facing some kind of monster, but seeing nothing he turned back with a raised eyebrow and took only a moment to realized that the woman was pointing to him, not behind him, and her breathes were coming in deep shallow gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a...You're a.. You're a...You're a.. You're a.. human,\" she said haltingly, shaking all the while, and then as the word human left her lips her eyes rolled back into her head. Dropping the metal helmet on the floor in made a clinking sound that echoed through the darkened house, though Amadeus was too busy catching the rabbit woman in his arms before she could hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm a human. Now wake up lady. Come on, wake up,\" he said to her, shaking her slightly. She had identified him as human, and that meant she might now where he could find a Combine Consulate, and a ride home. Focused on the woman as he was he barely perceived the entrance of another figure into the room, this one not carrying a candle, but outlined in the light of the one the rabbit woman had dropped Amadeus could tell the figure had lupine origins and very sharp teeth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Setting the rabbit woman as gently as he could on the floor, Amadeus looked at lupine form standing in the doorway into the entrance room of the odd tree/home before bolting out the door. He had no idea what kind of connection the two creatures had to each other, but he was not going to stick around and try and find out either. Jolting upward to his feet he rushed out the door as fast as he could into the night, abandoning the fur cloak and helmet, which would have been an encumbrance in a flight like his anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the entrance hall George Fennec rushed to the door to see that the man who had been holding his wife's limp form in his hands was already almost half a kilometer away, and getting farther all the time. Looking at where he'd been standing George could see some kind of metal head covering in the shape of a wolf's head which had probably been the source of the sound that had attracted him to the door. Kneeling over his wife, he slapped her face lightly with his left hand and trying to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Danielle, wake up. You can't die on me again,\" he said because her chest was moving in erratic patterns, and her breathe was coming shallow and grave. Looking into her face memories of losing her before flooded his mind, and he felt tears welling up, but they were quickly dried when she took a deep breathe again, her eyes opening to find her fox husband standing over her, his ears twitching noticeably in the wane light of her candle which had fallen to the floor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George,\" she wheezed out, pointing towards the door with a slightly panicked look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Danielle. Whoever it was is gone,\" he said, stroking her hair back behind her ears and getting it out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No George, that's not it. That man, he was human,\" she said, getting up and hurriedly grabbing for the fur cloak which the man had dropped, noticing for the first time the odd smell which came from the green wet stuff on it. Oddly it smelled kind of like blood, but none she'd ever smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was human, George. Like I used to be, but still looked like it,\" she told him, taking a deep sniff of the coat's odor, searching for the man's scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Impossible. The birds sealed up the portals, and besides when things come through them they change. You just had a traumatic experience. Come on, we'll get Kevin to give you some carrot juice to settle you down,\" said George, putting his arm around her and trying to lead her away from the door, but just as he reached the door into the house a wolf woman blocked his path holding a candle in her left hand and looking at the two with a worried eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay? Who was at the door?\" she asked of the fox and rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was noth-\" began George, but was cut off by Danielle as she pushed his arm off her and offered the cloak to Kell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a human Kell. You know, what I used to be, but I can't get his scent out of these furs, can you?\" she asked the wolf woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" responded Kell, taking the offered furs and looking at them closely. She too saw the blood stain, but unlike Danielle she knew without a doubt that it was blood, despite the fact that it was green and smelled odd. Bringing the garment closer to her nose she tried to weed through the scents of wolf fur and kzin blood for any odd scent, but unfortunately finding none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Danielle, but I don't smell anything. Are you sure it was a human?\" she asked, looking questioningly at the rabbit. Danielle's breathing slowed as she considered what she'd seen. Maybe it was just a hallucination brought on by the odd power outage which seemed to have effected the whole town as well as the cars. After a moment she turned back to Kell and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well then let's go see what we can find,\" said Kell, stepping around a stuttering George, who looked after the two females with a face that showed utter defeat. Shaking his head he went back through the door which Kell had entered, intending on informing the rest of the house of this supposed human. Outside the rabbit and wolf women were looking at the drive for any sign of the man's passage, and at the end of the drive they found something that confirmed that something odd had come up it just a moment ago, the tread print of a boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Kell, looking at the strange print which she didn't recognize at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shoe print. That proves it. No one on this entire planet wears shoes. That man was a human,\" proclaimed Danielle, looking off into the distance where the man had to have run. By now most of the extended family was in the door looking at the two women. Leaning down Kell got as good a scent as she could on the man's trail, following it up the drive before taking off into the woods. She found two separate trails dividing only a few meters out, and was quick to follow the one that lacked the wolf overtones the man had, had when he'd been wearing the furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way,\" she told Danielle, though everyone followed her as she sprinted off after the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Amadeus, having run as fast as he could manage over the uneven forest floor in his climbing boots, which was still pretty fast. He covered over three kilometers of ground before he finally had to stop to catch his breathe. Leaning against one of the taller trees he scanned the local area, searching for something that might indicate pursuit, but found none from his current level on the ground. Wanting to see more he realized that he could climb the tree, which seem taller than most of the ones around it, and look from atop it's branches for anything that meant he was being followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging the toes of the boots into the tree he felt an odd vibration, as if the tree were reacting to being bit into by the sharp points, but a moment later it subsided, and two test kicks found no vibration so he decided it was safe to ascend. Like a cat he made his way up, using the tree branches for hand holds, in combination with the boots to make it to the top only seconds after he'd started up. Looking down fro his new perch he was able to see a long ways off, and was disappointed to find that a small procession of figures was being led towards him by the rabbit woman as well as another lupine figure, though he didn't think it was the one from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, the bunny girl has other dog friends,\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're not friends, they're family,\" said a voice that seemed to come from all around him. Putting his hand securely on the branch he lt his gaze dart around looking for the source of the new voice which seemed female in tone, but he could find nothing close enough to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" he asked, spinning his head around hoping to find the speaker if she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. Now if you don't mind, could you please get out of my branches. You aren't very light,\" said the voice again, this time he could tell it was coming from everywhere as he watched the branches around him vibrate and rub in almost the same way a vocal cord does. Surprised by this he was caught off guard when the branch he was sitting on suddenly gave way and he began tumbling down towards the ground many meters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the tree, if it was the tree that had been talking, didn't seem to want to hurt him, and branches shifted position so that he hit many on the way down, keeping him from building up the momentum to cause a serious injury when he hit the ground, though with the many bumps and bruises that now dotted his body he almost wished the tree had just let him drop straight and take his chances. Slowly rolling off his back and then rising to his feet again Amadeus brushed off the dirt which had gotten into his suit and then put his hands behind his back and pulled, causing a loud cracking sound as his spine popped back into its accustomed place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my aching everything,\" he complained, trying to get his bearings back. Above him the tree now looked like any other tree in the forest, if a little larger, but after a second of observation he found the tree was least of his worries as he was now surrounded by an odd mishmash of humanoid creatures. Not planning on going down without a fight Amadeus dropped into a fighter's stance and drew the Startec pistol with his right hand and his axe, which was still strapped to his back, with his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, let's see what you guys have got,\" he said, intending on doing battle against the mysterious group of onlookers, but he was quick to notice that though they backed off a bit, none of them seemed to be making a threatening move. After a few seconds of silence a familiar figure stepped forward from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but we're not here to fight you. We just want to talk,\" said the bunny woman in a kindly voice. Amadeus, having survived on alien planets before did not lower his weapons, but he did rise from his crouching stance to stare the woman in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You identified me as human, so all I need to know is where the nearest Combine consulate is and then we can go our separate ways,\" said Amadeus to the woman. The others in the group were clearly at a loss and turned to the woman, who though she seemed composed, was obviously not enjoying the spot light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there are no human consulates on this world, from this Combine place or any other nation for that matter. Listen, you've been transported to another planet, maybe even another dimension, so you are understandably agitated. I was too when it happened to me,\" said the rabbit woman, motioning to him and then to herself in an a gesture meant to show him that they were in some way similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got sucked through a vortex too?\" asked Amadeus, not sure if he believed the woman or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no. Mine was more of a time/space hole thing, but I was dragged here without my permission. My name used to be Danielle Kendall, and I worked for the IRS in the United States of America,\" she told Amadeus proudly. Mulling over what he'd just heard Amadeus searched his memory for what IRS stood for. He remembered the United States, after all Jasmine had gotten him interested in the ancient history of Earth, specifically the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, just before Exodus, but IRS didn't ring any bells until he searched the back of his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Internal Revenue Service?\" he said questioningly, thinking back to a lecture on the hypercomplex tax system of that area and period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the IRS,\" she said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible,\" he said in disbelief, wondering how the woman could ever believe her claim of coming from some organization in a nation that existed tens of thousands of Earth Years ago on the lost Homeworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. You're in some parallel universe,\" she told him, and it clicked in his mind. She didn't have to be from his Earth, from Old Home Terra. After all a lot of humans in other dimensions named their homeworld Earth, a fact which had baffled xenoarcheologist since they first began to catalogue the various dimensions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the woman thought he was from her home he looked again at her eyes, and saw no hint of deception in them, though he did see something just as important, a gap in the circle that surrounded him. He was faced again with a choice. He could try to run again, making for the break in the trap in which he was caught, or he could put his weapons away and listen to what the bunny woman had to say.</span></div></div>",

After his rather bold statement one of the forms next to him slapped him on the back of his head, both moving the hat he was wearing in front of his eyes, and causing him to grip the back of his head in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Rudy,\" said the figure, this one with a very odd hairdo of spikes, though one that could easily have been worn by a human woman, if not for the fact that some of it seemed to be jutting straight out of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think going home would be a good idea. At least there we can talk privately with our new acquaintance about his situation, and maybe hear the specifics about how he got here,\" said one of the larger figures, this one also lupine and possibly related to the smaller one who'd spoken out a moment before. Amadeus, not really up on what to do in a situation where primitives are aware of humans, decided to follow without question and at least get some answers about where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little parade of various figures moved through the darkness without attracting much attention, mostly because whatever knocked out the power in the local area must have caused every animal and plant to go into a kind of stasis mode. It was like everything in the night were holding it's breathe, waiting for something glorious or horrible to happen. Of course by now Amadeus could see that many homes were lit by candle light, and he realized that his entrance to this world had probably caused a massive EMP that overloaded every circuit on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the procession a while to arrive back at the tree/home where Amadeus had first encountered the rabbit woman, much longer than it had when Amadeus had been running away and they had been running after him. Since they walked back and had to stop twice when Amadeus' boots got caught in debris that littered the path, their time was not surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone know where I can find a decent pair of walking shoes?\" asked Amadeus when he hit a third root and was forced to stop and yank at his leg to get it loose. He got some very odd stares from the other members of his group before Danielle walked up to his side and spoke in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, padded soles make shoes kind of irrelevant on this planet. I'm sure we can figure something out later though,\" she told him, and Amadeus looked down at the feet of the various forms to find that they were indeed barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" he said in acquiescence, accepting that a world where the major races had natural padding on their feet had little need for footwear of any sort. The rest of the trip back, barring the point where the younger lupine walked behind him and sniffed at his butt before being pulled away by the larger, maternal lupine, was uneventful. All in all it would have been a pleasant hike which he would have enjoyed making with Jasmine or Zee, though his present company was more than interesting enough to keep him from being bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the tree/home where his flight had begun he was surprised to find that they'd left the door open and unlocked. On most prim worlds he'd visited you wouldn't do that under any circumstances, though it really didn't matter as anyone who would check to see if the door was locked would be just as likely to break the door down as to be turned away by the minor obstacle. Still he had to admit that it was convenient that they didn't have to fiddle with a lock and key before going inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside most of the party stopped eyeing him for the moment as they began to take seats in what Amadeus took to be the living room, which was laid out along the lines of similar dwelling places he'd seen on a dozen different worlds, with many chairs facing the odd box which would display pictures when it received unique waves through the air that contained imaging data. This model had buttons, which usually indicated the ability to handle colored images using a system of mixing red, blue, and green, though since the majority of his party were canine, and most canines were color blind, he wondered why they bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah it's good to be home,\" said one of the larger figures as he lit a candle and placed it in the center of the room, and his rabbit like form was outlined by its light. Still, the dim candle was emitting barely enough light for Amadeus to make out anything, and he squinted in the darkness at his hosts before Danielle obviously remembered the human focus on vision and lit another candle, placing it with its brother and amplifying the light of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" she asked him, to the obvious puzzlement of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much, thank you, Danielle,\" responded Amadeus as pleasantly as he could. For a moment the figures studied their latest addition as the latest addition studied them back. Before Amadeus was an odd mixture of various creatures, each with human form basics, but some features that just screamed animals. The most prevalent species were wolves, the young male who had aroused the ire of the spike haired figure before stood between two others, a male and a female, to whom Amadeus could see he bore at least some resemblance, though more towards the female than the male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind those three stood another trio of figures, one gripping the older male wolf on his shoulders, though she appeared to be descended from some form of fox. Next to her stood another wolf female, this one far older looking that the one sitting down, though he thought she carried her years with grace and stamina, and finally standing behind the young male wolf was another fox, who might have been related to the female fox, though her ears were much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another sofa sat a literal bat boy and next to him the spike haired figure who'd hit the young wolf boy. Now in the light he could see the spikes were actually quills, and that the young woman was some form of porcupine or hedgehog. Beside that pair sat the large bunny man who'd lit the first candle, his eyes on the human even as he wove his arms protectively around a young baby sized rabbit he had sitting on his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the final sofa in the house sat the bunny girl from before and her fox husband, whom Amadeus assumed was the one who he'd seen in the entrance hall just before running off. The two made an odd looking couple to the human, though not the oddest he'd ever seen. After all one did not ply the spaceways without finding some very odd matches that seemed so wrong, yet were stronger than even the old Romeo and Juliet bond had been. Taking a moment Amadeus realized they'd been siting in silence for awhile, and he felt it needed to be broken, though he wasn't sure if he was allowed to speak now, being the guest, or what.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So then, where am I?\" asked Amadeus, breaking the silence that had settled over the room. The others, who had been intently studying him, all turned to one another as if looking for answers, but it was the hedgehog who spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your in our home, in the town of Domain, that's the best we can give you,\" she said simply, and after considering things for a moment the others in the group nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I have a planet name, even if it is a common one. So Danielle, how about you tell me how an IRS agent got from the United States of America to this place?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell us how you got here first? Or better yet how about your name and where you came from?\" responded the male fox beside Danielle. The others looked at him sharply, but the fox stood his ground, obviously trying to protect what Amadeus assumed to be his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust again. Okay then, my name is Amadeus Orman, and I'm from the planet Dedros in the Sarnok Galaxy's sector Foxtrot Hotel India, or FHI. I live on the southern landmass in a small city that has no name at the current time though I think the locals are petitioning that it be named Bob in honor of some old explorer, and I'm not sure how I got here specifically, so I was hoping the young lady could tell me how see can claim to be human, and yet clearly not be, and that might answer my own question about the how of my being here, and more importantly the how of me getting home,\" he told them matter-of-factly, and it seemed to stun them all into silence for a few moments before the hedgehog spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you're not from Earth?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not. I don't know of anyone who is, and I don't even believe that, that world exists, Mrs.?\" he said questioningly, holding out his hand towards the hedgehog girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot, you don't know our names. I'm Lindesfare,\" she said pointing towards herself and then motioning towards the batboy beside her, \"and this is Fenton\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there is Kell, my step mom, and her brother Ralph and their mother. Beside her is Rudy, her son and my step brother, as well as his girlfriend Fiona, who's mother is behind her and is married to Ralph,\" she said pointing towards the lupine sofa, each figure bowing in turn as they were named.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This large guy here is my dad, Kevin, and on his knee is his and Kell's child Coney,\" she said, motioning towards the bunny with his baby. Looking back over at the wolf woman he can just begin to see the similarity in her eyes and those of the young rabbit when Lindesfare turned his attention back towards her by motioning towards the last couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is George, Fiona's father, and you already heard Danielle's name,\" she said. Nodding his head at each figure proved a bit dizzying for Amadeus, but he did so anyway and put up with the slight discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet all of you. As duly recognized Combine representative I have the honor of first contact with you world,\" he told the gathering, to some very odd glances from all concerned, most especially Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, now that that's out of the way, what is this Combine you keep talking about. You were asking about their consulate earlier?\" asked Danielle, and Amadeus considered what he could tell them. They were obviously not ready to hear everything about the Combine and its history, and nor was he the right one to tell a grand sweeping story of that nature, but he also didn't want to offend them by remaining silent on the subject.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Combine is exactly what you think it is, a government of the people, for the people, and by the people,\" he told them, looking for their reaction. Seeing the blank looks on their faces Amadeus reached behind his head and scratched it, trying to rake out of his addled mind the words in English which he knew by heart in Combine Basic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about this, the Combine is a loose alliance of humans which rules about, well I have to think for a minute,\" he said, scratching his chin as he sat back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that number again?\" he muttered to himself, tapping his head with his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh forget it,\" he said eventually, rising up from his leaning position to look the gathering straight on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It rules approximately 10*10^50632 power systems totally, as well as bits and pieces of other various star systems. All in all we control only three galaxies completely, but we have spread out into so many others I can't keep track anymore,\" Amadeus told them, and he could see that both Lindesfare and Danielle were taken aback by the number, while some of the others obviously didn't understand what he'd just told them, or were simply incapable of comprehending a number with that many zeroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of systems,\" commented Lindesfare at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is. We've yet to encounter anyone bigger,\" said Amadeus, then looking around at his hosts, some of whom probably outweighed him by a few kilos he thought about what he'd just said and add, \"Astronomically speaking of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big deal,\" said Rudy, getting a glare of hatred from his step-sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Rudy, it's like multiplying this planet millions of times and then doing that again, and probably again,\" said Lindesfare, and Rudy considered that for a moment, recalling how big his planet really was from his venture into space, and then getting a blank look on his face when it occurred to him just how big a number that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he said at last, and Lindesfare smiled at Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah is a pretty good way to describe it,\" responded Amadeus, returning the hedgehog girl's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said loose alliance, what do you mean by that?\" asked Danielle, intrigued to hear anything that had to do with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we humans have never been that good at grouping together as other races. Get more than two humans in a single place and you usually have fist fights within minutes,\" he told them, and Danielle got a few looks from the gathering, as they silently asked her if this was true. Thinking back to her own world for a moment Danielle was forced to admit that violence was second nature to humans, and that Amadeus' words rang true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that's true,\" she said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than true. We humans are quite competitive compared to most of the races we've encountered, and our competitions seem to have a knack for finding ways of becoming deadly,\" added Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Combine is basically a government that's not a government. It allows the individual to do as they please, so long as they don't try and interfere in the affairs of the other individuals. That seems kind of counter productive to a society, but we have certain technologies that help make it work,\" said Amadeus, stopping to consider just how much he was allowed to tell the group before him about Combine technology, and just how much they could understand even if he did tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever he was going to say about the tech, and whatever questions they were going to ask were cut off as the lights in the room snapped back to life, forcing everyone to cover their eyes for a moment as they adjusted from the dim candle light to the overhead ceiling light which now shone brightly from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we've got power again. Maybe we should continue this tomorrow after those of us who aren't used to staying up all night have had a bit of a nap,\" said Danielle, getting up from her seat and turning down the brightness of the overhead light to make it easier to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it might be a good ide-\" began Kevin, before being interrupted by an odd sound. The ringing sound attracted every eye in the room as it came from...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's me,\" said Amadeus. Reaching behind his back Amadeus pulled a small catch on the side of his belt's back pouch, and pulled the flap of the pouch up to reveal a small handheld device that looked like a palm top computer, though there seemed to be no physical interface for the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee, buddy, are you online again yet?\" he asked of the small device, and the screen blossomed into animated life as a series of colored rings flowed outwards from the center of the screen, slowly filling it with the image of a human face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exor nabasihi ertos,\" said a human voice that came from the small device, and the face in the screen was obviously the one making the strange words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Osto normkan zyta,\" responded Amadeus, annoyance present in the tone of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zyta orvika?\" asked the small device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now start speaking in that language before I rip out your logic string and floss with it, bit brain,\" said Amadeus, and the device chirp something out in a kind of machine language which set Amadeus to striking it with his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are ladies and a baby present, so none of that now,\" he told the device, before setting in on the ground in front of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this everyone. Zee, you can come out of your box now,\" said Amadeus, and the little pad on the ground began to beep again, though this time in a lower pitched key. For a moment the beeping was relentless, and then without any warning at all it stopped, and the little pad leaped into the air, floating before the assembled group, most of which jumped  back in surprise, to Amadeus' amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging in the air and spinning for a few seconds the little device began to emit a new sound, and as the group looked on the sound was soon accompanied by what looked to be a bubble that formed on the skin of the device and slowly pushed outward. The bubble, a perfect sphere at first glance, was soon dotted with lumps which grew larger as the bubble expanded outward, and within moments the bubble was now in the shape of a human male, an outline without form or substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly again the bubble began to fill. Small squares of color and form began to appear on the clear outline of the man, giving him flesh and clothes that matched Amadeus, though he face was slightly different in shape. After a few seconds of filling in the man who had been an empty bubble a moment ago took in a breathe and opened his eyes, which were bright green in the soft glow of the ceiling light overhead. Looking around at the assembled group the man born of the strange device turned back to Amadeus and looked at him angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how annoying it is to be woken up from a restful sleep because you got lost again?\" asked the man of Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but then again, I'm the one getting lost,\" he responded, smiling at the man, who was obviously annoyed even more by Amadeus' lack of compassion for his circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have half a byte to leave you and go back into sleep mode,\" said the man, waving his finger warningly in Amadeus' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't,\" responded Amadeus, and the man was about to yell at him again when he froze in mid gesture and just stared into Amadeus' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I won't, but only because I'll get blamed if you get yourself killed, and I hate being blames for slag like that. So where are we anyway?\" asked the man, looking around again at the varied group in which he and Amadeus found themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our spiked friend says this is the town of Domain, and this s specifically the home of the Dewclaw family,\" said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything more general, like how about what galaxy this is?\" asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but you should be able to find out pretty quick. Danielle said this is an alternate dimension, so how about starting there first. Do a quantum pulse and see where we are,\" Amadeus told the man, who nodded gravely and then went rigid where he stood, closing his eyes to the world around him. For a moment he was frozen where he stood, like a statue, and then he opened his eyelids to reveal that his eyes had been replaced by green lit numbers that flashed across the space where they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could take a few minutes,\" commented Amadeus as he leaned back in his chair. The others, still surprised by the forming of their latest member from a small handheld computer were staring at the man with unadulterated interest. After a while Danielle finally looked over to Amadeus and gestured towrds the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" she asked Amadeus point blank, and Amadeus chuckled a bit before leaning forward again and facing everyone, who were all staring at him again waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Zee, he's a CAP, or Cyber Assistant Program. He's kind of my guardian, and he helps me to find my way home when I get sucked through interdimensional wormholes. Hopefully he's able to figure out where this planet is in relation to the Combine and we get gone before we interfere to much with your culture,\" said Amadeus. Rudy, looking over at the man and then at his CAP. Leaning forward slightly the young wolf boy stuck his finger into Zee's skin, and was surprised to find that it felt real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he said, mimicking almost exactly the tone he'd had earlier when he'd realized how big the Combine was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Zee is a piece of work. Great fighter too, once he gets into the battle, but don't tell him I said that,\" Amadeus told them, and before anyone could say anything else Zee closed his eyelids again, and opened them to reveal the green eyes he'd had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, you're not gonna like this,\" said Zee, turning to face Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Zee? Are we in an unknown dimension?\" asked Amadeus of Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the good news in all this. We're in a known dimension, one the Combine's explored, well, after all it is the home dimension of the Combine itself,\" said Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're currently 27 along the Tau, 36 along the Teh, and one along the Tec axis of time, which is home,\" said Zee, staring Amadeus in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what's the problem? Just contact the Combine and get us a ride home,\" said Amadeus, not understanding why Zee hadn't already done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the part you aren't gonna like. We may still be in the home dimension, but I have no idea where we are in it. My gravimet array can't ID any of the local galaxies\" said Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? If we're home you should be able to find at least one reference point, unless your gravimet is busted,\" responded Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought of that, but I ran all three system checks, and they confirm that it's operational at one-hundred over one-hundred efficiency. My sensors are perfect, but we aren't anywhere near the explored parts of this universe,\" said Zee defensively to Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" demanded Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we've only explored about nineteen percent of the universe, so we're just in one of those pieces we haven't been to ye-ugh!\" Zee, who had been standing tall and straight gripped his head in pain and went to his knees. Immediately Amadeus was at his side, staring with great concern at the form of Zee, which wavered, becoming a hollow bubble again before regaining it's solidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee, what is it?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some kind of massive data stream. I was searching for something to try and help find out where we are and I synced with it for a second,\" said Zee, his face pale with weakness as Amadeus helped him to his feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me, try again, this time, I'll connect slower,\" Zee told Amadeus, and he went rigid again, though this time he did not close his eyes, which stayed human looking. It was many moments before Zee moved again, and when he did he had a wide eyed look that bespoke of wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus, I know where we are,\" he told his human companion breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's some good news. What was it you connected with that told you where we are?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Archive, boss,\" said Zee, as if that explained everything, though even Amadeus eyed the CAP after his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, if you can connect t an Archive then you can get us a ride home,\" said Amadeus, not understanding why connecting to an Archive, one of the huge databases the Combine used, would cause Zee to go into a fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, I don't mean an Archive. I mean The Archive,\" said Zee, putting an emphasis on the word \u2018The'. For a moment the room was silent as the group tried to figure out what The Archive was, but Amadeus was mouthing wordlessly a thousand questions that popped into his mind at the statement that Zee had just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, you mean The THE Archive?\" he asked, and Zee nodded at him silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That The Archive, the one on Earth?\" he asked again, his own voice sounding weak as he asked the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that one,\" declared Zee, excitement obvious on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible. Now I know your malfunctioning. There is no way in the stars that what you just said is correct,\" Amadeus told him, and Zee shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is Deus. It is,\" stated Zee simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No way. Play the last message then. That will prove this isn't the Archive,\" said Amadeus, and Zee complied, sticking his hands out palms forward. An instant later streams of light shot from the flats of his palms, and together they slowly formed the image of a human woman with dark skin, and deep set eyes. Her features were those of someone who'd been fighting too many battles, and losing them more often than not. Sighing she faced the camera which was recording her and stared into the future from the distant past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. I'm not sure who is seeing this message, or even if you can understand me. Not that it matters. After all the way they designed this system it's doubtful anyone will ever even know it exists, or be able to access it,\" said the three dimensional image of the woman, which looked fake, especially when compared to Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Alice, and I have the sad duty to record this message for the future visitors to our once beautiful world of Earth. I am called the Secretary General of the United Nations by my people, which is an office that has in recent years grown in power to being near ruler of our world, or at least the closest we've ever had,\" she told whoever it was who was seeing the message in the far distant future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my last day on Earth. Most of our people boarded the Ark ships days ago, and left to find new worlds to inhabit, because we have so messed up this one. It is our hope that you who are viewing this are the descendants of those of us who travel to the stars, and that you have returned to help heal the damage we wrought on our mother earth, though I doubt we will ever return. After all, our past attempts to heal have only caused that much more hurt,\" said the woman, looking away from the camera, shame evident in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case, be you our descendants or some race which he cannot fathom, know that you now stand on Earth, the birthplace of humanity. We hope that you treat her more kindly than we have,\" said the woman simply, before the message cut off. Everyone in the room was silent as the light vanished back into Zee's hands and every eye turned towards Amadeus, who looked at his feet with an expression of pain on his face. Before anyone could react or say anything Amadeus bolted up from where he sat and rushed for the door. Slamming it open he rushed into the night.</span></div></div>",

George, with reflexes of a hunter, made to go after her, but was surprised to find that the instant his wife was out the door it shut again, and he was unable to open it. Looking down he saw that a hand was holding it shut, and that the hand was attached to a now many meter arm that eventually led back to Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of the door!\" he demanded, and Zee shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen George, those two need a bit of alone time right now,\" said Zee, and George was about to argue when a thought occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" he asked, realizing that the computer entity had never been told the names of those in their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus told me through telink. Basically he linked his mind with my processor and we had a very long discussion about you guys, and where he thought we were. When you saw us arguing in Combine Basic we were establishing a connection, and then after that, when I emitted a low pitched tone we linked and he told me your names. Or at least the names he knows,\" added Zee as an after thought, realizing that three of the individuals in the group had been given as relations, not names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, now how about letting go of the door so I can go after my wife?\" asked George, who had been trying to open the door all through Zee's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't, for the reason that right now Danielle and Amadeus have something very important in common,\" said Zee, who motioned for George to take his seat. Unable to open the door against the surprising strength of the hologram George did so and stared with venom in his gaze at Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean they have something very important in common? That they're human?\" he asked, trying to understand why the computer wouldn't let him go after the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. If that was all they had in common I'd go after them myself to keep them from killing each other. No what they have in common is that they both lost their homes, and have very little chance of going back,\" said Zee, and everyone was forced to remember that Danielle came from another world, and though she had given it up by choice, she still missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm her husband,\" protested George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you worried that Amadeus will try to get between you two? Don't worry about it. If he even thought about something like that Jasmine, his only real friend back home, would skin him, and then I myself would rub salt in his wounds,\" responded Zee, though his words didn't seem to be that much comfort to George, who continued to stare at the door like he was going to make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why aren't you as upset as he obviously is by being stranded here?\" asked George, trying to distract Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this is Earth we're stranded on,\" he said as it that was explanation enough, but everyone's looks told him it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Earth is the homeworld for humans, and of course those like me born from humans. Its location has been lost for a very long time, and now, we find it. I doubt you can ever understand the significance of that, but to me and to a lot of people back home, this is a great day. Eventually I'll be able to get home, if only by building a beacon and sending out a call for help, but boss. Well humans only live so long, just like all biologics. Humanity has been searching for this planet for thousands of years, and there is a good chance that even with a beacon to guide them they won't find it for millennia yet,\" said Zee, looking out the window by the door, which now had a few stars staring through it as the clouds over head were finally blown away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, racing through the underbrush, Danielle followed the scent of Amadeus towards the west. Amadeus, used to a higher gravity, was making good time even in his climbing shoes, but Danielle had been living on the world for months, and had learned the area around the Dewclaw's home well enough to find easier paths through the woods. It wasn't long before she caught up with Amadeus, who stood in front of a babbling brook, gazing at his reflection in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, hearing about this world in the history books I expected it to still be covered waste deep in slime and muck,\" said Amadeus to her, without turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would find it too, if the birds hadn't altered time,\" she said, sitting down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked, staring at her with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The birds. When I first got here from my world I was captured by birds, and then just as I was trying to leave two more came and went to my world, saying that the balance had to be restored. After that we came back home and one of them told us everything, or at least enough to make a good picture of what happened,\" she told him, staring down at their reflections in the darkened water, which were becoming more clear as more stars were revealed by the clouds blowing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said that humans messed up that planet so bad they finally left, and that the birds, being the only animals able to fly above the sludge that now covered the surface, evolved into sentient beings and used some left behind equipment to go back and change the past, taking humans out, and replacing them with animals that had been altered, made smarter,\" she told him, almost word for word what she'd been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. That explains it. Those birds probably mistook the Tempus technology for a time machine. That's why we lost track of where Earth was. It shifted position in relation to the Arks, probably while they were still flying through space,\" commented Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean \u2018mistook'? You mean that the birds didn't find a time machine?\" asked Danielle, obviously confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wasn't. After all the Tempus was supposed to help us repair the planet, now just make a splinter dimension where we never screwed it up in the first place. It didn't work right though, so we eventually abandoned it, and a bunch of other stuff, when we left. Or at least that's what some would have you believe,\" he told her, picking up one of the rocks that sat beside the water he began to toss it from hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the birds used Tempus to eliminate humans in the past, and then probably used the Morpheus gun to make animals sentient. That would explain that family I just walked out on, and the Tempus would explain how you came to be a bunny girl too,\" he told her, turning to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, watching as he picked up another rock and began to juggle the two stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the Tempus is a quantum waveform manipulator. It alters waveforms to their past or future states, however we found that using it on a wide scale causes certain distortions in space time to occur, like the hole you said you came from,\" he said, tossing the rocks even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to prevent anyone who came through from experiencing quantum cascade, the effect in which a set of quantum twins exist together in the same dimension causing the visitor twin to begin decaying, we made it so that the Tempus will overlay the local waveform over the visitor. In effect the Danielle that existed here was cut and pasted onto you,\" he explained as he picked up a third rock and added it to his juggling act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that explains why Lindesfare and I both look like those we are doubles of,\" she said, remembering Lindesfare's story about Fiona's mother, who had remained human after coming across the doorway, and wondering why she hadn't changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to prevent the cut and paste effect, say a barrel of something?\" she asked him, wondering what could have prevented something that advanced from doing its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A barrel? Well I guess it could, if it was full of some kind of byproduct of radiation, or a lead lined container. Both could cause the Tempus to view the object as a piece of that universe, but once opened, if the twin existed within the universe they traveled to, then the object or person would begin to decay, and literally vanish before your eyes. I'm guessing something like that happened,\" he said, knowing that Danielle wouldn't have asked unless it was so, and her nod told him he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened to Fiona's mother. It's why she was looking at you weirder than the others. She had a human body for a while, and I guess seeing you brings back memories she'd rather forget,\" said Danielle, watching as Amadeus added another stone to his collection, keeping all four in the air easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she can get over that, after all I'm not going to be leaving any time soon,\" he said in a lonely voice, staring up at the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you'll just have to do what I did. Make this place your home,\" said Danielle, and Amadeus smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. That's gonna take a bit of doing though. If that family is any indication this world isn't exactly a kind place,\" he told her, picking up a fifth rock with his foot and tossing it into the fray with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an okay place once you get to know it. I mean I found George here, and I'm sure if you looked you could find someone,\" she told him, not the slightest hint of lust in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe. Jasmine would be a bit miffed, but then again we never did have that close a relationship,\" he said, more to himself than to Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Jasmine?\" asked the bunny woman out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz is a friend from home. We Game together all the time, taking parties of new recruits into the depths of Hel's realm, or up against the Empire and the evil Vader, though our latest ones have always involved getting a Yggdrasil plant away from a dragon atop a mountain. We have yet to win it, but we're getting...I mean we were getting closer. Who knows, maybe she got it, after all when I left we were near the top, and the rest of the party was still in flawless condition,\" he said, correcting his grammar because he knew he might never get to finish playing the Game now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...sounds like quite a woman,\" said Danielle, somewhat sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is, though I think she likes Zee more than me,\" he said, remembering all the times the two had wandered off together in the Games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, Zee is a computer program, isn't he?\" she asked, remembering the thing that had come out of Amadeus' PDA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but that's not too much of a problem in the Combine. Heck, I've been suspecting that Jazz might be an AI herself, but I can't prove it, and it doesn't matter. She thinks, therefore she is, the motto of the Combine,\" he said, tossing all five rocks in succession towards a stone on the other bank of the stream. Each one struck the stone in turn, creating an ever brightening array of sparks that lit the night for a few seconds before fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean, she thinks like a human, therefore she is,\" said a familiar voice and the two turned to find that they had gained company to watch as the sun slowly rose over the horizon. It was Zee and..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Zee,\" said Amadeus, rising from his sitting position. Danielle rose as well, but she looked into George's eyes and saw a bit of an accusing look that made her look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on George, I told you boss doesn't do those kind of things. Heck, I'm not even sure he can do those with your wife,\" said Zee, gently striking George on the arm and looking down at Amadeus, his own gaze full of laughter and amusement. Amadeus, realizing for the first time that Danielle's coming to him could be seen as somewhat unfaithful, glared daggers at the CAP, who only seemed more amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny Zee. George, I'm sorry if you think something happened between me and Danielle, but you should have a bit more faith in her. She really likes you, we just had a discussion about some things,\" said Amadeus, and the others of the group all looked at George, who's fury ebbed at seeing the shame in his wife's face. Shame he knew was for him being suspicious, and not for her being unfaithful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I should, but you are the first one of her own kind she's seen in a while, and well... oh I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Danielle,\" he said at last, and Danielle's face was broken by a smile. The two raced to each other, and soon everyone was standing on a slight slope over looking the brook as first the false dawn, and then the true dawn finally began to light the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So De-Light, you ready?\" asked Zee, using his pet name for Amadeus which he pronounced Daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As ready as I can be bit brain, and since you brought the audience, I think I should get to decide the rules,\" responded Amadeus, nodding at Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said Zee, stepping away from the group who were staring at the two humans with questioning looks. Amadeus, who seemed to have forgotten that they were watching, undid the shoulder belt to which his axe was clipped and then his real belt to which his gun and pouch were connected. Gathering up the two belts he folded the gun belt over the shoulder one and held them out to Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take these for me for a minute?\" he asked, and Danielle, though slightly confused, took the offered items. Next Amadeus reached down and untied the laces for his boots, which he slipped off to reveal that his polymer mesh suit was full body, covering even his feet in it's thin membrane. Free of everything but the body suit Amadeus ran out so that he and Zee were facing each other across a small clearing of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rules are simple. No weapons, yield win,\" said Amadeus, drawing a line in the loose dirt using his heel. Zee responded likewise and then bowed across the way at Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With each new day,\" began Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comes the promise of a new battle,\" finished Zee, and without another word the two charged at each other, both dropping low and holding out their arms so that they appeared to be birds of prey swooping in for the kill. As they collided Amadeus fell to the ground, sliding forward with his legs held out in a v shape. As he met Zee he brought his legs together, intending to take Zee to the ground with the scissor movement. Zee, knowing the move was coming, leaped into the air to avoid it, and then came down fist first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the attack from the air, Amadeus rolled to the side, sliding out of the way as Zee plummeted to the ground, burying his fist in the dirt with the force of his blow. Without a pause Amadeus struck, using his feet again he delivered a low kick to Zee's head, which was in perfect position thanks to his stooped over posture. The blow sent the CAP flying several feet into the air before coming down in a slide that ended with his head slamming into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time it appeared the fight might already be over, as Zee did not move after the impact, but Amadeus did not rise from his stance as he approached, holding his hands at a level where he could send a straight and powerful punch at anything in front of him. His walk was guarded as he got near the still form of Zee, and it proved to be needed as Zee suddenly bolted up, and the two began to punch at each other so fast their fists became blurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the untrained eyes of the watchers the two fighters seemed to be the exact same in style and power, though to the two fighting they knew the difference between their strengths was large, and that their styles were designed to take advantage of their individual skills. Were Zee was pushing aside the punches thrown by Amadeus, allowing the fists to come closer, but letting them do less damage than Amadeus' style, in which he blocked the punches using his forearm, forcing him to absorb the blows, but not letting them as close to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punches continued to fly between the pair as they slowly walked away from the edge of the clearing until they stood in the center again, with the group of anthromorphs watching the battle rage on. The sun, which had only just arisen, caused the two fighter to appear as blazing outlines in its golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the stalemate ended in a draw as Zee drove his left fist into Amadeus' face while at the same time Amadeus did the same to him. The two hung in the air for a second as they absorbed the power of the other's blow and then flew across the clearing a short ways before falling to he dirt and sliding a ways. Zee used the moment of his slide to flip, doing a headstand for a brief moment before standing upright again and facing his foe with a look of childlike amusement in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus slid a bit farther than Zee and used his fingers to stop his slide, digging them into the ground to kill his momentum. Looking towards Zee he growled in fury, and watched as the CAP leaped into the tree above him, and grabbing a branch he swung onto it, landing in a standing position atop it. Amadeus, not one to be left in the dust, rolled to his feet and then leaped up himself, copying Zee's maneuver to land on the branch in a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at each other across the clearing the two fighters simply waited, each taking a moment to gauge the other's strength, before Amadeus broke the stillness by leaping onto the end of his branch and using it as a kind of diving board, leaping towards Zee. Responding in kind Zee flew into the air to meet him and the two collided in the air, exchanging two punches before each ended up in the tree in which their opponent had started, though a branch or two farther up, and before either could really recover they both launched into the air again, to similar results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ballet in the air continued for four more leaps until both had reached the tops of the trees in which they had originally started. Now atop the trees the diving board trick wouldn't work, but Zee figured out the solution to the problem, leaning back on his tree so that it leaned slightly, and then using it like a catapult to fling him across the clearing at Amadeus, who copied the technique. When the two met this time in flight Zee was slightly lower due to his tree's height, and the two hit each other, changing the paths of their flights so that Zee plummeted to the ground and Amadeus rose upward before arcing down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZee, who had his back to the ground, struck the dirt hard and created a slight impression as he did so. Amadeus, who had a bit more time to prepare for his impact, rolled just as he hit the ground, and leaped up into a standing position just in time to get tackled by Zee who seemed unfazed by his recent landing. Holding his arms across Amadeus' neck in a v shape he pinned the man to the ground and squeezed slightly before letting up and staring him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yield?\" asked the CAP of his human.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amadeus looked like he was about to respond with a bad word when he suddenly spit in Zee's face, causing the AI to rear back in surprise. Taking advantage of this Amadeus slammed his hands into Zee's chest using the flats of his palms like battering rams to send the poor electronic entity flying into a tree, this time rushing after him and holding his own arms in a v over Zee's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you?\" asked Amadeus, this time smiling himself. Zee looked slightly hurt, but stood silently for a moment not saying anything before nodding. Laughing Amadeus let him rise to his feet and the two clasped hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said no weapons?\" asked Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but I don't think spit usually qualifies. Well not for humans anyway,\" responded Amadeus as the two walked back towards the stunned on lookers, who stood silently staring at the two who just moments ago had seemed to be trying to kill each other engage in a friendly conversation. Reaching the place where they stood Amadeus held out his hand and Danielle, realizing she was still holding his belts, handed them back to him. Placing both belts on the ground Amadeus opened the pouch on his gun belt and withdrew a small silver cylinder, which Danielle knew to be a flute, though the others didn't recognize the instrument because their world, with the varying shape to their mouths, had never developed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since you won, that means you get to decide the story. Which one do you want De-light?\" asked Zee as he took position behind him. The others, not understanding watched as the human stared into the sky for a silent moment before turning back to his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the Serpent of Shadows? I like it,\" said Amadeus. Zee seemed ready to object for a moment, but thought better of it, and then sighing he stood behind Amadeus who had sat down cross-legged on the grass. Putting the flute to his lips Amadeus blew a few notes, and Zee used them to tune himself, singing in a high tenor to compliment the high notes of the flute. At last the two were ready and Amadeus began to play an airy tune as Zee hummed along, before he spoke the words to the old poem in a beautiful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Listen to me and I'll spin the yarn,<br>\r\n\tabout a creature that caused all great harm.<br>\r\nWithin the darkness did it lay low,<br>\r\n\tWatching the stars, its eyes all aglow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from there Zee began to sing about a creature called the Vorka, a serpentine thing that dwelt, according to his song and the pictures he created in the air in the same way as the image of the woman before, within the heart of a neutron star. Slowly it came out that the Vorka was a creature of darkness, designed by a foul race as a weapon, and let loose in the universe to destroy their enemies by burrowing into a star and causing it to collapse in on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with most weapons of that kind it eventually turned on its makers, destroying them as well, and continuing unopposed through the heavens until meeting up with a Combine vessel called the <i>Eternal Vengeance</i>. Whether true or not the group watch transfixed as the images of the rocket like craft did battle with the serpent, at last driving it into the one thing in the universe with more mass than itself, a black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And there lads and lassies I end this tale,<br>\r\n\tWhich happened long ago in the galaxy of Thale.<br>\r\nNow the monster has passed into ancient lore,<br>\r\n\tit eyes in the darkness glowing no more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe song done Amadeus played a few more notes before finally ending his flute playing, and above him Zee showed one last image of the <i>Eternal Vengeance</i> as it flew away from the hole into which it had lured the great beast. The air in the clearing was still for a few minutes as the group began to digest what they'd just heard and seen. Rudy was the first to recover and step forward out of the group to stare at the human and computer duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he asked, his voice, though he tried to hide it, full of wonder at the story he'd just been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the tale of a bard. Dad always told us that the bards of the old world were the greatest fighters, so me and Zee imitate them, taking the stories we hear about battles and turning them to song, though Zee insists on updating the performance by adding pictures,\" said Amadeus as he put the flute back in its pouch and re adorned his shoulder and gun belts as well as his climbing boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you play it again?\" asked Rudy, this time unable to hide how much he'd enjoyed the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would kid, but I think it best that we get somewhere and hide for right now, cause as accommodating as you folks are, some of your neighbors might ask some very pointed questions about us,\" said Zee, reminding the group that both he and Amadeus were human looking, which was quite different from the races of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since we're not leaving for awhile, does anyone have any place we can bunk at?\" asked Amadeus, looking at the group. Fenton, the batboy, was the first to raise his hand and point at a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tree still has a spare bedroom, and it's closest, so why don't you two go there?\" he offered, and the group nodded in agreement. Amadeus and Zee, needing no more prodding made their way towards the indicated dwelling. Most of the others, yawning due to the lack of sleep from the night before, went towards their own homes, to start the business of their day. Rudy asked his parents if he could stay home from school before his family was out of ear shot, but Amadeus could almost feel his mother's glare on the young wolfboy indicating his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burned kid,\" commented Amadeus as he and Zee raced over the morning dewed grass, silver droplets flying in the air at their passing. The two were still not fast enough to catch up with Fenton, who even carried Lindesfare in one hand as he flew through the air to his home. When they arrived everyone looked around a bit nervously, but was relieved to find that the forest's diurnal were just waking up, and the nocturnal ones were already in bed, and had been for some time. Thinking themselves lucky the four went into the tree, which Amadeus recognized as the one that had talked to him earlier that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tree, I'm home, and I have guests,\" said the bat, and the tree seemed to vibrate with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that Fentonm and recognize Lindesfare, but who are the other two. Wait a second, one of them was in my branches earlier tonight,\" said the tree, though how it recognized him Amadeus didn't know. Fenton and Lindesfare stopped as they remembered that they had indeed discovered Amadeus laying in a heap beside Tree earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, we found you at the foot of Tree. How'd you wind up there?\" asked Lindesfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I climbed to the top of...?\" he said, wondering what gender the plant was but then assuming from the voice that it was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, I climbed all the way up Ms. Tree to get a better look around and see if the bunny girl or her lupine friend was following me. I know now that the bunny girl was Danielle, and the lupine was probably George, though at the time I didn't think they would be friendly, so I was going to stay in the tree and hide when she spoke to me, and I was so surprised I lost my balance and fell. She caught me, and stopped me from really hurting myself, and then you guys found me,\" said Amadeus, telling his side of the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. Well then I guess we're gonna turn in. I don't suppose humans are nocturnal and sleep during the day?\" asked Fenton, wondering if they would have to put up with Zee and Amadeus talking while he and Lindesfare tried to sleep. They had already silently agreed that he would take Lindesfare back to college later, as the human was going to be much more interesting than any of her classes for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normal humans aren't, but I'm a Gamer, so I've learned to sleep when I can, and right now a few hours of REM sounds good. How about you Zee?\" asked Amadeus of his CAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't require sleep, though I do like the chance to power down and recharge to full. Today however I think I'll take some time and explore this world if you don't mind, boss,\" said the AI, looking out at the slowly awakening world outside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought you wanted to stay hidden?\"asked Fenton, confused about how Zee could explore the world outside without exposing Amadeus. Zee did not say anything, and instead demonstrated his adaptability by changing before Fenton and Lindesfare's eyes into a shorter, though bulkier, wolf much like Kell and her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stay hidden if I need to. De-light may stand out like a lamp in a dark house, but I can blend in when the situation requires,\" said Zee, moving towards the door and looking askance at Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but try not to disrupt this place too much,\" said Amadeus, and before he even took in another breathe the CAP was out the door and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, where should I sleep?\" asked Amadeus of his hosts. Fenton led him to the spare bedroom, which they discovered was not going to suit the human well as the bed was designed for Fenton, being a stick hanging out of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. I forgot. We gave the bed to your uncle the other day Lindesfare. I guess we don't have a spare bed. Maybe you can make it to Fiona's. She lives in a mansion and there should be at least one spare bed there,\" commented Fenton, but outside many people were already up and about, and there was no way to get Amadeus to her house without attracting suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is a couch. If you guys don't mind it too much I can sleep on it,\" suggested Amadeus as they passed the sitting room where a sofa sat facing a TV. Fenton and Lindesfare looked at each other with some concern before turning to face Amadeus again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that works, but you should mind the quills. Lindesfare lost quite few in that couch,\" warned Fenton. Amadeus, looking at the hedgehog girl's quills new them to be no laughing matter, but without testing with his hand he fell onto the sofa and laid on it. Feeling a prick in his back he pulled out half a dozen quills, none of which had pierced his suit. Seeing their guest was comfortable the pair went back to Fenton's room, which soon echoed with the sounds of snores. Feeling his own eyes getting heavy Amadeus too fell into the land of dreams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>CAP designated ZX3A-Virtue's journal entry number 7-09-06934. After our arrival on what I can now confirm to be Old Home Terra my partner Amadeus and I are still getting used to the particulars of our new circumstances,</i> recorded Zee to himself as he walked away from Tree towards the main part of the city, which he had been told was called Domain. An odd name for a city, though considering the origins of the residence it seemed somewhat appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I find it odd to breath in the air that so many people have searched so long for, and know that only hours ago neither Amadeus nor myself even believed this planet existed. Chalking it right up there with the legends of Vida, the diamond planet, and the Guardian's Gate, an artifact that can supposedly transport one between dimensions along the Tec axis of time, something no known science has been able to do on purpose, though accidents have occurred,</i> continued the CAP as he dropped to all fours and began running like a wolf. Oddly it felt more natural than the bipedal posture which he had been using, something that he would have to question his hosts about later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As stated in previous entries I believe that Amadeus is unique, even for a human type mind set. His initial reaction to the data regarding our location was flight, and after only a few minutes of juggling rocks he came to accept his circumstances. I find myself drawn back to mother's speech about how Orman males usually juggled rocks when they needed to think something out. She said it helped them to see things as a moving whole rather than a frozen snapshot,</i> Zee said internally to his secondary processor, which would record his thoughts for later viewing by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever the case I find this new world to be an intriguing place, and am quite sure that Amadeus will as well once he fully gets over his disappointment at being pulled away from Dedros and Jasmine. However once he does become interested in this place I must find some way to get him to blend in. This is a world of eat or be eaten, and while Amadeus' battle skills are exemplary, I do not believe them to be sufficient for his protection on a planet where he will be viewed by a large percentile of the population as food stuff,</i> observed Zee as he at last encountered the road he had been expecting to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he found no other creatures on the road, either driving in vehicles or walking along it as he himself was, though footpaths and other evidence suggested that the road was used to both kinds of traffic on a regular basis. It was highly likely that the power outage the previous night had disrupted some of the local fauna, causing some to oversleep or simply refuse to awaken with the morning. Zee, having been adversely affected himself, was ninety-three point five percent sure that the tunnel that had brought himself and Amadeus to Earth had been the cause, and that the EMP had effected the fauna directly as well, being that the lower functions of their brains would have been disrupted as well as their electronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The culture, which I discussed with the extended Dewclaw family during my first few active moments on this planet, seems to be an odd mixture of Polymer Age America, the time when that particular nation was experiencing odd upheavals due both to the economic situation of that age, as well as the lack of control over media, which in turn caused more than a little chaos as government secrets as well as unsubstantiated rumors reached the public in contexts that caused massive discontent that was most often not deserved,</i> continued Zee as he started walking along the road in the direction of Domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Along with the American culture there are overtones which mimic Zevian culture. The Zevians, an insect-like race of Vodok-Ver, is known as one of the few species to continue practices of cannibalism after achieving space flight due to the lack of any other organism on their planet thanks to their ancestors appetites. This caused an odd evolutionary design where the race became caste like, with offspring servicing as food for stronger members of their race if they were slain. This system is still practiced in some Zevian colonies, though they also vary their diet with other food stuffs now,</i> explained the CAP to himself, knowing that he might not recall the race right off upon later playings of his journal entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped his internal musings as he at last came to the city's real limits and out of the suburbs in which his new acquaintances made their homes. He was not startled to find that the building design in the city varied greatly from the more natural ones outside. He spotted dozens of brick and mortar office buildings, as well as a few glass ones, which were a far cry from the caves and trees in which the population lived outside the urban area. Observing the rising of some of the locals he was intrigued to see the mixing of predator and prey in the streets of the early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came to a halt at a cross walk he observed a family of rodents, apparently mice of some sort, as they made their way across town on foot. The mother in the lead appeared to be having a difficult time of keeping her younger children in line, though that was through no lack of trying. One of the youngsters, a female by her looks, got away from her mother and ran into the street after a small rubber ball which bounced in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching up with the toy the child stopped in the middle of the street, and Zee heard the sound of an approaching car just as it careened into view, going in excess of ninety-three kilometers an hour. Such a speed meant it would have no chance to stop, and he projected it's current course as intersecting the young mouse in less than two point oh eight seconds. The woman had a nine in four chance of grabbing her daughter back before she was splattered, but Zee was unsure if she would be able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out at the girl he debated whether to save the life of the young one or to allow the natural events to occur, whatever they might be. Personally he would do whatever it took to preserve the life of another sentient, but in this case he was also aware of the fact that saving her would violate the noninterference in primitive cultures treaty that the Combine had signed. Considering everything in the span of a heartbeat Zee...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaping forward Zee initially planed on grabbing the young mouse, but found that his new hand were much stronger than the human ones to which he had grown accustomed. Not wanting to hurt the child during his attempt to save her Zee did something that he had seen in nature films about wolves and other large quadrupeds and used his mouth to scoop up the rodent, hooking his teeth on the scruff of her neck, and then jumped forward just in time to avoid the incoming vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling as he fell forward Zee tried to curl his body into a protective shell around the now screaming and crying mouse child, who was understandably afraid of her rescuer who had come at her mouth open. Luckily the child realized his intent was not to harm her very quickly, and rested still as his body absorbed the impact of their hitting the other side of the street with the full force he'd put behind his leap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce safely on the sidewalk again Zee uncurled his body and released the mouse girl on the ground, who was almost instantly grabbed by her mother's waiting arms, the woman and her children having crossed the intersection on the red light which the driver of the vehicle had in advertently run. The woman, with the child in her arms, looked over at her savior with wide eyes, and Zee was again reminded that to her species he looked like a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she breathed out, still stunned by the rapid pace of the events previously. Zee noticed that several others were now looking toward him and the mouse woman, probably wondering why a wolf would save a mouse child. Zee, not caring about social graces at the moment, crossed his hands in a prayer gesture and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the Eye that it saw fit to give me the wisdom to save her,\" he said, wondering if he would be able to introduce the religion of the Eye to these people. Amadeus was a self-proclaimed irreligious bastard and would probably care less about what Zee did in that regard on this planet, but Zee still felt the tugs of the Combine at his heart, or rather what passed for his heart. He wasn't supposed to interfere in other cultures at all, let alone introduce new religions to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for the woman to grasp his words or what they meant Zee turned on his heels and walked farther into the city, still unsure of where it was he was going. He never had a destination when he'd come here, intending only to watch the flow of the city, but he felt the eyes of the others on him, and he knew he would now have to pick a destination or risk having a small crowd follow him everywhere he went for a while. Luckily for the CAP a voice broke out over the bustle of the city, one he recognized from the morning's events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a very nice thing you did for that woman back there,\" said the voice of Kell Dewclaw, the wolf woman. Zee had modeled his current form off of her and her family, because they had been the most numerous of his selections the previous night, and thus they had the most attributes he could jumble together to make an original form for himself. Obviously he had done good work as Kell gave him a cursory sniff or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" she asked after a moment, her olfactory senses recognizing her scent as well as that of her son, brother, and mother in Zee's. Not knowing how exactly to proceed with the crowd still looking at them Zee nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kell Dewclaw, you do. We met last night, remember I'm the out of town cousin visiting for a while,\" said Zee, hoping she'd play along. Zee hadn't really bothered with thinking about how he and Amadeus would fit into this new world, but being a cousin from out of town would help to make the transition easier for him, and from what he'd heard the night before the Dewclaw name carried a bit of clout, which would help him to defend Amadeus when he claimed him as a friend who was there with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKell, looking at the strangely familiar wolf was still considering his words when she recalled the computer man who'd been born from a PDA carried by the human. She realized with a sudden shock that the CAP had somehow cut pasted attributes of herself and her family into a unique form, which had the odd effect of truly making her look related to him. Catching his drift and the story he was trying to lay Kell gave a slightly embarrassed laugh as they continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right. In the whole power outage incident I had forgotten about you and your friend. I feel so  silly now, but I thought you and that strange friend of your's were going to be staying with Tree today,\" she said, taking Zee's arm and leading him towards what Zee recognized as a caf\u00e9 of sorts, though the menu was not something he'd ever seen before, consisting of species rather than dish names. The crowd, seeing the odd wolf pair walk into the caf\u00e9 considered it perfectly normal that someone related to Kell would save a mouse child like that, her being married to a rabbit and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost would forget the incident by the end of the day, though the mouse woman's child would fondly tell her children stories about the big strong wolf that had stood between her an a monstrous truck, beating the thing back using the power of his howl. Kell and Zee were just as glad that he crowd blew off to the winds, going about their own business as they took a seat in the nearly deserted open air caf\u00e9, which was still in the process of opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing here? I thought you and the human were going to be hiding all day?\" asked Kell in a hushed tone from behind one of the menus which she used to hide her face from the outside world. Considering the range of hearing of most of those passing by Zee wondered if the gesture was really worth it, but decided it best to respond in kind, putting his own menu into a standing position between him and the passing crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While my companion my require rest, especially after the night he had, I do not, and this planet, as I said before, is utterly fascinating to me. I wish to explore, and as you can see I can physically blend in when the situation calls for it,\" he told her, running his hand over his current form, showing that it now resembled her's quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's true enough. You even smell like I do. How do you do that if you're just a hologram?\" she asked, relaxing a bit, probably having believed that some problem had arisen in getting Amadeus to Tree or that the sleeping quarters had proven insufficient for his needs. The latter would not prove true at all. As a Gamer Amadeus had been trained to sleep wherever he could, and had slept on battlefields, both real and Game, in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am much more than a simple hologram. As I explained to you and your family earlier this morning I am a CAP, and that means I must be capable of many things, including scouting areas that would be dangerous for my companion to go. To do this properly we CAPs must be able to mimic anything in the environment, including its smell, texture, shape, and even taste,\" he told her, not explaining exactly how he did this because he knew she wouldn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know what I taste like?\" asked Kell, interested more in his data collection now than how he had been able to mimic things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple. The smell coming off anything is formed by particulate matter being shed by the object, in much the same way as taste. I extrapolate the data for one from the other,\" he said, giving her a very broad description. The truth was in fact that he had tasted wolf before and simply extrapolated the differences in taste based off the differences in the other sensory data sets, but he didn't think she needed to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then, since you know what I taste like, would you like to sample some other cuisine? This place is a very nice breakfast spot and they make excellent dishes,\" she advised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not require nutritional ingestion as I am still a CAP and thus powered by a trinary crystalic core, so anything that I eat would be wasted, and I hate to waste life,\" said the CAP, not wanting to get into a philosophical debate about the way a machine values life. It would take the prim worlders time to truly understand Zee, whom they probably considered just a very advanced computer. Amadeus would probably set them straight by force if anyone made that assertion in front of him, as Zee had found Amadeus disliked it when anyone insulted his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, do you mind if I have something?\" she asked him, probably wondering about whether he would be insulted if she ate something when he required nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said pleasantly, hoping to reassure the wolf woman that he was not a hostile being by any means. In fact Zee was a conscientious objector, believing that violence for the sake of taking a life to no purpose was wrong. That did not mean he thought violence was wrong, or that killing was, just that he hated to see life go to waste. Kell, probably not worrying about any of that, called a waiter over to her and ordered for herself a slice of ham, which promptly arrived and disappeared with a speed that made the CAP feel like he need a chronometer check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a nice snack. So Zee, are you going to continue to explore the city? If so how'd you like to come to my office with me. You can observe some very interesting social interaction there,\" she told Zee, and Zee recognized the ploy. Kell was trying to protect him, taking him to an environment where she would be able to watch over him. Zee, being a human mind set, was very independently minded, but he had to consider that having Kell around would help him to blend easier, as she could offer at least some advice on local customs, all on the pretext of him being an out of town cousin. After a moment or two of though Zee told her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Excellent,\" said Kell, and the two got up from their seats. Kell left a few small metal discs and several pieces of parchment on the table that Zee recognized as currency. Studying it for only a moment he was surprised by the similarity to the bills and coins of the nation state upon which the culture was based. He would need to form a hypothesis later on how such a thing occurred, though knowing that there was at least some bleeding from another Earth as well as the influence of the avians and the Archive, gave him a plausible explanation for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogther the two made their way through the fast filling streets of the city, which were now divided very much into the different species, with prey type on one side of the street and predator type on the other. Further divisions were also apparent as like types of both sides, big cats and wolves for example, formed groups within groups. Zee saw that unlike the humans he was used to the people walking the streets were interacting socially, even out in the open. Obviously he and Amadeus both would have to alter themselves slightly more in that respect and begin to socialize, or risk standing out more than they already would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Kell seemed to be intent on getting herself and her companion to her office as fast as possible, and her car was only a few meters...yards from where Zee had recently saved the young mouse child. Zee corrected his own thoughts to local measurement units, and would instruct Amadeus to do the same when they met later. Kell, for whatever reason, had parked in a nearby complex, possibly having intended on going to the caf\u00e9 for a snack before ever meeting with the CAP, or maybe for some other purpose which he couldn't even guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the land vehicle Zee observed that the transport smelled of various past passengers, some of which were obviously related to the family, though some were strangers whom he had not met. He recognized at least half a dozen species scents as he got into the car, and realized that he and Amadeus had gotten lucky on their landing sites. After seeing the division of individuals on the streets even in this small city, Zee was pretty sure that almost any other group would have rejected himself and Amadeus without a thought, probably eating Amadeus and smashing Zee himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting vehicle,\" commented Zee as he climbed into the front passenger position. Briefly he recalled that the seat was also known as shotgun because of the fact that during the eighteen-hundreds someone riding next to the driver of a stagecoach usually carried one of the weapons to discourage others from robbing the coach. He wondered for a moment if the people of this planet used the term, and if they had a similar historical reference, or if it was another case of cultural bleeding from other dimensions and peoples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. Though with Rudy getting his license soon I don't think it'll be running much longer,\" responded Kell as she climbed into the driver's seat. Zee, calling up images of the wolf child from the morning, did not know how to respond. It took a bit of deviling into his database to find that transports like the car had required a special permit in order to operate, because of the dangers that biologicals and mechanicals faced while traveling at the vehicle's normal speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not worry so much. The child appears to be able to handle himself quite nicely,\" said Zee, remembering that Rudy had been the first to recover from his performance earlier, and had asked for a encore. Obviously that was no indication of the boy's abilities, but anyone who liked Zee's music couldn't be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell him you said that,\" responded Mrs. Dewclaw as they pulled out of the parking complex into traffic. They spoke little as transport careened dangerously through the streets of the city, at speeds that Zee found quite fast for such a primitive vehicle. Fortunately their speed meant that they arrived at an office building before Zee could begin to evaluate the risks of collision at such speeds, and when he opened his door he vowed to himself that he would not allow Amadeus to operate one of the vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are Zee, my workplace,\" she said, waving her hand towards the large sign that read Herd Thinners. Zee didn't have to ask about what kind of business the corporation was engaged in, as the name gave him a pretty good idea, but he was interested how a woman like Kell could risk going out and killing the various prey species as so many of her relations and friends were among them. Zee kept his mouth shut on that particular peculiarity, deeming it unimportant to his relationship with the wolf woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a nice office, but be careful. We don't need anyone getting ideas about you nature,\" warned Kell as both she and Zee walked up to the doors that led into the structure. Inside the office was a buzz of morning activity. Various predators, both large and small, moved through the building, making reports or getting a list for the days scheduled kill quotas. Kell was greeted with enthusiasm by a few of the workers, though a few others, mostly felines, were giving her dark stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place seems rather, diverse,\" commented Zee as he and his protector moved through the floor towards an office along the back wall. The plaque on the door read...</span></div></div>",

Avoiding the stack of papers with a grace born of computerized sensors Zee followed her inside and gently closed the door. Kell, nodding at the door and testing it to see if it was locked, proceeded towards the desk in the back upon which were piled even more documents that obscured whoever it was who was typing on a keyboard. Moving around the mountain of paper that contained a large sum of binary code, Zee was face to face with the last thing he expected to see in a predator office building, a sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Corrie, how's your day been going?\" asked Kell nicely as she got closer to the sheep. Corrie, having been typing furiously on the keyboard, was startled by the \u2018sudden' arrival of Mrs. Dewclaw, but recovered quickly and leaped up from he seat to administer a hug, which looked very odd from the standpoint of Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Dewclaw, it's nice to see you, and as for your question, well I've been up since the earliest hours of the morning trying to repair some of the damage done to the Herd Thinners website. A lot of the stuff was stored locally and whatever caused the power surge that knocked out everything on the planet did a number on the files,\" complained Corrie as she looked around Kell to see an oddly familiar looking individual. She thought at first that it might be her father, Ralph Dewclaw, but closer inspection showed that he was someone else entirely, though he was obviously related in some way to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who's this here?\" asked the sheep, forgetting about her problems for the moment as she turned her attention completely to the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Zee, Corrie, and he's from...well far out of town. Listen I know Rudy told Bruno a bit about humans, but how much do you know?\" asked Kell, dropping her voice to a whisper after looking around nervously for a moment. Zee did not see the reason for the secrecy, as anyone interested would just bug the room, but decided it was some human trait, as Amadeus did the same thing in similar situations where someone might be listening, even though he knew whispering would do little good, and in fact pointed out to the listener the pieces of information that the whisperer did not wish shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that they were the stars of that strip Rudy did, and that they were real sometime in the distant past, but they're all gone now. Right?\" said Corrie, who had clearly heard the information second hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's close, but not really. They were the stars of Rudy's strip, but they didn't all die out. Kevin's sister, Danielle, used to be a human, and so did Lindesfare, at least according to what she believes. Anyway we got a shock last night when another human showed up last night, but he didn't look like one of us, instead he still looked like a human,\" explained Kell, and Corrie looked past her at Zee with a gauging eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a human?\" asked Corrie, and Zee was tempted to tell her yes, but realized that at the moment, muddying the waters with the classic debate of whether he was really a human or not would serve little purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am not. I am a companion to a human named Amadeus. He and I are probably the reason you are so backed up, as our arrival was more than likely the cause of the blackouts earlier,\" said Zee, looking over at the terminal that the sheep female had been working. The device, primitive by Zee's standards, was still quite a good personal computer, and he was quite impressed by the coding skills of the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So where is this human?\" asked Corrie, leaning out of the way as Zee studied her computer more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's staying with Lindesfare and Fenton at the moment, or so we think. I had thought that Zee would stay there as well, but he opted to explore on his own, and after he rescued a young mouse I discovered him on the streets,\" explained Kell to Corrie as both watched the digital lifeform approach Corrie's console. Realizing at the last minute that he should ask permission before messing with the system, he turned to face the women again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I interfaced with you computer for a moment?\" he asked the sheep female, and Corrie, after a moment's consideration, nodded her head, interested to see just what the creature would do. Zee, having gained permission to interface, turned back to the terminal and studied it, making sure that he knew all the right commands in the language of the system, as well as slowing his own processor so as not to overload the less sophisticated device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough with his inspection, which had, to the two watchers, appeared to be him just staring at the machine, Zee opened his mouth and a low pitched stream of tones came forth. Instantly the monitor, which had been displaying files that were scrambled, became a window of ever shifting colors and forms as Zee accessed every file within the computer's hard memory and then began to gain input from outside terminals that were networked to the one in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly he discovered that some of the terminals to which he had access from this single computer were half a world away. Having lived his life with Amadeus Zee had been exposed to the Internet when playing Games that were set in the era when Earth had been connected by it, but he had never had a first hand interaction before, and it threatened to overwhelm him for a moment before he allowed his processor to return to its full speed in order to interpret all the data, repair the files damaged everywhere on the planet due to his and Amadeus' arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he hacked into Heard Thinners main system and created a profile for Amadeus that listed him as an employee, as well as creating a pseudo file for himself which listed him as Zee Dewclaw, a distant relative who had been living on an isolated island with Amadeus for years. Done with his business Zee logged off the terminal, leaving a new code system that would allow the machine to run at almost twelve times its original operating speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it,\" he said as he backed away from the monitor. To Kell and Corrie he had spent only a moment interfacing with the computer, but as he allowed Corrie to sit back down she was startled to find that not only was her computer working faster than it ever had before, but the files which would have taken her a good nine months at least to restore were back to their original condition. Staring in disbelief at the monitor for a long moment the sheep finally turned to face Zee who was now studying a plant that Corrie had hung in her office as a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" she asked, not sure where to begin with her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply interfaced with the machine. Now both Amadeus and I have a background on this planet. With that we can at least make some attempt to create lives for ourselves,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I hope you do not mind but I listed myself as a distant cousin of yours who has been living in the Wild for a few years with Amadeus listed as a local Herd Thinners representative,\" he told Kell as he turned to face the wolf woman. In effect, with Corrie focused on studying all the alterations Zee had made to her system, they were the only people in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't see a big problem with it, but what did you list as kills for Amadeus, I mean humans, who have no natural weapons, wouldn't be able to take down that much with their bodies,\" said Kell, remembering that at Herd Thinners you were only really allowed to count a kill if you took it down with your own two hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I listed the kills he has done with his bare hands, though he might protest a few of them. I altered the specific kills to species on this planet that have nearly the same weights and natural defenses. His biggest kill on your records is a young bull elephant,\" said Zee, having substituted the elephant for a Qura Lummox, a seven legged creature with about the same weight and semi-sentient intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean Amadeus, the scrawny thing I saw this morning, took down and ate something the size of a bull elephant?\" said Kell in surprise, thinking that even with the moves he'd shown that morning it sounded impossible. Zee realized that he'd made an error too in his reporting of Amadeus' skill as Amadeus had killed the Lummox, but as far as Zee knew Amadeus had never actually eaten it, or anything else he'd personally killed in the real world. In the Games he'd killed an eaten many things, but in the real world he'd always had a near by ship to help feed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did not eat it, but he did kill it. I guess I will have to tell him that he needs to start doing that before we bring him to work here,\" commented Zee, wondering if he would need to accelerate Amadeus' metabolism in order to allow him to ingest the necessary amount of bio mass to work for Herd Thinners. Kell and Corrie meanwhile were exchanging glances. Corrie had seen pictures of when her step mom had been human, and of course the ones in Rudy's short lived comic. They hadn't exactly seemed very fierce, with no claws, talons, or horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea. This office is the center of Herd Thinners and even Kell and I have a hard time just surviving here sometimes. For someone without any natural defenses...\" Corrie let the thought trail off, allowing Zee to draw his own conclusions. Zee's conclusion though was that Amadeus, being a Gamer, would enjoy working in such a volatile environment, though he would have to learn some self-control to prevent him from killing everything that came close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Amadeus is able to take care of himself. If nothing else he will always carry his pistol, and nothing on this world can match that sidearm,\" said Zee, remembering the power that the Startec weapon had, and how it could probably destroy half the planet if used right. The two women did not seem very confident, but then they had not seen Amadeus in action. Once they did they would understand why Zee was more worried about him killing others, than others killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case, I do not think I should keep either of you from your duties,\" he commented, pointing at a nearby clock to show that they had been in the office for over an hour. Kell, who had lost track of time, became a bit frazzled when she saw the time, realizing that she should have already been out hunting. Corrie, who looked at the clock with the same amount of consternation, realized that Zee had already done her work for the next few months, all she had to do now was maintain the site, and easy enough job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kell may be busy, but I think I'm free for a while. Zee, would you like to come with me and I'll show you around, or would you rather go with Kell and watch how they hunt?\" asked Corrie, wondering just what Zee would choose. Though she hadn't been told the sheep guessed that Zee was some kind of electronic lifeform, thus did not need food, and would not need the skills to hunt. Zee considered the two women before him for a moment and at last chose to spend his day with...</span></div></div>",

Corrie on the other hand was just as happy to have some time to talk with the newcomer, knowing a slight bit about humans thanks to her connection with the Dewclaws, being Ralph's daughter, and thus Kell's niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since you've done my job for me on the computer, want to help me do the real world work too?\" asked Corrie, indicating the various papers that were strewn about her office, all of which were now quite useless since she had gotten them merely to compare the original base code of her system to what it had become since the blackout. Zee, always willing to be helpful, reached for a stack that was higher than his head and easily lifted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where do we go with this stuff?\" he asked her, not sure what a culture that lived in trees would do with waste paper. Corrie, picking up a much smaller stack of papers, motioned for the CAP to follow her and together they walked out into the main building. Zee was quite surprised with the speed that the building had emptied out, most of the staff being hunters, and thus now in the field doing their jobs. Alone except for a few administrative assistants who were standing around, either talking with each other or just doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this usual behavior for this office?\" asked Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but since the computers were down most of the office work couldn't be done. Now that you've fixed it I'm sure things will pick back up, but first we have to tell Angelique that their working, and I don't know about you, but I'd rather hold off on that for a bit,\" said Corrie, dreading talking to her boss, Kevin's ex-wife and a rabbit who was pretending to be a mouse. Zee, who knew nothing about this, decided not to argue and followed the sheep girl towards a vault like door in the back of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrie turned the handle to the door and Zee watched as it slowly slid aside revealing the things that lay beyond. Entering the room Zee could see nothing but file cabinets that stretched into the horizon. Turning on a light switch be the door, Corrie proceeded into the huge room, knowing by heart exactly where the papers came from. Zee, used to the human ways of destroying paper when it wasn't required, was startled to see that some of the records in the vault which must have dated back hundreds of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" was all he said as they wandered through the maze of cabinets. Being the center of a major company the office in which Kell worked kept hard copies of most of the files that passed through it, from the very beginning to the present day. Truly Zee would have liked to go over the various documents and such, but he decided it might be best not to, as some of the parchment on which the information was written would be quite fragile, and he would hate to damage it by breaking into the cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it, though I find it bothersome that I have to have to get the key to the cabinets from R.L. He's just so protective of these files,\" commented Corrie, confirming to Zee that the locks on the cabinets were kept locked, to protect the information contained within. At last reaching a set of cabinets marked with binary code Corrie withdrew a key chain from around her neck and used the very ancient looking key to open the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how about I place these in and you go get more. Hopefully this doesn't take too long,\" said Corrie, and zee placed his stack of papers down before marching back to the door to the vault, which stood open still. Unsure of if he should shut it Zee decided to leave it open, just in case. Walking back through the office proved just as easy as before thanks to the fact that most of the staff was still engaged in their own conversations, ignoring that newcomer who moved through their ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding Corrie's office again Zee grabbed another armload of papers and made his way through the office again. The vault still stood open and since he could see others were walking past it he decided that it was a good thing he hadn't shut the door. Making his way inside he followed the path through the cabinet maze just as he had before, again eyeing the older cabinets, wanting to crack them open and find out what secrets might be contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting that urge he found Corrie still filing away the papers they'd brought in their first load. Looking over at him with a somewhat exasperated expression she smiled as he delivered another stack of papers, thanking Zee for his assistance. Smiling Zee told her it was no problem and then went back for more. After nine trips the Corrie's office was finally clear of the clutter, though the sheep herself was not going to see it for some time as she carefully re-filed every sheet into it's proper slot. Zee, seeing the system which she was using leant a hand, and suddenly the piles of paper literally began to melt away as Zee and Corrie took sheet after sheet off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Corrie said triumphantly as she placed the last piece of paper into its proper folder. Slamming it shut with a resounding clang of metal meeting metal. Holding up her hand she gestured towards Zee as if she wanted something. Zee, who had observed human customs of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries with Amadeus in the games recognized the gesture as what humans called a \u2018high-five'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy a planet of humanoid animals would have such a gesture he didn't know, as most of their hands had some form of weapon on them, but he ignored that thought and smacked his own palm against Corrie's. Smiling at him again, not noticing the slight delay in his reaction, Corrie led the way out of the file vault. Reaching the door she motioned for Zee to exit ahead of her as she turned off the lights. Once outside again she pushed the heavy door shut, which closed with a very final sounding thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that that's done, what do you want to do?\" asked Corrie. Before Zee could answer a coughing sound came from behind him and Corrie's eyes got wide. Turning Zee found himself face to face with....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mrs. Angelique, how are you today?\" said Corrie in a sheepish voice. Zee realized only a second after he had the thought that the phrase was quite appropriate considering Corrie's appearance, though he still had to question her about her genetic coding, which he had found to be quite interesting. The mouse woman, who's own genetics spoke of rabbit rather than rat, was standing up straight and towering over the smaller sheep woman, thought Zee still looked down on her by over a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wondering why you're not at your desk fixing our computer problems rather than out here hanging out with this young man,\" said Angelique, eyeing the stranger with a gauging look, finding something vaguely familiar about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this anyway?\" she said, pointing a rolled up piece of paper she was carrying in her left hand at Zee. For his part Zee stood up to her inspecting gaze, not backing down an inch, though he had to admit that the woman carried a sense of power with her that seemed to intimidate the other workers, most of whom were trying their best to look busy, some logging into their computers and learning that the system was back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Zee. He's a distant relative who came in last night and stayed at Kell's during the blackout. He's been helping me with the computers and we've got them up and running again, as you can see,\" said Corrie, motioning towards the workers who were all beginning their own tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you said the system would be down for a month at least?\" responded Angelique suspiciously, wondering why the sheep would lie to her about it. Probably just trying to look better with the boss when she fixed it early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it would have, but Zee here is a wiz with computers. He was able to show me a trick that got them back up faster than I could believe,\" said Corrie, thinking only a moment later that maybe she'd said too much. If Zee had more skill than her then Angelique might just try and hire him to replace her. Zee however was not interested in any position at a company that dealt death out, though neither of the two women could know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're good with computers?\" asked Angelique seductively, already hoping that maybe the newcomer could replace the sheep, who had been a slight annoyance to the mouse woman for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite skilled, however I have taught cousin Corrie my trick, and so she should be just as skilled if this ever happens again,\" answered Zee, lying to the rat woman, knowing that the problem would more than likely never come up again, and even if it did he could just fix it again like he had the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I guess we'll have to test her skills,\" said Angelique, pulling a stack of papers out of the hands of a worker who had been standing behind her, unnoticed, during their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the latest updates to the site that R.L. wanted. I hope that you keep up the pace you seem to have gained, otherwise we may be looking for a new webmaster pretty soon,\" Angelique told Corrie, shoving the papers full of crude drawings and various advertisers logos into the hands of the sheep woman before walking off to cause a stir among the other workers. Sighing with relief Corrie led the way back to her office, and once both she and Zee were inside she promptly closed and locked her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was a bit tense,\" she said, smiling nervously at Zee, who had kept a stone face throughout the encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did notice a bit of tension in the air. Perhaps with time that woman will learn to relax a bit more,\" commented Zee, sitting down in the now cleaned off chair across from Corrie's desk. Corrie took her own seat and stared at her computer for a moment before looking back towards the CAP, having not really heard his comment at all while lost in her own reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Zee, thanks for telling that to Angelique,\" she told him, and Zee was a bit perplexed for a moment, and then remembered that he'd lied to the woman to avoid her offering him Corrie's job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it, Corrie. I merely told her that to avoid a very...problematic situation,\" responded Zee, taking a second to think of the right word to describe what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it saved my job for another day. Not that I really think she'd fire me on such short notice, but around her you can never be too careful,\" said Corrie, more to herself than to Zee. For a long time silence hung in the air as Corrie typed at her computer, inputting a few of the changes listed in the information Angelique had given her, and planning out where she would put the new groups of ads on the website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime moved slowly for Zee, who took the spare moments to begin to collect sensor data from everywhere he could. Gravimet sensors still did not recognize any of the local masses, though he was quite interested to discover that Alpha Proxima had drifted closer to Sol in the time that humans had been away, something others had theorized was happening, but never having the chance to prove it before Exodus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that little interesting stellar fact Zee found nothing that caught his eye among the local stars. Nearer to home he used various other sensors to position the various vital forms he had met during his short stay on the homeworld of his brother's people. Most were inside the home where he had first become active, probably running the local ISP which his online jaunt had informed him was called Hare-Link and was run out of that home, with their servers located inside Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention next to that dwelling he was pleased to find that Amadeus was still sleeping, though how long he would keep that up was anyone's guess, as Amadeus was a very light sleeper, and often went a week with only a dozen hours of slumber. On this new world though, Zee hoped that Amadeus would begin to sleep the eight hours that were recommended for humans. He knew it probably wouldn't work, but he still hoped for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving even closer he detected the female wolf named Kell out among various other vital forms. Presently she seemed to be following the path of one that was particularly large, probably stalking it. Looking at the clock Zee realized that almost three hours had now passed since she'd left, and if his readings were accurate she had yet to make a single kill. Amadeus would have easily taken something down by now, but then Amadeus would not spend time stalking anything, preferring instead to take his foes head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last his sensors came to rest on Corrie and her computer. As before he was startled to find her DNA was over sixty percent human, an oddity compared to most others he'd encountered who contained only nineteen percent on average, though the bunny named Coney from earlier had an even higher level of over eighty percent. Knowing that Corrie claimed Ralph Dewclaw, Kell's brother and a wolf himself, as her father, he believed it had something to do with her parents, though he would have to ask about the mother, whom he assumed was a sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it that people do for fun around here?\" asked Zee at last, trying to break the silence. Corrie started at his abrupt speech, looking over at the clock and being startled to find that she'd been typing for more than half the day trying to get the site up, ignoring her visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that Zee. I guess I got a little caught up in my work,\" she apologized as she pushed her chair back from her monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright. If you need to work then I will allow you to do so, but I do have questions about this place. After all Amadeus is going to be trying to work here tomorrow, and it would be good if I knew as much as I could about how things work here,\" he told her, looking towards the locked door with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well. I don't exactly know how things work out in the field, as I've never been out there, but here in the office we try to keep an atmosphere of peace and calm,\" she told him, her words becoming questionable when the sounds of a fight came from outside, with many barks and cat growls coming through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see that,\" said Zee sarcastically, knowing that he would have to tell Amadeus to be careful tomorrow. Zee did not want his brother to kill anyone on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Truly this place is just like any other office, though we try to bring a variety of hunters together, more to keep them fighting each other than anything else,\" commented the sheep, showing her own prejudices to the newcomer. Zee, who had gathered a large amount of data off the net was of the opinion that she was right, seeing as how more fights were happening between the staff at the offices of Herd Thinners then hunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see where that would be helpful,\" responded Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably can at that. I hope your brother is as good as you think he is, because if I remember humans right then he's not exactly going to be the most intimidating person to look at,\" said Corrie, remembering the pictures of humans, and their lack of any kind of weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry about that. Amadeus may not look it, but he is quite a skilled fighter. Believe me that he will fit right in here. After he busts a few skulls, anyway,\" said Zee, moving forward in his seat and placing his head on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I am quite intrigued that you work here. I assume you are part wolf as you claim Ralph as a father, but obviously your mother had to have been of different stock,\" Zee told Corrie, bringing the conversation around to the arc he desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother happened to be a sheep Zee, and yes Ralph is my father. They had a fast romance that ended when I was born,\" she told him, remembering her father and what he'd said about her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. So he left your mother after you were born,\" said Zee, remembering similar situations that had occurred in human history. Surprisingly Corrie bolted up from her chair and slammed her hoof into her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what happened!\" she said forcefully. More so than she'd really intended to. Calming down a bit she sat back down again and stared at Zee who was looking at her with renewed interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother, she died giving birth to me, and my father, well he didn't think I'd be safe with his family, so he left me. Eventually I met up with a nice wolf boy named Bruno, and we've been together ever since,\" she told him, and Zee recalled that Kell had said Bruno and Rudy were friends. Obviously the Dewclaw family had a web of connections in the local area, which meant he could hide among them that much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That would explain your DNA,\" said Zee, making one last scan to confirm his suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, \u2018my DNA'? How would you know what my DNA is like?\" asked Corrie, who, having been part of a cloning experiment knew that DNA took days to scan with even the most powerful computer, and even longer to even try and interpret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I scanned your genetic structure, and it contains a much higher concentration of human that any other besides Coney, the bunny child of you aunt. Most others contain trace amounts, but you and her are truly closer to humans than most of the Combine citizens,\" said Zee, knowing that in truth Coney was second only to Amadeus in terms of human DNA in her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the combine? Is that where you're from?\" asked Corrie, realizing for the first time that this newcomer had to have come from somewhere, and that she had not even thought about what his home was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that is not it. The Combine is not a space, it is a government. We are both...well we were both citizens of it,\" he told her, and from there launched into a history of the Combine. How the four Ark shuttles launched from Earth used Gravimet drive to cross the stars, coming out on entirely different ends of the universe. Eventually each colony met up again, though only after each had begun to evolve in different areas of technology and understanding, some even assimilating nonhuman sentients into their culture as they expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon regrouping the four colonies created a central government, that for various reasons, only human type minds could be a part of. He did not explain those reasons to her, instead providing various details about how the Combine was set up, with the Gamers being the military and the Triad Square, a group of nine individuals, ruling as political heads. He went on to describe the great cities they built across the heavens, and how they were masters of three whole galaxies, a feat that no other known government had equaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then of course there is-\" he began, but was cut off by a pounding at the door. Looking over at the clock Zee was startled to find that his story had taken up most of the day, it was now time to go, if they worked the nine to five that humans had normally worked back on Earth. Getting up Zee opened the door and into the office marched....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, how was your day together?\" Kell asked as she entered the office, finding it clear of the mounds of code papers that had been there earlier that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Kell, just fine. Zee helped me put the files back in place and then he and I traded a bit of information regarding our two worlds,\" said Corrie, slipping the sheets that Angelique had given her into a desk drawer for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So what did you tell him about us Corrie?\" asked Kell, wondering what exactly the sheep had told the CAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too incriminating, Kell. Just a few tidbits here and there. Corrie was just being a proper cousin and helping an out of town relative know where he stands in the big picture,\" said Zee, motioning lightly at the open door, and hoping that the two women remembered that he was supposed to be a cousin of their's who had been living far away until now. Corrie, having spent the day with Zee, remembered the cover story first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. After all Zee has been living on that island all alone with his friend for a while. What kind of family would I be if I didn't try and bring him up to date on matters in that regard,\" said Corrie. Kell took a moment to process what she was hearing, and then started as she too remembered the story Zee had seemed to whip up out of thin air earlier that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess we can allow that. By the way, Corrie, Bruno is over at my house now, as is your friend Zee, so we'll go there rather than by Tree. I hope that's okay?\" she asked, and Zee wished that he had a human face with eyebrows so he could furrow them in anger. Amadeus up and about was one thing, but he must have traveled between Tree and the Dewclaw home on foot. Now that he had a backstory it was alright, but Amadeus didn't know he had one yet, so he had gone out, and likely gotten himself seen by dozens of sentients without any regard to what it would do to the local culture. Typical for him really, and something Zee had expected, but he really had hoped that his brother would try to learn at least a little discretion since they were both stuck on this world, probably for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fine with me. I just wish Amadeus would tell me before he goes out like that. His appearance is not exactly normal,\" commented Zee as he got up from his seat. Kell nodded in response and was about to leave when she remembered Corrie who was still shuffling a few loose papers about on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be coming by later too right?\" she asked the sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. If Bruno is over at your house I wouldn't miss it. I don't think we've had a big gathering like this since Lindesfare graduated. And besides I want to meet this Amadeus. He sounds fascinating,\" responded Corrie. Smiling and waving goodbye Kell led the way through the office, which was once again abuzz with activity, most of it kind of bloody as hunters brought in proof of their kills that ranged from a deer's horn to the served head of a squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus is going to love it here,\" commented Zee. The blood and violence would appeal to his nature as a Gamer, though Zee would have to increase his metabolic rate in order to allow him to ingest his kills. While Kell and her kind were designed to eat a whole deer in a single sitting Amadeus rarely ate more than a ration bar unless he had to. Luckily for the duo the staff was focused on the day's work, and so they got outside without any trouble. Walking up to the car which had brought them there Zee wondered if he could get Kell to give Amadeus a ride into work from now on, as he was still of the opinion that Amadeus did not need to be behind the wheel of such a vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize in advance for anything Amadeus has done to your home and culture. He really needs to learn to control himself more,\" said Zee as Kell started the car and pulled out of the parking lot into the fast moving traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to do that. According to Kevin Amadeus has been getting along quite well with everyone. He even helped a little with a snag in Hare-Link's hardware, patching a cable with that weird gun of his. He then proceeded to beat Fiona and Rudy at video games, which surprised them both,\" commented Kell with a laugh, remembering how shocked Kevin had seemed at that statement. He had been watching Fiona beat Rudy for years, but Amadeus had apparently trounced them both quite throughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Amadeus has a lot of skill at games, both those of the Terminals and the more archaic ones played on disks and cartridges, though I do not believe he has ever had an opponent in the latter as most people prefer the Terminals,\" said Zee, remembering how Jasmine had played with Amadeus for hours in the Terminal, simulating something called a Nintendo and using a controller interface to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he has opponents now, and he beat them badly. I think it is good for them though, as Fiona sometimes needs to learn that there is always someone better than you. Something she proves to Rudy every time they play against each other,\" responded Kell as they made their way through the traffic. From there the conversation stalled as Kell had to focus on the world around her, dodging in and out of lines of cars that seemed to be ripping down the streets and excessive speeds. Zee defiantly would make sure Amadeus was not allowed to pilot one of these vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after many hair raising turns they arrived back at the large tree house in which Zee had first become active, and it looked just the same to the CAP as it had the night before, if a little brighter and with more people. Now there seemed to be quite a few vital forms already inside, though his sensors confirmed that only one was really new to him, and it was more than likely Bruno, the wolf boy that Corrie had talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car Zee followed Kell up the drive and went to the door, expecting to find Amadeus leaping about showing off his combat skills he was surprised to find that everything was quiet, and that nothing in the immediate area seemed to have been broken or battered in the last few hours. Opening the door Zee found that everyone was gathered around Amadeus who was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking over Kell's shoulder Zee found Amadeus sitting in the middle of a large group of people he recognized from earlier, though many were sitting in different positions. The only unknown was a wolf boy several times Rudy's size sitting next to him and Fiona. Already having surmised that the newcomer had to be Bruno, Corrie's boyfriend if he guessed correctly about her relationship with him, Zee looked next to his brother, who was squeezing the end of a femur in a firm, yet gentle grip, pressing it into an already impressive model that sat in the center of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here?\" asked Kell, causing all eyes to turn towards the two newcomers. Obviously these people were impressed by Amadeus' marrowmelding technique as they had not even heard the door open to admit the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just demonstrating a bit of art. Coney generously agreed to give me a few bones from her stash so I could preform some marrowmelding,\" explained Amadeus as he released his grip on the femur to reveal that it had bonded to the rest of the sculpture, becoming part of a large cube shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marrowmelding?\" asked Kell as she took a seat, looking in fascination at the complex shape Amadeus had already constructed from the various bones that Coney, her carnivorous bunny of a daughter, had given him from her growing collection. Most of them were small, forming intricate shapes within the overall image, while larger femurs created the cube's less detailed outer shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marrowmelding is an ancient art, created a long time ago by the Recom, who honored their dead by creating grand works of art from their bones,\" explained Amadeus, picking up another bone and placing it next to the large femur, and the squeezing it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is Rekos. The Recom were their cousins, and they typically ate their dead,\" corrected Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well Bit-Brain, how about you give the history lesson while I finish this up,\" said Amadeus, who had tried to explain the art without success earlier to his audience, and then had decided to simply demonstrate. Zee, knowing his brother's lack of storytelling ability, decided to start at the beginning just to correct whatever other mistakes Amadeus may have made explaining the art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. Marrowmelding is a very old art, and is supposed to be done shortly after an individual has died, when the bone is still soft. The Rekos believed that by doing this, the spirit of a fallen mate or loved one would be preserved forever as a piece of art,\" began Zee, watching as Amadeus put just a bit to much pressure on the tiny bone he was working on, causing it to shatter in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, even when new the bones are strong, and thus break if you apply too much force to them. Rather you have to allow the bones their own shape, and give them only the force needed to assume the form that lies within them,\" he continued, watching in amusement as Amadeus reached for a bone of similar shape and size to the one he'd broken, yet placing it on an entirely different place in the cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the Rekos there s no higher honor than to have their bones preserved in this way, though many cultures that meet them consider the art form somewhat morbid, due to the unease associated with life termination,\" he told the group, who listened and watched with great fascination as Amadeus pulled away his hands, revealing that the small bone now connected the larger cube to one that was contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, when done properly marrowmelding lives up to the name it was given, literally fusing the marrow of two bones together. This is done by applying an exact amount of force, as too much breaks them, but too little will leave them with an unfused form. It makes the art a difficult thing to master. Many spend lifetimes studying it. Amadeus spent over forty years learning the art himself, from Jygo-ris, a woman considered to be the greatest of the greats,\" Zee informed his audience, but the information seemed to startle the artist most of all as Amadeus dropped the bone he had been about to place in the sculpture and look over at his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean forty years? I'm not that old,\" complained Amadeus as he picked back up the bone, placing it atop the inner cube, connecting it to the outer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to these people. We have to start thinking in new terms Amadeus. Shift from Trade Standard measurements of time and space to their's. That means meters to feet. Cycles to hours, and our years are about twenty one of their's, making you just a little over four-hundred-twenty-six,\" Zee told Amadeus, which caused him to shrug a bit in recognition of the change. The other's took the news of Amadeus' age a bit more harshly, most of them looking to Danielle who was the resident expert on humans, but she seemed just as shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your over four hundred years old?\" asked Danielle at last, having taken a moment to process the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to Zee, who I trust in matters like this,\" responded Amadeus, not the least bit concerned that his age seemed to be causing a bit of a stir among his audience. Danielle was again the first to recover, having assumed that Amadeus was older than he appeared anyway, as she knew humans had been trying to expand their lifetimes, and Amadeus' humans had, had a few thousand years to make them even longer than the hundred years that was the limit on her world when she'd left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good for someone that age,\" she commented, not sure what else to say. Most of the others, who were used to much shorter life spans, were still having trouble believing that the creature before them could survive that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I do try and take care of myself,\" said Amadeus as he added yet another bone to the sculpture. Unseen by anyone save Amadeus Coney had crawled her way over to him and proceeded to rummage through he pile of bones at his left. She seemed to pick one at random, holding it out to Amadeus, who looked at it and nodded, taking it and placing it among the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got quite an eye for art, Coney. Maybe you would like to learn this,\" said Amadeus as he pressed the bone into the piece, and then without an warning backed off, allowing Coney to pick up one of the bones and crawl over to the cube. Delicately she placed the bone at the bottom edge, and was about to press it in when suddenly another place caught her eye, and she shifted her place, putting the bone at an angle to where she'd been about to place. Amadeus, who was sitting back in a lotus position looked at her placement and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good eyes,\" he commented softly, leaning forward and placing his hand over her's, helping her to place the bone into the art. Together they both stood and he walked around the cube within a cube, while Coney hopped at his feet, before returning to Kevin's lap. Everyone, still reeling a bit from the revelation of Amadeus' age was now staring at the art, and slowly they nodded in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" commented Fiona at last, reaching out to touch it lightly, as if to make sure it wasn't some smoke vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite interesting. A real tesseract made of bones. Some would say that you just combined high art and high science. Blasphemous really,\" commented Zee as he walked around the cube-within-a-cube shape that Amadeus and Coney had just completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only to those who worship one or the other. Personally I think they go quite will together if you give them a chance,\" responded Amadeus as he joined Zee staring at his sculpture from a distance. The others, who were still marveling at the shape were just beginning to notice that no matter where they moved their heads the cube inside the larger one seemed to remain stationary, as if it moved with them. Lindesfare, a student of science, would have recognized the term tesseract from her classes, but the others, who were not nearly as well versed in such things, were left to wonder what it was specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a tesseract?\" asked Fiona at last, as she stared into the almost infinite depth of the two cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tesseract is to a cube, what a cube is to a square. It is a four dimensional shape that is expressed within a three dimensional universe by placing a cube within a cube,\" explained Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I should go wash off my hands before I do anything else, as I seem to have gotten marrow all over them. If you will excuse me,\" said Amadeus, moving around the crowd, most of which ignored him as they stared into the sculpture, just as he'd intended. Zee looked after him with some concern before following Amadeus to a rear portion of the house where the bathroom was located. He found Amadeus already soaking his hands, and as he stepped through the door he heard Amadeus' hand go to his belt and begin to rummage for something. A moment later he pulled out...</span></div></div>",

Before the ball had appeared to be smooth an chrome like the rest of the weapon, but now it glowed with an inner light that seemed to be rippling, as if trying to break out of the prison of tech in which it was contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have already started it,\" commented Zee in the Combine Trade language, looking over his shoulder to make sure none of their hosts had gotten suspicious and followed the pair. Amadeus remained silent as he gazed back down the hall as well, and then slowly shut the door and locked in so that the two were in the bathroom alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I told you I would. Now, how did your exploration go?\" asked Amadeus, using that same language, which sounded much like musical tones, and would have been incomprehensible to the people of the planet, who had never heard the language before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I discovered much about this world, and its people. As you surmised they have an Internet much like that of old Earth, or the one which connects the various Archives of the Combine,\" responded Zee, looking at the weapon in Amadeus' hand with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You accessed it then?\" inquired Amadeus, who stared at the weapon with a look of concern himself, but he seemed to be less nervous about it than Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I can confirm the story now. The avian lifeforms accessed the Vault shortly after humans left the planet. Inside they found those technologies that were deemed to unstable to carry with the Arks across space. Of course the avians had no real understanding of what they'd discovered, mistaking many of the items for other things,\" said Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like thinking the Tempus was a time-machine rather than a quantum-waveform manipulator,\" said Amadeus as he nodded his head, understanding how such errors would have occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As far as they know they found a bunch of junk humans left behind because they couldn't take it with them. They never had any inkling of the real reason such things were left behind,\" explained Zee, still eyeing the weapon. For a moment it seemed he might try to rip it out of Amadeus' hand, but Amadeus gripped the weapon to tightly to allow the CAP any hope of getting it away from him in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they don't know what they found?\" asked Amadeus, tapping the point f his gun on the counter at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  Now turn it off Amadeus,\" said Zee in a pleading tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't do that Zee. So don't ask,\" responded Amadeus, pulling the gun closer to himself in a protective manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can. You always tell me you have a choice. You choose what you do. Well you are making a wrong choice here!\" said Zee, in a shouted whisper so that it would not alert anyone else to the drama unfolding inside a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders are orders Zee. This isn't about emotions. I don't want to do this, but unless you can give me a reason not to, then it has to be done,\" said Amadeus in a flat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just following orders has not been a viable excuse for millennia. And if you want a reason then look around. Do these people look like they have access to things that can destroy the universe?\" said Zee again using a vehement whisper, this time gesturing towards the door and their hosts beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may not, but that doesn't mean others don't. Zee, if you me to turn this off, you have to give me a reason that I can use, not just some emotional heart tugs,\" responded Amadeus, watching as the small sun in the ball at the back of his gun began to shift colors from a bright red to a neon orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are asking me to prove a negative Amadeus, and I can not do that! No one can. I already told you I do not detect anything from the Vault active on this planet,\" said Zee, staring at the gun's sounding chamber with a look of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to prove it Zee. You just have to tell me that you're slagging sure that there is no danger from it. Now did the story check out, did the birds send everything into the future?\" demanded Amadeus, raising his own voice as he watched the neon orange color shift to bright yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they did not. They think they did because they think the Tempus is a time machine. What they did has eliminated the Vault techs. I have their list, and it has an entry for everything they found. The names are different, but I believe with all my logic string that it is everything we left behind,\" responded the CAP, beginning to sweat as the gun changed again, this time to a burning white. Only moments remained now before it went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think that the Vault techs are gone. That is your assessment?\" asked Amadeus, much more calmly than Zee felt the situation warranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Now please turn it off Amadeus!\" said Zee, shouting now as the white began to become black, the heat of the weapon consuming even light now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not lying to save them are you Zee? I know how you feel about this. I know what you would do to protect this place, but as a citizen of the Combine it is your duty to give me accurate information. An Admiral needs to trust his people, and right now I need to trust you. Zee are you worthy of my trust?\" asked Amadeus, staring into the ever deepening void of his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I am not lying. Now please Amadeus, shut it off!\" commanded Zee as the weapon began to emit a high pitched whine. Amadeus had a choice now. He could believe Zee was telling the truth, and that he didn't have to do what he was planning on doing, or he could let the gun finish its work, and make sure that this was ended now. Does he believe Zee?</span></div></div>",

Zee, having almost given in to his impulse to attack Amadeus and take the weapon by force, sighed heavily and slammed into one of the walls, sliding into a siting position and wiping his brow, clearing off a few trickles of sweat. Amadeus, noticing the sweat for the first time noted that Zee shouldn't have had any sweat glands in his current form. Obviously the whole incident had truly gotten to Zee, and Amadeus put his arm around the CAP as he sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, Zee. For what it's worth. I believe you,\" he told his brother, who looked at him with a relieved expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad for that Amadeus. I really am. I still cannot believe what you just tried to do though,\" commented the CAP as he stared into the human's eyes. Amadeus, having taken hours to do what he'd just done, nodded. He couldn't believe it either, but he was a member of the Combine military, and his orders regarding Earth, and the Vault techs, were quite clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then think of it as a dream Zee. That always makes things like that easier,\" said Amadeus, remembering past instances that he wished had really been just dreams, though he knew they were real as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAPs don't dream, brother. One of the few things you can do that I cannot, but I will try to understand your actions as best I can. I think we should get back to the others now. Your sculpture may be good, but it will not keep them distracted much longer,\" observed Zee, getting up and walking towards the door. Outside he could hear a few murmurs already coming down the hall. The gathered vital forms had just noticed that the two visitors were no longer among them. Trying his best to put on a smile Amadeus followed Zee in going out the door, and once more into the home which he'd just nearly vaporized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Zee. You know why I did it, and you know that it is necessary,\" said Amadeus in the Trade Language again, making sure that Zee would not be able to respond in kind as they entered the living room where eyes were now turned towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you two get off to?\" asked Kevin as the two resumed their positions beside the marrowmeld tesseract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a discussion about what Zee learned on his day. Some very interesting stuff,\" said Amadeus, telling a half truth, which was a still a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say so. After he hacked the Internet wide open and did work that would have taken Corrie months,\" responded Kell. Trying to act like he already knew about that Amadeus chuckled slightly and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he said something about that, though truth to tell I was more interested in the social commentary, as I will have to at least try and blend in tomorrow,\" said Amadeus, who had been discussing plans with the Dewclaw's earlier about going into town and looking for a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, blending in isn't going to be easy for you. Herd Thinners isn't exactly a kind place to work, even for people like myself, and for someone without any natural weapons or defenses it will be even harder I imagine,\" commented Kell, getting a few sidelong glances from everyone around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Danielle before anyone else could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee said he hacked our records and gave Amadeus an employee file. According to him he created a past that says he is a distant cousin of ours, and that he and Amadeus have been living on an island far away,\" said Kell. Because of certain cultural differences only Danielle seemed to find the past odd, though she did not comment on it, feeling that she could discuss it with Amadeus alone later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the basics of what my alterations state,\" confirmed Zee as the others looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we really are here to stay then, huh Zee?\" said Amadeus in a depressed tone, as if him being employed made their situation any different from where it had been when he'd let Zee wander while he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Amadeus. We really are in an E.T.E. now. So you better start getting used to it,\" responded Zee, his tone only slightly less dreary than that of Amadeus. The others, even these that really had only a base understanding of what was going on, found their moods dipping to new lows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's an E.T.E.?\" asked Rudy, not seeming to feel the darkness that hung in the air, and getting a shoulder in his gut from Fiona who looked at him with venom in her eyes. Amadeus looked down at his feet for a moment before looking over at Zee, motioning with his hand that he should explain. Zee didn't look to eager to do so, but sighing he turned so that everyone could see his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An E.T.E. is a three letter acronym for Extra-Terrestrial Event. The Combine, our government, is quite old, and large, so times when citizens find themselves stuck on a populated world with no way to return home have happened in the past. Because of this there are certain rules that have grown out of previous experiences,\" explained Zee, putting his hands out before him and projecting shafts of light above his head. Forming out of the shafts was a screen that displayed Trade Standard Language text before shifting to English when his translator kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, any citizens who find themselves in such a situation are required to blend in with the local population as much as possible, to avoid affecting the culture of the natives through religious misconceptions,\" read Zee aloud as the text moved across his projected screen. Amadeus beside him let out a chuckle and lightly tapped him on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that one never seems to work out. Remember Qourk Thela where they thought you were a \u2018Spirit Beast' and I was a \u2018Child of Heaven'?\" asked Amadeus, and Zee looked at him like a father scolding a misbehaving child. Coughing embarrassedly Amadeus stepped back and allowed Zee to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, any citizen in such a situation is to limit themselves to technology that the culture is able to develop itself, except when circumstances of personal safety become an issue,\" read Zee. Again Amadeus stepped forward, but this time instead of trying to talk to Zee he faced the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What that means is we aren't allowed to build anything that you can't yourselves, unless for some reason this whole planet is threatened by something, and then we are allowed to do whatever we deem necessary to prevent it,\" explained Amadeus, looking over at Zee to see if he said it right. Zee nodded at him, and so Amadeus smiled in triumph as he stepped back behind the CAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, Three, any citizen involved in an E.T.E. is to use their own judgement regarding dissemination of information regarding their origins, but is advised to keep any knowledgeable individuals informed of their circumstances only as long as assimilation requires,\" stated Zee, closing both his hands and causing the light shafts to shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means that Amadeus and I are allowed to tell whoever we want about what we are, but we are supposed to get as far away as possible from anyone we tell, to avoid violating rule one,\" explained Zee, smiling as he stepped back beside Amadeus who had been about to step forward and explain it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which we won't do, mostly because we didn't really have to tell anyone anything. You guys already knew about humans, and besides, this is Earth. The homeworld. I think this qualifies as a unique situation,\" said Amadeus, both to the group, and to Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All E.T.E.s are unique. Though I will admit that this one is highly unusual,\" responded Zee, talking to Amadeus and not the group. Everyone else seemed to be a bit stunned by the new information, and the fact that their new guests actually had rules of conduct that basically told them to try and be like everyone else. Looking over at the two everyone was of the opinion that Zee could fit in fine, but Amadeus would be hard to hide, even if his personality weren't so outgoing. At that instant the front door burst open and into the Dewclaw home came...</span></div></div>",

Rudy, still sitting next to Fiona, rolled his eyes and sighed, but straightened up when his own girlfriend looked ready to elbow him in the gut again. Corrie pushed Bruno off her, giving the wolf boy a quick kiss as she did so and soliciting a rude noise from Rudy, who, as promised, got an elbow jammed in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Corrie, so how was your day with Zee?\" asked Fiona, trying to cover up for Rudy's actions. Corrie was silent for several seconds as she looked around the room, finding it to be full of her family and relations, including her latest \u2018cousin' Zee, who sat on the floor by a very interesting looking sculpture made of what she thought were bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were drawn, however, to the individual sitting next to Zee. See recognized almost instantly that he was human, both from Rudy's old comic, and pictures of her step-mom after she had become human thanks to a kind of doorway that went to a world full of them. His form was very similar to those around, if a little less furry, but his eyes were much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the eyes of the others all held a kind of primal feel to them, his were focused, and alert, seeing the world in a way the others couldn't. Corrie remembered that she herself had found only four other sets of eyes like that, three of them in the room now. One was Danielle, a former human and Lindesfare, who was also a former human according to what Rudy had told Bruno. The others two sets belonged to people of her world, but ones Zee had said were more human than most, and they were her's and Coney's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings and salutations, Corrie. I apologize for anything Zee might have done to make your work harder. I know he can be a bit of a handful,\" said Amadeus, holding his hands before him so that they folded into an S-shape from her perspective, and then bowing deeply to her. Rising he smiled at her and winked before resuming his seat. Not sure how to take the gesture Corrie stood silent for a few moments, looking around again to try and find some answers before deciding that she was better off just making her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do that. Zee didn't make my work any harder. In fact thanks to him it was several hundred times faster than it would have been. He fixed the entire network at Herd Thinners in minutes,\" proclaimed Corrie, and Kevin, Ralph, and the others who had been working at Hare-Link stared at the CAP in amazement. They had been dealing earlier that day with their own scrambled files, which had been miraculously fixed by some outside force, which they could now put a name and face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't just do their files, did you?\" asked Kevin, wanting to confirm his suspicions before he went any farther. Zee looked at the rabbit man for a moment, before simply nodding. Amadeus seemed much more enthusiastic about the information, slapping his hand on Zee's back, pushing him forward slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you Kevin. Zee excels at programing. He could help your ISP go a thousand times faster,\" inserted Amadeus, smiling at Zee, who didn't look that thrilled to learn that his companion had been bragging about his skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do that, yes, but I have to ask why you informed them of my capability,\" said Zee, staring at Amadeus, his expression stony and unreadable to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reason you created files in this Herd Thinners place for me, a job. Right now we need employment in order to acquire material necessities, including room and board,\" responded Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need room and board. I require no such thing,\" commented Zee, creating an icy chill in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not entirely true Zee, and you know it. Listen, as it is, Tree is free right now. Lindesfare and Fenton with both return to their university soon, and so they have a spare home, which I had hoped to borrow while we get some feet under us. Once we're up and standing we can start walking on our own two legs, but until then...\" said Amadeus. He had discussed his plans with both Tree and the Dewclaw family, and most agreed that it was a good idea, though they would have to ask Fenton when he awoke later, s legally Tree was his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of Fenton, Amadeus remembered that he had been sleeping in their home, and had not bothered to awaken them when he'd left, which might cause some concern when they awoke and found him gone. Looking out at the sunset through a nearby window he knew they would be up and about soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On that note, I think I should get back to Tree. I don't want either Lindesfare or Fenton to wake up and find their house guest mysteriously vanished,\" he told the group, most whom were looking out the window and found the late hour surprising, especially considering they had gotten little sleep the night before thanks to the blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not be a good idea Amadeus. I still want to try and avoid you influencing the local culture until tomorrow, or rather until I can give you a crash course on local customs. Perhaps it would be best if one of the others goes and grabs the two,\" suggested Zee, motioning towards the assembled group. Amadeus, not one to hide, had many objections ready for such an argument, but he wondered if maybe Zee was right and that he should remain hidden until the CAP could give him advice on the local culture. Staring out into the sunset he said at last...</span></div></div>",

I would think you would stand out here like a sore thumb,\" responded Zee, truly wondering how Amadeus managed to make his way from Tree to the Dewclaw home without causing a major stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I studied,\" stated Amadeus, not elaborating further to his companion, or the assembled group. Kevin had been the first to find the human in the home, having not even heard him open the door and come in, so no one really knew how Amadeus had made his way from Tree to his current residence. Instead of speaking on the matter Amadeus instead got up and walked to the door, where he picked up the cloak and helm he'd been wearing when he'd come to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this time I think my old costume would be better. It comes off a lot easier than mud,\" said Amadeus, looking at Zee and tapping his nose. Zee, who had not considered Amadeus to have been paying that much attention to his surroundings. Considering what he'd nearly done not paying attention would probably have been a good idea for him, as it would have made the action easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" said Zee, and many of the others were dumbfounded by the information that seemed to pass between the two, without any word or signal. As always they turned to their resident expert on humans, Danielle, but she was just as confused as they were by whatever it was that had just been understood by Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you get, may I ask?\" she queried at last, looking at Zee with a probing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus used an old hunter's trick. He covered his body in mud to mask his natural scent and then kept out of sight coming over here. Since most...well most animals tend to rely on smell rather than sight they never caught him. Ingenious really, and something I should have thought of myself,\" said Zee, admonishing himself for his lack of ingenuity, and at the same time he tried to think of ways to say what he thought without causing a stir among his hosts, most of whom did not catch the somewhat derogatory comment that had been aimed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but mud is a bit of a mess, both getting on and getting off, so my Norse warrior costume should work just as well. It is Fenrir's hair after all, and it still has his scent on it,\" explained Amadeus, who could detect the odor of the Great Wolf in the fur, even with his inferior human nose. To the others the scent had to be even more pungent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Fenrir?\" asked George, who remembered Danielle mentioning that name once in connection with Kell. She had asked him if Kell were a descendent of him as a joke, though when her fox of a husband had stared at her blankly she had shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fenrir is a god on my world. He is a huge wolf, with fangs like swords, and claws that can rend mountains. I assume that that is the Fenrir your talking about,\" inserted Danielle, wanting to try and establish her own knowledge about humans, and to confirm that Amadeus' people really did have the same base as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of. Fenrir is the son of Loki, but not really a god per say. His brother, the Midgard Serpent, was much more powerful in terms of the miracles and stuff, but yeah, Fenrir is a huge wolf thing. I killed it the Game I was playing and came away with a new fur coat,\" said Amadeus without thinking, not even caring if his talking of killing a wolf would upset his audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZee however did care, but was relieved to see that none of the lupines in the group so much as raised an eyebrow in anger, though since they didn't have eyebrows that would have been hard in and of itself. Instead they seemed to be caught on the fact that Amadeus claimed to have slain a wolf, and then skinned the beast. Zee watching Amadeus proudly don his cloak and clip the helm to it decided that maybe he needed to be knocked down a peg and decided to prove Amadeus' words, while at the same time hitting him in the pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I remember it Amadeus, you got a much larger fur coat during that experience, but decided it did not fit quite right,\" interjected Zee, holding out his hands again and projecting yet another image into the air over his head. This image quickly resolved into two distinct forms. One looked to be about the size of Coney, but looking even more like a predator than she did, with a true wolf appearance to it walking on all fours and growling at a little ant that was shouting at it from the base of one of its paws. The ant shouted up at the gigantic beast, and it was clearly trying to threaten it, even though it didn't even come up over the wolf's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrender now and I'll go easy on you!\" shouted the ant-like figure at the titanic monster. Slowly the scene began to zoom in on the figure and so Amadeus standing hip deep in snow staring up at Fenrir and brandishing his axe like it could hurt the thing. The wolf, unable to see anyone around looked in every direction for a moment before turning down to face the tiny bug at its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH AND JUST WHAT WILL YOU DO IF I DON'T?\" said the voice of the wolf, booming compared to that of Amadeus. Not backing down even against a beast like Fenrir Amadeus cried his fury and struck at the monstrous paw before him, which seemed to amuse Loki's son as he laughed at the puny human, flicking it away with a light gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWAY WITH YOU MORTAL. MANY MATTERS ARE AFOOT THAT YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO GRASP,\" proclaimed the wolf, baring his mighty fangs at the intruder who had dared violate his land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will you do if I don't?\" said Amadeus, repeating the tone of Fenrir perfectly. For some reason his mimicking made the wolf's hackles raise in vehement anger, and it brought it's maw closer to the pathetic mortal who had dared repeat his own words back to him. The group watched in fascination and horror as the wolf stuck out its tongue and literally lapped Amadeus up, swallowing him whole like the bug he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't very bright. Your brother is really trying to get himself killed,\" said a new voice, this one female. The view shifted and now focused on someone right next to the recorder, a young woman with fiery red hair and green eyes who was wearing only a few scrapes of clothing despite the fact that she was laying in snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be concerned, Amadeus Ex Machina is the hero of the Battles of Dreka and Golodrom Core. He has a plan, that I'm sure of,\" said a voice that was obviously that of the recorder, and equally obviously Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" said the woman quietly, looking back over towards the wolf, who as the view shifted back over it, was again standing still as a statue in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the game rules Fenrir is supposed to stand there and guard the pass to a mountain. Unfortunately our party at the time had no weapon capable of piercing its skin. Quite a conundrum really, but Amadeus bulled his way through as usual, and came up with this idea without consulting any of us. Watch,\" said the real Zee, zooming in on a piece of the wolf's underbelly. The image stayed focused on that area even as the wolf began wobble, and slowly tip over, dead before it even hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone, including a very mad looking Amadeus watched that section of the wolf's belly began to bulge slightly, and then it burst open, letting spill gallons of blood, as well as a very dirty looking Amadeus. The figure sputtered and coughed as it emerged from the inside of the gigantic beast, tripping over a bit of flesh that got caught on his boots. Ripping it off with all his strength Amadeus pulled not only his boot free, but a large section of fur as well, which had the same pattern as the cloak he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that lady and various others, is why Amadeus is not allowed to work on his own anymore,\" said Zee in the recording, and the image bobbed up and down as he and the woman both ran up to grab his brother who was covered in various internal gunk from the wolf. Still coughing he looked up at Zee specifically and wagged his finger at the CAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me a bowl of Spice Soup later. I told you we didn't need to go after that damned magic sword to kill this thing,\" said Amadeus weakly, before his face fell into the snow with a crunch. The image faded quickly after that and the others looked at each other for a moment, their eyes shifting from one member of their group to another before every eye, including Zee's was focused on Amadeus who was wrapped up in his cloak and helm, which hid most of his body as well as his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you never did pay up for that Zee,\" commented Amadeus at last, seeming to be unaffected by the memory he had just seen. Zee, for his part, did not laugh or even crack a smile, but everyone could feel a sense of amusement radiating from the CAP as he stared at Amadeus across the room. Before anyone could quite recover from the new information though Amadeus trotted over to the door and looked back at Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming, or are you going to stay here and tell more embarrassing stories about me?\" asked the human, and Zee smiled this time, unable to hide his own childlike delight at tormenting Amadeus. Not needing any more answer Amadeus stepped out the door and began his trek towards Tree. So do we go with Amadeus, or stay with Zee and the extended Dewclaw family?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking with an air of agitation Amadeus made his way through the woods and roads that led to Tree, the same woods and roads he'd traveled three times now. Once running away from the Dewclaws in the dark morning, and the next going back to their home with them as his allies, if not friends, and then finally a few hours ago when he'd awoken and decided to explore on his own and not awaken the pair who were sleeping in Fenton's room, the bat himself hanging on a pole, and Lindesfare sleeping in a bed below that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose three times though he had been more focused on getting away, on the people accompanying him, and then on not getting seen respectively. Now though his attention could be dedicated at least partially to the world around him, and he had to admit that his ancestors had been right. This world was beautiful, more so than any other he remembered. He'd seen so much of the universe, and even explored the other infinite realms beyond that, but never before had he seen such majesty as the towering oaks, and azure skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery other place had felt isolated and alien to him, but here, for some reason that he couldn't fathom, he felt he belonged. An odd sensation considering just a few days ago he hadn't believed this planet existed, that it was a fabrication made to bind the Combine together. Odder still when he thought of the fact that through his actions this world had almost been lost again but minutes earlier. As he'd told Zee then, it had been his duty, and he would have fulfilled it without hesitation then, but now, standing among the grass and tress of what he knew to be his people's old home, he didn't thin he could ever bring himself to follow that order, or any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he'd have to. Despite what Zee thought Amadeus understood his situation perfectly well. There was little chance that he'd ever get home. All the signs pointed to him dying miserable and alone on a world that had been abandoned eons ago by his forebearers. Those brave men and women, who tried many, many times to save their home, only to have every plan fail, and every device turn against them, until finally the only safe haven left was the cold and pitiless stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here he stood, a member of that proud race, back after so long away, only to find that in his absence others had taken root. He had little doubt that Zee's word was true. The avians were descendants of Morpheus, one of the final four plans to save the Earth so long ago, and yet another one that had eventually turned against man, driving him to farther extremes. Amadeus wondered again why his ancestors, believing the Vault Techs to be too dangerous to take with them, and left them behind rather than destroy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably out of some foolish notion of returning one day and trying to restore their home again, he thought, but he would never have the chance to ask. Zee, when he'd spoken to him through the Dance Language, had found nothing in the Archive that explained the odd decision. Thinking back on the battle that morning he laughed, wondering if any of his hosts would ever figure out that Zee and he had not been fighting, but rather communicating in a secret art, trading information in such a way that no one could ever guess what had been said, as the dance language required that one be on the receiving end of the blows so that they knew how much force had been behind each punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Amadeus caught sight of a deer in a suit, walking along the paths himself. Not wanting to draw attention to himself Amadeus walked by the deer without batting an eye, and the deer did the same to him. Obviously the relationship between the prey and hunter types on this world were somewhat different than he'd heard from the Dewclaws, though he would wait until Zee told him the specifics of his new role at this Herd Thinners place before making any judgements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Rudy he'd learned that his mother was a top hunter at the company, quite skilled at taking down prey and devouring it. Amadeus had hoped to observe a hunt himself, but apparently they did it as work or sport only now. Hunting just for food did seem a bit of a hassle when they had markets and other businesses which would do it for them. He would just have to wing it tomorrow on his first hunt, and hope that his skill at combat and various other abilities were enough to get him through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last arriving at Tree he looked around to make sure he'd attracted no undo notice, and was pleased to find that no one seemed to be paying any attention to him at all. Some odd looking, yet still human creatures, were making their way home after a long day's work, and he noted only one or two stared at him, and then turned back to their own business. Smiling under the wolf shaped helm he opened the door, which had been left unlocked earlier that morning, and when he'd eft he hadn't bothered locking it. He wondered for a moment if he might already be too late and that Fenton and Lindesfare might already be awake and agitated by his disappearance, but not able to hear anything through the heavy doors he opened them, and was instantly greeted by a voice he recognized as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're late,\" complained the voice of Tree from one of her many speakers. Amadeus could tell from the tone and volume of her that the Fenton and Lindesfare were still asleep, as Tree said the words quite pointedly, yet kept them to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I got detoured,\" Amadeus offered, rubbing the back of his head searching for the catch to the helmet that kept it buckled to the cloak. Finding it at last he undid it with a simple click, and let the hot cloak fall away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For three hours?!\" she shouted at him with a whisper which Amadeus feared might awaken the slumbering pair. Amadeus was still unsure of Tree's senses, though he had discussed with her a bit about it before leaving. According to Tree she had no sense of sight, and only a slight sense of taste and smell, but her touch was such that she could feeling the vibrations of the air, hearing things with her whole body, which allowed her a kind of echolocation, much resembling Fenton's own radar, but even more sensitive. With senses like that she would know how loud she could be and not disturb Fenton or Lindesfare, and she would be able to hear him no matter how softly he spoke, so he walked up to one of the speakers that was her voice and spoke directly to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, three hours. I wandered for less than ten minutes before finding my way back to that house from this morning. The Dewclaws were home, and I got to talking with them. We had a lot to discuss, me being new here and all, so it should be no surprise that I lost track of time,\" he retorted, and Tree took a moment to digest this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that, but I was worried. Fenton told me to keep an eye on you before he went to bed, and that's hard enough with you here, let alone wandering,\" said Tree, her agitation fading. Amadeus had to admit, he'd promised the sentient flora that he would be gone only a few minutes, and he would have to, had not Kevin discovered him in his home. Amadeus berated himself again for getting caught, but he had to admit he was glad he had been, as he'd learned more than a little about his new home from the Hare-Link day staff and company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich included both Kell's mom, and for some reason Ralph's wife. Elanor, Kell's mother, lived with her daughter, so there was no real surprise at her presence, but Martha, who was Ralph's wife and Fiona's mother, didn't really have any reason to be there. As she had that morning, the fox woman had stared at him. It hadn't been a mean look in her eyes, or an accusing one, just one that made Amadeus nervous to be in her sight. Luckily Martha had softened up once the discussion had begun, and she'd even cracked a smile at one of his observations which everyone had taken for a joke, though really it hadn't been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew where I was, I'm sure, and besides, what was the worst that this planet could throw at me?\" said Amadeus. Tree had warned him before leaving about local predators and their tricks, but Amadeus had passed off her warning, telling her that he could deal with it, and he had. Using a bit of water he'd coated his polymer-weave suit in mud and that had killed his natural scent, which made him nearly invisible to the local population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that didn't mean you were safe. I'm sure you think you can take care of yourself, spaceman, but you shouldn't dismiss the locals so easily. I've seen some of the things they do,\" observed Tree, shuddering at how Kevin had once ripped into an old flower bed. The carnage he'd wrought had taken months to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure their violent in their own way, but I'm a trained combat operative, and besides, at one gee these people never develop anything like my strength,\" commented Amadeus, wishing he could take his suit off, as it served not only to keep him comfortable, but to keep him from hurting himself in the lighter gravity of the planet. Used to walking in Dedros' three point nine gees, and to training in much higher gravity environment, Amadeus was confident he could take anything that had developed on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just don't die on my watch. Fenton is very interested in you, and I would hate to have to tell him his new friend got himself eaten before you two had a chance to talk,\" she told him, and then promptly fell silent, having nothing more to discuss with him. Not one to try and talk to someone who didn't want to talk Amadeus went back to the sofa where he'd slept for eight hours. Eight highly uncomfortable hours, mostly spent tossing and turning on the sofa due to the fact that he was used to zero gee sleeping areas, where he could literally float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to ask Zee if we can build a Gravimet room tonight,\" Amadeus reminded himself. He'd already found a few metal plates left over from the installation of the Hare-Link servers inside Tree that would be perfect for turning into Gravimet plates, though he'd have to convince Zee to do the actual work as he had no tools with which to build them himself. Tree ignored Amadeus as he talked to himself, focused instead on the room where Lindesfare and Fenton slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside that room the two were already beginning to awaken. Fenton's snores were becoming less regular, and Lindesfare's breathing had sped up to almost normal. Now it was a race to see which one would awaken first, as they usually let each other sleep when one got up before the other. Whichever one did arise first would be able to talk to Amadeus in the relative private of Tree. So who gets up first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindesfare awoke slowly at first, starting when she realized she wasn't back in her dorm room at Beige University with Rhonda, the large tigress who was her roommate. It came back in a flash, everything that had happened that morning, with Danielle fainting at a sight of new comer not only to Domain, but to the planet Earth itself. Then the chase after him, followed by a meeting with his odd computer companion, and the humans reaction to his new circumstances, which ended with a battle between him and Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her bed all the memories flooded back, along with all the questions she still had to ask the human, and Zee as well. Looking around she found the Fenton was still asleep hanging by his favorite perch, and Lindesfare decided she didn't want to wake him so she got out of bed as quietly as she could manage, grabbing a set of clothes from atop her dresser that matched the ones she'd worn that morning precisely, though she could see those clothes sitting on the edge of her hamper, waiting for her to take them back with her to the University so she could wash them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed she opened the door to the bedroom and then closed it so softly that she doubted even Tree could have felt it. Of course when one of the branches in the hall moved to help her straighten her quills she knew that Tree had indeed felt the door close, or at least felt her waking up. Taking the motherly gesture with a stony face Lindesfare turned to face a speaker through which she could hear Tree, which made it the closest thing to a face the smart house had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Tree,\" she said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening yourself, Lindesfare. I take it you had a nice sleep?\" asked the sentient flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As good as can be expected. I just can't get used to waking up in another bed after sleeping in the dorm though,\" she told Tree, walking down the hall towards the living room. Entering she found Amadeus, his head down standing in one corner with his foot propped against the wall behind him. At first she thought he might be asleep, but when he looked up at her she saw his eyes were wide open and his face was split by a kindly looking grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you up and about,\" he said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you're up too. How was your first day in Domain?\" she asked him, wondering how well he'd been able to sleep in a strange environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite informative. Your father proved to be a wealth of information about this planet, and observing the staff of Hare-Link at work proved to me that Zee and I have at least a few useful skills,\" he commented, Lindesfare nodding dully in answer for a second, before it hit her what he'd just said, sending a jolt up her quills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, you went to dad's house?\" she asked, looking at the human in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I awoke some hours ago, and rather than disturb you and Fenton I decided to join Zee in a little personal exploration, which led me to your house, where I got caught by your little sister, who informed your father. I must say Coney is quite an impressive hunter,\" he said thoughtfully as he got up from his corner and walked over to the couch where he'd slept before, taking a seat and then patting on the other pad, before flinching back and showing that his left hand now sported one of Lindesfare's quills which had been stuck in the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow,\" he cried out, more in surprise than pain. Lindesfare rushed over to him, afraid he'd hurt himself, but was relieved when he pulled the quill out using his teeth, and then held it in the palm of his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. They come out all over the place. My family's learned to be careful around stuff I sit on,\" she told him, taking the quill and tossing it into a nearby wastebasket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to learn that too, since it's looking like I'm not gonna be going home,\" said Amadeus. Surprisingly to Lindesfare his voice held no emotion at that statement, whereas she knew she'd be sad if she ever got lost on some alien world. Well actually she was, but she'd been on the alien world so long it was home. The only home she'd ever known really, as she'd crossed over from the human world at such a young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that. Maybe your people will come and get. I mean there's always a chance right?\" she said, trying her best to cheer him up. Amadeus didn't seem to be cheered by her words though, staring at his feet with a distant expression on his face. Sighing deeply he looked her in the face as she sat down next to him and smiled at her, though this time the grin held a cold indifference rather than the kindness it had the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a chance, yes, but not a good one. I'm a Terminal Gamer, and thus a soldier, and as such I know when to root for the long shot, and when to accept something for what it is. This, I can accept. I mean, do you have any idea how many people spend their lives in search of this place?\" he said, waving his hand to try an encompass everything, not just the room, but the whole planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, I didn't know I was so sought after,\" inserted Tree, knowing that he wasn't speaking about her, but wanting to put in her thoughts on the subject. Both Lindesfare and Amadeus shared a laugh at that, which had been Tree's intent, so her feelings weren't adversely affected. The laughter died away quickly after that, and for long moments the two just sat in silence, neither knowing what to say next. At last Amadeus decided to lift the dark mood, getting up and walking over to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously though, I don't mind. This isn't the first time I've been stranded somewhere. Heck, compared to some of the worlds I've visited this place is a paradise,\" he told Lindesfare, his eyes getting another distant look to them as he stared into the evening sky, the first stars just coming out of the infinite depth of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a paradise. This is a world that really was worth fighting for,\" he said. This time his words were not directed at Lindesfare, or Tree, or anyone else near him. Instead his words were intended for people who had left thousands of years ago, and couldn't hear him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is,\" said Lindesfare, getting up to stand beside him and stare at the stars. She'd always felt like she belonged somewhere up there, one of the few non-fliers who did. She'd even made it once, many years ago. Now standing beside her she had a man who'd traveled between those distant dots of light and seen what lay within their glow. So many questions went through her mind that she didn't know which to ask first, instead standing beside Amadeus in silence gazing upward until...</span></div></div>",

He trusted Lindesfare not to do anything, and he doubted Amadeus would have tried anything that fast, but he still had dark thoughts regarding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was nice talking with you, but I do believe the others are expecting us sometime soon.

Once I talk with Zee later and learn what I'm supposed to be I can go out without hiding, but for now I think it might be best if I wore this,\" he said, holding up the fur cloak and helm, slipping them on without any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice costume. That's the stuff that was laying by the door this morning wasn't it?\" asked Fenton, walking up and sniffing the fur, which he remembered mainly because he'd found the scent odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's my warrior's cloak, carved from Fenrir himself,\" proclaimed Amadeus proudly. Seeing the looks on the faces of his hosts he decided not to extrapolate, feeling it really didn't matter that much anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, let's just get back before Zee gets himself into a tight spot,\" he said, which made Fenton curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean get back? You went out while we were asleep?\" he questioned, and Amadeus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I decided to explore on my own and wandered into Lindesfare's parent's home. I would have gotten out clean had not her little sister found me. Quite a good hunter that Coney,\" he commented, though Fenton really had no idea how to take the remark. Without waiting for a reply Amadeus put on his helm and hooked the clips into place to hold the cloak to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also had a discussion about lodging arrangements for Zee and myself. I hear Tree is feeling a bit empty with no one living here, so we were wondering if you wouldn't mind loaning us the spare bedroom, at least until Zee and I get on our feet,\" said Amadeus off handedly, trying to aim his words at both Fenton and Tree at the same time. Fenton considered his words for a few moments, and agreed that Tree had seemed sad when he'd left the night before, intending on returning to Beige with Lindesfare, though with the blackout and the visitors they'd stayed an extra day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no reason why you can't. Tree, how would you feel about having visitors for a while?\" asked Fenton, who directed his question at the livingroom speaker that connected to Tree and allowed her to speak to him with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, it would be nice to have someone to talk to again, but is either you or this Zee person herbivores?\" asked Tree, who put up with Kevin only because Fenton asked her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an omnivore, but I'm not to into eating my dwelling place so you don't have to worry about me, and Zee doesn't eat at all,\" he said, but then snapped his fingers at a half forgotten memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not true. Zee did eat when he was following the Gourmand, but since then he hasn't eaten a thing as far as I know,\" said Amadeus, admitting to himself that there were times when Zee and he didn't run together for years at a stretch, normally when Zee had a kid or two to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess it's okay with me,\" said Tree, a bit giddy. Both Lindesfare and Fenton looked at each other with questioning glances. They truly hadn't thought Tree was that lonely, but her excitement at the prospect of other people living with her proved otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I hope I am worthy tenant, Ms. Tree,\" said Amadeus, bowing at he speaker, even as he moved to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now though we really need to be going. I'm not sure I trust Zee alone with anyone yet. He tends to create problems when I'm not around to keep him out of trouble,\" said Amadeus, remembering how Zee's second kid had resulted from a simple trip to an ambassadorial suite that took less than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should go see everyone while they're up. We'll go back to the college tomorrow,\" said Lindesfare, announcing their plans to both Tree and Lindesfare, neither having been privy to the decision that the plans represented, but neither objected to the plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, see you again later tonight,\" said Tree, wagging her top in glee. She'd have people in her again, for a while at least. The three said a few more words of goodbye, but soon found themselves walking down the path that led from Tree to the Dewclaw home, Amadeus setting a brisk pace that Fenton and Lindesfare, who were used to flying, had trouble keeping up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you slow down?\" asked Fenton at last, gulping in breathes of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but I don't see why. You should be able to outpace me if you took to the air. Lindesfare's father said you two were quite fast,\" said Amadeus, who didn't understand why the two had been walking in the first place. Lindesfare looked from Fenton to Amadeus, and then went over to Fenton and took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, how about a race. Let's see how fast you can run. Danielle used to tell me that humans could run a mile in four minutes,\" she said, trying to subtly tell Fenton to try and keep his flight speed down to somewhere near there. Fenton stared at Lindesfare for a few moments before catching on and winking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are you ready Amadeus?\" he asked grinning. He would keep his speed down to just little faster so that he didn't reach the Dewclaw home too much quicker than Amadeus. Amadeus took the challenge with a grin, walking back to where the two stood and leaning down so that he was standing like he was about to leap forward, his hands serving as supports with his weight mostly distributed towards his front. Nodding he was ready he let Fenton flap his wings twice, getting a little altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" shouted Lindesfare and the two men took off towards the large tree in the distance. Like a shot Fenton flew forward, hoping to fly high enough to keep a good eye on Amadeus. Once he'd achieved his target height he looked down and back, trying to find Amadeus, but his radar showed no one on the ground in the direction. Lindesfare nudged him slightly and pointed. When Fenton turned his radar to where she indicated he was surprised to find that Amadeus was outpacing him by almost half a mile already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible,\" he exclaimed as he watch Amadeus just seem to fly over the ground, using a leaping stride to cover whole meters at a time. Fenton, not one to be out done, flew faster, dipping his flight path so he could pick up a bit of the speed he'd wasted ascending to his current altitude. It didn't seem to help though as Amadeus looked over his shoulder and just laughed, increasing his own pace which continued to carry him farther away from the flying pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt their speed it took them both mere moments to reach the Dewclaw residence, Amadeus arriving almost a full twenty seconds ahead of the two who'd been flying above him, quite a good lead considering the whole run had taken less than three minutes. When Fenton landed he was again gulping in the air, and was slightly frustrated to find that Amadeus did not look like he'd had a hard time at all, his breathe coming regular and even compared to Fenton's own ragged gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where-di-d-you-learn,\" said Fenton through his deep breathes which chopped his words up, he tried to say more but Lindesfare held her arm up to his chest to stop him from falling over from exhaustion, which he'd nearly done trying to speak in his condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Fenton wants to ask how you learned to run like that,\" she told the human, and the bat nodded in confirmation. Amadeus laughed a bit, pushing his hair out of his face and facing the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad Fenton. I'm used to a higher gravity, so in the one gee of this planet I can run and hit a lot harder than I can normally. When I get used to this though I won't even be able to do this half as well,\" said Amadeus, a bit mournfully. Lindesfare looked at Fenton with a bit of concern on her face, wondering if Fenton could have even kept up with half that speed, but decided to say nothing, giving the bat a moment to catch his breathe before going to the door and opening it to find the family...</span></div></div>",

Amadeus and I sped the last mile here,\" said Fenton, trying to stand up straight, but finding that he needed Lindesfare's support just to stand at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so how badly did you beat him Fenton?\" asked Danielle sitting at one end of the table with George at her side and Rudy staring across the table at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" said Fenton, trailing off as he tried to find the right way to say that Amadeus on foot had beaten him when he'd been in the air, Amadeus though stepped forward grinning and helping Lindesfare to hold the at up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't beat me by that much. Next time I plan on going all out though, so he'd better watch it,\" said Amadeus, who had somehow acquired a pant himself, and was sweating slightly now. As he helped Lindesfare get Fenton to a seat he winked at the bat out of the corner of his eye, and Fenton returned a weak smile. With Fenton sitting steadily in his chair Lindesfare and Amadeus took the seats to either side of him, and Lindesfare looked around, surprised to find that everyone seemed to be sitting at the table, even though she could hear noises that indicated someone was working in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's cooking tonight?\" she queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was going to order some pizza, but Zee insisted on cooking, saying he wanted to show his gratitude for not tossing him and Amadeus out. He insists he downloaded a couple of cook books off the Internet, so we agreed to see what he could do,\" said Kevin, looking towards Amadeus, silently asking a question he knew the others were all thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in for a treat then. Zee studied the Path of the Gourmand for a while. I think it was more for Vikki than out of any real desire to learn the art, but he picked up more than a few culinary skills,\" answered Amadeus, chuckling at the memory of Zee asking him if he knew how to cook, and being forced to admit that he'd once burned ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others though looked at each other with a bit of concern wondering just what they were in for letting a computer cook for them. They didn't have any time to question Amadeus farther on his companions skills at the culinary arts as the subject of the discussion came into the room, sporting over a dozen plates, and oddly enough an arm for each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is served,\" declared the CAP, moving around the table, placing each plate in front of a particular person. No two dishes looked exactly alike, though he seemed to have tried to serve the couples similar looking plates. Stopping at Lindesfare and Fenton he presented to them what looked like two plates covered in various bugs which had been roasted and then seasoned lightly, before moving on to his companion, to whom he gave a bowl full of an odd looking liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you could join us Amadeus. Now I hope to fulfill that bet, so that we can start off clean,\" said Zee to Amadeus just low enough that none of the others could hear what he was saying. Unfortunately they seemed to think the worst of the machine, each of them picking up a fork and poking at the food before them without actually eating anything. Zee didn't notice though as he looked to Amadeus expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to show the others that the food was safe, and to show Zee that he trusted him he picked up a spoon and took a mouthful of his soup. Everywhere around the table the others stopped even trying to look interested in their own dishes to stare at Amadeus, who's face changed into a hurt expression as the soup touched his tongue. For a moment everyone was afraid that the human might be dying, but then with a sharp exhalation he breathed out not just air but also a small wisp of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. There's a kicker. How'd you make Vidaran Spice Soup here Zee?\" asked Amadeus breathlessly. Taking another spoon full of the odd multicolor liquid, his face scrunching up in pain as he did so, he then placed his hands before his mouth while looking at the CAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vidarans created the Spice Soup using only terrestrial ingredients Amadeus, just much differently than anyone had back home. Even the smoke pellets are a simple chemical trick,\" answered Zee, smiling as Amadeus breathed another wisp of smoke into his cup hands. Closing them tightly before any of the smoke could escape Amadeus squeezed his palms together oddly, and then when he released them a cloud that looked like a butterfly floated in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they invented something great, and you do their dishes honor Gourmand Zee,\" said Amadeus, his voice a bit raspy from the spice in the soup. Looking at his smoke sculpture he breathed out one last bit of smoke that pierced the butterfly and collapsed it into a formless cloud that quickly vanished. Everyone took a moment to stare as Zee bowed at the complement before turning to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what had just passed between the two they each faced their own food, and almost as one they each took a testing bite of the food. Silence permeated the room for several moments as everyone took in the flavor of their food, and then Rudy interrupted it by diving at his plate, tearing into the food like... well like a wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it my food meets with approval?\" asked Zee, looking at everyone as they each continued to eat their meals, some savoring every bite, while Rudy and others ripped into theirs. Amadeus, who was still trying to get through his soup a single spoonful at a time leaned close to his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can take that as a yes,\" he said, and Zee nodded. He bowed again, taking the silence and the fact that they were eating his dishes as complements in and of themselves, as he'd been taught to do by his master on the Path of the Gourmand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the meal passed without another word spoken, though Rudy belched loudly once, only to have Amadeus belch even louder in response, earning the human a pointed look from Zee and the women, but an approving one from the males who sat at the table with him. When at last not one scrape of food remained the group was silent again, while Zee took each of the plates away as each person finished their particular meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of clinking plates and running water came from the kitchen, and when Zee emerged again his body looked like one of Kell's family again without all the extra arms. Everyone was content to just sit at the table for several silent minutes, looking at the last few smoke images forged by Amadeus before they faded away into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I declare this meal a success,\" proclaimed Zee as he walked towards the livingroom, and the group, Amadeus included, nodded their agreement as they followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite a talented chef Zee. You'll have to teach me that recipe you used to bring out the flavor of that veal,\" said Kell as everyone took the seats they'd had last night, though with Bruno and Corrie sitting on the floor near Ralph and Martha. Lindesfare and Fenton pointed at the tesseract as they entered the room, looking at the odd sculpture and pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Fenton as he took his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something Amadeus made from Coney's bone stash,\" answered Kevin as he let his eyes fall on the sculpture as well. He lost himself in the almost infinite depth of the cube-within-a-cube design before looking away. Lindesfare and Fenton stared into the sculpture themselves, excited to find that the inner cube didn't seem to move no matter how they moved their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingenious, a tesseract,\" said Lindesfare, identifying the shape from a drawing one of her teachers had once shown her. Amadeus looked towards Zee with a surprised expression which the CAP returned as they both faced Lindesfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what a tesseract is?\" asked Amadeus, stunned that one of his hosts recognized the three dimensional representation of a four dimensional figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kinda. My professor talked about it once, but she didn't seem to know much. I looked it up after class, but about all I know is that it has something to do with four dimensions of space,\" she admitted, but both Zee and Amadeus remained surprised. They hadn't thought the science of the new dominate species of Earth had evolved far enough to recognize four spacial dimensions, let alone express them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. A tesseract is a basic four-d shape. It is to a cube, what the cube is to a square,\" commented Zee as he stared at the hedgehog with renewed interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what it said online, but your model of it looks much more advanced,\" she said staring at the sculpture. Amadeus, seeing Zee's expression pinched the CAP causing him to start in surprise and pain alike, and focusing his attention on a very mad looking Amadeus, who silently admonished his brother not to stare at their hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's just the shape the bones wanted to take. They could have just as easily taken the form of a clown,\" said Amadeus dismissively, trying to make the conversation turn from the odd sculpture, while wishing he hadn't made it, and hoping that he could destroy it sometime later without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could have, but they did not,\" said Zee, trying to keep the conversation alive, but by then everyone was staring at the pair, and they were forced to chuckle embarrassedly. After that the conversation turned towards what the two would do the following day, with Zee agreeing to come by the Dewclaw's and see what he could do with the Hare-Link server while Kell took Amadeus to Herd Thinners and showed him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZee informed both Amadeus and the group that in the files he'd created Amadeus was listed as a species of lemur that was indigenous to a single island. Luckily the lemurs were few in number, so few would know one, while at the same time they were listed as being wanderers, meaning Amadeus' current location would not be too hard to explain. With the business of the newcomers covered the group was then informed that Fenton and Lindesfare would be returning to Beige University tomorrow, and that Amadeus and Zee would be taking up residence within Tree. Just after that declaration of plans Rudy let out a deep yawn, which spread through the group like a wave, causing everyone but Zee, Amadeus, Fenton, and Lindesfare to yawn as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing it's bed time for most of you. So how about me, Zee, and the lovely couple go back to Tree and start getting ready for tomorrow. I have some questions for Tree which I think she and I need to work out,\" said Amadeus, and many of the others nodded their tired agreement. Goodbyes were brief as Fiona hugged Rudy, Bruno hugged Corrie, and then both girls went off with Martha and Ralph towards a large building in the distance which was Fiona's mansion according to what Amadeus had been told, though why the youngest of the four owned the dwelling in which they lived he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the next group to leave the four going to Tree said their piece with those staying at the Dewclaw's, Fenton promising Kevin to look after Lindesfare, and Kell getting Lindesfare to promise to keep out of trouble and to look after Fenton too. With those goodbyes said the group walked to the door, and Amadeus looked down at his cloak, realizing he now had a choice of whether or not to wear it. Does he wear it?</span></div></div>",

Zee, seeing his odd mix of both high tech clothing and old world armor laughed at the image it created, pointing it out to Lindesfare and Fenton, neither of whom seemed to get the joke, making the CAP cough nervously and place his hands in the pockets of the jeans he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is the night life around this area usually like? Last night it seemed pretty dead, but now I can sense over a hundred vital forms in motion,\" commented Zee, pointing at a pair of glowing eyes in the bushes, obviously belonging to some form of feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It comes and goes depending on the season, but it's normally pretty active. Fenton and I used to be part of the local night life, until we started going to Beige, now we're only here some of the time,\" commented Lindesfare, waving at the cat in the bushes, getting a return wave before the gray cat streaked off after what looked like a mouse. Amadeus, with his human sense of sight, couldn't see what was going on, but he could hear things just fine, and he smelled a hint of blood in the air, indicating that somewhere in the distance the cat had caught her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" asked Zee, pointing after the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was Abby, dad's newest neighbor. She's nice enough, for a cat, and she and Kell get along great,\" said Lindesfare like that last bit was something special, and Amadeus was left to wonder why. The major separations on the planet seemed to be based off diet rather than looks, so Amadeus had no idea why the lupine Kell would have any problems associating with the feline Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Zee, who remembered that on Earth felines and canines had never been exactly known for association. Amadeus, being of a more universal in his views, knew that the feline Amerians, humanoid cat anthromorphs, and the canine Veraxan, humanoid dog anthromorphs, were known to be allies stronger than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good for them. I wonder if I can make any friends here,\" said Amadeus without thinking, and then realizing that what he said could be considered dismissive of the kindness that the Dewclaws had shown him so far he added, \"I mean it's nice to talk to you and your family Lindesfare, but to you I'm a bit of a curiosity. I'll probably be that to others to, but no where near as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I remember how Danielle felt when she first got here. She was worried all the time about fitting in, but after a while she just sort of accepted it, and she and George are regulars at certain spots now. I don't know if she thinks of the people she knows there as friends, but I do know they helped her to get through her transition,\" said Lindesfare, remembering her discussions with the human turned anthromorphic rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still a bit of curiosity herself though. People will still sometimes stare at her when she orders meat at a restaurant,\" commented Fenton, his own memory of one of the gatherings they'd all attended coming crystal clear in his mind. He chuckled a bit at the image of some of the carnivores looking over at the bunny eating a burger with big, bug eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I think with Coney as a niece they accept it a bit easier. After all an omnivore rabbit is nothing compared to some of the rest of our family,\" responded Lindesfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think not. After what I observed on the Internet your relatives have many things that lift them above the mediocre,\" said Zee as he recalled all the articles regarding his hosts that he'd copied from his exploration of the net. While Amadeus would not approve of the side track to his primary mission, Zee had felt it necessary to understand those who had helped them in their earliest times on this new world, hoping to find some way to repay them for their kindness. Lindesfare seemed to be slightly disturbed by the CAP's observation though, and stopped in her tracks to turn and face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find on the net about us? More rumors and slander?\" she asked, not accusing Zee of anything, but really wondering if anything they didn't already know about might be floating on around the world wide web about her family and relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of it yes, but the majority of files I procured from an avian database mark your family as this words first step towards a new age. Specifically it makes mention of young Coney's enhanced tele abilities, as well as the friendships your mother has formed with species that are normally enemies of her own,\" said Zee matter-of-factly, though the information he shared seemed to cause Lindesfare even more concern than had he told her slander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. The bird that moved into Ms. Aura's house said something like that, but he didn't say that Coney was telepathic. Is she really?\" asked Lindesfare, wondering if Zee might have some way to test for it. Oddly it was Amadeus who stepped forward and answered the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly telepathic. She can't rip the thoughts out of your head, if that's what you're thinking. She is simply a bit more human than you are and thus able to tap into a part of her mind called the Collective Unconscious more than you are, to the effect that she can communicate with open minds like those of young children through thought,\" he told them, having had a short conversation with the bunny child earlier that day when he'd asked her if he could borrow some of her bones for his marrowmelding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Amadeus, to them it is close to telepathy. She reads the thoughts of what are expected of her, and draws from the experiences of those around her. It is quite a good thing she is unaware of the true nature of her abilities as she could very well cause another instinct loss event if she were to try and form a conscious link with someone,\" said Zee in an off hand way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Coney was responsible for the world wide loss of instinct?\" asked Fenton, who had suffered in that incident himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The first case, when Rudy was publishing his little comic about humans, was caused by the fact that your people, being infused with human DNA, also have the parts of the mind that are given over to the Collective Unconscious. In your case though that space is taken up by instincts, something which humans have little of. When Rudy's comic was disseminated it activated that part of the mind of a few individuals who naturally tried to form links with others, erasing the information contained within that portion of the minds of those they tried to link with,\" explained the CAP in a low tone, looking over his shoulder and scanning around them to find that luckily no one around them showed any interest in their discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After he stopped publishing that strip the individuals ceased to... think like humans, I guess is the best way to put it and eventually this world achieved an equilibrium again, with others literally giving copies of the instinct to those who lost them, allowing them to function again, if with a bit of a learning curve now due to the transplanted information's incompatibility with their own systems,\" said the CAP his pace increasing as he led the way back to Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second incident was simply the same thing, but this time on a much wider scale as real humans were present, minds that were used to the Collective Unconscious, and thus knew how it was supposed to go. Though she did not do it on purpose Danielle and various others, including the avians themselves, were attempting to reach out and grab onto the minds of others, forging a new link. It was only by sending the strongest of the minds through to another world that the network collapsed, however in that particular case the result would have been something much different than what the birds believe,\" said Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lindesfare, wondering what else Ms. Aura's people might be hiding from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the birds thought that the forming of the link would overwrite all instincts on the planet, leading to a major sociological shift that you just are not ready for at this time. However my data indicates that more likely the new link would have encompassed the data as well, which would had led to changes, but not the ones the birds though,\" said the CAP, getting blank looks from everyone in the group, including Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the birds thought that the instincts would go away, leaving this world reeling in chaos as everyone basically forgot how to do what they were supposed to do. What I believe would have happed though is that the instincts of all the races would have been accessible by any individual, leading to a world where... well where wolves knew how to hide like rabbits, and rabbits knew how to stalk like wolves,\" explained Zee as best he could, and he saw in her eyes that Lindesfare understood him, while both Amadeus and Fenton seemed lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not really that important, as neither scenario is possible now. Amadeus, unlike Danielle, is able to control that part of his mind, and will not try to form a link with anyone. Still I wish I could have discussed this with Aura, she seems like a smart woman,\" said the CAP, a bit of regret coming into his voice as the group at last reached Tree. Without waiting for the others, and still scanning everywhere Zee opened the door and ushered everyone inside, closing and locking the door behind them before breathing a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so who was following us?\" asked Amadeus, startling Fenton and Lindesfare, who looked back towards the door nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one, Amadeus, at least not anyone I could sense, but I do not think that subjects like the one we were discussing are fit for the open air. The birds lost the Vault Techs, but that does not mean they are not dangerous, and there were some oddities in the data flows of the net which I cannot account for,\" said Zee, looking at Amadeus intently, freezing his brother in his gaze as the human had made ready to grab his pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you lied earlier,\" sated Amadeus. It was not a question, it was a statement of fact for him, and Zee was forced to look down at the floor ashamed that he had bent the truth even slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I said the Vault Techs were gone, and that is the truth. These data flows though sparked my interest, and yet I have not been able to crack them. Something bad could possibly be going on here Amadeus, something neither you nor I are qualified to handle alone,\" said Zee, still looking towards Amadeus with a gaze that bespoke of what he would do if the human dared to draw his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side both Lindesfare and Fenton were staring at the pair of visitors, confused by the strange change that had overtaken them. Zee hadn't changed that much, those his eyes looked less bright and more focused than they had before. Amadeus though had changed drastically, his voice going from soft and kind to something hard and unbending, while his eyes changed into something that reminded Lindesfare of Kell when she was on the hunt. Oddly enough his scent too had changed, as if he had become an entirely different person as he stared at Zee accusingly. For many minutes the staring contest continued until at last Amadeus set his hand on his belt, and then looking over at Lindesfare and Fenton he...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess you're more than a little confused by this aren't you?\" asked Amadeus, smiling warmly. His eyes had returned to the soft state that Lindesfare and Fenton remembered, and his scent was slowly edging back towards what it had been before. His voice retained a slight edge of hardness, but even that seemed to fade as he leaned back against the wall behind him, and then motioned for Lindesfare and Fenton to have a seat on the couch while he stood in front of it. The two complied with his silent request, not sure what they were in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, where to begin, where to begin,\" said Amadeus to himself, drumming on his chin with his left index finger. At last he looked towards Zee and motioned for the CAP to stand beside him, as if Zee would play some part in what he was about to tell Lindesfare and Fenton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I don't know what the avians told you about humans, or about the history of this planet, and our leaving, but trust me, at least half of it was either a lie or wrong due to their own lack of knowledge,\" he said, trying to begin his tale by erasing whatever it was that the birds had told the two about his people. He'd spoken earlier with the family about what they knew about the history of humans on Earth, and found it to be more than a little biased against humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, Earth wasn't trashed by humans. Not as badly as Kevin and Danielle seemed to think anyway. I mean they did clear cut the rainforest and do dozens of other horrible things, but for everything one human did wrong, a dozen others tried to do right, and usually they achieved a precarious balance of creation and destruction,\" he explained, moving his hands like those of a scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, when my ancestors came to a certain point they began to expand their technology in a new way, one that dealt with life itself, and in the end that caused a bunch of problems, namely the creation of nonhuman sentients, and several other kinds. These other sentients at first acted docile and non threatening but many would turn on humanity, and begin what was known as the Gaia Conflict,\" he said, trying to remember everything he could about the legendary battle between man and what had seemed like the planet itself at many points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually humans would come out on top of the Conflict, after much bloodshed and heartache. The planet suffered greatly from the battles fought using the very lifeblood of her, namely a silver, glowing liquid that is called Genesis, the basis of the technologies that caused the evolution of the nonhuman sentients,\" he said, skipping over the details which in truth he didn't know. Zee, who probably did know the details, stood beside him, not wanting to add the gory particulars of what was one of the worst periods in recorded history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many technologies that came out of he war were then turned to the purpose of resurrect what was fast becoming a dead world, but in the end all the plans would fail, many creating worse enemies than the ones from the war. At that time too was developed the Morpheus Ray, which would accelerate the formation of neural networks, basically increasing the intelligence of anything it hit,\" he told them, gesturing at the walls around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my guess that Tree is a subject of that very weapon, though exactly what it did to her I don't know, I just know that it works on any living creature, which included the first avians which were granted sentience in an attempt to get them to help revitalize the planet. As you can probably guess that didn't work either, and after that we were hit with two more severe set backs, the Green Brain and Foulmess, the first being a living mass of neural fiber that literally took control of the forests and turned them into armies that tried \u2018purify' the planet of everything that wasn't flora, and the second being creatures the were born of a kind of filter that removed impurities in Genesis energy, but unfortunately shoved the impurities together until they became living creatures of darkness and rot,\" he said, remembering some of the games he'd played that had involved fighting those same creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After so many set backs and battles the human race gave up on this planet. They just couldn't live here anymore and decided to pack up and leave, but rather than take the techs which had caused the problem with them the humans of the past decided to lock them away in a device known as a vector cage, which was...well it was a device that created space where there really wasn't any,\" he explained, searching for right words to describe the vector cage. Getting blank looks from his audience, who still didn't understand where the explanation was leading, Amadeus turned to Zee and motioned for him to try his hand at explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never were a good teacher Amadeus,\" complained the CAP as he stepped forward, this time forgoing the projections he just spoke directly to the two listeners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vector cage is a type of spacial warp, wherein certain forces, specifically those involving gravimetrics, create an area where false space exist. In effect a vector cage can hold an ocean in a space the size of a syringe,\" he said, stepping back so that Amadeus could finish his history lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Zee. Now into the vector cage, which was code named The Vault, the humans of that age placed techs which they would leave on Earth for whatever reason. Had I been them I would have simply destroyed the stuff, but my ancestors had a thing for knowledge. Even when they didn't want it they felt that they should preserve it in some way,\" he told Lindesfare and Fenton, who still had no real idea of where the lecture was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest is history, as the saying goes. Eventually the humans would go out in four arks, which were themselves shuttles equipped with gravimet drive systems and vector cages. After landing on the four colonies and evolving for several years the scattered remnants of Earth would reunite and form the Combine,\" he said, getting at last to the point he had been trying to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now upon forming the Combine began searching for the home that the humans had left behind, but thanks to certain events which we have never understood the beacon left on Earth which had vanished. We assumed the worst of course that Earth had been destroyed in some unknown way. However just because we assumed that it was gone didn't mean we were willing to just write off the dangerous techs we'd left in The Vault,\" he said, and Lindesfare gasped slightly. It dawned on her where this speech would be leading and why the two visitors had seemed so intense a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want the technology the birds used destroyed, don't you?\" she asked, and Fenton looked at her in shock. He knew that according to the bird who'd explained some of the situation that the techs were supposedly gone, sent into the future using a time machine, but of course the human visitor wouldn't have known that, and may have made plans to acquire and destroy those items which would have involved a confrontation with the birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Standing Order number four of the Triad Square states that any member of the Combine military who is put into a position to destroy the techs should do so by any means necessary. In my case those means involved causing an overload in my pistol's hydrogen sounding chamber that would have created a small proto star. Once the gun's chamber burst open the star would then ignite the atmosphere, destroying the techs no matter where they were on the planet,\" he said, his hand dropping to his belt and withdrawing the pistol from its holster. Lindesfare seemed more disturbed by the new information that Fenton, as the bat truly did not grasp what Amadeus had just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were going to destroy the whole planet, just to eradicate a few trinkets?\" asked Lindesfare, disbelief in her voice. Fenton, hearing her words, put two and two together and realized that that was exactly what Amadeus had just told him. For a moment shock was evident on his face, but it was fast replaced by a smouldering anger directed at the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few trinkets? The techs in The Vault had the capability of destroying the entire cosmos if misused. Even the Combine today couldn't fight some of the things contained within those walls, and that is why were are supposed to make sure they're gone. Zee convinced me earlier that they were, and I believed him. I still do really, but these anomalous data flows may be just as dangerous,\" he said, a forlorn look in his eye as he gazed out a nearby window at the starry sky outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you will believe me, but I didn't want to hurt you, or anyone else on this planet. I mean this is Earth. This is where my people began, but my wonder at this place has to come second. A soldier has to follow his orders, even when he doesn't agree with them. Can you understand that?\" he asked of the two, and Fenton still stared at him with anger in his eyes, realizing what the human was admitting to nearly doing. Next to him though Lindesfare's expression was much different. Her shock at his statement was tempered by her thoughts about Rudy, who had been looking at joining the service recently. As Amadeus had said, if Rudy joined then he would be required to follow his orders, even if he didn't agree with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" she said at last, to Fenton's surprise. He turned his gaze from Amadeus to her, and then back again, the anger giving why to shock again as he saw the softness in the gaze of the woman he loved directed at a man who had almost killed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I would still understand if you chose to hate me, and if that is the case please tell me now, and I will leave. It would be best if I left soon if you hate me, as I do not wish to cause you any undo concern. I would even be willing to leave a piece of my weapon in your hands, to prove that I would not take such actions in the future,\" offered the human, pulling at the gun in his hand and popping off the small orb at the back. Holding out his hand he passed the sphere to Lindesfare who rolled it in her palm for several minutes before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindesfare rolled the small metallic sphere around in her hand for a few minutes, studying it and wondering how such a small device, that was smaller than a baseball, could be such a large threat to her world. After everything she'd seen and done, she knew that little things could cause trouble on a global scale, and that this tiny orb had been made by a people who had many times her own people's time to develop weapons. Staring into the depths of the chrome finish she at last held her hand out to Amadeus and then let it roll from her palm into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should keep it. I don't think we're ready for this,\" she said at last, and Fenton looked at her in disbelief. Amadeus though, nodded as he replaced the sphere back onto the butt of his gun, causing it to click into place followed by a small whine that quickly ended. Spinning the pistol twice on his index finger the Combine soldier slid the weapon back into the holster at his waist and then faced the one who had just handed back such an awesome power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is ever ready for that kind of power, but you have my word that as long as I wield it, this power shall never be used against this world or those on it,\" swore Amadeus, crossing his hands before him to form an S and then bowing at Lindesfare. Fenton, who had been sitting beside Lindesfare leaped up from his couch and pointed an accusing finger at the human before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you think we trust your word? I mean you just admitted that a couple of hours ago you were willing to kill everyone just to get rid of a few pieces of junk your people left behind eons ago,\" he said to the human, and before anyone had a chance to react, Lindesfare leapt up and stood between the human and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fenton, you just gave us at least one good reason to trust him in that sentence, and you don't even realize it,\" she told him, and the bat stared at her blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told us Fenton. He didn't have to. He could have just acted like it was nothing, and we would have believed him, but he didn't He was willing to take our judgement for his actions on himself. Not only that but he didn't do it, and he was willing to give up that power to us. He gave us a chance Fenton, a chance to live, and I think we should be willing to do the same,\" she told him, he voice full of emotion. Silence hung in the air for several moments as everyone digested what Lindesfare had just said, a silence that was broken when a slight coughing sound came from one of the speakers in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if my opinion is really valued in this instance, but I have to agree with Lindesfare, Fenton. No matter what he was told to do by his superiors, Amadeus didn't do it, and that means that he's on our side. I think,\" interjected Tree, and Fenton slowly fell back into the couch. Upon landing he let out a startled yelp and flew back up, a quill stuck to his butt. Again silence hung in the air, but this time it was broken by the sound of laughter as Fenton pulled the quill out of his posterior and set it into a dish on a nearby table that was full of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be more careful,\" he commented as he resumed his seat, looking towards the three sets of eyes that were staring at him. He smiled as best he could, which solicited a hug from Lindesfare before the four figures were again seated in their two pairs, both facing each other across a small gap. Amadeus and Zee seemed to be back to their normal selves completely now, with Amadeus having lost that hard edge he'd had mere moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, about these data flows. What is it you find odd about them Zee?\" asked Lindesfare, interested as to what an alien computer mind might find odd on the Internet, if for no other reason than casual interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not odd per say, just a little off. As most people in computers know code is written by a single programer and then later expanded on by others. In most cases the code comes to take on a kind of life that helps you ID the programer who made it through what is known as a FIST,\" he said, and Fenton, Lindesfare, and Amadeus nodded, all three familiar with the principle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is I cannot ID these programs. Everything on the net had some kind of identifying trait to it that let me at least know the species of the programer through what I know about behavioral patterns, but these things just do not fit any of the patterns I know,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well could you just not have patterns for the species that made the code?\" asked Fenton, his own interest in the situation sparked by self-preservation as he still didn't trust Amadeus not to blow the world to kingdom come if he thought that the flows represented a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though of that, but even if the patterns did not fit I should have been able to follow the flows back to some source, and I could not. They just sort of vanished whenever I tried,\" he said, shrugging his elbows in a defeated gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could the code segments have been immature EIs?  I mean it isn't unknown for a linked computer network to begin forming the complex codes that can form EIs,\" said Amadeus, and Zee considered the question for a moment before nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is possible, but I still should have been able to ID the code in that case, as even EIs take part of their code from basic programs before forming a coherent logic string,\" he said, shaking his head in defeat again. His mind was racked with possibilities as to the origins of the odd flows, but he had no concrete data on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, when you're helping with Hare-Link tomorrow try and find out some more. Now that the unpleasant business of SO4 has been dealt with we can focus on the more sociological oriented stuff. Hey it could be nothing more than trash code that clumped together,\" purposed Amadeus, but neither he nor Zee looked to confident. Shaking his head and trying to dismiss the disturbing news about odd data flows Amadeus turned back to Fenton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we are going to be staying here, by the way, I wanted to ask if Zee and I could make some modifications to the guestroom, and also if I could borrow some of the metal shell plates left over from the server installation,\" said Amadeus, shifting the conversation towards a less serious path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to ask Tree about any modifications to her, but as for the plates I see no reason why you can't have them. What are you planning on doing with them though?\" asked Fenton, wondering what the human could do with a few pieces of EM shielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm stuck here I can't get to any place with high gee training equipment, so I figured that I'd build some for myself,\" said Amadeus, looking over at Zee and tapping him on the shoulder before rising. He led the way through the house and back to the room where the servers were humming away. Walking carefully over the cables on the ground he made his way past the machines and then emerged from the labyrinth of technology a moment later holding a panel of sheet metal about a foot square and a cm deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would this work for gravimet plating Zee?\" asked Amadeus as he handed the piece of metal to his companion. Looking at the thing with a gauging eye Zee turned it over and over again before at last holding it flat before him. Then placing on hand under it he placed the other atop it and as all three of the watchers looked on his hand began to flow into the sheet, spreading out like water. After a second or two his melted hand had completely covered the sheet and then he withdrew it like a magician whipping a table cloth off a table full of fine china. Instead of leaving the pieces of expensive glass standing though Zee revealed that the surface of the plate on his palm was now covered with circuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are sufficient. However does this not violate rule two of our current situation?\" asked Zee as he handed the altered piece of metal back to Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kinda, but as long as I keep it for personal use only it should be okay. That precedent was set back in five-oh-eight(508) when a Combine trooper crashed on a world of proto humans. He made a few things for his personal use, like a gun, that the people couldn't make. He didn't get hit because he didn't introduce the tech to anyone,\" responded Amadeus as he studied the new sheet, before nodding at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to the bigger obstacle,\" he said resignedly, turning to face one of the speakers that allowed communication with Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tree, I want to make some small alterations to your interior. Would that be alright?\" he asked, wondering if puppydog eyes worked on something without sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...what sort of alterations?\" asked Tree slightly nervous at the prospect of altering her insides, though still wanting Amadeus and Zee to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing drastic, if that's what you're thinking. I just want to build a place where I can work out. All I'm really going to do is make a big, room sized, metal box inside you. It shouldn't hurt,\" he said, and he could feel Tree's agitation at the idea, even with his assurances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't feel that you have to do this. I'm not going to force this on you,\" he said, not wanting to try and coerce anyone into anything they didn't want. Thinking about it from Tree's perspective he knew he wouldn't want anyone to build a small metal box on his insides. Tree considered the same thoughts for a few moments before responding that...</span></div></div>",

Nothing too big, mind you, just a feeling of dizziness that comes from two competing gravitational fields,\" admitted Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never heard of the field affecting the surrounding structure too adversely, however my memory contains at least half a dozen records of living vessels complaining about disorientation. It is unlikely that you will even feel these effects, but I am not willing to say that as an absolute,\" added Zee as he came out of the computer room carrying a stack of the metal sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, even Bit-Brain says you'll be fine. Now let's get to building,\" said Amadeus, walking towards the guestroom without looking at the other three. Lindesfare and Fenton both seemed as nervous as Tree at the prospect of Amadeus doing any construction, while Zee was shaking his head and sighing at his brother's back. They still followed him though, if for no other reason than Amadeus seemed to draw them after him. His pace was such that even Zee had a bit of a problem keeping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving told Fenton and Lindesfare about his near destruction of their planet had lifted his mood for whatever reason, and Amadeus walked with a spring in his step, nearly bouncing with each footfall, before he finally entered the guestroom and came face to face with the first problem in his construction efforts. It was true that the room was bare of furnishings, as he'd remembered, but what he'd forgotten was the small perch that stuck out of the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so maybe I should have thought of this earlier,\" he commented to himself, scratching the back of his head again and turning to find the other three coming up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Zee, I think we might have a bit of a problem,\" he said to the CAP as it entered the room, pointing towards the protrusion from the wall. Zee took a moment to study the branch, before turning back to face Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am surprised at you brother. You act like I cannot work around something like this,\" Zee told the human, setting the plates he'd been carrying down before grabbing the top one and holding it in front of him as he'd done with the one he altered. As before his hand was placed palm flat atop the thin sheet of metal, but this time when he withdrew it a small strip came with it, until he had enough that it formed a mold of the perch with more than a few extra inches to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I told you lately that I think you're brilliant,\" said Amadeus as he took the sheet from Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not lately, but then you and I have been a bit busy today,\" responded the CAP, picking up another sheet off the stack and altering it as he'd done with the first one, again creating a thin sheet that was covered in oddly glowing circuits. Amadeus set two of the altered plates side by side on the floor in front of him, and then drew his gun, an action which caused his two hosts a bit of consternation, but then they noticed that he played with a dial on the weapons side, causing the end to spark brightly like a welding torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the tricky part. I have to bond the plates, merging the circuit paths. If I make a single centimeter mistake then the paths don't meet up and the plates becomes useless,\" he explained to them as he pushed the two plates closer together, and then delicately, with the same deft hand which he had applied to the marrowmeld sculpture he touched the tip of the gun to the plates getting a small stream of smoke. When he at last pulled back the circuits linked perfectly, and they seemed to be glowing brighter than they had separately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" he commented, grabbing the third plate and placing it beside one of the two joined plates. Again he placed the tip of his gun on the metal, bonding the plate to its brothers, and causing the circuits to glow brighter still. As he took up the forth plate Amadeus began to hum softly to himself, to a tune that sounded oddly familiar to Lindesfare, though not as much to Fenton. Slowly the words to the song began to fall from his lips, barely audible to the two despite their hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well they say a man is made out of mud,<br>\r\na poor man's made out of muscle and blood.<br>\r\nMuscle and blood and skin and bones,<br>\r\na mind that's weak, but a back that's strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou load sixteen tons and what do ya get?<br>\r\nAnother day older and a deeper in debt,<br>\r\nSaint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go,<br>\r\nI owe my soul to the company store.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not that old bawl again,\" complained Zee as he passed Amadeus another plate, causing the human to look up from his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good working song Zee, and this is work,\" he told the CAP, gesturing at the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You have never worked a coal mine in your life, or anything even close to that difficult,\" commented the CAP, before turning as he felt a small tap on his shoulder. Looking back he found that Lindesfare had stepped up behind him, her face inquisitive as it usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but what song is that he's singing? I seem to remember hearing it somewhere before,\" she asked, and the two extraterrestrials looked at each other for support, before Amadeus turned back to his welding, still humming the tune, forcing Zee to explain it to his hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The song is titled Sixteen Tons, and it is a folk song dating back to a period about one hundred years prior to the one your world is currently at. It is a description of the life of coal miners of that era who felt like they were born mining and died mining, all while working for corrupt mine bosses. Now in truth these were accurate reads of their situation, but the song itself was a bit of fantasy based on the estimate that in their lifetime each miner moved roughly sixteen tons of coal,\" explained Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first line of the song is actually a tribute to the major religion of that time and area, its creation myth being that man was born when a divine being molded him from clay,\" said Zee. He was about to continue his explanation when Amadeus tapped on the stack of metal sheets, holding out his hand for the next piece of his growing puzzle on the floor at his feet. Looking somewhat hurt at being interrupted Zee quickly altered another sheet and passed it to the human, who then began singing again as he set his latest addition in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well I was born one day when the sun didn't shine,<br>\r\nI picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine.<br>\r\nI loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal,<br>\r\nand the straw boss said \u2018well ah bless my soul'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou load sixteen tons and what do ya get?<br>\r\nAnother day older and a deeper in debt,<br>\r\nSaint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go,<br>\r\nI owe my soul to the company store.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that first line of the second verse is appropriate to you. You were born in a city that never saw a single drop of sunlight,\" commented Zee as he made another plate, passing it to Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I don't think the author of the song ever had Shunt Cities in mind when he wrote the song,\" responded Amadeus, still humming the tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you see me comin better, step aside,<br>\r\na lot of men didn't, a lot of men died.<br>\r\nOne fist of iron, the other of steel,<br>\r\nif the right one don't get you, then the left one will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou load sixteen tons and what do ya get?<br>\r\nAnother day older and a deeper in debt,<br>\r\nSaint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go,<br>\r\nI owe my soul to the company store.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that last verse, not counting the chorus, speaks of the kind of person such a life creates. Hard and strong, capable of great acts of strength and violence. Not unlike Amadeus really,\" said Zee, again getting himself a hurt look from Amadeus. Looking around themselves Lindesfare and Fenton were surprised to find that the box of metal plates Amadeus had been welding together was almost complete, with only a small portion of the floor left to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping onto the finished pieces of the floor the two watched as Amadeus quickly set the last few sheets into place, completing the box. It was only then that the two noticed that they had no exit to the room now, the door being covered by metal plates, but as if in answer to their thoughts Amadeus quickly rushed to where the door had been and used his tool to carve open a small rectangle of wall, which caused the room to go dark as the circuit was broken and ceased to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling at the newly made door Amadeus opened it wide so that he let light from the hall into the new room and then did a few things with his tool that Fenton and Lindesfare couldn't see, though they were nearly blinded as the circuits around them suddenly flared into life again, bright enough now to provide what looked like sunlight into the enclosed world around them. Walking up to one of the circuits Lindesfare ran her hand over it and followed the small band of a light as well as she could in its confusing pattern over the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and like most things of beauty, it is quite deadly to the unprepared, so you, Fenton, and I stand to the side while I turn this thing on and put Amadeus through his paces,\" responded Zee, motioning for Fenton and Lindesfare to stand beside him in a corner that seemed to glow a different hue than the rest of the box. Once they had joined him he looked askance at Amadeus, who silently nodded towards his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, Tree, can you hear us?\" asked Zee, looking towards the area of the wall where the speaker had been. A muffled voice called out an affirmative, and Zee touched his forearm, causing the fur and skin to melt like they had when he'd made the plates, but this time instead of merging with metal, the arm became metal, specifically a metal control pad that glowed the same color as the circuit around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us see how good Amadeus is. We shall try a setting of twenty gravs to start, and go as high as fifty if he looks to be doing okay,\" said Zee, and Lindesfare looked at him, slightly shocked by the figures he was throwing out so nonchalantly. She knew Amadeus was used to a higher gravity than any she'd known, but fifty times. Amadeus had an odd expression on his face at the two numbers as well, though his were for entirely different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only fifty? Come on Zee, that's baby stuff. Give me a real work out,\" he said to the CAP, who shook his head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus, I am still not confident of this structure's ability to withstand the pressures you are used to, so let's play it safe for now. Maybe later we can play with the training wheels off, but for now they are on no matter what you want,\" responded Zee, and Amadeus couldn't argue, seeing as how the CAP was holding the only control for his new work out room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then how about cleaning me off first. I haven't felt clean for days now, since Fenrir actually,\" said Amadeus, getting some odd looks back from his hosts, who had no idea of what he was talking about. The cleaning became explained a moment later as Zee pressed a button on his arm that cause Amadeus to lift off the ground by an inch, and hover in the air. As they looked on, impressed by the simple fact that he was flying, they watched as what looked like dirt and grim literally peeled off his skin, finally falling to the floor in a heap when the gravity around Amadeus returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better. Now give me what, you've got Bit-Brain,\" said Amadeus to Zee, and Zee complied. Looking over his shoulder Lindesfare watched as the number on his display slowly rose from one to twenty, which caused Amadeus to jerk in surprise, before he seemed to find his balance again, bouncing from one foot to the other as he had been before, and neither Lindesfare nor Fenton could see any difference. Both took a step forward as if to test and see if anything before them had changed, and before Zee could stop them __________ crossed the safety zone into the twenty times gravity field.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The quilled young woman reached the boarder between her safety zone and the zone where Amadeus was working out, causing both herself and Amadeus to cry out in shock, her falling to her knees, and Amadeus leaping up and slamming into the roof. Both Fenton and Zee went to the fallen Lindesfare, helping her to her feet after the sudden collapse, and luckily she appeared to be fine, if a little unnerved by her experience. Amadeus, without aid, picked himself up off the floor and then walked over to right before where Lindesfare was standing unsteadily on her feet with Zee and Fenton on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that young lady, is why you should never step out the safety zone while in a grav room,\" he admonished her, causing Fenton to stare at him somewhat harshly, but looking up weakly Lindesfare nodded at him in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember not to do that again,\" she promised, shaking off the two valient gentlemen, who seemed to have forgotten that while recovering from a surprising ordeal, she was quite capable of standing on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened anyway? I thought I was going to be crushed when I passed beyond the safety zone, but instead I felt... well like I felt when I was on the shuttle,\" she commented, recalling how microgravity had felt during her little jaunt into space some time before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it should have. The field is supposed to protect you, so when you passed over the line it canceled all local gravity, creating a zero g zone in my area, which affected you as well. We're actually lucky you did and not Fenton to tell the truth,\" commented Amadeus, not really caring about how unique it was for Lindesfare to know what zero gravity felt like. To him it was such a common thing that he didn't give it a second thought, though in the back of his mind he knew that it wasn't nearly so common for Prim Worlders like Fenton and Lindesfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" asked Fenton, somewhat insulted at te implied weakness, though in truth he knew Lindesfare was stronger than him in most senses of the word. Amadeus however, meant no insult by his comment and shook his hands in a motion that indicated Fenton should erase the last comment from his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant. I meant to say that since you're a flyer your sense of gravity is slightly different. If you'd been exposed to the sudden shift it would probably have thrown you for a loop, likely knocking you out for a while,\" he told him, and Fenton seemed to take it better that the insult was really just a trait of his kind of being rather than anything personal, though Amadeus could sense that he still wanted to prove himself, especially after Amadeus beat him in a foot vs. flying race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so Amadeus, do you want to keep going with your workout, or can I shut this place down for a while so we can all catch our breathes after that little scare?\" asked Zee, fingering the controls on his arm. Looking around Amadeus seemed to be searching the walls for some sign, but after a quick search he didn't seem to find what he was looking for and nodded at Zee while pointing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, go ahead and shut it down. It's probably getting late anyway, and I still have to ask you questions about this place where I'm going to be working tomorrow,\" responded Amadeus, and with a single push Zee shut off the gravity room's field, yet instead of growing dimmer, the light from panels actually grew stronger in intensity. Motioning for Lindesfare and Fenton to follow Zee walked across the room to the door to show them it was safe, and then together the four left the newly refurnished room and made their way back into Tree's living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it really is getting late,\" said Lindesfare when she at last got a look at the clock on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have to pack up all the stuff we brought with us and then set off back for the college. Come on Fenton,\" and so saying she grabbed Fenton's hand and the two rushed back towards the bedrooms, this time going into the one in which they slept, leaving Zee and Amadeus alone in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what do you want to know Amadeus?\" asked Zee as soon as he knew the two were out of ear shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's start with the basics, what will I be doing, who will I be doing it to, and how much will I be making?\" he asked, and so Zee launched into an explanation of what he'd been able to find out about Amadeus' duties at Herd Thinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first one is easy for you, you will be killing things, something you do anyway, so a job doing it should suit you well. As for the who you will be killing, well from what I was able to find out you are given a daily quota of pounds, and you are supposed to fill it or die trying. That third thing, well I do not know it, you will have to ask Kell. I bet she will,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there the discussion becomes more specific. Details of the office hierarchy, which Zee describes as being based off a pride of lions, with a few leaders sitting around making decisions while others carry them out. In this case the Alpha leader would be a creature called R.L., with several lower echelons below him in varying categories. From the files it appeared the Kell was actually the local top hunter, though how she fit into the rest of the company even Zee could not figure out, as most of the place was literally a mishmash of thrown together departments, most of which were still in one way or another involved in hunting and killing, though some other, like Connie's Webmaster position, were more about filing and information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, will I be working under Kell, or what?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will, for a while at least. From what I gather the top hunter takes newcomers to the area out into the field on their first hunt in order to both gauge them, as well as provide insight into local prey and their tactics,\" responded Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hard of a time should I have with the local prey, do you think?\" asked Amadeus, having spent the day gauging the ability of those around him he doubted he'd have much difficulty, but it was best to prepare just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The local prey in the wild is about average intelligence. They use no tools, instead relying on their individual attributes of camouflage and defense, most types of which you have encountered and over come before so I will not go into detail,\" answered Zee, but then he held up his hand as if he were remembering something half forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will however be one complication,\" he told Amadeus, giving a slight pause as if asking the human to figure out what he was going to say next. Amadeus, not one to back down from a challenge, held up his own hand to stop Zee's continuation, and after a second or two of though he snapped his fingers and pointed at the CAP in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eating part. I can't eat that much in the time span they want. Right?\" he asked, and Zee smiled at his brother while nodding, showing off the teeth which he had in his current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. Thanks to odd nature of their evolution, people on this planet are still used to eating a lot all at once, which as you know is a throw back to pre-sentient evolution when one could not count on regular meals at all times. It is not that they eat more than you, they just eat what you eat in a day in about six minutes, so we have to boost your metabolic rate, which is why I made these,\" said Zee, reaching into his pants pocket and pulling out a two sealed, plastic containers, each of which were wafer thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So what are they?\" asked Amadeus as he took the plastic containers from Zee, who motioned for him to open one. Digging his fingernails into the place where the lid and container met her pulled the two apart, to reveal that inside the containers were individual crackers, saltine to be specific, though the salt was oddly colored, with a slight violet tint to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up, how are crackers going to help me eat that much at once?\" asked Amadeus, sniffing the odd looking confection, and finding that it had only the normal odor for such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not a normal cracker Amadeus. The salt contains a metabolic booster that will accelerate your digestive tract allowing you to eat many times what you should. If you notice the two are marked purple and orange. Purple makes you eat more, and orange returns you to normal. And to make it less suspicious, take this too,\" he said, pulling out of thin air seemingly a pack of saltine crackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute Zee. What's next, pull a coin from behind my ear?\" said Amadeus, and then reached over to Zee and did just that, pulling his personal coin, the one he'd used to choose his direction after first finding a road on his new planet, from behind Zee's ear, before returning it to his pouch, and then placing the package of crackers and the two special ones in beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there anything else I should know about my new place of employment, or should do I know enough not to get myself in trouble?\" asked Amadeus, having asked all the questions that he found important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more thing. Office social policy. You are allowed to kill your coworkers at Herd Thinners, however it is frowned upon as inefficient, as well as bad manners, so please restrain that violent streak of your's and just knock fellow employees out for now. I am sure that after two or three concussions they will learn that you do not like to be bothered,\" warned Zee, and Amadeus started at this little bit of information, filing it away for later use. Before he could inquire anything else a shuffling noise came from somewhere down the hall that lead to the bedrooms, and out of that hall came Lindesfare and Fenton, the later holding a suitcase that was almost the size of the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all packed, and we have to get flying if we want to make it back to Beige before sunup, so we'll see you two this weekend, alright?\" asked Lindesfare as the two stepped through the livingroom towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. Have a safe flight,\" said Amadeus as the two literally flew out the door towards a far off destination. Truly alone now except for Tree the two brothers took time to reminisce about their lives, and how they came to be where they were. At one point Zee remarked that he hoped his children were doing okay, prompting a startled sound from the local speaker, forcing Amadeus and Zee to explain that Zee's body was as real as anyone's, and had the same reproductive organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth Zee had been married nine times in his four hundred years of life, and had literally hundreds of children of which he was the mother or father, depending on which gender he happened to be in that particular relationship. This also caused Tree to ask Amadeus about his own love life, which was a bit of a conversation stopper as it turned out that unlike his \u2018little' brother, Amadeus had never found a woman or man whom he loved enough to have kids with, though that was due more to his devotion to the Combine military, which had kept him busy most of his life, giving him little time to find a soul mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the three discovered that they'd been discussing the lives of the two extraterrestrials for well over four hours, and that on the horizon the sun was just rising. Zee, who had made the travel arrangements the night before, informed Amadeus that Kell would be stopping by Tree on her way to dropping off Rudy, Fiona, and Bruno at school, but that if he wanted to he could make his way over to the Dewclaw home if he wanted to, as Zee would have to be going their now anyway to do his own job.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll come with you. I'd like to get a look at this areas morning habits anyway. Sociologically, I think the walk over will prove quite illuminating,\" said Amadeus, prompting Zee to roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are trying to act smart again, are you not?\" asked Zee, and Amadeus smiled innocently at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I do that?\" he said, his tone full of sarcasm. Zee didn't bother to respond to his brother's attempt at childishness. After all, lost as they were on a planet full of non-humans, Amadeus needed every boost to his spirits he could get. Shaking his head in a manner that should his annoyance Zee turned his head towards one of the speakers as the two made for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tree, we will be leaving now. If all goes well I will be back in a few minutes to rewire the server,\" Zee told the sentient plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have a good day,\" responded Tree, and Amadeus assured her it would be one to remember, no matter what happened. What he meant by this, neither Tree nor Zee knew, but Zee knew Amadeus well enough to be slightly worried about the statement. Trying his best to ignore the implications, Zee opened the front door and led the way outside into the strange new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not too strange anymore. Both had spent the previous day about in this odd place, and the two had learned much in their own way. Amadeus' knowledge consisted of what he had learned of the culture from the odd family he'd spent the day getting to know, while Zee's consisted of actual experience out among the daily workings of the city in which they had found themselves citizens of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough both pieces of knowledge were different, together they gave the two enough understanding to make their way in the odd culture. Walking along the now familiar path towards the Dewclaw home Zee found the sight of the nocturnals going into sleep, and the diurnals awaking to be infinitely fascinating. Such a mixture of human and alien concepts, not unlike the Combine or any of the other multidimensional governments, and yet it still had its own unique characteristics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookie there,\" said Amadeus, pointing towards a lark. The bird, famous for being a musical animal, was actually clearing his throat, before chirping into the early morning sun. Amadeus, having seen the animals on other Combine worlds, was still entranced by the song it sung, though this one was probably just a bit more complex than the ones he'd heard as it was born from a sentient mind mixed with instincts, rather than instincts alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite lovely, but I do not think you should be staring or pointing. I believe that even here that qualifies as rude, and we do not want to be rude, do we?\" asked Zee, trying to remind Amadeus of incidents in the past where he'd been in a bit of trouble due to similar actions. Sentients, for the most part, did not like people singling them out as oddities, though for Amadeus, being odd was a matter of pride, so he rarely saw the problem in the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the hint was enough for even him, and the two continued down the path without further pointing, though Amadeus' eyes shot about much like a child's, finding each and every sight to be beautiful, and for an instant Zee wished he could share in that wonder, which most humans even lost by the time they wore a tenth of Amadeus' age. His brother though, never let go of that, and he always seemed to find something to brighten his eyes with wonder over every horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking those thoughts made the walk go a little faster than it had the previous evening, and all too soon the two extraterrestrials found themselves at the familiar driveway of their adoptive family. Well, adoptive of Zee at least, as he was now listed in the records as a real part of the odd mishmash of species that was considered the Dewclaw family. Amadeus on the other hand was just an oddity that was tagging along behind, though he still held out a bit of hope that he could make a small niche for himself in the planet's culture, at least until the Combine came and took him back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get this day started,\" said Amadeus dejectedly. Interested as he was in the planet and its culture he didn't really wasn't too into getting a job. Having been a military man for the majority of his life, he was no stranger to working, but even though his job would involve the excitement of a hunt, he expected it to be as mind numbingly boring as laying siege to an enemy fortress. Knocking on the door he heard the hollow booms as the knelling of a bell, and when it opened he beheld a sight that probably belonged somewhere on the tenth level of Dante's Inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Zee,\" said Kell, yawning as she did. Obviously having just awoken, her blue hair was slightly askew, though it did look like she had brushed it at least for a little while. She motioned for the two newcomer to enter, and found most of the household, including the grandmother wolf, Kevin, and Rudy gathered around a table eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Amadeus was going to wait at Tree for me to pick him up,\" commented Kell as she walked with the two back over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed he would, but he decided to come here with me,\" responded Zee as he took up position in a nearby corner, leaning against a wall. Amadeus meanwhile walked up behind Kell and withdrew her seat from the table, and then helped her to move forward once she was seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to imposition my boss on the first day, so I came to you rather than making you come to me,\" explained Amadeus, though that was only one of a hundred different reasons he had for coming with Zee to the Dewclaw home, another of which being to see how they ate their meals as smaller groups, rather than the large gathering of last night. It turned out manners were pretty much the same in both situations, violent in the case of predators, and slow and steady in the case of herbivores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's nice of you,\" said Kell as she tore into her food again. Amadeus, having kept his face pleasant since seeing her, did not bat an eyebrow at the sight, though it disturbed some primitive part of his mind that told him to run from the sight of flashing teeth and tearing claws. Fighting those urges he smiled in such a way that hid his teeth, which among most cultures like the one he now found himself was a sign of aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, he is a nice guy, when he tries to be anyway,\" commented Zee, more to Amadeus than the Dewclaws, most of whom weren't listening anyway. The two brothers stared at each other across the room, each seeming to be lost in thoughts of the other. The meal, luckily, lasted only a few minutes longer, and when Kell took the dishes back into the kitchen the others dispersed to do their morning tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two newcomers, having no tasks, simply walked into the livingroom and took up positions similar to those they'd had around the table, awaiting whatever would come. They didn't have to wait long, as it was mere moments before the door opened, and together entered another group of people, this one consisting of Fiona, her parents, and stepparents, as well as Bruno and Corrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" said Danielle as she noticed Amadeus and Zee standing in the living room. Amadeus nodded and mumbled something that could have been a good morning, or could have been something else entirely, in return. Whatever he said the group quickly broke up, many going to their jobs at Harelink, the home business run out of the Dewclaw home, at which Zee was now employed, while Fiona, Martha, and Danielle took seats on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was your first full night on Earth, Amadeus?\" asked Danielle, staring at the human, probably hoping to compare his experience to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was interesting, I'll say that. Zee and I built a gravity room inside Tree, which took a bit of the night up, then when I was trying to train Lindesfare gave us a bit of a scare when she crossed a safety field, but she wasn't hurt. After that she and Fenton went to pack their bags, and I assume they are back at their college by now,\" said Amadeus, summing up the evenings events as best he could. Finding little comparison between her memories and what Amadeus had just told her Danielle leaned back and nodded absentmindedly, though Fiona leaned forward, interest apparent on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a gravity room? I mean I think I can guess, but...\" she let the thought trail off, hoping for Amadeus to fill in the blank. Chuckling at a stray thought he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you probably can guess, cause it's just what it sounds like, a room where gravity is alterable at the touch of a button. It's a basic tech if you want to go at a good speed in the real universe after developing on a normal sized planet, though most Combine people mainly use the tech to train in high grav environments,\" explained Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well how high can you go up to? I mean, humans aren't really designed for high gravity, anymore than we are, right?\" asked Martha, the fox woman and mother of Fiona, who lived as a human for a period of days, and still remembered how vulnerable she'd felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, they are not designed for it, but adaptation is something humans do well, and the gravity rooms are no exception. Amadeus has proven capable of taking gravity levels about three hundred and twelve times Earth normal, though only in an environment suit due to the fact that air compresses at that pressure into a liquid, making it unbreathable,\" answered Zee offhandedly, as he usually did with information that surprised his hosts, which this piece did more than slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three hundred and twelve times Earth gravity? That's possible?\" this from Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is for someone from our type of civilization. Heck, from what I hear, the Unified Worlds Alliance has humans that can go up to four thousand or so, though I've never actually seen them do it,\" said Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if he can move around at that high a gravity, shouldn't he be nearly godlike in strength,\" commented Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally yes, I would be, but in order to prevent me from injuring myself or someone else in lower gravity environments I wear these,\" he said, and pulled at a piece of his suit, which was a uniform gray all over. His tug revealed that on his shoulders and hips he wore small bands that blended right into the suit when he didn't pull them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're called neural limiters, and they keep my strength at a level just below my ability to hurt myself in this gravity field,\" he explained to his hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how strong are you right now?\" asked Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at this time I could probably bench five hundred and sixty some odd pounds, though it would be quite a strain,\" said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about at maximum, without the limiters?\" queried Martha again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't know. I've never had to push myself to that limit, but I assume its several tons at least, after all I weigh just over two hundred in this environment, and that means I weigh over sixty thousand pounds at my gravity limit,\" said Amadeus, who now wondered like Martha just what his limit was, though he could think of no safe way to test it on the prim world he now found himself on, though vowed silently that he would find out when he got back to a Combine world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation would have continued had not Kell and Rudy emerged from the back of the house, both lugging packs. Rudy's was like the one Fiona had brought, a pack designed to carry various large books, while Kell's looked more like a business bag, designed to carry papers, folders, and other odds and ends that were part of any office environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well we're ready when you two are,\" said Kell as she entered the room, eyeing Fiona and Amadeus as well as a clock on the wall. Looking over his shoulder at the clock, Fiona started at the time, and then leaned over and kissed both Danielle and Martha on their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go, love you both,\" said Fiona, as she made for the door, followed close behind by Rudy. Kell and the other women looked after the pair with that look that females usually got when seeing a display of young love, though Zee had a similar expression on his face. Unlike his brother, Amadeus had never experienced life as a woman, though he had spent a week as one on a bet with Vivan Sekot, one of his old squad mates from his days in the Arrow Squadron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving found the life to be odd compared to his normal he switched back the instant he could, and pocketed three hundred grams of borash jelly, a honeylike biological byproduct of Vivan's own making. Seeing that he would get little understanding out of staring at the women and his brother, Amadeus soon followed after the two young ones, which prompted Kell to do likewise, wishing those that remained behind a nice day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting into the car Amadeus took the passenger side in the front section, seeing as the two younger individuals seated themselves in the rear together. Looking out the window he awaited the arrival of his hostess, whom he tried to think of as Alpha now. Oddly he looked back to find Bruno and Corrie standing in the doorway waving goodbye, yet according to his own memory of the previous day Bruno went to the same school as Fiona and Rudy, while Corrie worked with Kell at Herdthinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they not going to be traveling with us?\" asked Amadeus of the two in the rear, and Rudy shook his head, but refrained from giving any other answer to his question in explanation. Luckily Fiona seemed to sense the basis of the inquiry and was able to give Amadeus the requested information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Corrie can drive herself, thanks to a special license she got from Herdthinners, so she usually drives them. Heck a few years ago Rudy and I rode the bus, but thanks to Kell's new position as head of certain departments she has the extra time to take us in the morning,\" she explained to the out of town visitor, who nodded in understanding. A stray thought reminded him that without Jasmine and her games about Old Home Terra he would likely have had to ask what a bus was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in and of itself was not too suspicious an anomaly, as a lot of people created games set on an Earth of that type, as they were the most common Earth type you would find thanks to forces like the Progenitors and the Seeder Ships, which were constantly going about the multiverse, adding human DNA elements to base worlds. Hell, Amadeus' own Earth was likely a seeded world, though since it had been lost since long before the process of seeding was know there had been no way to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was however, highly suspicious that Jasmine's games had usually involved some form of anthromorphic entity in the plot. Often enough this had been the typical werewolf, or lycanthrope, with a human transforming into a beast, but many had also included creatures like his current carmates, true amalgams of human and animal DNA patterns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This could of course had been a reference to the Genesis Technologies of the Pre-Exodus era, yet their cultural fit so well with this new world that Amadeus had to wonder if Jasmine had not had some precognitive ability allowing her to see Amadeus falling into this situation. At that thought Amadeus shook his head to get the thoughts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not Jasmine had been aware of his current situation do to some ability was not an issue, as he had no way of contacting her or even his government. This meant that such thoughts had to take a back seat to the more important issues of survival and information gathering. After all The Vault Techs, while gone, still exerted an influence on this world, and he still had the problem of Yggdrasil to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to his knowledge of Old Home Terra history, while most of the \u2018Lost Technologies', including Tempus and Genesis stuff, had been inside the Vault at Exodus, the Final Solution tech called the Yggdrasil machine was not. That meant that it could still be on the planet somewhere, or under it, or over it, waiting to emerge and rip the universe to shreds with its unimaginable pow-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" said a voice breaking through his reverie, and Amadeus started, turning his head to find Kell looking at him with concern in her eyes. Shaking his head again to clear it Amadeus smiled and chuckled slightly, hoping to cast a nonchalant air on his musings, which he now realized had been quite evident in the way he'd been wringing his hands until they turned a nice bright shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, quite. I was just thinking about some things, and got lost for a moment inside my own head, thanks,\" he said, brushing away her concern. Luckily for Amadeus Kell thought the reason for his concern had a more mundane origin than the fate of the cosmos, and she nodded at him as she pulled the car out of the drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry. The first day at the office is the hardest. As long as you can survive that though, you're usually set for life,\" she told him, trying to ease his mind about his new job. At first Amadeus thought he should laugh at what he assumed was a joke, but then he remembered that a day at his new job really could end in death, something that had been decidedly uncommon in the games he'd played with Jasmine that had been set in this era.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will strive my utmost to survive it,\" he told hr, smiling again, and breathing an inner sigh of relief that she had not actually guessed his thoughts, at least one of the being that he should destroy the blasted planet, killing them all, and probably saving everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" came a sarcastic comment from the wolf boy in the back seat, followed swiftly by a yelp of pain as his girlfriend struck him on the shoulder. This was also followed a moment later by an chittering sound coming from inside Rudy's fur as some parasites moved around. Amadeus started slightly at the sound when he heard it, as it sounded much like the language of Vivan, who had been of insectile descent, though only on her father's side. Before he thought about it fully Amadeus made a similar clicking noise with his tongue, which solicited looks from everyone else in the car, as well as new clicks from the furs of both Fiona and Kell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he asked quizzically, his gazing going back to Fiona, who's fur erupted in a series of clicks that sounded threatening in their intonation. Amadeus then clicked twice, adding a finality that needed no translation to his speech, as everyone could hear it as a \u2018bring it on' kind of phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do I even want to know who you're talking to?\" asked Rudy as he looked at the human, pulling down his sunglasses to reveal his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, apparently you three are infested with a kind of parasite. I was unaware of this until one of them complained about Rudy being struck again, and throwing their home askew. I commented that maybe they shouldn't live on someone without permission, and they launched into a heated discussion about me knowing they're language. I find it odd that they seem to think you don't though,\" he commented to his companions, who stared at him blankly for a moment before anyone could respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's because we can't. No one can speak flea, at least no one I've ever heard of. People have tried of course, but most of those end up giving up halfway through because of the itching involved in such project,\" Fiona answered at last, and Amadeus nodded in understanding, before he let loose a flurry of clicking sounds that were soon returned by the fleas in Fiona's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, now that I know you can't speak they're language, I've been instructed that I can't teach it to you, on the punishment of a very itchy death. I was forced to apologize for my last comment to, as I had assumed you would speak the language of a species you allow to inhabit your bodies,\" Amadeus said, explaining his early, harsh clicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not exactly a choice. Fleas happen, and we just have to deal with them. The occasional flea dip helps though,\" this comment, by Rudy of course, solicited a round of furious clicking from within his fur, but Amadeus refrained from answering instead turning back to face forward after turning in his seat to stare at Rudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on your own for that one, my tiny friends,\" he said, this time in English, and then what could only be the insect equivalent of a raspberry could be heard from Rudy's fur, before the car was silent again, this time because Kell was coming to a stop in front of the school. She obviously was trying her best to ignore everything she'd just been told or overheard, and turned back towards the two in her backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you two be good today, and try not to eat anyone we know,\" she said as the two got out of the car, both muttering that they would try, even as they eyed the odd human who rode in the passenger seat. When they were both out the door Kell took off again towards the end of town where Amadeus assumed the Herdthinners main office was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really speak flea?\" she asked, trying to make conversation, though also having an interest in just what else her companion could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. The language I'm speaking is ::Series of musical whistles:: a friend of mine spoke it as her father's native tongue, and being close to her I sort of picked it up during our association,\" explained, and Kell nodded, accepting this explanation more easily than she probably would have had she not just heard him do it with her own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many other languages do you speak, if I may ask?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I speak about nine-hundred-twenty-three pure languages and several thousand dialects of those, would you like a tally of them, Alpha?\" he asked pleasantly, and Kell was about to respond in the negative when that last word hit her like a ton of bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what did you call me?\" she demanded, recovering after veering sharply to the left when she turned to face Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called you my Alpha. Is that not that designation of a pack leader on this planet?\" he asked, and Kell didn't respond for a moment, gathering her own thoughts on the subject before deciding what the best answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Alpha is a pack leader, but I didn't think that humans, well Danielle never used any of those kinds of terms, and so I assumed that you wouldn't,\" she said, admitting her own prejudgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You still think of Danielle and myself as coming from the same kind of culture, which I can assure you we don't. Her's is as different from mine, as it is from your's. I do however have knowledge of culture's similar to both of your's which allows me a bit of insight into thought. And before you ask, you are not the first person I've called Alpha, as Zee's brother-in-law, a Veraxan named Krex, demanded it of me. I obliged him because of Zee, and only because of Zee. You however, being my teacher in local hunting ways, deserve at least that much respect from me,\" he told her, and she didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the drive there was a hanging silence as they made their way through the traffic of the city to the office where Kell, and now Amadeus, worked. Observing the piloting technique Amadeus was confident he would be able to control a craft like the one in which he now rode, though he knew Zee didn't want him even trying such a thing at this time, and for his brother's sake he would refrain from operating such a vehicle, except in dire circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last they did arrive at the building that displayed the title of the company on the side, which Amadeus found slightly odd for an association of hunters, who would under normal circumstances prefer to remain anonymous, but then, he doubted they could have hidden it well anyway. Getting out of the car he slammed the door shut, and walked with Kell toward the big double doors that would allow him entry into his new life. The instant he step through the doors he was assaulted by the color white in the form of....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everywhere around Amadeus was a city, like some of the ones he'd seen playing the games with Jasmine, the ones set near the last age of the old Homeworld. The landscape, familiar as it was, was populated with creatures that simply didn't fit. The things were staring at the human who had fallen from a hole in the sky, some with curiosity, and others with hatred directed at any intruder into the natural flow of their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so home this isn't,\" commented Amadeus to himself, looking around the city and finding a large number of the local creatures to be bipedal humanoids for the most part, with two arms and legs, though various other forms including what looked like huge insects had either multiple legs or arms, or were walking on all fours. Each one stirred memories buried deep within Amadeus, memories of the games he'd played with Jasmine that had been set on Old Home Terra, and the myriad lifeforms he'd seen that had lived there. Every creature that he could see had some root of a one of those long lost species, though each one was much more human in form than anything he'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try talking with them. At least see if they know what planet this is,\" he told himself, stepping forward, to the obvious dismay of some as they backed up. Intriguingly, he noticed that it was only those who seemed to have been based off herbivorous species who backed up when he got closer, while those who ate more than plants seemed to puff up, as f expecting him to attack at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Amadeus recalled he was wearing the fur cloak from his game with Jasmine, and looking at the blood stain on the front he had to admit he must have been an odd sight to those in front of him. Holding up his hand to indicate that he needed a moment, which surprisingly the anthromorpic population seemed to understand, Amadeus undid the belt clasp that held the cloak to him and shouldered it off before reaching up to his neck and peeling back the connector for the helmet, and then throwing both fur and metal mesh helm to the ground he stood before the throng of onlooking creatures as a human, though wearing the gray, polymer fiber suit which was common to the Combine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba Wee Grana Weep Mini Bong,\" he said to the crowd, holding up his hands to show he bore no ill will towards them, despite the fact that he was armed. The universal greeting, something used in first contact situations where one is at a disadvantage to the alien race, was designed to throw the new contact off while the contacter, in this case Amadeus, used the time to collect his thoughts and figure out exactly what he was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting his thoughts Amadeus finally began to notice that the cars and vehicles that had probably been in motion only seconds before his arrival were now stopped dead in their tracks, and that despite the fact that the place around him looked like a city street he couldn't see a single light on in any of the nearby offices, which looked like dark foreboding tombs. Everyone else seemed as baffled by the lack of activity as he himself, though they obviously were willing to blame it all on the new comer who'd just fallen out of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Amadeus could guess that his entrance to the world really had resulted in the loss of local power. After all giant holes in the sky usually caused massive EMP fields, which had probably also had something to do with his Terminal's problems before he'd been sucked in, and the field had been strong enough to send a MultiDimensional Terminal for a loop then it probably flipped every circuit on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so my first impression is pretty bad, doesn't mean the natives won't be friendly and understanding,\" he said to himself quietly, just before a small explosion detonated from the crowd and a lead projectile flew right for him. Dodging the bullet which hadn't been all that well aimed in the first place Amadeus looked at the crowd to see someone emerging from it holding what looked like a small golden shield in a leather carrying case. It took him only a moment to realize that he was staring at a badge, and that the dogman holding the gun was the local constabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the ground. Now!\" shouted the creature, and Amadeus was startled to find that he understood that thing's language, which was exactly like the old American English he'd used when playing the games with Jasmine. That thought brought him back to his question of where exactly in the universe he was, and to the conclusion that he might not even be in his universe anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sir, I know this looks bad, but I thin if we talk this out we can come to some-Hey!\" shouted Amadeus, having walked towards the dogman, whom he now could place as being of the German shepard breed of dog, he reached out his hand, only to get shot at again. Luckily the bullet had been aimed for his shoulder, and the polymer mesh of his suit caused it to bounce off, but the impact still hurt, and Amadeus saw the dogman aim the next shot for his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the ground!\" ordered the dogman again, and this time Amadeus decided to forgo the attempts at contact, and took off as fast as his legs would carry him, which wasn't as fast as he would have liked thanks to the climbing boots which he still wore. The police dogman fired his entire clip at the fleeing human, but Amadeus was now wary of the bullets, turning to the side at every sound of a gunshot causing all the bullets to miss, though barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the city proved easier than Amadeus had suspected, but that was actually due to the fact that most of the inhabitants moved away from the strange looking man who'd fallen out of their sky just after the power went out. He didn't know whether to be glad that they weren't trying to kill him, or disappointed that no one was trying to talk to him and get his side of the story. Looking back over his shoulder Amadeus saw that his dogman of a police officer had friends, and they were all chasing after him, and they were all armed with the same small pistols as the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of stars,\" swore Amadeus as he ducked into one of the alleys that stood between the buildings of the downtown area. He had thought to run into an adjacent street and try to escape into one of the buildings, but his plan came up short when he found that the alley he'd entered dead ended after turning to the right, and he was now staring at a brick wall which kept him from going forward, while at the same time he could hear the impacts of his pursuers' feet on the alley floor coming up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped he had a few options that he could choose, the easiest of which was simply to give up and hope the planet he was on had some contact with the Combine that he hadn't been able to see on the street when he'd arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was to use the climbing boots to ascend the wall before him, though he'd be a slow moving target for the guns that the dogmen held, and he wasn't entirely certain the polymer mesh of his suit would hold off a steady spray of fire as easily as it had a single bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about for anything else Amadeus was pleased to find a door in one of the walls before him, which he could bust down even if it wasn't unlocked. The only problem being that he'd be trapped in the building exactly as he was now, only with even few options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option, and one he would not ever consider under normal circumstances, was to turn and face the police dogmen with all guns blazing. His Startec pistol was more than a match for their pathetic weapons. Of course, using his weapon was strictly forbidden by the Combine, as you were not supposed to use high tech weapons against primitives unless no other options remained. But he saw only a few other options, and they weren't exactly what he would call good ones. So what does he do?</span></div></div>",

Even if he got away from the officers, he didn't know where he was, and if someone saw him, the hunt would just start up again. 2. While he knew that he could easily kill the officers, if he somehow managed to get home, he'd be executed for murdering a bunch of, relatively, defenceless civilians. 3. He was lost, and didn't know how to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the officers entered the alley, he just slowly, and calmly, raised his arms and said, \"I surrender.\" At this, one of the officers asked, \"What? You figured out that it is usseless to run or something?\" \"Maybe it is,\" Amadeus said. \"And maybe it isn't. I know that I can easily scale these walls with very little problem. However, that would cause you to shoot me, and while my armor could survive your projectile weapons shooting at it, all it takes is one luck shot to the head to kill someone, and also, the force behind them might be enough to cause me internal damage. Also, I could easily take you one, and maybe even kill you, but, even if I somehow survived and got away, I'd be wanted for murder, and then, even if I got home, I'd be executed for it. Of course, the final problem is this, I'm lost, and even if I got out of the city, and eluded capture for whatever reason, I'd still be lost. So, all things being concidered, surrendering seems to be the wisest choice that I could make.\" \"Well in that case,\" the officer said. \"Hands on your head and turn around!\" \"Sounds reasonable enough,\" Amadeus said, as he did as he was told. He felt the officer grab his wrist, and pull it to his back, and the snap of cold metal handcuffs. \"I doubt you'd get out of this, alien,\" the officer said, as he grabbed his other wrist and cuffed it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus chuckled, as he pulled his wrists apart, suripticiously, straining the links on the cuffs. \"Buddy, if I tried to escape,\" he said. \"These restraints alone wouldn't prevent me from getting my hands free. After all, I trained to fight in gravity that is about three hundred times that of this planet. In fact, the one reason that I really didn't try to escape is because my armor has a limiter on how much of my strength can be used, so that I don't hurt myself or someone else by accident.\" \"Oh really,\" the officer said, with sarcasim in his voice. \"You don't look like much of a threat to me. You have no fangs, no claws, or anything else that you can use, especially once I take this belt off of you.\" \"Be my guest,\" Amadeus said. \"Just don't try to mess with my pistol. If someone other than me tries to use it, unless I say that you can, it will give the person a massive electrical shock, and can cause one to have a heart attack. Also, I'd advise you to be careful with Zee, the guy gets cranky when even I try to wake him up.\" \"And what would this 'Zee' be?\" \"Well, I guess you could call him a highly advanced android, if you know what robots are,\" Amadeus said, as he looked at his friend, who was basically asleep, and in the shape of a PDA-like device. \"And what do you use this ax for?\" the officer asked. \"I doubt it's for whittleing.\" \"You're right on that,\" Amadeus said, as the officers started to lead him to a squad car. \"But it certainally is handy for survival, especially since ones made of stone ensured my kind's early survival, and their decendants improved upon it, making it more efficiant, more durible, and more useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, after his fingerprints and photograph had been taken, and entered into the system, he was taken to a holding cell that had...</span></div></div>",

They apeared to be in their late twenties to early forties, and despite being of different races, Amadeus saw that they were harden criminals, who could do almost anything to the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the officer opened the door, all five looked at him, as the officer took the cuffs off of him. The four men each had a look that said, \"Interesting looking creature. He'll be fun to, play, with.\" The boy's eyes, on the other hand, seemed to pop out of his head, as if he was amazed to see him. \"Maybe he knows about humans,\" Amadeus thought, as he entered the cell, keeping an eye on the four men, and sat down on the bench that the boy was sitting at. \"Hey kid, is this your first time in prison?\" he asked, looking at the four rough men, watching every move they made. \"Y-y-yah, but I'm innoscent,\" the boy said. \"Let me guess, some storeclerk saw you with some candy in your pocket, or some such thing, and claims that you are a shoplifter,\" Amadeus said, as he carefully looked at the boy. He appeared to be about sixteen years old, looked like a humanoid wolf, had a green shirt with a hood, and a red hat on his head. \"If only it was that,\" the boy said. \"The police say that I chased one of their squad cars, but I didn't do it. I told them that it was someone else, as I had seen who did it, but when the car came back around, I was the only teenaged wolf with a green hoodie and red hat on the block.\" At this, Amadeus looked at the boy and said, \"Well, I don't know how serious of a crime that chasing a police car is, but, I believe you kid.\" \"Do you?\" the boy asked, his eyes widening. \"Yep,\" Amadeus said. \"Why do you say that?\" the kid asked. \"Your eyes tell me that you speak the truth,\" Amadeus said. \"You look into a man's eyes and you will see their whole life. For instance, I can tell that your family cares for you, and will come to pick you up soon.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"No real parent would leave their child in a cell,\" Amadeus said, as he noticed the four grown men start to come over. \"Ah, the freak is trying to cheer the puppy up,\" the biggest one, a tiger type creature, said. \"Maybe he can help cheer us up to.\" At this, the other three started to chuckle evily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Amadeus also started to chuckle. \"What's so funny?\" the leader of the men said. \"Only the fact that the four of you, against me, just isn't fair,\" Amadeus said, as he stood up. \"How about two on one, if you include the puppy?\" The tiger asked, with an evil smile. \"No,\" Amadeus said. \"Just the four of you, against me.\" \"Oh, you're a cocky one,\" the tiger said, as he and the other three cracked their knuckles, and threw the first punch. However, Amadeus grabbed the man's fist, and bent it backwards, breaking his wrist. He then punched the second, a wolf, like the kid, in the stomach, causing him to double over, kicked the third, a red fox, in between the legs, also causing him excruciating agony, and head-butted the forth, a rinoe like person, knocking him unconsius. He then looked at the tiger, who was clutching his wrist. \"What are you?\" the man asked, with agony in his voice. At this, Amadeus grabbed his chin, as if deep in thought. \"Hmmm. What am I?\" he asked out loud. \"Oh, that's right, I'm a killer, a trained killer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed the man by this shirt colar, lifted him up, and said, \"Look into my eyes buddy. I am Amadeus Orman, I am a soilder, trained from birth, in the art of killing. I have killed things that make most men run home crying for their mothers. Someone like you is nothing compared to some of the things I've had to face.\" With that, he threw the man, causing him to hit the brick wall, knocking him out. Then, he picked the four up, and set them on the bench across from him and the kid. Then, he started to slap his hands, as if ridding them of something unplesant, and sat back down next to the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" the boy asked, as he looked at him. \"Like I told him,\" Amadeus said, pointing at the tiger. \"I'm a trained soldier.\" \"How did you beat them though?\" \"You look into someone's eyes, not only do you see their whole life, you will see every move that they will make before they even make it.\" \"Wow! You can really do that?\" \"Yep, it just takes time. Now, you might want to be careful about what you say. I've got a funny feeling, one that says that someone is about to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shows up?</span></div></div>",

At the sight of them, the wolf child rushed over to them, and the wolf gave him a hug, although when the rabbit tried to give him one, his arms couldn't quite fit between the bars, so he settled for putting his hands on the kid's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Kevin, man am I glad to see you,\" the boy said, wagging his tail, in a manner that Amadeus had no problems understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rudy,\" the mother wolf said. \"We would of been here sooner, but with the blackout, traffic was crowded beyond belief.\" Her own tail was also wagging in the same way as the kid's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus just chuckled, as he sat in his corner, out of sight from the two adults, who were comforting their son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keven smiled at his stepson, glad that he was okay, and no one had harmed him while he had been in the holding cell, he heard a chuckle coming from inside the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked up, he saw four men, two of which were groaning in pain, from injuries of some sort, and the other two seemed to have been knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed a fifth figure in the shadows, one that seemed to be watching them. \"Um, Rudy,\" he said, in a low voice. \"Did something happen before we showed up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Rudy looked at the figure, who said, in a male voice, \"Go ahead kid, you can tell your parents what those guiys tried to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Rudy tried to speak, he had trouble trying to form sentances. \"They, try to, attack, me. He, protected, me, from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Keven asked. \"Did those four men try to harm you and he protected you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Rudy nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeven then looked at his wife, Kell, and the two of them looked at the man. \"Why would you protect my baby?\" Kell asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been in a prison cell before madam,\" the man said. \"The more hardened criminals tend to abuse first timers, especially juviniles. I remember my first time. I'd been arested for murder, and thrown into a cell with several hardened criminals. Almost all of them, except for one, ganged up on me and started to beat me. My eyes were punched, my nose broken, shoulder dislocated, leg broken, and some of my fingers were busted, before the one who wasn't trying to harm me, finally pulled the others off of me and beat the living daylights out of them. When I asked him why he saved my life, he pointed at his throat, revealing a scar across where his voice box would of been located, which told me he couldn't speak. However, he did have a recording device, and he played a sound bite from it, which told me why he did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me mister,\" Kell said. \"How can I repay you for protecting my son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the man chuckled and said, \"Let me tell you, as that man told me.\" With that, he cleared his throat, and said, in a clear voice, with a tune to it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't owe me a thing.<br>\r\nI've been there too.<br>\r\nBut someone once, helped me out,<br>\r\nJust as I'm helping you.<br>\r\nBut if you really want to pay me back,<br>\r\nHere's what you do.<br>\r\nDon't let the chain of love, go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Don't know the artist's name, but I think the song is called \"Don't let the Chain of love go to waste\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's beautiful,\" Kell said, a tear rolling down her cheak. \"Is there more to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes there is,\" the man said, sitting up. \"It's the chorus of a song. It starts with a woman parked on the side of the road, because her vehical broke down, and everyone keeps on passing her, untill this guy, in a beat-up vehical, pulls over to the side of the road, and fixes it up. When the woman tries to pay him, he tells her the chorus, that his name was Joe, and that he had also been in trouble, but someone had helped him and he was just retuirning the favor, and left. The woman, who was in shock at the man's kind act of charity, drives to a diner and orders a coffee and sandwich. However, the waitress catches her eyes, as the woman was several months pregnant, and seemed to have some sort of troubles with something. Well, when the woman was getting change for her, as she had given her a large bill, that was almost twenty times more than the price of the coffee and sandwich, she wrote a note on a napkin, what the man had told her earlier that day, and left without getting her change. The waitress was amazed at the woman's generousity, and when she got off of work, and went home, she went to her husband, who was asleep in bed, that things would be alright. Then, she said the final words of the song, 'I love you, Joe.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me get this straight,\" Keven said. \"The man who helped the woman out was the husband of the waitress that the woman had left the money for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know,\" the man said. \"However, it is a fair assumption to make. Needless to say, it sort of explains why I hepled your son out. I was returning a favor of sorts, one that I owed to the man who had saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is there a real way that we can pay you back?\" Keven asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could use some help in getting out, leagelly of course,\" the man said. \"Of course, it would help if I knew what I was being charged with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't they tell you when they arrested you?\" Kell asked, looking at the man who had protected her son out of the kindness of his heart. \"It's in their regulations to inform one of their rights, as well as what they were being charged with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they must think that I don't have any then,\" the man said, laying out on the bench, revealing that he had some weird looking paws (Amadeus's boots), and that his fur was completly covered with clothing. \"After all, I'm what you would call an alien I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, he's a human,\" Rudy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Keven and Kell looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't Aura's cousin say that the portal to the human world was blocked?\" Keven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, but you know about what happened with your sister's counterpart,\" Kell said. \"There was a storm and she came through. He might of come through during the blackout, just like she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Keven looked at the man, who had stood up and walked into the light where he could be seen, revealing that he was a human, one with a strange outfit, that looked like a mixture of wolf fur and military uniform, with a large green stain on it. \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"And how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Amadeus Orman, a soldier in the Combine military,\" the man said. \"As for how I got here, while I don't know exactly how I got here, I was heading home after playing some games with my buddies when there was a blackout and a portal opened up and pulled me through to your world. Needless to say, I'm kind of lost to the rest of the Combine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do owe you,\" Keven said. \"And besides, unless you've been charged with a crime, the police can't hold you for more than twenty-four hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you father is a criminal, you would know about that,\" Kell said, as she looked at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Keven chuckled and said, \"For once, my father's choice of career helps someone out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Amadeus was by the reclaiming booth, getting the things that the police had confiscated from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" he said. \"Pistol, check. Ax, check. Belt, check. Zee, triple check, can't wait until you decide to wake up buddy. About the only thing missing is my helmet.\" At this, a clang is heard. \"We were making sure that it did come from someone's head,\" the officer said, as Amadeus started to walk towards the front of the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the front, Amadeus saw that the Dewclaws were waiting for him. Keven had told the prison officials that holding a man who was not imformed of his rights was against the law and that the man would file charges of unlawful arrest unless he was released, immediatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mr. Dewclaw,\" Amadeus said, as he shook the rabbit's left hand, which the man had offered. \"While I know that I could of broken out on my own, I wasn't in the mood for a man hunt, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Keven just chuckled and said, \"Well, be lucky that you didn't. When it comes to hunting, my wife is the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kell said, \"Oh, you always know what to say to make me happy.\" With that, she kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Amadeus said. \"Do you have a place that I could stay? After all, something tells me that the motels, or hotels, or whatever, won't let me check in, nor would they accept my money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could use our daughter's old room,\" Keven said, as he scratched the back of his head. \"When she's not in collage, Lindesfare is at her boyfriend's house, Tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'd settle for sleeping on the couch,\" Amadeus said, as the four walked to the door to find that......</span></div></div>",

While I don't know what they are like here, where I am from, everytime something happens, they swarm like, now what did my friend say that those birds that ate carion were called, oh yah, vultures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, they are worse than that,\" Kell said. \"After all, Herdthinners employs several of them to clean up what the hunters miss during their hunts. In fact, I'm friends with a few of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well either way, I am not showing my face, at least not like this,\" Amadeus said, as he guestured towards the green stain on his uniform, and his furless face, and his hands, which had no claws to speak of. \"Of course, I can just clean my outfit, put my helmat on, and put my hands in my pockets, and walk out, without attracting much attention, I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you worried about your face and fur?\" Rudy asked. \"You could just beat them like you did those four men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, being able to do something and doing it are two different things,\" Amadeus said, as he shook his head, looking at the boy. \"For one thing, I could of easily killed those four men, but I didn't. I held back on purpose, because I do not want to just kill someone who stood no chance against me. Those reporters are the same, I can't just beat them up, because they are not a threat to me. However, I've got to limit my exposer on this world, and that means disguising my appearance to a degree, because there are certain rules that I have to follow in situations like this. 1. Limit interferance in a society's culture as much as possible. 2. Don't kill anyone, unless they are a threat to your life. 3. Try to make contact with Combine forces. 4. If contact with Combine is impossible, assimilate into the culture as best as you can. 5. Don't give out top secret information about the Combine to anyone, not even those you trust. 6. Avoid using technology that is beyond the culture's capability to produce, unless it is something that they could possibly make. 7. Stay near where you arrived, unless the area is too dangerous to remain near, for any reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whow, so many rules,\" Rudy said, as he looked at the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, those are the basic ones kid,\" Amadeus said. \"In any case, I best clean myself off, put my helmat on, and hope for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Katty Blackfur reporting for Channle Two News,\" said a female black cat. \"Various sources say that during the blackout some sort of portal opened in the heart of the city of Domain. Some of these sources claim that an alien came through the portal and tried to talk to them before the police arrived and fired at the creature. Eyewitnesses claim that the police chased the creature to an alleyway, where it is said that the creature gave itself up without a fight and was taken to the station. Needless to say, the police can only confirm that they arrested a suspicious looking man who had fled the area. Other than that, they are not saying a word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opens, but just as the reporters start to rush forward, all that comes out is a wolf with his hands in his pockets, and a disheveled uniform. \"Hey mister,\" Katty Blackfur said, as she brought the mike near the man. \"Given that you just came out of the police station, perhaps you can answer a few questions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want to know?\" the man asked, with a slight slur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you confirm if the police have an alien in their custady?\" Katty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can not confim that miss,\" the man said, as he walked past her, keeping his head low, and walking with a bit of a drunken stuper, and bumping into a few of the reporters and cameramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the Dewclaws come out, after telling Rudy to keep quiet about Amadeus. When the reporters asked Keven and Kell what they had seen, they said that they had seen nothing unusual, which meant nothing, especially since a rabbit marrying a wolf was unusual enough. However, one of the reporters asked Rudy if he'd seen anything unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion, does Rudy keep his mouth shut, or does he say something?</span></div></div>",

The man's act was very convincing, and even his breath smelled like he'd been drinking, due to a jell filled capsule that he'd put in his mouth and caused to burst, after he'd cleaned his outfit of the green bloodlike stain on his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mom, Keven, can we go home,\" he said. \"I don't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kell looked at her son, she noticed that he was indead pale, as if he was sick. However, she knew that he was nervous, both because he'd just been in a holding cell, and because he didn't want to betray the trust of the man who'd saved his life and give him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, we better get you home,\" she said, as she pick her son up, and started carrying him to the car, an easy task concidering she'd taken down things larger than her son while hunting at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeven then looked at Amadeus, who had just stumbled into yet another cameraman. If he didn't know better, he would of thought that the man really was drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sir,\" he said, walking up to him. \"Would you like a lift? You look like you could use one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyssh, thankshhh,\" Amadeus said, as he seemed to look at the rabbit, getting ready to fall upon his feet again. \"Your a nicssshe, Sholdier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Keven put one of the man's arms around his neck and started to carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arn't you going a little far with the drunken soldier act?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One could,\" Amadeus said, in a low voice that was barely audible, even to Keven's sensitive ears. \"However, I've had to deal with some of my comrades when they got drunk, and this is how they tended to act when they were sobering up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah well, you better do something about you breath,\" Keven said, turning his head away to a degree. \"Most people tend to have very sensitive noses around here, including my wife and stepson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that,\" Amadeus said, as he leaned on the man's shoulder. \"I've got a couple of capsules that will make my breath smell like peppermint or spearmint, or some type of mint at any rate. Very useful when there is a lovely woman some place and I had forgotten to brush my teeth that day. After all, one wants to leave the ladies with a good first impression, so they will ask you out in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Keven chuckled and said, \"Your right on that. I remember when I first met Kell. She didn't know if she wanted to have me for dinner, or FOR DINNER, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they all,\" Amadeus said, with a chuckle of his own. \"While I've never been at risk of being put on the menue, as it were, I dated a woman who was either a nice person to chat with, or someone who makes a murderer look like saint in comparison, because she was two people in one, seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, when Keven opened up the door to the back of his car and helped the man get in, and start to drive away, Amadeus reached pulled his one hand out of his pocket and put a capsule in his mouth and bit down, causing his breath to smell like mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" he said. \"The scent of alcohol gives me a bit of a headache, especially given the fact that I've got this helmat on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you take it off now?\" Keven asked, looking in the mirror. \"I doubt that anyone would get a clear shot of you at this distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right,\" Amadeus said, as he looked behind them. \"I'd just prefer to be on the safe side until we reach your home. After all, sometimes the moment that you let your guard down, turns into the last moment of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal experiance I take,\" Keven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Amadeus said, with a slow nod. \"I remember one night when me and some of my comrades were sitting around a campfire, swapping stories, when next thing I knew, a sniper's bullit took the lives of the guy next to me, and the fella across from him. I tell you, being that close to death makes you aprectate life, even when you think you are having the worst day of your life, because you could of been killed instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your whole species like that?\" Rudy asked, his eyes widening when he heard what the man who had saved his life had said. \"Killing each other that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on who you ask,\" Amadeus said. \"Some say that we are a peaceful race, who only fight when necesary, and others argue that we are the most violent race in existance, who take great pleasure in killing each other, and others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's a question,\" Kell said, looking at him. \"When you said that you'd been arrested for murder when you were first taken to jail, did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus says.....</span></div></div>",

However, I got my revenge, and beat the man to within an inch of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you let the athourities take care of it?\" Kell asked, as she comforted her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The athourities would not of been able to do a thing, not even if he did it in front of the whole police department,\" Amadeus said, with a sigh. \"The man was the son of an ambassador, and as a result, he had diplomatic immunity from the law. But, as her brother, he had no such immunity from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?\" Rudy asked, wondering about the man who had just caused his stepfather to cry like the day his step-aunt died, saving the life of his girlfriend's, Fiona, father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back then, I was a miner, digging out rocks that held important metels  or stones that were valuable to the right people, as well as a construction worker, building houses for the miners and their families near the mines,\" Amadeus said. \"As a result, I was stronger than the average person who lived in the cities. This man, he'd never worked a day in his life. He'd had it all, money, servants, expensive, and massive, mansions, everything. Well that day, I made him work for his life. He thought that weight lifting and martial arts training would make him strong enough to beat a man, who'd been a miner and construction worker, who had nothing left to lose. Well, he was wrong. I broke every bone in his body with my hands, everything from his toes on up to his skull, and left him to die, just as he left my sister to die. After my sister's funeral, the police, who were decent enough to wait, arrested me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how did you get out of prison?\" Rudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After about a month in jail, a recruitment officer showed up, and looked at the evidance against me, which was obvious, because everyone knew that I was the one who did it, and told me that I had two choices, life in prison, or life in the service of the Combine military forces. I chose the military option, and I haven't looked back since,\" Amadeus said, as he turned his head to look out the window, to look up at the sky, where his home was, someplace way out there in space. \"That was about four hundred of your planet's years back, back when I was about twenty of this planet's years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how old did you say you were?\" Kell asked, as she and Keven, who had dried his tears by this time, turned to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that would depend on which planet I'm on,\" Amadeus said, still looking up at the sky, trying to locate where his home was. \"On some planets I'm over a thousand years old, on some I'm less than ten years old. On this planet, if my calculations are correct, I'm about four hundred and twenty years old, if I'm judging the distance this planet is from your sun correctly, and how far the horizian is, to mesure the curviture of this planet, and calculate both its size and the length of its day. If I am correct, it takes about twenty-four hours for this planet to make a revolution, and about three hundred sixty-five of its days for it to compleate one orbit around the sun, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes,\" Kell said, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that means that I'm about four hundred twenty years old on this planet,\" Amadeus said. \"Of course, I've got a funny feeling about this planet, a very funny feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would this feeling be?\" Rudy asked, as he knew that the man had been on the ball every time he'd said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm home,\" Amadeus said, as he looked at the wolf cub. \"And that is a feeling that I've never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case,\" Rudy said. \"That must mean that your planet must be like Earth then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you just say that this planet is Earth?\" Amadeus said, his eyes growing under his helmat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyah,\" Rudy said. \"What's so important about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus started to laugh. \"No wonder I feel like I'm home, I am home,\" he said, still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Keven asked, looking at the human that was disguised as a wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only humans will call a planet Earth,\" Amadeus said. \"Especially when they resemble the legandary home planet of humankind, a planet that had a surface that was about seventy percent water, and thirty percent land, had a yellow sun, with an atmosphere that was about seventy percent nitrigian, twenty-nine percent carbon-dioxide, and one percent trace amounts of other elements, had twenty-four hours in a day, and three hundred sixty-five days in a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it was so important to your kind, why did you leave it?\" Rudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if there is any thing about humans being the most destructive race out there, there is a grain of truth to that,\" Amadeus said. \"We ruined it, ruined it beyond recovery, or so we thought, until I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if what Danielle says is true,\" Rudy said, looking at the man. \"There is a parralel Earth out there, inhabited by humans, who live lives similar to our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, didn't Keven just say that Danielle died?\" Amadeus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Keven said, as he started the car back up, and got back on the road. \"But about a month later, she showed up, claiming that she was really a human that had been turned into a rabbit. At first we thought that it was just because of the shock of coming back from the dead or something, until her wedding to George, when we learned that she, and my stepdaughter, Lindesfare, really were humans from another world. Needless to say, it was a bit of a shock but, well, they are still family where it counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arn't they always,\" Amadeus said, with a smile under his helmat. \"Me and my comrads tend to call each other brothers and sisters, especially since we've been through the worst battles we've ever fought, survived things no one else has, and shed blood for each other. If that isn't a family, I don't know what is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes later, they pulled up at the Dewclaws' place, which was a large tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are,\" Keven said, as he opened up the door to let Amadeus out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not quite what I was expecting to see,\" the man said, as he looked at the tree, which had several windows carved into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he pointed over towards a mansion, which was across from an identical one, a short distance away from the first, and said, \"I was kind of expecting something more like that place over there, although a little smaller perhaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's Fiona's place,\" Rudy said. \"She owns both of them, living in one, and using the other as a bording house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus says...</span></div></div>",

In combat though, you are moving, shooting, ducking, punching, kicking, stabbing, biting, scratching, and whatnot, trying to kill your enemy before he kills you, and losing energy the whole time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you do it?\" Rudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You either stay awake, and live, or die in your sleep,\" Amadeus said, as Keven unlocked the door to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amadeus entered the house, uh, tree, Kell said, \"You must be hungry Mr. Orman. If you want, there is some leftover venison in the fridge if you want something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amadeus stopped, and asked, \"I'd hate to ask, but did it come from another person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technecally, yah, it did come from another person,\" Kell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while I'm not going to change your life style, but, unless they died of natural causes, such as sickness or old age, or were going to die anyways, or I was starving to death, I can't just eat the flesh of another sentiant being,\" Amadeus said. \"It's nothing against you or anything, it's a law, and regulation, that was created when the Combine allowed races that were not human to join the military, and some of them came from worlds where canibalism was practiced. So, I hope that you are not offended if I said no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Mr. Orman,\" Kell said. \"Of course we do have fruits and vegtables in the fridge, and in cans in the cuboards, as well as tofu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be alright,\" Amadeus said, as he took his helmat off. \"And please, either call me Amadeus, or Deus. The last person to actually say my last name was the man who raped and murdered my sister when I showed up at his house armed with a pickax handle and a length 4by4, that I'd made a hand grip for, that was about three feet long, both of which I used to take out his guards, before I killed him with my own two hands. After that, no one called me by my last name, unless it was for formalities, and I always asked them to not say my last name around me after that. That part of me died when my sister died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Kell said. \"I hope that I didn't offend you when I called you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't take offence at that,\" Amadeus said. \"Now being called a cocky glory-hog though, now them's fighting words in my book.\" Then, he started to laugh, which caused the others to chuckle, and smiled. Even if he was indeed lost to the rest of the Combine, at least he had a few friends, and was truely home, on the original home world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after a late supper, where Amadeus met Kell's mother, Elanor, and Keven and Kell's daughter, Coney, who looked like a rabbit, like her father, but she seemed to take after her mother, in terms of her diet, Amadeus was in a room, that had more that a few boxes, and a bed that had a few quills, trying to sleep, but his mind was wide awake. He, Amadeus Orman, had found the perverbial holy grail, the REAL EARTH. If nothing else, even if the Combine never found him, it was still something to be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he had one of his funny feelings, grabbed his pistol, and, after setting it to stun, started to walk around the hallways, looking for the thing that had disturbed his rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he saw someone enter through the window. The person was about a head shorter than him, and had his back to him, and had something in his hand, which he put into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus then walked up to him, and stuck the muzzle of the gun in the person's back, and said, \"Take your hand from your pocket, and whatever you have it, slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly pulled the object from his pocket, revealing it to be a.....</span></div></div>",

Can you get it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Amadeus said. \"I can do that. Just don't try anything foolish. I was trained by the best when it comes to close-quarters combat, and I can kill someone without trying, which means that I've got to be careful about how much strength I use if I want to take someone alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the rabbit seemed to chuckle. \"Were you in the army or some such thing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that,\" Amadeus said, as he got the man's lighter out of his pocket. \"Oh course, you could say that I'm on an extream version of shore leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he carefully lit the cigar, which the man put in his mouth, and started to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can I turn around?\" the man asked. \"After all, when I saw my son pull up to the driveway, with a third wolf in his car, one that I did not know, I came to check out my son's guest, and see who he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead,\" Amadeus said, as he put his pistol in his holster. \"After all, if it weren't for the fact that I haven't been able to see my kids in years, I'd want to know who was in the house with them myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Bentley Kindle (*Note* I got the name for Kevin's father off of wikipedia, under the part for Kevin and Kell) turned around, to look at what he had thought was a large wolf, he was shocked, and besides almost having a heart attack, he almost dropped his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" he said, as he repositioned his cigar. \"You were not what I was expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Amadeus said, with a bit of a chuckle. \"When most people hear of me, they assume that I'm some tall ass giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why is that?\" Pa Kindle, as he was also called, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand it even if I told you,\" Amadeus said, with a chuckle. \"But, I have taken on some rather hard to defeat beings and won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know this much,\" the rabbit said. \"Anyone who can sneak up behind me, without me noticing them, has my respect. I'll tell you what, don't tell my son that I was here in his house, and smoking at that, and I won't say a word about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd aprectate that,\" Amadeus said, as he offered his hand out. \"Let's shake on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Bentley said, as he shook the offered hairless paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, when he left out the window, he put his hand in his pocket, and found, instead of the pistol that he thought that he had taken from the creature, his own lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" he thought, as he looked back at the strange creature, who just twirled the pistol in front of him. \"He's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he just chuckled, as he walked back towards the mansion that he was staying at.

Then, he heard a few more voices, all of which seeming to be those of women. He pressed up against a corner, and pulled out a mirror from his pocket. \"Best spy tool I've ever used,\" he thought, as it could allow him to see what was around a corner without exposing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then carefully tilted it in a manner that would let him see beyond the corner, without creating a flash and giving himself away. He saw four women, including Kell. One was a gray furred cat-like creature, whom the others seemed to call Aby. A second was a red fox creature that Kell called Martha. The third one, however, was a rabbit that seemed to resemble Kevin, suggesting that they were siblings, who was holding onto what appeared to be a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that must be Danielle,\" Amadeus thought, as he put the mirror back into his pocket. \"Either way, I can't just walk out there into the kitchen.

He wove the strands together and put them into a hologram projector on his uniform, which would let him blend in with a native population of those who were not humans, providing that he had D.N.A. samples from several different individuals of the race that he wanted to disguise himself as, as it would create an algamation of the people whose hair/fur/skin/blood/whatever he had collected and feed into the projector, to create the illusion that he was one of them, down to his scent and taste even.*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Amadeus carefully walked back up the stairs to his room, he thought about his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could just put his helmat on, and put on some makeup to help disguise his features, but that wouldn't explain why his hands and feet were different, as well as the fact that he didn't have a tail. He also had the feeling that, even if Kell had told the others that he had been a soldier who had returned home after being wounded in combat, that wouldn't fully explaine everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis second option would be to just wait until they left, but he knew, from personal experiance, that when a woman was at another's house, it could be several hours before they left, especially if they didn't have to go to work that day. (The guy did once have a sister, and had been in several different relationships with various women over his 420 Earth years of living, remember.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his third option would be a slight violation of the regulation about using technology that was beyond the capabilities of a civilization. In his belt was a device that he could use to create a special hologram, one that could make him look like an entirely different species of people. He had used it before when he, and a few others, including Zee, had been given orders to spy on this one planet, to observe the people, and identify if they were a threat to the Combine, especially because of the fact that they were highly advanced, almost on par with the Combine, if not more. While the others of the group could change their shapes naturally, or in Zee's case, artificially, due to the way that he had been programed to take the shapes of those around him to help him blend in with those who were flesh and blood, Amadeus could not do that. However, a group of scientists had made a special holographic device. It could make someone look like an entirely different race than their natural one. All that it required to work was the DNA of the race that one wanted to appear to be. However, while it could work with the DNA from one person, it was best to get the DNA samples of several different individuals, as the person would look like a mixture of those whose DNA had been collected. After all, if one wanted to blend in, it was best if they didn't resemble someone especially enough to the point that there could be a case of mistaken identity. As a result, he was given the device, and after he tested it out with the help of some of friends, of several different races, he was ready to go. The mission was a success, and after returning home, the reports were given, and apropriate diplomatic actions were taken as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he had been allowed to keep the device, and he mostly used it to play tricks on some of his friends. Besides, it was also usefull to have when he did not want to be pursued by followers, fans, press, or otherwise. All that he had to do was head into something, like a store, go to a restroom, preferably one that was for several people to use at once, select the race that he wanted to be, and press the button. (Think of the Omnietrix from Ben Ten, only the size of a regular coat button, and you sort of get the idea, except without the watch's design on the being that he turns into.) After that, he could leave the place, and leave his pursuers behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got the device out of his belt, Amadeus looked at it. He then looked at his wolf helmat, and smiled. \"Well,\" he said. \"The regulations do state that if it is to keep an individual from being detected, anything can be used. Anyways, its not like I can use it to directly harm someone. Besides, if I use my helmat, and wear my wolf outfit underneath my uniform, the projector will fill in the blanks, as it were. After all, I did bump into a few of those reporters and cameramen who were wolves yesterday. If I have enough fur from enough individuals, on my uniform, it should be enough to make me look like a wolf, much like Rudy and Kell, to the point that that even they wouldn't know the difference, not to mention smell a bit like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took out some tape, and started to lift the fur from his uniform, and started to put them into the device. \"I hope that I have enough samples from at least seven different individuals,\" Amadeus thought, as he looked at the device to find that...</span></div></div>",

He could tell this as the device projected a hologram of the various people that had touched him, and lost some of their fur on him, whether it was from just a casual handshake, like with Kell, or if he had bumped into them, like the reporters and cameramen, or had hit them, like that wolf in the holding cell. In fact, he had enough samples from enough individuals, that he could make himself look like a canine of some sort, a feline of some sort, and a few others. However, when he looked at the sample that he got from Rudy, he found that the boy was half Grey Wolf, and half Red Fox. Of course, that was nothing compared to Coney, who was half Grey Wolf, and half rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Amadeus thought, as he remembered some of the things that he'd been told about Old Earth. One of those things was that while species that were closely related to each other could have offspring, like lions and tigers, such offspring was normally steril. However, something like a wolf and a rabbit could never have offspring, let alone offspring that could potentially reproduce. Heck, they were not even close to being homionid when humans left the planet. Of course, something could of done something, which could of done something, which caused the animals to become hominid-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the idea came to him, and it was a bit of a shock as well. Rudy had said something about the Danielle, that he had caught a glimps of, being a human from a parrelle world, one that had been turned into a rabbit after she had came through a portal. Perhaps something had showed up after humans had left, went back in time, and created an Earth where humans never evolved, but every other creature had been made sentiant, creating a parrelle universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" he thought, with a bit of a chuckle. \"If that is the truth, then someone screwed up on the whole predator/prey thing, and forgot to fix that when they gave sentiancy to every other animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done chuckling, he put his helmat, and his wolf outfit, on, pressed a code on the button, one that combined the features of the different wolves that he had samples from, put the device on his shoulder, in such a way that it wouldn't fall off or be noticed, and pressed a button. A flash of light enveloped him, which disappered fairly quickly, to the point trhat one would miss it if they were not looking, though it was bright enough to force anyone to shut their eyes until the light was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amadeus looked at his arms and hands, he deffinatly noticed the differance between this, and the makeshift disguse that he'd used yesterday. Yesterday, all that he had going for him was the helmat that looked like a wolf's head, and parts of his wolf outfit, which, while good for a brife intervale, was useless for a day to day disguise. This though, made him look like the real thing, and even his claws could become functional, when need be. He also felt a slight breeze behind him, right were a tail should be. Amadeus used his mirror to check it out, and it was confirmed that he indeed had a tail. \"I guess it will behave like the real thing,\" he thought, as he had accidently touched it with the mirror, and felt a slight shiver rush up his back, as if something cold had touched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he used the mirror to check out his face. All that even resembled his real face were his blue eyes. \"Not bad,\" he thought, as he opened his mouth, revealing his carnivorous-looking teeth, and stuck his tounge out, in a comical manner. \"Why, I'd fool my own mother, if she was still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around, to face the door he...</span></div></div>",

Of course, the more that I look like something, without using the device itself, the better the illusion works. For instance, if someone were to try and touch my face, as it is right now, while the device is on, they would quickly realize that I wasn't really a wolf, as their hand would sort of pass through my muzzle, as it were. With my helmat though, if they touched my face then, while it wouldn't exactly feel like a wolf's real face, if they asked why it was like that all I'd have to say was that my face was damaged, and had to be reconstructed, or is that something that is beyond what your planet's medical personel are capable of doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you talking about things like plastic surgury?\" the boy asked, somewhat puzzled by the terms that Amadeus used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could be something along the lines of what I am talking about,\" Amadeus said, as he saw the slight confussion in the boy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case,\" the boy said, with a sigh of relief. \"That is something that our doctors, especially specially trained ones, are capable of doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good,\" Amadeus said, as he put the helmat back on his head, put the device back on his shoulder, and pressed the button, making himself look like a wolf again. \"After all, I can't just walk out and show people what I really look like, concidering the fact that I am an alien, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Rudy said, giving Amadeus a sheepish grin, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pair got to the kitchen, Amadeus saw Kell just looking at him, as if she also didn't know who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mrs. Dewclaw,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus,\" she said, with a slightly forced chuckle. \"I almost didn't recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised what a good night's rest will do,\" Amadeus said, with a friendly smile. \"Almong with a bit of personal grooming, like brushing one's fur for instance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Kell, said, giving the man a slightly forced smile. \"If you want, there's coffee in the pot by the stove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just coffee beans and hot water?\" Amadeus asked, as he looked at the familliar looking container, with the familliar looking black liquid, and walked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Amadeus,\" Kell said, confidently. \"Concidering that I have some non-canine friends and family members, I make it plain, so that I'm not forced to make several pots for those of other diets, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aperciate it miss,\" Amadeus said, as he poured some into a cup. \"It's been a while since I've had a good cup of real coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" the rabbit, Danielle, asked, as she looked into his eyes, as if they seemed to be familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get the luxury of returning home while I was in the service miss,\" Amadeus said, as he sat down, and started to drink the warm liquid, which was quite good, and brought back fond memories of his father, before he died in a cave-in, with his mother dieing of a fever later on. \"Then again, I had no one to return to, no real family anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surly you must have family out there somewhere,\" the cat, Aby, said. \"After all, while most of my family lives on the other side of the country, with the exception of my one brother, who lives nearby, we keep in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only blood relations that I'd have an idea could be around would be my kids, many of which wouldn't even know that I exist,\" Amadeus said, in a low voice. \"It's kind of hard to raise a family when you are away for months at a time, and, while you are at it, throw the fact that I've never actually married any of their mothers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, everyone just looked at him, including Rudy, and a young female red fox, with really long ears, whom the boy had been about to leave the house with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" the girl asked. \"You have children, but you never married their MOTHERS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of them woudn't have worked out,\" Amadeus said, with a sigh. \"Some were fellow soldiers of the oposite gender, others were already married, some were just one-time things, and others, well, they didn't want a soldier for a husband I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were there any who came close?\" the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there was one,\" Amadeus said. \"In fact, I was all set to say 'I do' when a sniper, who had a vendeta against me for killing his brother or something, pulled the trigger on his rifle, and, well, let's just say that it is hard to marry a woman who has a hole through her head, and is missing most of her brain, which is splattered all over your dress uniform. It wasn't a pretty picture. After that, I could never think of asking another woman the question of whether or not she wanted to marry me. After that, when it came to the point where one would of normally asked the question, I'd ask my commanding officer to give me a transfer to another base, and that was the end of it, although I would ask some of my buddies to keep an eye on the woman, especially if they were pregnant. After that, if the child was indeed mine, as sometimes that buddy of mine fell for the woman, and married her, they'd send me a picture of the kid, and keep sending me one on their birthdays. But, except for being mine by blood, they are not my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Amadeus took a look at the child that Danielle was struggling with and saw that the child was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everywhere around Amadeus stood what looked like old style land vehicles he had driven in various Games, as well as one some of the Prim worlds he'd been the visitor on. These though didn't look like they were in any condition to run as some lacked wheels and seats, others engines, and still others were just empty chassises sitting in the dirt rusting away peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance a large sun, yellow and thus most likely H-class, burning hydrogen rather than any of the heavier gas elements. Sniffing at the air Amadeus was surprised by the lack of fumes that normally were associated with the industry required to create and run the vehicles around him, but inspection of one of the few engines showed him why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motors of the transports that still had them were designed to burn ethanol rather than a petroleum extract that was the usual mode of combustion in such engines. Taking a look at the interiors of the vehicles provided him with a clue as to the average size of the native population by gauging how much space the seats provided. He guessed them to be about hominid medium size, same as his own homo sapien race, which seemed about right as the planet's gravity felt to be about one grav, and that was a usual indication of the local biosphere's proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I don't have to deal with fifty foot monsters,\" said the extraterrestrial to himself, slamming his palm onto one of the derelicts before walking off into the rest of the yard. Oddly it looked like something recent had caused a shift in the piles of various debris, many still having small avalanches of car parts and other garbage rolling down their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked Amadeus took stock of his situation by running his hand over his belt. Pulling at the Startec pistol he discovered the weapon to still be in working order, or at least the gun thought itself to be. Whether it was or not he didn't want to test as he was pretty confident that the magnetic stream caused by the guns firing would rip a few of the errant metal objects out of place and possibly bury him in the cast offs of whatever civilization held sway on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next order of business was to grip the pouch on the other side of the belt, ripping it open and staring inside. Luckily most of his personal possessions seemed to have survived their trip through whatever it was that had drawn him into the sky intact, though the flute looked like it had gotten scratched in his rough landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can buff that out later,\" he commented, replacing the top of the pouch before putting his hands behind his back and withdrawing what looked to be a small PDA. Obviously the odd display of bits and pieces of various images was not what Amadeus had wanted to see as he swore violently in his native tongue smashing his palm into the side of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zee, you don't want to leave me here alone do you? Come on and pull yourself together,\" he ordered the device, and was answered by a series of whining pulses and beeps that ended in a steady high pitched tone. The screen then went blank for a moment before a timer appeared displaying that it would be a couple of cycles before the unit's logic string recovered from whatever it was that had thrown it for a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're never there when I need you, you know that?\" he told the device, getting only silence in answer as the timer continued to count down. Looking up at the sun and estimating the planet's rotation to be somewhere around sixteen cycles, though probably a little less. That time struck him as odd as it was the same rotation as Old Home Terra, the legendary home planet of humans, or at least it was according to the Games Jasmine designed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, she really believes it exists too,\" said Amadeus, remembering all the arguments he'd had with Jasmine about it. He was of the opinion that the planet was a myth, something dreamed up to give the people something to search for always. After all expeditions that were searching for the lost homeworld were launched everyday, and it always filled the people with hope that maybe they would find it this time, though they never did. After all you can't find something that isn't real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his thoughts Amadeus nearly missed the sound of footsteps as the approached. Not wanting to cause a panic just yet among the locals Amadeus decided quickly it would be best to hide, and so dove into one of the derelict vehicle frames, rolling into the back seat so that he could stare out of one of the rusted holes in the back door. Looking over at the direction from which the footfalls were coming Amadeus stared in anticipation as the figure rounded a corner and came into his view. It was a shocking view too as the figure turned out to be...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amadeus stifled a gasp as the creature rounded the corner and he was staring at a huge lizard thing. No stranger to alien worlds and their inhabitants Amadeus was still struck by the creature's appearance, which reminded him of some of the monsters he'd faced in various wars on untold planets. The creature stood almost three meters in height, towering over the vehicle relics around it, and it's triangular head whip about, scanning the surroundings for something with both its eyes and nose as it sniffed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on two legs the creature looked quite capable of running on all four to increase its top speed, though likely at the expense of agility. Other striking features included the claws which tipped its three fingered hands and feet. Almost a third of a meter in length the things looked more than capable of ripping through the metal bodies around the creature, and when it ran the tip of one claw over a vehicle chassis it left a small streak of yellow, presumably some kind of poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most starling feature though was the tail, which looked to be only a meter long at most when Amadeus first glimpsed it, but proved itself to be on a kind of catch spring, able to shoot out at high speed growing to nearly five meters and adding force to the blow. On the tip of the tail was a hooked claw, and it looked even stronger than the claws on the creature's hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a violence that seemed sudden the tail whipped out slammed into a nearby vehicle, smashing through the side before the creature retracted it, ripping off the door and sending it sailing through the air. The creature then pulled at a belt which Amadeus had not noticed before and pulled off a strange device which the Combine soldier recognized a primitive radio communicator, probably made for short range communication with a receiver held by another nearby agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything. Are you sure this is the arrival point?\" demanded the creature of whoever was on the other end. Surprisingly the thing was speaking English, a language Amadeus knew through the Games he'd played set on Earth. The language had been for a time the closest thing to a universal dialect the planet had, had, at least according to those who believed in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly the device only crackled and sparked at the creature, emitting tones and pulses similar to those that Zee had been when Amadeus had tried to wake the CAP. Obviously Amadeus was not the only one having trouble, though the creature took the devices failure to respond much more harshly that Amadeus had Zee's. Swearing and cursing the thing beat on the small transmitter with its hand before the device finally gave under its strength, shattering into dozens of pieces, which solicited a whole new round of profanities from the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus, still unsure of what exactly the creature was looking for, though he assumed he was the target, was faced with a decision. He could reveal himself to it, and hope that despite appearances the creature proved friendly, or at least benign. And then of course there was the ever faithful Plan QRITOD, which stood for Quickly Run Away In The Opposite Direction, his favorite fall back plan if he could think of nothing else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amadeus, after only a few seconds thought decided to try and approach the creature. If he was indeed the target then finding out why the thing wanted him was a priority. Besides if the thing was evolved to exist in only the one grav that the planet had then he would be able to at least fight on its level. He was after all a trained soldier, and had taken on much bigger foes, though usually with backup waiting in the wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, would you happen to be looking for me?\" he asked the creature as he climbed out of the derelict vehicle's remains. The creature, surprised by the new voice, jumped up onto one of the piles of chassises. The thing looked nothing if not like a cat waiting to pounce on a mouse that had suddenly emerged from its hole. Amadeus though recognized a fighter when he saw one, and knew that unlike the cat, this thing wasn't likely to give up if he ran back into his hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's not be hasty here. I'm sure two gentlemen like ourselves can come to an accord without resorting to violence,\" he said, fingering his pistol. Hopefully the creature recognized the tiny thing as a weapon of immense power. If it didn't then Amadeus might actually have to fire the thing, with results he didn't think he could predict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the creature eyed the weapon before grabbing something from the pile that Amadeus believed was called a hubcap, though this one was razor thing and looked almost as sharp as the creature's own claws. After a second of worrying that thing might throw the hubcap as a weapon Amadeus relaxed as the creature's attention seemed focused on the object, and he began to hope that maybe he hadn't been the object the thing sought at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without any sign or warning the creature threw the hubcap straight at Amadeus. Unable to react in time Amadeus believed he was dead for a moment, before observing that the projectile's flight path just barely intersected the spot where he stood. Before he could use that information though the human cried out in pain as the sharp disk bit into his hip, and then he felt the weight of his belt fall away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to go for the weapon that was still in the belt Amadeus was stopped when the lizard creature landed nearly on top of him, having used the spring like back legs to vault into the air, leaping a dozen meters high before coming down right on top of Amadeus. Rolling to one side to avoid a sweeping slash of the things poisoned claws Amadeus took the only immediate action that seemed appropriate and ran into the junkyard away from the belt and the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hope was that maybe the thing would try and use his weapon against him, kicking in the devices safeties which allowed only Amadeus himself to wield it giving a stunning shock to anyone else who dared try and raise it against anyone. Unfortunately either the creature knew about that particular defense or simply did not wish to wield the unknown weapon, bounding after Amadeus on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing instantly that he could not outdistance the creature, who's top speed was almost twice his own even in the light planetary gravity, Amadeus knew he needed a new plan, and fast or he'd become a scratching post for the odd creature. Looking around provided him with dozens of ideas that ranged from using a car part as a weapon to trying to push a stack of cars over on the creature, but he doubted the thing would be hurt by anything Amadeus could wield directly, and that it wouldn't stay still long enough to get crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out of the corner of his eye Amadeus glimpsed one of the larger stacks of derelicts and an idea formed in his head, though it would involve a bit of gymnastics that he wasn't sure he could pull off. Still with nothing else presenting itself Amadeus switched his course, and proved his guess about the creature's limited mobility while running on all fours. The thing had to almost stop to change direction, or it would literally topple head over heels in the direction it had been moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact against a non-sentient or even just a beast-type mindset would have given Amadeus the chance to get away by running in a zigzag pattern, but he doubted seriously that the creature would fall for such a trick, especially if Amadeus really was his target, a fact which seriously did not doubt now, but wasn't going to let go until the creature confirmed it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at his target Amadeus leaped up in a manner similar to a cat, coiling his body like a spring before releasing every erg of his energy upward. The force of the leap carried Amadeus up a good five yards before he felt his momentum slacken and Amadeus grabbed one of the vehicles that made up the pile before him. Not resting for a second the human began to climb as fast as he could up the precariously rocking tower of metal, which seemed almost ready to tip over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing a trap the creature slid to a halt just out of range of the tower's fall. Arriving at the top Amadeus observed this fact with some consternation as his plan relied on the creature getting closer to the tower. Looking over the hood of the top derelict of the pile Amadeus stared down at the creature which stared back with bloodthirsty eyes, and he knew that if he fell off his perch the creature was likely to charge in an go for the quick kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought did not help when Amadeus suddenly found the ground under his feet titling, and looked back to find the vehicle he was standing on leaning forward towards the edge of the tower. Falling to his knees he tried to grasp the hood of transport, but found that the smooth metal of the hood provided no traction. Swearing profusely the human slipped those last few centimeters and in a mimic of his earlier dive fell to the ground below, though this time he landed on his butt rather than his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better than another face plant,\" he commented to himself, springing to his feet. Before him the creature sensed a chance to take down his prey, and rushed forward with reckless abandon. Amadeus, seeing the look in the things eyes, began to run away, but found his path blocked by the tower of derelicts that had moments ago been his salvation, but now spelled his doom. The creature, jaws wide and claws dripping poison rushed forward, and Amadeus turned to meet him. At that moment a new sound overtakes the dump. It is the sound of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smiling to himself at the sound Amadeus leapt backwards just as the creature sprang forward, landing right in the spot where Amadeus had been standing a moment before. The creature, focused as it was on its target, did not hear the sound of scraping metal, and the first clue it had that anything bad was going to happen to it was the sudden darkness that overtook the area where it had stopped. Looking up it had no time to react as the top vehicle of the stack fell straight towards it, smashing into the creatures with a thunderous crash, kicking up a cloud of dust that obscured the scene for meters around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sound of the various small bits falling atop the crashed car finally ceased the dust began to settle and Amadeus was rewarded for his plan with the sight of the lizard creature stuck under the chassis, the bottom half of it's body crushed under the derelict and a mound of other small metal pieces that had fallen with the derelict from the pile. The creature at first seemed dead, and Amadeus was afraid that he might have overestimated the creature's resilience, but after a second or two the thing began to thrash and jerk, trying to pull itself out from under the junk which buried it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus sighed in relief when the creature stopped its struggles, mostly because he was half certain that the thing might be able to move the junk off itself, but luckily the pile proved to great, and the creature stopped at stared at its captor. His smile vanishing in a single instant Amadeus reached under the fur cloak he wore and withdrew the axe which he probably could have used to slay the creature before, but had not used because he needed information, and corpses had the annoying habit of keeping what they knew to themselves most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now that I have your attention, how about you explain why you're looking for me, and maybe how I got here,\" he suggested to the creature, fingering the edge of the axe before holding it high over his head and slicing into one of the derelicts at the bottom of the pile. In a flash the axe was again at Amadeus' side and neither he nor the creature could see a flaw in the metal of the chassis, but an errant shift in the wind tugged at the thing, and a moment later the front hood of the transport fell to the ground, having been cleanly chopped off by the blade's sharp edge and the wielder's prodigious strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do I need to use some of those fine interrogation techniques that you can learn in any starport dive if you watch long enough,\" he said, wondering if the creature could be intimidated by the show of strength. He doubted it, but it was worth a shot. Walking forward he stood right before the creature so that it had to crane its neck and look up at him before lowering himself to his heels and staring the thing in the face. The creature, stuck under the derelict said nothing in response to the threat, but rather began to struggle again, at least wriggle one arm free from under the pile of debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus, fearful of what the poison in the thing's claws could do to him, sprang backwards, and just in time too as the now free appendage swiped at him. With the attack failed the creature went back to trying to work its way free of the rubble under which it was buried, and Amadeus knew he had to attack before the thing could do that, as he might never be able to trap it again. Thinking fast Amadeus leapt forward again, surprising the creature with his dexterity and agility as he lightly swung his axe at the monster, who braced for a fatal blow. When it opened its eyes though it was still alive, if now minus a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you take my threats seriously from now on?\" Amadeus asked the trapped lizard, kicking the severed hand which he had just lopped off the creature's arm closer to its former owner. Oddly the creature took greater interest in the hand then it did in the one who was threatening it, trying to hit it with the stump of an arm it now had. Unfortunately for it Amadeus' swing had sent the appendage a few centimeters away, and even his kick had not moved it back into range, but to prevent the creature from reaching the hand he slammed the iron heel of his climbing boot atop the flailing arm, sticking it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\" complained Amadeus, holding his axe right in the creature's face. Surprisingly instead of balking at the nearness of the weapon the creature instead lunged for it with its head, turning it so that its mouth was parallel to the blade's edge. Biting into the weapon its teeth found a grip, and Amadeus was thrown back in surprise as the axe was ripped from his hand, and by the fact that the venom in the creature's fangs seemed to be dissolving the metal of the weapon's construction. Something that should have been impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting an attack Amadeus lowered into a fighting stance ready to deflect the weapon when the creature tossed it at him, but he was stunned into silence when instead of attacking him the thing spit the blade out at its own severed hand, causing the sickening sound of crushing bone and liquefying flesh to echo over the dump. Oddly Amadeus could swear he heard a metallic crunch as well, but he couldn't see from where until a new sound came over the area, this one a high pitched whine he recognized without any hesitation, as he had a similar device built into one of his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping back again Amadeus watched from twelve meters away as the creature's body began to shine with an inner radiance hat nearly blinded him as he stared into it. Slowly points of light blossomed under the lizard like scales, moving about inside the creature towards a single shining dot inside the things head. With each droplet of light that dot grew stronger and stronger until at last Amadeus could no longer stand to look at it and was forced to turn away as the light and whining sound reached their crescendo together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last the sound had died down Amadeus looked back to see the last vestiges of the plasma reaction fading. Where the monster, derelict, and various bits of junk had stood their was now a crater that was about six meters wide and almost that deep. Amadeus swore as he walked up and inspected the crater, both because his only lead on how he'd get back home had just committed suicide, and because the blast radius had included his axe, meaning that when he got back he'd have to make a whole new one, which meant at least three weeks of hard work for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all. You know Jasmine made that for me, you scaly jerk. How am I supposed to tell her I got her gift vaporized on some unknown planet?\" he complained at the crater, before kicking a bit of debris into it in frustration. With that act done Amadeus decided not to dwell on his anger, and instead focus his mind on how to get home, which would require help from his brother, who was still probably still a bit scrambled by their arrival on this new world. Thinking about how he'd explain the loss of her gift to Jasmine, Amadeus started back towards the place where his belt lay when he heard the sound of other voices just around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" demanded one, which sounded an awfully lot like the voice of the lizard thing when he'd been speaking into the small radio transmitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking me, genetic filth. He's your brother not mine,\" responded another, this one of an entirely different accent, though still speaking English. Staring towards the pile between him and the two voice Amadeus realized he would have to get past them to get at his belt, Zee, and his weapon, not a prospect he delighted in as he didn't think he could take one of the lizards unarmed, let alone one of them and something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he was surprised to find that the crater left by the first lizard had opened a hole in the rear fence of the junkyard, providing him with a view of the forest beyond. Turning back towards the direction of his things he realized that once again he was faced with a choice of paths. He could attempt to face the two who were speaking and get to his belt, or he could run into the woods and wait for Zee to come to him, as the CAP was sure to activate and come after him when he'd sorted himself out. Staring up into the fast darkening sky above Amadeus as last decided to...</span></div></div>",

Overhead the primary star was beginning to descended towards the horizon, and because of the darkness that was fast over taking the opposite side of the sky Amadeus assumed that the system had only a single sun, unlike his current home of Dedros which was a binary system with a bright primary and a smaller secondary that caused the planet to have only an cycle or two of darkness before one or the other rose into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the home from which he'd been ripped Amadeus was over taken by an urge to go back and bust the heads of the two who had been speaking earlier, as he was quite certain now that his presence on the planet was due in part to the lizard humanoid who had attacked him, and he was just as certain that whomever the two voices belonged to had at least some relation to the lizard thing. After all one of them had talked about the fact that someone who was missing was the other's brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought the urge though, as he was still not sure if he could take one of the lizards unarmed. Oh he was confident he could kill one if he had to. Probably more than one, but his goal was not to terminate the lizard things, but rather to capture one, and force it to tell him where he was, why he was there, and most importantly how he would get his butt back home so he could finish the Game with Jasmine, probably getting killed by the Midgard Dragon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the information he required out of reach Amadeus had to fall back on what the Combine military advised in situations like his. Sit tight, keep yourself alive, and wait for pick up. Though nebulous in nature those orders had kept him going on at least three occasions that resembled his current one, though in all three instances he'd never had anyone actively hunting him. Usually he was just lost on some planet with no way off. Those times he'd just laid low and waited for help to come. This time though he had a feeling help wasn't coming, and he would have to try and figure everything out on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting and waiting for Zee to pull his circuits together sounded like a good idea for the moment. Even if those two back in the junkyard did find the belt it was doubtful they would be able to identify the CAP, and even if they were able to ID the device there was no way they could hurt it. CAPs came equipped with self-defense programs to protect the storage module even if the CAP themselves were for some reason rendered helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning through the hole in the fence Amadeus ran as fast as he could in the climbing boots he was wearing into the woods, which proved harder to navigate because of his footwear. Every step he took seemed to get the spiked toes caught in a root or branch, but with a single-mindedness that only a true soldier could demonstrate he continued running, ripping the woods apart as he did so. He was well aware that he was leaving an obvious trail to follow, but he had hope that maybe the two at the dump would not take notice of his escape when they learned of the death of their fellow lizard thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if they didn't, Amadeus was still making pretty good time as he made his way through the foliage, and he was sure that the air had a hint of water in it. Once he was able to find a river or stream he could follow it for a ways, throwing off any would be pursuers and buying himself all the time Zee would need to repair himself and then come and get him. Once they were together again Amadeus was confident that he and Zee could figure out what the hazmat was going on and then get themselves back to where they belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way quickly through the branches and leaves Amadeus' first sight of the river was just as he broke through a curtain of vegetation and then fell off the bank into the cold water. Landing with a hard splash Amadeus panicked for a moment as the water rose over his head and he felt the weight of his cloak and helmet drag him to the river bed, with the strong current trying to rip both items off his body. His struggles tore at the water, sending it flying in all directions, though it was eerily quiet as Amadeus did not once scream out for help for fear that he might be being followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling stupider than he had in most of his twenty Combine Standard Years of life Amadeus realized with a start that he was scraping the bottom of the \u2018river' with his hands while thrashing. Stopping his thrashing about Amadeus put his hands on the soft mud underneath the water and hauled himself to his feet, discovering that the stream he was standing in was quite deep for its size, having only about three feet width, but coming up to his knees when he stood in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, when I tell Zee about this later, I am so leaving this part out,\" he told himself, beginning his march up stream. His boots, which had proved a hindrance in the woods, were even worse in the water, as it felt like he had to tug them loose from the mud with each step. His pace slowed to less than a snail's crawl Amadeus had time to listen to the woods around him, and was startled to realize that he had yet to hear a single animal sound, although that might not be odd. Several worlds were silent to him because the native lifeforms used alternate forms of communication or used sounds who's pitches were too high or low for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill even on those worlds forested areas had at least some indication of life, yet stretching his senses to the their utmost he could feel nothing anywhere nearby, either following him or just going about their daily business. Disturbed by the lack of activity Amadeus searched the banks on either side for signs of some passage, but found only a few trails that led into the woods, most seeming to have been abandoned for at least weeks, which usually meant there was something wrong with the local area that caused natives to avoid it. Possibly something to do with the lizards, if they weren't the locals themselves, which, though he didn't have any evidence of it, he doubted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the one he'd fought in the junkyard had seemed out of place. After all the majority of the vehicle derelicts had been designed for something about Amadeus' size, roughly one to two and half meters, while the lizard thing had been nearly three in height, with the tail adding at least another meter if not more to it's overall length. Such a thing would have never found transports of that nature comfortable, indicating that they were not among the most numerous species on the planet. Besides, if they were the dominate race of the planet than they should have been able to track him much more easily than they seemed to, as he'd only encountered three in the junkyard, two of which might have had no relation to his assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a bank of the stream that was only slightly difficult to climb, being neither the steep bank he'd found when first coming upon the stream, nor the banks that sloped into the river creating a way to just walk out, Amadeus made his way out of the river, grabbing a branch for a hand hold and ripping it off as he ascended the slope. Walking into the woods he found a trail and made sure to leave a set of footprints on it that walked off into the woods more wild section before stepping backwards exactly in his own footprints and returning to the water to continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he could find a place a little farther upstream to get off at and try to find a clearing where he could make camp as any followers were likely to see the easily visible signs of his leaving the river and make their way into the woods, traveling downstream and away from where it was Amadeus would eventually get off. Hist footsteps coming easier thanks to the knowledge that he had done all he could to protect himself Amadeus was surprised when he reached an area of the river where the water shallowed out to be less than an inch deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this might be a good place Amadeus made his way into the woods, and was again surprised when his path brought him almost instantly to a clearing that was a good twenty feet wide. It seemed like the perfect place to bunker down for the coming nighttime. Maybe a little too perfect really. Looking around Amadeus half expected to find some kind of duckblind setup, but everywhere around there seemed to be only trees and woods. Amadeus, after a moment or two of consideration...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking to the edge of the clearing Amadeus found the branches of the local trees to be just about the right length for use in building a camp site that would be adequate for at least a few days. Knowing that ripping the branches off living wood might be considered bad taste on this world as it was on others Amadeus made a quick search of the ground, finding deadwood almost everywhere he looked, most of it in at least useable condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way into the brush Amadeus began to pick up random sticks, pulling at their sides and seeing if they snapped or broke. Any branch that did instantly found itself tossed back towards the clearing, for use as fire wood, while those that stood up to his assault were placed under one arm, for use either as more kindling or for more important roles which he would determine when he had found as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering himself to be either quite lucky Amadeus walked back into the clearing with a bundle of sticks under his arm, dumping them into roughly the center of the open area. Looking down at his prizes he was confident that he could survive on the planet, for at least one or two nights, though if he found a good source of food he knew that he would be able to live here indefinitely, though he still hoped that Zee or someone would come and take him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling at the cloak on his back he lightly set the fur on the ground beside the sticks and began to lay each pieces of wood beside the garment, measuring with his eyes to see if any of the sticks would do as poles for a lean-to. Finding two such pieces of wood in the stack he set them on the ground and rotated them in such a manner as to cause them to drill into the dirt, until at last about 15 cm of their ends were buried in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at he work Amadeus then grabbed the cloak off the ground and set two of its corners on the poles and tugged, making sure the lean-to would be able to hold up if the wind began pulling at the cloak. He was gratified to find that the sticks he'd chosen did indeed have the necessary strength to service his needs, and pulling at the free end of the cloak again he buried it under several centimeters of dirt to brace it, forcing the cloak to stretch out ward forming a basic three sided shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around the small hut he'd made in only a few minutes Amadeus felt confident that it would suit his needs as a temporary dwelling place, as, if Zee or no one showed up in the night, he planned on moving on, and hopefully finding out a bit more about his new planet. Making one last circuit around the temporary dwelling Amadeus nodded again, satisfied with his handiwork, and hoping that the wind didn't pick up too much in the night, as if it did that usually indicated rain in a nitrogen rich atmosphere, which he believed this planet's to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dwelling set up Amadeus turned to more important matters, namely provisions. Since his belt had contained his pouch Amadeus had no tools or items from his own civilization. His gun had been the only truly useful thing on the belt besides Zee, but Amadeus still would have liked to have the pouch, in which he knew were a few nutrient cubes, that, though they tasted terrible, would have filled his stomach for the night at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to dwell on such wishful thinking, no matter how much he wanted to, Amadeus set about constructing a campfire area, placing a few of the stronger sticks into positions similar to those of his lean-to poles, burying their ends in the ground so that they stood straight up. With that done he then pulled at their ends, ripping the sticks in half through the sheer strength of his arms, creating makeshift prongs that would be able to hold up a third stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part came to be a bit more difficult as Amadeus pulled off his lupine shaped helm and then had to find a stick that would fit into the jaw hole that held the faceplate to the rest of the head covering, yet was strong enough to support the metal helm as it hung between the two sticks he'd just buried. Luckily for Amadeus one of the sticks he'd picked up proved perfect for the task, and after leaving it up for a minute he felt it would suit his purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the helm with the stick stuck through it, Amadeus marched back to the river, and using the helm as a pot he got as much water as he could in it before making his way back to camp. As he looked down at the large amount of water in the bottom of his pot, Amadeus thought of all the times Corrin and Vivian, his old squadmates, had commented on his large head, compared to their's. Now though that big head was coming in handy as it made the helm into a decent sized pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the memory of his friends, whom he hadn't seen in at least a year, Amadeus set the full pot/helm atop the two stick that would hold it over the fire. He waited for three minutes this time as he watched the pot sway in the light breeze, fearing with every swing that he would hear the shuddering sound of a crack as the stick broke apart under the combined weight of the helm and the water, but despite the thinness of the branch it held, and Amadeus smiled as he moved some of the extra wood he'd gathered under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fire setup complete Amadeus was again forced to venture into the woods to find stones and dry brush. The stones to use as both an ignition source, and to ring the fire to prevent it from spreading, and the dry brush to use to help the initial spark take hold. Again the abandoned nature of his surroundings worked to his favor, as both items were readily at hand, though he would have liked the stones to be a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, beggars had no right to be choosers, and he made due with those stones he located along the river bank, carefully placing each one next to the other until they formed a complete circle around the edge of where he intended to spark his fire. With that done Amadeus then threw the bits of dry brush into the small pile of sticks, making it look like a tree had suddenly fallen in on itself and then he'd set his makeshift pot over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping his hands together to get off the excess wood chips and dirt Amadeus then set about the harder work of ripping the grass out of the area around his fire, tossing any good looking handfuls into the place where the flames would blaze, while throwing most outward towards the edges of the clearing. When he was done he got to his feet and again clapped his hands against each other, finding the half meter of dirt around his circle of stones to be a testament to his survival skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, not from exhaustion, but from the sheer amount of work he knew lay ahead, Amadeus picked up the two roughest rocks he'd found by the river. Taking them back towards the flowing water he tested their edges against each other, making sure that they would suit the purpose to which he intended on putting them. He was rewarded for his effort with a slight flash of sparks as the two stones rubbed against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to himself, and looking up at the sky, Amadeus was startled to find the sky was already a deep purple hue, with the sun vanished some time ago over the horizon. Amadeus stared up into the velvet sky, seeing the first hint of starlight he'd seen in a long time. Oddly he thought he recognized some of the star patterns in the sky overhead, but he couldn't place any of them. It seemed to him that he'd looked up at the stars many times, but that should be impossible, as Dedros was the first planet he'd ever lived on by choice, and most of the ones he'd ended up by on accident or because of orders had been V-class, meaning their atmosphere prevent one from seeing the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the feeling of familiarity, he wandered back into his camp and stood in front of his fire pit. Clicking the two stones together as hard as he could solicited sparks from them, ones which fell on the dry grass and brush, causing light smoke to begin to rise. Putting aside the rocks Amadeus stared into the brush, trying to will the fire to come out. When that failed he did the next best thing and began blowing on the brush, causing the smoke to rise faster and harder before it suddenly burst into a bright inferno before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fire burning steadily Amadeus leaned back against a nearby tree and stared into its blaze. He lost himself for a time in the dance of light and smoke which he knew had captivated the hearts of many humans before him. Some would lose themselves in the light for hours at time, finding their chaotic fury calming. For him though their chaos was not calm. In the crackle of the fire he heard the shots fired from weapons he held, and the hiss of the air reminded him of screams as people fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in the Games, or being a soldier he had to steel himself against the images, just to keep on going, but at times like these he couldn't do that. The Warrior in him would not come out to protect the Child from the things they had done. Instead the Child was laid low, forced to endure the horrors it had seen others commit before it, and worse still those horrors done by its own hands, though at the time those hands had belonged to another, or so it had seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Amadeus a moment to feel the wetness in his right palm, and he knew that he'd again started squeezing that hand. At first he thought he might had cut it open with his fingernails again, but looking down he saw that he'd been digging that hand into the dirt without knowing it, and had found a small tuber buried just below the surface, and he'd squeezed some of the juice out of it. Pulling his hand close to his face Amadeus sucked off a bit of the juice and found that it tasted bitter, though he noted that just after it had passed down his throat he felt a little weary. Probably it had a sedating effect on him, but light enough that he would be able to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging on purpose this time Amadeus unearthed a dozen or so of the small green root-like things, and then walked up to his fire, over which the pot was already beginning to boil. Wiping the dirt off as best he could Amadeus dumped a small handful of the tubers into his water, and watched as the juice began to flow out of them, mixing in the bubbling water into something that resembled a witch's brew, though he hoped it tasted better than tongue of frog and eye of newt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the concoction another few minutes to boil as he made his way over the camp, choosing at last one of the longer, yet thinner sticks to serve as a poker for his fire. Walking over to the stream and dipping it in before making his way back to the fire, which had grown low as he'd stared into it earlier. A quick jab with the damp would, though, caused the fire to redouble its blaze, and few extra sticks were added to the mound of kindling to keep it going for a while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied that he'd given it enough time Amadeus gripped the ends of the stick which held his helm/pot and carried it to the stream, lowering it into it so that the bottom touched it. He heard the satisfying sound as the water under the pot flash boiled, becoming a small cloud of steam which quickly vanished in the slightly chill night air. Holding it for a few extra moment Amadeus could actually feel as the helm came down to a temperature he could hold in his hand without burning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last done with that Amadeus walked back into the camp, and sat under the lean-to which stared straight into his fire. Picking up the helm in his palm he lightly tilted it, taking a testing sip of his brew. Surprisingly the taste of the liquid was not nearly as bitter as the raw tuber juice had been, and in fact it had an almost sweet after taste that he would have enjoyed under different circumstances, though the current situation made enjoying it a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tasting of the liquid out of the way Amadeus decided to see what the plants themselves tasted like, and reached his hand into the mixture, pulling out one of the tubers that shined in the firelight. Biting off one end he was again struck by a bitter taste, and wondered for a moment what was in the water that would so alter the flavor of the juice, but his stomach didn't really care. According to it any food at the moment was good food, no matter the taste, and after a few more mouthfuls Amadeus found he was in complete agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Amadeus long to eat his simple meal, throwing away the bits of plant which he'd found to be inedible, as well as washing out the helm in river water before setting it over the fire again to dry. Finding nothing more to take his mind off the situation he was in Amadeus decided that sleep was his next priority, and that if Zee, who he knew had by know corrected whatever problem he'd had, had not yet contacted him by morning, he would go searching for the CAP as well as for a way off the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying under his lean-to Amadeus could see only a ragged edge of the stars that were nearly invisible in the firelight, but just at the side of his eyes he caught a glimpse of something he recognized right away, mostly because he'd seen it a dozen times in Games he'd played with Jasmine. There, sitting in the sky as if it belonged, was a huge silver sphere, the planetary satellite, but it had to be huge compared to the planet if it was visible so easily, and only one planet he knew had one that big compared to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary homeworld, a world he himself had tried to prove mythological at least a dozen times during his sessions with the commanders of the Third Fleet, who insisted on wasting resource searching for it. Not fully able to process what his sleep deprived mind was telling him Amadeus began to drift away from the impossible scene before his eyes into the darkness of his dreams. Oddly as he did so his eyes did not close, but remained wide open, just unfocused as his mind entered its unconscious phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he remained for many hours, without any thoughts of huge satellites or mythical homeworlds, or even of Zee and his own lost status. Instead his dreams were filled with images of fire-breathing monsters, both those of the real and Game variety. Neither type were doing pleasant things to him in those dreams, but he endured their flames, both because he felt he deserved their hot kiss, and because he knew of no way to fight them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreams ended suddenly when the sound of a snapping twig brought Amadeus back to reality, bolting from his slumber to fully awake in less than a second, a result of his training, of which the eye open sleep was a side effect. Looking around Amadeus was assaulted by the sound of something crashing through the woods nearby. Poking the dim flame into brightness he looked towards the source of the noise, and was startled when a new form burst into his clearing, one of a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The deer and Amadeus stared at each other across the clearing. In the eyes of the creature Amadeus could see the focus of a mind that knew the concept of I, and thus was sentient, though the thing wore no clothes and said not a word to him, the surest signs of intelligence. Silently the two figures stood as they studied each other in the failing light of Amadeus' campfire, which must have been burning for many hours and now stood in the spectral place between life and death, for a fire anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would run if I were you,\" said the deer at last in English, prompting Amadeus to stand up straighter and set his foot on the end of his wooden poker, bringing it to hand. Before he could inquire as to why the deer felt flight was necessary, or why it spoke English, the creature took off across the clearing to crash through the brush on the other side and begin bounding off into the woods again towards an unknown destination. Or more likely away from some unknown assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking calmly over to his campfire Amadeus drove the end of his stick into the ember's glow, causing a small spark of life to reveal itself to him. Reaching down, but never getting off his feet, Amadeus picked up one of the sticks he had kept as extra fuel and tossed it along with a handful of dry grass into the small tongue of flame, which lapped up the wood and plants with a hunger that caused it to crackle as it burned brightly against the darkened woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching his senses to their utmost again Amadeus could hear the sounds of the deer's hooves as it made its way through the woods. Elsewhere he now sensed the movement of other beings. Two seemed smaller, and lighter than their companions, at least one of which had a step like a lummox or an elephant. The other, though lighter on its feet than the lummox, still made more noise as it moved through the woods, obviously bigger as he could hear more branches break with its passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he listened the large sounding creature made its way in an almost straight path towards him, and Amadeus realized that the deer must have been fleeing the creature. Why it would be hunted in such a primitive fashion when it was clearly a sentient Amadeus did not know, but he didn't have time to care that much either as the creature crashed through the small barrier of shrubs that surrounded the clearing, landing right inside his shadow as it leapt into sight, crouching on all fours and growling like a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature had claws obviously made for ripping into flesh, as even in the low light of his fire Amadeus could see the glint off the sharp, long nails. The things eyes and face were a reminder of a race he'd encountered called the Veraxan, though it was obvious by the stance the creature took in battle it had never ever heard of that species, for if it had it would have assumed a much more defensive stance, for which the Veraxan were famous, called the Vera Cone, which forced all hand to hand combatants to fight the Veraxan head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, despite the look of the claws and even the shape of the thing's mouth Amadeus could tell that its teeth were as flat as a cows, designed for grinding rather than ripping, and would have only limited use in any combat that the creature partook in. Studying it still farther Amadeus noted the drawn out look it had when standing on all fours as it did now, a look like a spring that had been coiled and was ready to pop forward at any time. A stance which would have been useful against a non-sentient opponent, but against Amadeus, who had fought things that the creature could not even conceive of, the stance was thing to laugh at, though he did not do so just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he predicted, the creature leapt forward, coming straight on like a wild animal rather than thinking through the attack like a true warrior. Depressed at the lack of challenge Amadeus merely spun out of the way of the leaping attack, bring the stick in close like a fencing blade and then slashing it down as the form of the lupine creature jetted by him, slamming the wooden weapon into the thing's left leg and soliciting a pain filled yelp from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature landed hard, rolling across the clearing after trying to come down on the injured limb. Amadeus, now spinning his weapon before him like a shield, ran after the creature, and as it once again tried to get to its feet, still growling and probably still planning on doing battle, Amadeus whacked it across the temple with the stick, causing it to fly a few feet across the clearing before sliding to a stop almost right next to his campfire, and revealing two new facts about the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, and probably something he should have noticed before, was that the creature was wearing clothes. Specifically it appeared to be wearing a jacket, which indicated not only sentience, but that it was part of a civilization. The other thing was that the jacket had writing on it. Writing in the same ancient language that the lizard and deer had been speaking. One word in particular caught his attention as it was an indicator of the creature's age. The word school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh slag. I just knocked out a kid. I am in so much trouble,\" said Amadeus gripping the back of his head in frustration as he looked over at the still form of the lupine child. Even though he was about the same size as the creature Amadeus' close inspection of the feature's told him that the thing was indeed still a child, as the head didn't look quite the right size for the body, being just a bit too big, a good indication of the age of carbon based lifeforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering his situation Amadeus actively thought about chasing after the deer and maybe hiding out with it. After all the creature and its friends were probably not going to be too happy with him when it was revealed that Amadeus had injured one of them. Flight, as the deer had suggested, seemed like a good option. But could Amadeus really leave the thing unconscious in the middle of clearing, in a forest that could contain dozens of species that might well make a meal out of him while he was helpless?</span></div></div>",

Well slumbering was probably not the right word as the creature continued to paw at the ground, as if Amadeus had caused some damage to the poor thing's mind when he'd struck it. Unwilling to entertain thoughts of that bleak nature Amadeus went to the creature's side, and began to take stock of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already observed the jacket that had the word school on it, which indicated the jackets owner was in some form of educational system, Amadeus took stock of other clothes, noting that outside the jacket the youth wore an odd fur cloak, not unlike his own, but this one made of hair from another animal. The horns atop the head and fluffy white nature of the hair indicated to Amadeus an animal that was called a sheep, bringing to mind an old axiom about a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off the cloak Amadeus placed it over the lean-to constructed from his own and set about checking the creature's body, both to see if it had sustained injury and to confirm its gender. A quick glance told Amadeus he was dealing with a male, which indicated to him that the society on the planet would probably have matriarchal overtones, as the stronger genders were usually those that stayed at home, rather than going out and hunting. Though many had tried to dissuade Amadeus of that fact, his own research had proven it true in ninety-seven out of one-hundred cases, which was proof enough to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he checked was the creature's... no the boy's leg, making sure it was still whole, if bruised. A few pokes gained him pain filled whines from the still unconscious thing. He noted, however, that he felt only whole bone, which at least meant that he hadn't broken anything in his assault, a good thing considering it was likely Amadeus would be helping the creature back to wherever it came from and he didn't really feel like dragging it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus then tried to look for other injuries, but found his search complicated by the small mat of fur that obscured the boy's skin. Not used to having to look through a screen of fur for injuries Amadeus at last gave up his search, hoping that the creature's only wounds were those two bumps that he himself had inflicted upon it. If so then all he'd have to deal with when the creature awoke was a headache and really sore leg, both things he could help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting all the clothes back on the boy Amadeus decided to leave the cloak off, not knowing how the creature had kept it on while running through the woods, the cloak having no ties or clips which would bind it to either the creature or his garments. Leaving the sheep cloak hanging on his lean-to Amadeus placed the boy as gently as he could before the fire, hoping the warmth would in some way ease the pain which the boy was likely to waken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he was comfortable Amadeus then set about the task of digging in the dirt at the edge of the clearing again, searching for more of the tubers he had discovered by accident. The juice from the tubers, when he'd ingested it raw, had a sedating effect on him, and seeing that he was able to survive on the planet's surface unaided, as was the boy, Amadeus had a hope that the chemical would have a similar effect on him. It usually worked that way, as most lifeforms throughout the cosmos followed some basic pattern, so that chemicals would effect them in similar ways, though not always the exact same ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prayed silently that the tuber juice wasn't some form of narcotic for the young boy, otherwise he might well cause the creature to gain a drug habit, something frowned upon by most cultures, being considered a weakness. Having succumb to such pleasures only twice in his life Amadeus knew the thrall they held, and he did not truly wish to give such a crutch to the boy, but the tubers might at least ease the pain he would feel upon waking, and Amadeus needed him focused on something other than that pain, which he had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering as many of the tubers as he could Amadeus walked back over to the fire where the wolf boy still lay in the land of dreams. Nudging the creature with his fire poker solicited a small whimper and another bout of scampering in the air with his legs and arms, but nothing further. Thinking that maybe he'd hit the boy harder than he'd though Amadeus walked around him and grabbed the helm which lay near the fire, having been placed there to dry after his meal earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the helm between his legs, Amadeus began to squeeze the tubers in his fists, causing small streams of liquid to pour through his clenched fingers into the makeshift bowl. He repeated the process until he at last ran out of the green root-like things, and was disappointed to find that he had only half filled the helm. Looking around he at first thought that he might dig up some more, but decided that he'd make due with what he'd already gotten, as it was at this moment that the creature at last began to stir out of his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in pain, and moving his hand to grip his head to keep it from moving too much the creature rose to his knees and took stock of the local surroundings. Amadeus was quite surprised by the action considering the reckless abandon with which the creature had acted when breaking into the clearing before. Now, with the bloodlust drained from him by a few minutes of pain induced sleep, the boy was in control of himself again. Walking forward Amadeus stepped in front of the young one and held out the helm to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. I think this will help the pain,\" he offered, admitting to the creature that he didn't know if it really would help or not, but the boy didn't seem to care, grabbing the helm and draining it in a few short gulps. Tossing the metal aside the boy faced Amadeus with fire in his eyes, though he swayed in the light breeze, meaning he was in no real condition to do battle, but that he was willing to try all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Amadeus, wondering if the spoken language of the creature was the same as the deer and the lizard, and the same as the words written on his jacket. It was always possible that the boy spoke a different tongue than those around him, which would complicate matters for a few seconds, though Amadeus was still wearing his transcollar, which meant with a flick of a switch he could understand any language as long as it was based in a recognized thought pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you understand me?\" asked Amadeus, this time tapping that side of his head near his ear to accentuate the words. The boy repeated the gesture, not knowing why his captor chose to make it, but hoping that if he kept it talking long enough his friends would show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No and yes,\" said the boy and last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not okay? What hurts?\" asked Amadeus, hoping that he could keep the boy talking. He still needed information about where he was, the lizard having proved uncooperative in that area, choosing self-destruction over giving Amadeus any clue as to where he was, or why he'd been brought here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything. My head is throbbing, and my leg feels like you shattered the bone,\" responded the boy, gripping that leg and trying to stand for a moment, but failing miserably and falling back to the dirt with another pain filled yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to stand. Your legs not broken, but I did hit it pretty hard I'm afraid,\" said Amadeus, hoping that admitting he had caused the hurt would at least get the boy to not think of him as an uncaring enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good news at least. Why are you out here anyway? This is the hunting ground for our school. No ones supposed to be here but players, judges, and prey,\" said the boy, sitting upright again as he pushed himself off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hunting ground? That explains the seldom used trails. And to answer your question I'm not from around here, so I had no idea what this place was. I just needed some place to set up camp tonight and came upon this clearing. When you attacked me I defended myself, and you're quite lucky I didn't kill you,\" said Amadeus, not trying to impress the boy that he'd been spared, but instead stating a simple fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you aren't from around here. I've never smelled anything like you before, and I've never seen anyone do with a stick what you did,\" admitted the boy, staring at the human with unshielded respect at the power he'd seen him display in taking him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just something I've picked up in my travels, lupine child. I can teach it to you if you want, but first how about telling me where I am,\" offered Amadeus. The wolf boy mulled over the offer and the request for a few moments before at last staring into the man's eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go first. I'll tell you who I am and where we are, but before that I want to know where you're from and who you are,\" countered the boy at last, and Amadeus knew he had to respond. He could of course lie and claim to be a native of the planet from far away, as he wasn't sure that the wolf boy might be in league with the lizard thing that had attacked him. Of course if his lie was discovered it wouldn't help his matters any, especially if it turned out the wolf boy was an enemy of the lizard thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, if that's the way you want it. My name is Amadeus Orman, I'm a homo sapien. My homeworld, well I don't have one. I was born in a hyperspace shunt city that existed between the worlds of Armanos and Verax. At the current time my place of residence is in an unnamed city on the southern landmass of the planet Dedros in the Halika system of the Sarnok galaxy. The sector is Foxtrot Hotel India, or FHI,\" he said, giving as much information as he could about himself, hoping that something he said might get a reaction out of the child, but unfortunately the lupine boy sat facing him, and did not react as if the names sparked any memories within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you're from another planet?\" asked the kid in disbelief, and forced Amadeus to consider the possibility that he was on a prim world, something he'd guessed at by the types of vehicles in the junkyard, but had attempted to ignore. Now faced with the child's stare of wonder Amadeus couldn't lie to himself, and was forced to admit that getting a ride home wasn't going to be possible. At least not until he understood what brought him to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm from another planet. Now that that's established, what planet is this, and do you have any form of interstellar travel?\" he asked, hoping that maybe he was wrong, and that this child was just less traveled, and simply had never met someone from another world, despite a culture that could travel the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the planet we're on now is called Earth, but as to interstellar travel...well the farthest we've been is the moon. Are you really from another world?\" asked the wolf boy again, staring at Amadeus with a look that asked plainly if he was lying. Sighing Amadeus shook his head and stared into the fire, silently bemoaning the loss of his belt, the contents of which would have proven his claim with ease, either through his gun, or better yet Zee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, you can believe me or not, that's you're choice, as I lost the stuff I have that could prove my origin without a doubt. Still, doesn't my appearance look odd enough to suggest an extraterrestrial birth?\" he asked, waving his hand over his own body and standing fully in the light of the fire so that the wolf boy got a clear view of him. For many long moments Amadeus stood nervously as he was studied, though he realized quickly that it was his scent that was under scrutiny more so than his appearance, which suggested many things about the wolf boy and the culture from which he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do smell odd, but I could swear I've smelled something similar,\" commented the wolf boy, more to himself than to Amadeus, but Amadeus leaped up as if the lupine child had been yelling at him, facing him across the fire with blazing light shining in his eyes. Leaping over the flames he looked down at the wolf boy and grabbed his forearm, not roughly, but enough to get the child's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you smell something like me? It could be my people are hiding somewhere on this world, observing you. Please, try and remember, maybe they were called something else. My people are also known as humans, though I'd be surprised if they...\" Amadeus' voice trailed off as he stared into the wolf boy's eyes, because in those eyes he saw a spark of recognition at the word \u2018human', something that truly startled him as few in his own government would dare to call themselves human, most being half-breeds or even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans then. So where is it you remember humans from?\" demanded Amadeus, not needing the wolf boy to answer his previous question in words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never met one before, not while they were human anyway, but according to Kevin's sister, Danielle, she used to be a human,\" he responded, and Amadeus was again forced to stare at the boy, before releasing the wolf boy's arm, and turning away in defeat. He had no idea what the child was talking about, though from his tone Amadeus doubted seriously that he would find anyone from the Combine on this world. He did have some hope that maybe this Danielle was from the Unified Worlds Alliance or the Grand Imperium, but that hope was faint at best as someone from either of those governments were as likely to kill him as help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I scared you, but I'd really like to go home, and any human you've met could be my ticket back,\" he apologized to the child as he walked back across the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However you've only answered one of my questions to you, while I answered both of your's,\" he said, and the wolf boy stared at him, not comprehending what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're name. I gave you my name and home, but you only told me where I am, not who you are,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. My name is Bruno. It is a pleasure to meet you Amadeus,\" said the wolf boy, which caused Amadeus to snick slightly, soliciting a hurt look from Bruno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would probably be a greater pleasure if we hadn't tried to kill each other at first sight. Still I've formed friendships under worse circumstances,\" said Amadeus, getting up from where he sat and walking over to his lean-to, tossing Bruno's cloak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go find your friends, or maybe a real medic to help with that leg of your's?\" offered Amadeus as he stepped up to the fire and threw a few hand fulls of dirt on it, casting the clearing into darkness. His eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light that filtered out of the skies, watching as the silhouette of Bruno struggled into the sheep...or rather ram skin, and then stood on his good leg. Grabbing his poker to use as both walking stick and weapon if need be Amadeus walked up beside Bruno and offered the lupine child a shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" asked Amadeus pointing back towards the direction where he seemed to remember the wolf boy coming. Bruno shook his head at the suggested direction and pointed a few degrees farther to the left. Without speaking the two set off in the direction Bruno had indicated. It soon became apparent to both that they would not have much time for conversing on the walk to wherever Bruno was taking them as their attention had to be focused on the forest floor, which acted almost like it was alive, with roots and branches constantly pulling at the two as they made their way farther away from the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly Amadeus did not feel remorse at leaving either helm or cloak behind. Having shared his origin with Bruno he did not feel it would be necessary to hide who he was to others. In fact the more he thought about it the more believed that announcing who he was might draw the lizard thing's friends to him, something he desired as they were his only clue as to how he got where he was, and thus his only clue on how to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo focused was he on his internal thoughts that Amadeus almost ran into the thing which crossed their path. It emerged from the brush, low to the ground and silent as it moved over the forest floor, it feet barely making any noise at all. Drawing his stick in closer he prepared to defend himself against the unknown being which then made its way into a small shaft of light that poured down through the branches and was revealed to be...</span></div></div>",

For whatever reason someone appeared to have created a small foot tall rabbit mechanoid that was making its way through the forest, banging on a drum, and after a moment it stopped, spun one of its sticks in the air and moved in a circle for a second before moving on, running into a glowing circle of blue that Amadeus knew hadn't been there a moment ago, and vanishing in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a usual example of this planet's fauna?\" asked Amadeus of Bruno, pointing at the spot where the rabbit bot had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've never seen anything like it before,\" commented Bruno, looking as astounded as Amadeus by the creature's sudden appearance and disappearance. For a moment he looked like he was going to continue, but then he stopped as Amadeus started snapping his fingers and getting a thoughtful expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Bruno, wondering what the human could be thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It just feels like I've seen that bunny somewhe-Wait, I've got it. If I'm right then he should be here in 5-4-3-2-1\" he said, pointing towards the spot where the rabbit came from. When the count reached zero everything in the woods seemed to grow still, and Bruno looked on in anticipation, but after several seconds nothing happened, and he looked back over at Amadeus, about to say something, when a new crashing sound caught his attention and he looked over to find a new form come stumbling out of the woods behind the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always slow,\" said Amadeus softly as he looked over at the figure. The man, for indeed it was a human, wore a suit not unlike Amadeus' own, except his was white all over rather than gray, and at the shoulders, hips, and waist there were odd gold colored rings that didn't look like they served any purpose other than decoration. The newcomer, not yet aware of the two staring at him, gripped a rope in one hand and looked around frantically for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you, you stupid rabbit,\" he complained, his eyes darting everywhere. They briefly passed over Bruno and Amadeus, but he didn't notice them at first, instead doing a double take a moment later and falling over backwards in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" he swore, pointing at what to him would be the outline of a huge creature as Amadeus and Bruno were leaning on each other, causing their shapes to blur together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell indeed, Mr. Wilco,\" said Amadeus, amusement evident in his voice as he chuckled at the sight of the man on the ground. Walking over he helped Bruno against a tree before holding out his hand to help the unknown human to his feet. The man didn't seem keen on taking the offered appendage, until he took a close look at the face of Amadeus in the dim light, and then his own face brightened considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amadeus, is that you?\" he asked in astonishment while Amadeus pulled him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. And you're still Roger Wilco, right?\" responded Amadeus, and the two walked over to the tree where Bruno was leaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me. So, how'd you get ahead of me? I left you four portals back,\" commented Roger, to the obvious bewilderment of Bruno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably did, but if you remember, you're traveling through dimensions, meaning time moves differently. To you it's been a few minutes, to me about three years have passed,\" said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My years or your years?\" asked Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine, which makes it about twenty-one of your's. Oh and this here is Bruno, a native of this planet. Bruno this is Roger Wilco, a friend of mine from back during my days with an old military unit. From what I remember you got in a bar fight and ended up hoping portals between dimensions chasing a mechanical rabbit, is that right?\" asked Amadeus, and Roger nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. If I can catch that thing it'll take me home, at least that's what I was told. By the way, you wouldn't happen to have seen it anywhere, would you?\" asked Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it went into a portal over that way,\" said Amadeus, nodding in the direction the bunny had gone in before vanishing into the now invisible ring of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Roger simply, quickly getting up to pursue his prey. The portal appeared again as he got close and with only a second's hesitation he leaped into it, taking it with him as he vanished in another flash of light. When the human was gone Amadeus let Bruno lean on his shoulder again, and the two set off once more in silence, though Bruno's face indicated that he had a question or two on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why didn't you go with him?\" asked Bruno at last, hoping the reason wasn't that Amadeus had stayed to help him. Amadeus, surprised by the question, stopped in mid stride before turning his face towards the wolf boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want to get home, Bruno, not killed, and in truth Roger's more lost than I am. At least here on this planet I know there's someone who can help me, if he ever comes online that is,\" said Amadeus, and then the two set off on their way again. Bruno didn't know who this person who could help the human was, but he didn't think he wanted to know, all things considered. Hopefully Danielle or one of the other adults would know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few more minutes of hiking for the pair to burst through the tree line into a well kept, and oddly well lit field at the edge of the woods. The state of the place was actually something akin to the sporting events Amadeus had seen, though the cheering quickly hushed when they noticed the particulars of the figures that emerged from the woods. Amadeus wondered exactly what it was Bruno had been doing, but kept his question silent in favor of the more immediate problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medic!\" he shouted as loud as he could, and several figures broke away from the crowd in the stands. One had the unmistakable red cross on a hat, though the form was that of a snake. Amadeus was struck again by the red plus sign being a near universal sign of a medic, though he shook off that bit of trivia as the person wearing the hat got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's got a hair line fracture in his leg caused by the application of focused local pressure. I don't feel any bone chips, but I'm not familiar with his details, so the damage might be more severe than I can diagnose,\" he told the serpentine, who slithered over to the duo as Amadeus aid Bruno gently on the ground. The snake didn't appear to have any tools, but put the tip of its tail on Bruno's leg and pressed several times before turning towards Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your observation was correct. I'll have to take him back to the hospital for a full check up but I think he'll be fine. Lucky for him you were in the woods,\" commented the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm the one who hit him, after he tried to eat me,\" admitted Amadeus, just in time for a few of the other figures, namely a sheep girl, to enter hearing range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hit Bruno?\" she said, outrage evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I defended myself from his attack. If you wish some form of satisfaction from this you may have it later, but for now I think getting Bruno to the hospital would be our best course of action,\" responded Amadeus, not trying to change the subject, but rather stating fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right Corrie. Let's get Bruno to an ambulance, and then we can find out the details of how he was hurt. Kevin, if you would?\" asked the snake doctor as a large rabbit humanoid stepped forward, Together he and Amadeus lifted Bruno off the ground, and they as well as an oddly mixed group of followers started making their way towards the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to have noticed Amadeus' details yet, or that he was human, but two of the figures in the group, a rabbit female and a hedgehog female, were eyeing him. Before the group could get to the stands though a shout and several cries could be heard as the veritable sea of bodies parted, allowing a new form to pass through. As it came into view Amadeus was once more face to face with...</span></div></div>",

He leaped through the gathering of people, and made his way towards the stands where the lizard creature was already being joined by two of it's kin, all almost three meters tall, with wicked spiked tails, and claws foot long claws on the ends of their fingers and toes, each spike appeared to drip something that caused the metal of the stands to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked the largest of the creatures, looking around for someone. In answer one of the large of the people there to see the game stepped forward and stood in the lizard things way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't know who you're looking for, but we've got a situation here, so please let these people pass, and then maybe you can search for this person,\" he told the lizard thing, which eyed him. Without comment or word the lizard thing simply reached over, picking up the anthromorphic humanoid at his waist, and tossed him into the crowd, which began to run away from the trio of terror which roared and hissed at anyone who got close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask again, where is the human?\" said the largest one, and his question was answered a second later as Amadeus stepped forward through a bit of the crowd that had rushed onto the field in panic. Unafraid he faced down the large reptiles, spinning his walking stick at his side in a show of skill before slamming it into the ground beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you guys wouldn't happen to be related to that thing in the junkyard this afternoon, would you? If so I have some questions to ask you that he didn't have time to answer before he went boom,\" said Amadeus, hoping to get some reaction out of the things. One of the smaller ones appeared to be about to charge forward, but the leader stuck out his arm and blocked the overanxious one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, our father's ally wants this one alive, remember? So, Amadeus Orman, position Arrow Two, callsign Amadeus Ex Machina. We've been waiting for you,\" said the leader, and it was Amadeus' turn to react. Obviously despite his lack of information regarding the lizards they knew a lot about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've done your homework about me, but I seem to have misplaced my notes about you guys. How about you give me a review before the big test?\" he said mockingly towards the large lizard thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. Where are my manners? I have no name, as we don't use them, but others call our species the Grendal. You may have heard of us,\" responded the large lizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't some old warrior kill one a long time ago,\" said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beowulf in legend slew the thing after which we are named, yes. But believe me, no mere human could beat us. Allow me to demonstrate!\" the last was a shout as the creature lunged at Amadeus, claws forward. Amadeus, unable to back up enough to avoid the strike, instead ducked under it, and then rolled to the side, bringing his legs around in an arc to hit the legs of the Grendal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grendal, seeing the hit coming, leaped out of the way, and before Amadeus could rise to his feet he attacked again, leaping forward and forcing Amadeus to raise his walking stick in defense, only to have the inch thick piece of wood broken in half by the attack. Not pausing the Grendal lashed out with it's tail, trying to pin Amadeus to the ground, but Amadeus rolled again, and before the Grendal could recover he now faced a standing Amadeus, who twirled the two halves of his stick like batons in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute. Let's see if you can take as well as dish out though,\" said Amadeus, this time rushing forward to the attack. The Grendal, who hadn't expected the maneuver, struck blindly in a horizontal slash with its claws, missing with both swings and leaving Amadeus to pop up in the area between the two arms. Before the Grendal could react Amadeus drove both sticks into the things eyes, not stopping until they hit the back of the thing's skull with a dull thunk, and knocking the huge lizard over backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire scene went silent at this point. The two remaining Grendals didn't look like they really grasped what had just happened, and the rest of the crowd, seeing how easily the large Grendal had dealt with the much more intimidating man in the crowd was awed by the skill the human had shown in taking down the huge lizard. Unfortunately, one of the Grendals recovered quickly as it noticed that Amadeus was unarmed now, and drove into the attack with a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus, not caring about his lack of weaponry, repeated what he'd done to the first Grendal, ducking under the strikes of the large lizard, and rolling out of the way is it's tail came down on him. Unlike the first one though he spun back around before the Grendal could recover from its attack, and then with an unusual stance he drove his foot into the side of the Grendal's tail spike, causing a loud crack to echo over the field, followed quickly by a howl of pain from the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping forward he grabbed the spike and rolled to a stop a few meters in front of the Grendal, brandishing the spike he'd just stolen as his own weapon. The Grendal, blinded by pain and rage didn't hesitate to strike forward, pointing it's claws at Amadeus and diving at him. Amadeus, seeing the attack coming easily rolled under it, and came up under the thing's chin, driving the stolen spike into it's lower jaw, and causing it to fall over dead right in front of the larger one he'd killed a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the reaction was much different from the crowd, as many cheered the human on, and the remaining Grendal looked at the small puny thing in disbelief. It couldn't understand how the other two had been beaten by the thing, but quickly determined that Amadeus needed some kind of weapon in order to take him down. With that thought in hand the final Grendal shot forward, slashing with it's hands, but not allowing the tail spike anywhere near the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus, seeing that the Grendal would not be obliging in offering its own weapon for him to use against it. Still he'd been unarmed against bigger creatures than the Grendal, and won every battle he'd been in. Dodging the attacks of the smallest of the three Grendal he found that this one was actually quite skilled at hand to hand, artfully altering the course of its blows when he avoided them, forcing him to take ever more extreme angles in his stance edging him closer to falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to give up without at least one attack he noticed that like the other Grendal this one had a gap in its stance right under its chin. Even after seeing him exploit this hole twice the thing apparently not learned to cover it, probably thinking Amadeus didn't have the ability to deal any damage to it without some form of weapon. Throwing all his weight forward Amadeus aimed to prove the creature wrong, falling right into that small hole in the creature's defenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up he stared right into the soulless eyes of the Grendal, and he found no compassion there. The thing fought not to avenge the fallen comrades it had seen killed before its own eyes, but simply to prove that it could succeed where they had failed. Seeing that in the eyes of the creature made Amadeus that much more willing to kill the thing, and he shot upwards, leaping with his hands held up, palms flat so that they smacked the Grendal's head so it was looking straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arc of ascent peaking in from of the Grendal's head Amadeus threw his foot out, using all his weight to start himself spinning, and bringing his other foot to connect with the Grendal's head. Turning he heard rather than saw the Grendal's neck snap, and when he again had his feet on the ground he looked over his shoulder to find himself staring at the top of the lizard thing's head rather than its chin, its head having done a complete one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the lizard fell forward, and Amadeus was forced to leap out of the way as the now dead body of the Grendal slammed into the dirt at his feet. Sweating after the battle he wiped his brow as he got to his feet and looked around. Before anyone could cheer this time though, the sound of clapping and a dry chuckle came from the direction of the now empty stands, and out of the shadows from which the Grendal had first appeared a new form stepped. This one...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Impressive Amadeus. Truly impressive,\" says the figure as it steps from behind the bleachers into the stadium lights. The figure, clad in an oddly shaded blue robe, was lightly clapping his hands still, and from somewhere hidden in the hood of his garment he was chuckling in what could only be considered an evil tone. Slowly the figure made his way down the steps to the field, and the crowd which had begun to gather around the human, parted to allow his passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never have expected you to beat one of the Grendal, let alone three of them in a row. Even knowing the things you've done in the past weren't really enough to do you justice,\" said the figure, his tone almost friendly with Amadeus, as if the two were familiar with each other, and meeting again after years apart. Amadeus' own expression remained guarded though, showing that even if the figure knew him, he didn't know it. One in the crowd did though, and turned to another to ask a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that one of the Rabbit Council?\" asked Danielle of Kevin, her voice a hushed whisper, and he did a double take, looking first at her, and then at the figure, and then back at her again. When he looked to her the second time he was shaking his head no, but one look at his face would show anyone who knew him that he wasn't really confident of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be. The Council doesn't leave the warren. Maybe he just copied the robes,\" suggested Kevin to his cousin in the same voice, but he looked at the figure with new eyes, and before anyone spoke again the figure turned to face Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, my dear traitor. Our otherworldly cousin is quite correct. I am indeed a member of the World Council,\" proclaimed the figure, pulling back his hood to reveal that his words were in some part true, as he was a rabbit, though whether he was a member of the Council or not was still not completely confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to fight the Easter Bunny now? This day just keeps getting weirder and weirder,\" said Amadeus, and again many eyes were drawn to him, including the exposed rabbit anthro who chuckled again at this latest verbal shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have just gotten you're first strike Amadeus, as I am just a humble rabbit, and never got to play that particular role. The traitor has though, so if you want to fight the Easter Bunny I suggest you fight him,\" said the figure, pointing his thumb at Kevin. Amadeus, though, would not be distracted, and continued to stare at the one before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care for titles that much friend, but since you seem to know as much about me as the Grendal did, how about you give me the same courtesy they did and tell me your name?\" asked Amadeus, and the figure stared at him a moment before resuming that evil chuckle of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, you really don't waste any time with the verbal stuff, do you. Straight to the point. Very well then, my name, if you must know, is Daemon Veris, or at least it is now. I had another name before my involvement with a very interesting group a few years back, but after the traitor's cousin betrayed us even more so than he did, we fell apart and I had to distance myself from them,\" said Daemon Veris, staring angrily over his shoulder at Kevin, but oddly did not include Danielle in his piercing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that one died fighting us, so she got her's in the end, and then this little whelp came from the other world to take her place,\" Daemon said, turning his back to Amadeus, and walking towards Danielle. The rabbit cupped his hand and grabbed Danielle's chin in his strong grasp, causing a fox to leap forward, hoping to block him, but when the rabbit's other hand shot up in a choking gesture. George, the fox and Danielle's husband, stopped in mid-stride and began clawing at his neck as if he really was being choked, despite the distance between him and Daemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this, murderer. This particular discussion is between me, Kevin, your lovely bride from another world, and of course our visitor from the stars,\" declared Daemon, making a sharp slapping gesture, sending George reeling backwards. An instant later Daemon released Danielle, who stared at him a moment before running to the side of the fallen fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my business with them can wait. Right now all I'm supposed to be interested in is you, and how to bring you back to my master alive,\" said Daemon, staring at Amadeus, who again found himself looking into the eyes of someone who wanted to use him. Not really a new thing for a four hundred year old soldier, but this was the first time such a stare came from someone who looked like a rabbit in Jedi robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm guessing you and the Grendal are in cahoots then?\" asked Amadeus, hoping for an affirmative answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes unfortunately, they are among my associates, though I try to avoid them and those like them, whenever possible,\" said Daemon, and Amadeus smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that means you'd know about my little altercation in the junkyard this afternoon, correct?\" Amadeus asked, and Daemon nodded, his expression saying plainly that he had no idea where the human was going with this particular line of questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so how about you tell me where my little brother is. Then maybe we can talk about me going with you,\" Amadeus told him, and again Daemon's expression was one of clear puzzlement, until he suddenly snapped his figures and pointed at the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean the digital form? Well, like you, he has a part to play, so my master took the opportunity you provided to acquire him. Of course I'm sure if you join him he'd be happy to give the bit-brain back to you. Heck he'd even be glad to send you home after you've fulfilled his request,\" offered Daemon, and Amadeus looked at him questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I to assume then, that it was these masters of your's who brought me to this world?\" asked Amadeus, and Daemon shook is head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. As powerful as he is, my master can't reach across the universe. Other hands brought you here, but my master was quick to take advantage of it,\" explained Daemon, and Amadeus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I have one last question then. Exactly who is this master of your's, and what is it he wants from me?\" he asked point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my master wants from you I really don't know. After all I'm second generation, if that, and in an example you would grasp, an ensign does not know what is on an admirals mind,\" he said, and Amadeus nodded again, understanding the metaphor quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for who he is, I don't know that either, as we are all told to call him Emperor, but I think you'd be interested to know that he's the Emperor of a very special group called the Ap-Gara,\" said Daemon with his usual chuckle, though the change on Amadeus' face showed that whatever this Ap-Gara was it could scare the hell out of him, as he went slightly pale at the mention of the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Amadeus, since you recognize the name, how about you just come with me, and you can meet my master. That would be the easy way, or you could try and oppose us, but if you remember your history, those who opposed the Ap-Gara previously met with some rather violent deaths,\" said Daemon, and Amadeus again nodded, remembering images from history tapes that showed the devastation wrought on Earth just before Exodus by the creatures, self proclaimed gods, who called themselves the Ap-Gara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the depths of his mind he began to sort everything into place, listing to himself all the odds of his choices. It was in fact quite likely that the Ap-Garan Emperor could get him home, and would even give him back Zee if he gave him what he wanted. The problem was he would likely be sacrificing the entire planet and several others in the deal. After a long pause he finally stared into the eyes of Daemon and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I was afraid that would be your answer. Unfortunately for you, if you don't come with me by choice I've got orders to press the issue. Also for the record, that is strike two on your part,\" said Daemon before throwing his hand out. No one saw any other movement but Amadeus stumbled backwards as if struck, and they realized quickly he was using the same mental powers he'd used on George but moments ago, and many in the stands who had been frozen up until this point became unfrozen quite quickly and made for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few moments had passed only the tight group standing around the fallen wolf boy and the fox man remained, this included a few rabbits, some other wolves, and the serpentine doctor, all of which looked at Daemon with fury, but stood aside, knowing full well the rabbit would kill them without any effort at all, in the same way he'd nearly killed George. This left Amadeus to rise to his feet on his own, using the back of his hand to wipe away a small squirt of blood on his chin and look at the rabbit with a glint of amusement in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just took out three creatures that probably could have ripped those antique vehicles from the junkyard apart with their bare hands, and now you send a psychic punch at me and expect me to stay down. Boy do you have a lot to learn about humans, bunny boy,\" said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Well then perhaps you'd educate me. Say tell me what it would take for you to join our little party. My master, the Emperor of the Ap-Gara could literally offer you anything your heart desires,\" responded Daemon Veris, meeting Amadeus with his own smile, though this one having a much different look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see. First off you can stop being evil, second you can give me back my brother, and last you can get you master to take a nice long stroll in the event horizon of the nearest black hole. Do those three things and I think we can come to some arrangement,\" offered Amadeus in mock seriousness, causing Daemon to chuckle at him a bit, before throwing a second mental punch, though this one didn't even seem to make the human flinch as Amadeus just stood his ground, smiling at the anthromorph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna know something, my friend? You make a lousy first impression. First you take my brother, then you interrupt me after a really fun fight and threaten me, and now you hit me. That's three strikes against you, and that means you get only one warning. The more that hit you, the more that will,\" said Amadeus, his tone getting slightly cryptic on the last phrase, which seemed disconnected from the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before anyone could breath the human reached to the ground and hurled a stone at the rabbit, forcing Daemon to raise his hand and cast the stone aside with a mental shove, but before he could even blink two more stones flew through the air at him. He pushed these aside, and yet more began to fill the air as Amadeus dipped and leaped, grabbing any stray piece of hard material that he could find and hurling it at Daemon, who realized instantly that he was doomed. Amadeus was on the offensive, and he was on the defensive, the human wouldn't let up now, at least not until his target was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus did they battle, Amadeus even reusing previous projectiles as he spun around the rabbit in a circle, constantly tossing things at him. It soon back apparent to Daemon that Amadeus was a brilliant tactician, as the number of projectiles began to increase, because Amadeus was now gathering clumps of dirt and compressing them before tossing, and until he touched them Daemon couldn't tell which attacks were the stone, and which were imply dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then all at once it was over, as Amadeus broke Veris' guard with a dirt clump striking him on the right shoulder. As innocent as this sounds Daemon's guard faltered, and suddenly two more clods collided with him, throwing him off even more as stones with the force of a pitcher's arm connected with his knee, sending him to the ground with the sound of breaking bone and screams of pain. After that three more stone were flung in quick succession, and suddenly Daemon Veris was crippled as both his knees and elbows had been broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" reprimanded Amadeus as he stepped towards the rabbit man, his breath coming out in ragged gasps. As useful as the tactic had been, Amadeus' condition spoke of the cost it took from his body, and he literally collapsed to the ground beside the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, are you gonna talk now?\" asked Amadeus of his prisoner, who continued to cry with the pain of his injuries, but was able to respond through clenched teeth with a swear that caused the younger of the two wolf women to cover the ears of what looked to be her son, the wolf boy wearing shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now that's too bad, cause if you know me like you say you do, you know I don't take prisoners who don't wanna talk,\" said the human, picking up several rocks that were sitting nearby. He juggled them for a moment before tossing all but one aside, and then raised this one above his own head. It took the group, and Daemon Veris a moment to realize that Amadeus was telling the truth, and that Veris' life was about to be taken in cold blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it!\" shouted someone from inside the group, and out of it stepped a shorter, but obviously older rabbit woman than Danielle. The female looked at Amadeus with a matron's eyes, demanding that he not walk down this road, a road who's end was covered with blood, both innocent and guilty, though in truth the human had lived on that same road most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why shouldn't I? He was willing to kill the fox man, George, I think is the name the rabbit woman called out,\" responded Amadeus, never taking his eyes off Daemon Veris, who's face, when his death had seemed imminent, was now twisted in pain. As willing as he had been to kill, it was obvious Veris had no desire to die. In Amadeus' opinion that made him a lousy soldier, and lousy soldiers existed only to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he was, but that doesn't mean you have to kill him. Look at him, he's helpless now. He can't even move,\" she told him, as if that somehow erased his past crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That merely makes him an easier target, as any true soldier would tell you,\" responded Amadeus, raising the rock above his head once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a soldier, so I wouldn't know, but I know when someone's beat, and he is. Why don't you try asking him your questions again?\" she purposed to him, and Amadeus sighed. He knew the instant he'd paused his hand that the rabbit woman would not allow him to kill Daemon, and her argument made sense, but Amadeus hated prisoners, as they were so hard to keep locked away. Corpses on the other hand usually stayed exactly where it was you left them, unless some fool necromancer, deathwalker, or whatnot raised them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" he said to the rabbit woman, letting the stone fall to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me where your bosses are, and maybe I'll let you live,\" asked the human of the rabbit, but before anyone could respond or do anything the sound of snapping fingers echoed over the nearly empty stadium, and suddenly a shot of flames, black as night, fell onto the field in which the group stood, and it struck Daemon with a fury that none there could understand save Amadeus, and turning to the stands everyone looked upon a human form, like Amadeus', but this one was wreathed in flame as black as those that had consumed Veris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why didn't you just ask, Amadeus? I could have just said \u2018right here' and saved you that whole fight sequence,\" said the figure, as he slowly walked onto the field. Despite his fiery appearance, none looking at him could feel the flames, and the grass remained unburnt as his feet passed over it, but when they looked back at Veris, or rather where Veris had been, only a small pile of ash remained, the rest being consumed by the flames that burned so hot they even consumed light, yet the man who wielded them did so with such control that he could grasp a snowflake in his palm and it would not melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Veris wasn't lying, he really does work with the mutants and freaks of the Last World War. Pyro, isn't it, one of the Four Elementals?\" asked Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, that is what people called me. Master of the Black Flame, and second only to the Emperor himself,\" said the figure within the fire, and surprisingly Amadeus began to laugh at his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Yeah right. The History I read says you were the lowest of the original Nine Ap-Garans. And if anything the Four Horsemen were above you and the Elementals, with their leader, Kinetic, being the second in command of your little terrorist group,\" responded Amadeus getting to his feet, which seemed to cause Pyro's flames to grow around him, as if that little statement were enough to fuel his flames, but a moment later he calmed down, and then Amadeus did something no one would have expected.</span></div></div>",

It was also very possible that even if Amadeus did leave and wait for the CAP to come to him, who ever was hunting him could easily follow the CAP and find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was worth the risk, Amadeus crawled as quietly as he could passed the unknown enemy.  Unfortunatly, it only took a few sniffs of the reptilian's nose to spot Amadeus.  This new attacker looked exactly like the previous one, but even more angery as it snarled at Amadeus.  Amadeus tried to dodge but was pinned under the beast's claw in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a distance, three figures were mumbling to each other, one was holding a rectangular box over it's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"So, the guy is pinned down and is about to be eaten or whatever they are about to do to him.\" the first one with the rectangular box.<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I get the point, you were right the first time,\" the second one replied \"just find that frequency you beat boxing fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the end for Amadeus, untill somthing very intresting happened.

He also wore large head phones and sunglasses.  Holding on his shoulder was a rectangular metal box with two speakers, Amadeus remembered that it was called a boombox.  There was also a dragon wearing a lab coat and what looked like an android with a keytar and covered in a flexable neon material.<br>\r\n\"Dude, we need to get out of here before the batteries in my boomer box die and big and scaily wakes up\"  replied the human \"Spark, get the guy from under the claw, and Rave-N, look out for any more unwelcome guests.\"<br>\r\nThe dragon then began to pull Amadeus out while the android scanned the area.</span></div></div>",

The character comes from the Mirrored Emperor stories written by this author under the pen name Simon Sez. The world comes from the comic strip Kevin and Kell about a wolf married to a rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kevin and Kell comic strip can be read at herdthinners.com.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mirrored Emperor stories are avalible upon e-mail request to this author<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuggestions, requests, or any other input is welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCast of Characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus Orman(Human, Male)<br>\r\nAge: 26 CSY(Combine Standard Years, roughly equals 420 Earth Years)<br>\r\nEquipment: Standard Combine Survival Belt which includes a Startec 32K Pistol, a pouch for carrying various knickknack such as an old flute, and a coin. On the back of his belt is clipped his Cyber Assistant Program, or CAP, an EI(Emergent Intelligence) which he calls Zee, contained in what resembles a small PDA, though it can create a physical shell that resembles anything Zee wants it to if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin Dewclaw(Rabbit, Male)<br>\r\nMarried to Kell and adoptive father of Lindesfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKell Dewclaw(Wolf, Female)<br>\r\nMarried to Kevin and mother to Rudy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindesfare Dewclaw(Hedgehog[Formally a human], Female)<br>\r\nAdoptive daughter of Kevin, from his first marriage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRudy Dewclaw(Wolf, Male)<br>\r\nSon of Kell, from her first marriage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle Kendall/Kindle(Rabbit[Formally a human], Female)<br>\r\nInterdimensional traveler through one of the gates created by the time machines used by the avians, now posing as Kevin's deceased sister and married to a Fox named George Fennec, who happened to have been in love with the original Danielle Kindle before her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge Fennec(Fox, Male)<br>\r\nMarried to Danielle and copartner of Kevin's business called HareLink<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay rules for additions<br>\r\n1) There is no set chapter length. If you want to add it can be as short or as long as you like, however it has to be understandable. If I can't figure out what you said, it get's deleted.<br>\r\n2) This story is told in the third person, though the perspective can change if you want.<br>\r\n3) Try to have fun with this, if you want to do something completely insane like have an energizer bunny suddenly roll across the area where the star is, go ahead, but always remember rule number 1, I don't get it, and it goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n::UPDATES::<br>\r\nRules for Additions<br>\r\n4) You are allowed to play with the backstory of Amadeus or any other character as long as it does not conflict with the chapters prior to your addition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember you add/review me, and I'll do the same to you. Or if you prefer I could give you GP instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell with nearly a thousand views, and more text than some real books I know this is now my longest single project to date. Still with only one addition I am disappointed in the response of the readers. What am I doing wrong? Why does no one add?</td>",
