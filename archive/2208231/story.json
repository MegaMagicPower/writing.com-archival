So they start gaining weight for any reason you can think up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are no weight limits, but there are only two restrictions: 1: slob isn't allowed, as the focus is the fat bodies of the girls, not what's on their fat bodies. And 2: Only females from the series can gain weight, having the males like Sly get fat as well would defeat the name/purpose of this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternative expansion methods like blueberry inflation, regular air/water inflation, vore, and pregnancy, can be used to spice the story up if you wish, but the primary emphasis must always be on expanding the girl's bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy</td>",
