His parents disowned him and he is struggling to find a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda is a beautiful woman who just got her doctorate, but her beauty prevents people from taking her seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff is a middle aged man fixated on his past athletic achievements. He has a wife and two daughters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille is a lesbian who is tired of one night stands and wants to find a girl she can spend the rest of her life with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these people are wishing for a change in their life. They each take their problems for granted and it is about to bite them in the butt. There are two ways that these characters can change. They can switch lives with someone, but remain physically the same. Or they can switch bodies with someone and retain their own life. For example a man switch lives with a woman. From his perspective he is still a man, but to the rest of the world he is 100% female. Or a woman switches bodies with a man. She now has a man's body, but the rest of the world still sees her as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich character do you follow?</span></div></div>",

His new wife, Lisa, was a woman that you longed for. For a brief moment in their relationship they broke up and you were able to swoop down on Lisa. Your relationship with her was brief, but intense--you both fell madly in love. It was the happiest you ever were in your life. She loved you and Justin equally, but she ultimately got back together with to him and you felt a large void ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was he married to the girl of <i>your</i> dreams, but he was incredibly handsome too. Chiseled jaw, muscular, and over 6 feet tall. Your envy was reaching a tipping point when you finally yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I wish that I had his life!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the words leave your lips you feel a strange tingle course through your body. It passes a moment later and you shrug it off. You go back to watching TV and being mopey. After a few hours you start to get hungry. You head into the kitchen and start to look for something to eat. As you are searching you hear the apartment door being opened. Justin was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last box huh?\" You asked as he walked into the kitchen. They had just bought a house to together and they were moving in today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! I can't wait to have my own home!\" His voice was giddy. You ignored him and went back to searching. He loses interest and retrieves the last box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best of luck out there.\" You try your best to be sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Erik.\" He sets down the box and shakes your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he is gone you sit back down on the couch. \"...Fucker.\" You mutter under your breath even though he was there to hear you. You finally turn in for the night. When you wake up the next morning something is different.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't your room. It was bigger and completely rearranged. You turned over and investigated the shifting weight next to you. It was Lisa. Her long blonde hair perfectly fell to the side of her delicate face. Her perky breasts were exposed and they rose and fell with each breath. Her big blue eyes slowly opened and stared into yours. <i>Shit...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Oh I am so sorry! I don't know how I got in here!\" You jumped out of the bed and backed away from her. Where the fuck was Justin? He was going to kill you for this for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin what are you talking about?\" <i>Why did she just call me Justin?</i> \"You aren't usually this disoriented in the morning.\" She laughed and kicked off the sheets and rose from the bed. She slowly sauntered over to you. Her hips swayed as she moved. She doesn't say a word and when she was only an inch away, she keened in and kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, fuck it!</i> You returned her kiss and your heart melted with happiness. It's like your relationship never ended. \"I love you Justin.\" Her voice was low, but unmistakable. She really thought you were Justin--your wish came true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself. You didn't have Justin's athletic body--your pudgy belly is clear evidence of that. But none the less Lisa saw you as her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned her sentiment. \"I love you too Lisa.\" You broke into a smile as the words left your lips. They felt good to say. Her face exploded with happiness and she kissed you again. This time more passionately. Her hand slowly wandered towards your hardening penis. She gripped the shaft and you moaned quietly. Was this really happening? <i>This has to be a dream!</i> She pulled the boxers down and your dick sprung free. You stepped out of them and you were completely naked. She climbed back into the bed and motioned for you to join her.</span></div></div>",

The way she called you by his name drove more horny than anything else. You reach up and start to fondle her perfect breasts. <i>How can such a skinny girl have such huge tits!?</i> You leaned forward and started to suck on her erect nipple. She started moaning and grinding her legs together. You reached between her legs and felt her moist vagina. Your lips leave her nipple and you pry her legs open and start licking her dripping cunt. She can hardly take it. \"Don't stop!\" She writhed in pleasure as your tongue moved in and out of her. \"Fuck me now!\" She screamed as she orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to beg for it.\" You smile and gripped her closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Justin. Please fuck me!\" That was enough for you and you drove your cock into her. She pawed at your back almost painfully hard. Her nails scratching wonderfully. It only took three thrusts before you exploded into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Lisa.\" You smiled as you looked down at her. She looked like an angel. She smiled and cuddled next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Justin.\" You both slipped into an early morning nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you've been switched again!</span></div></div>",

Surprised, you nearly drop the coffee mug. <i>What the hell just happened?</i> You thought as you set the mug down on the table you were sitting at. <i>My head fucking hurts!</i> You reach up and rub your temples. Something slows your movements. Hair...long hair. You pat your head down and feel the strange wig attached to you. Why were you wearing a wig? You started to pull it off and winced in pain. <i>Fuck is this real hair??</i> You stood up and tried to gain your bearings. The weight of the hair on your head felt odd, but the rest of your body felt odd too. Like you weren't wearing a shirt. You looked down and gasped. You were wearing a white sports bra! The restrictive clothing was covering your pectoral muscles but left your midriff exposed. You looked further down and saw that you were wearing grey yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God what is going on?\" You said as looked over your body. You were crossdressed with a realistic wig attached to your head. Your abdomen was still flabby, but now completely void of hair. You pressed down on your stomach and were surprised that they felt toned and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room you saw an ornate mirror hanging on the wall. You approached it cautiously starting to believe what had happened. Your reflection confirms your suspicions. You were Lisa! At least you had her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit did my wish actually come true?\" You couldn't believe it. You moved your hand and Lisa copied your movement. You felt your pudgy stomach again and watched as Lisa touched her taut stomach as well. Again you could feel powerful abdominal muscles underneath the fat. \"Do I have her muscles?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was a professional dancer and ballerina. She was in incredible shape and was extremely flexible. You had seen her drop to the floor doing the splits like it was nothing. You reached between your legs and touched your thighs. They felt firm and pliable. Could you do the splits now? You slowly sat down on the floor in front of the mirror. Lisa copies you--she has a look of curiosity on her face. You move one leg out and move into a hurdler's stretch. Something easy that you could already do. You don't feel anything! No pain or struggle. You slowly lower your face closer to your kneecap. You are reaching past your normal range of flexibility and you weren't in any pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your other leg and slowly pull it outward. You can't believe it! You are actually doing the splits! You look up at the mirror and see Lisa's face beaming. You look down at yourself and see your penis straining against the yoga pants. This was turning you on! Lisa's reflection has a damp spot on her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back up and walked to the table that you first \"arrived\" at. You pick up the coffee mug and take a sip. Green tea. You were about to spit it out when you realized that it actually tasted good! <i>I thought I always hated green tea...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso on the table is Lisa's phone. <i>I wonder if Lisa is in my life now? I should probably call her.</i> Suddenly the phone vibrates with a text message. You unlocked the phone and read it. It was from Justin, her husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa, I gonna stop home on my lunch break. See you soon! :)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should tell Justin what happened. That could be helpful or a very bad idea.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and walked back over to the mirror. <i>Damn Lisa is cute.</i> You unlocked her phone and snapped a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imgur.com/wpGtr1x\" target=\"_blank\">http://imgur.com/wpGtr1x</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I can't believe that I look like this!\" You grinned. \"I have Lisa's life!\"</span></div></div>",

It seems that Lisa was already dressed for it anyways.\" But how would the rest of world view you? Would they see the beautiful girl reflected in the mirror or would they see a strange crossdressing man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to risk it. You step outside and feel the warmth of the sun beating down on your scantily clad body. It wasn't even noon yet, but it was already hot outside. You take a hairband from your wrist and tie up your long hair into a ponytail. You sit down on the porch and make sure that your shoes are tied. They are pink trainers. You put in a pair of headphones into your ears and select a poppy sounding song. You usually hated that kind of music, but you felt that it was appropriate. You stand up and stretch your already limber legs. You look down the sidewalk and bound off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed to know in your mind exactly what path to take for the run. It was about 3 miles long and went near a lake. You were taken off guard that you seemed to know this. How did you? You had never been to this area before. In fact you didn't even know what city you were in. Your breathing starts to increase and you feel your chest bounce up and down. <i>Why is it bouncing? I don't have any breasts.</i> You thought as your tried to not think about the feeling of the non-existent boobs bouncing in your sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you could see the lake that you somehow knew about in your mind. It looked quite crowded for an early saturday morning. Kids were splashing in the water and teenagers playing beach volleyball. This is the first time on your run that you have come across anybody relatively nearby. <i>Time to see how they react</i> You thought as your started running past a group of teenage boys sitting on a picnic table. You turned off your music hoping to hear them say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that chick?\" One guy said. \"Holy shit she has a godly pair of legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you ran past. They saw you as Lisa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to draw more attention you quicken your pace and the lake slowly disappears from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrive back at Lisa's home, drenched in sweat. <i>I hope Justin is back at work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously open the door. The house sounds quite. You exhale in relief and take off your shoes and walk to the bathroom to take a shower. The floor creaks as you walk through the empty house. It is almost eerily quiet. You find the bathroom across from Lisa and Justin's bedroom. It isn't anything amazing, just a bathroom. You look into the mirror above the sink and make Lisa's sweaty face smile. You then start to take off her sports bra with glee. Lisa's breasts are firm, pert and slightly upturned. Probably a B or C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gingerly cup your chest and slowly rub your nipples. <i>Wow that feels good! My nipples are way more sensitive!</i> You start the shower and let the water warm up before stepping in. The warm water against our smooth skin feels incredible. You can feel your body relax and you reach for the shampoo <i>Mmm...strawberries.</i> You smile as the delicious smell reaches your nose. You start to lather up your long hair and start to hum one of the songs that got stuck in your head while out on the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower you dry off and get dressed. You find a pair of pink panties a grey tank top. You are again enamored by Lisa's reflection as you attempt to get her looking beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay...maybe one more selfie.</i> You think as you realize that you are becoming as camera obsessed as Lisa was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imgur.com/5xgclzd\" target=\"_blank\">http://imgur.com/5xgclzd</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed that you could use a camera to see how you really looked. You walk back to the bathroom and finish getting dressed. You grab a snack from the kitchen and sit down on the couch to watch TV for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while you start to get antsy. Maybe you should go find Lisa. The thought keeps nagging at the back of your mind. But Justin would be home soon and you didn't want to put any unnecessary strain on their marriage.</span></div></div>",

It was a quick drive, you had no idea that she lived this close. Soon you were staring down your own door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa answered the door and your heart fluttered at the sight of her. Even though you had her reflection and could stare at her whenever you wanted, she was beautiful standing there in front of you. She looked different though. Her hair was short and boyish, just like yours used to be. Her clothes were bland, but fit her petite frame. You could tell that she wasn't wearing a bra underneath her t-shirt because her nipples poked through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa,\" She said to you, her voice was nervous. \"What are you doing here?\" Her cheeks were already turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at her. \"Oh I was just in the area and I thought I'd come by and say hey.\" You liked seeing her like this, squirming and obviously still infatuated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh things are okay I guess.

You always had a massive crush on Lisa ever since Justin introduced you to her, but never acted on it for fear of ruining your friendship with Justin. But now that everyone thinks you are Lisa and Lisa thinks she is you, you can pursue a sexual relationship without fear of him ever finding out. You could even call the wedding off and make Lisa your wife...husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned a smile to Lisa and asked if you could come in and use the restroom. Knowing that Lisa wouldn't turn you down, you went inside when she said yes. As soon as Lisa closed the door, you planted your hands on her hips and kissed her. Lisa received your kiss well but eventually pulled back after about 10 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Lisa? If Justin found out he would kill me.\" Lisa told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained that you and Justin were taking a break from each other and you had your eye on her (Erik). You move in and begin kissing her again. After what seems like an eternity, you put your hands under her t-shirt and lift it over her head, exposing her bare breasts to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lisa wraps her arms around your waist and squeezes your butt. It feels weird making out with a woman while she is mauling your butt. Usually it's the other way around. Once she had enough of your butt, she pulls off your tight shirt and unhooks your useless bra and quickly got to work sucking on your chest. Although it felt amazing, you kinda wanted to suck on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leads you to the living room couch where she pushes you down and tears your yoga pants and panties off in one go, exposing your erect penis with a landing strip above it. As she stands above you she unbuckled her belt and dropped her jeans and boxers exposing a vagina covered in matted brown hair. You finally got Lisa naked in front showing you her full glory. Your cock was rock hard, yet something just wasn't right. Lisa finally lowers herself on top of you and for some reason begins moving her hips as if she is thrusting in and out of you with an imaginary penis of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how weird this has turned out, you're experiencing too much pleasure to stop. She grinds onto you for about two minutes until you feel like you're about to orgasm. Unfortunately before you do, Lisa makes some grunting noises and you feel a warmth spread across the inside of your scrotum. As Lisa got off of you, semen oozed out of your penis and all over your lap. \"Did she just come inside of me and finish before I could orgasm?\" You thought. Lisa seemed oblivious to the fact you were a little upset about finishing without getting you off. As a guy, you never had to worry about this. \"I need to piss.\" You told her as you went to your old bathroom while still fully nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom, you closed the door and sat down to pee. Not only urine came out, but a large quantity of semen also slowly oozed out of his penis. Once the felt most of it was out, you began masturbating on the toilet. You felt on edge and had a primal need to finish what Lisa started. It took you a few minutes and a lot of moaning (something you never did) but when you finally orgasmed, it felt different. Instead of feeling pleasure concentrating around your groin, it spread out over your whole body to the point of making you feel weak in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you recovered, you got up and looked yourself over in the bathroom mirror, still not used to seeing Lisa's reflection staring back at you. After freshening up, you went back to your old living room to get your clothing. Lisa was there wearing nothing but a pair of boxers while eating a bag of chips on the couch. You sat down next to her and began getting dressed again. As you leaned forward and put on your panties and yoga pants, she stared at your phantom breasts. \"Was I always like this?\" You thought. Now I understand why women think guys can be assholes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce fully dressed, you decided to talk to Lisa who was living your life...</span></div></div>",

Erik had a lot of questions that needed to be answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, he needed to deal with Lisa.

If you didn't know any better, you'd assume that it was the only show on the entire cable channel. It being the only show you've ever seen on it while channel surfing. You are about to reach for the remote and flip it off when you notice something weird. There is a chubby man wearing a bikini and is sitting next to Janice Barsamian in the family's hot tub. It takes a second process, but you recognize that the man in the bikini is you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Belle? Should we fly out to Venice and visit Dad?\" Janice asks <i>\"you\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whateva you want Jan. Me and Molly are gonna look for a party tonight and get <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>f***ed</b></font> up!\" Your doppelganger replies with a spot on valley girl impression. He is even talking like Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" You stop and try to clear your throat. \"What the fuck?\" So it wasn't your imagination. Your voice register was higher! You jump to your feet and feel your body jiggle in strange places. Sure you were chubby, but your chest and butt never actually <i>jiggled</i>. Your eyes dart downward and are met with a strange sight: two large mounds protruding from your chest. You quizzically extend your index finger and press it into one of the lumps. Your eyes widen as your digit depresses the squishy sphere. It felt odd to say the least. Almost even pleasant. These were definitely breasts. No question about it. Not flabby man-boobs, but real female breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally your hand moves to the next logical location: your penis. But before your hand even ventures into your boxers, you already feel the distinct absence of your cock between your legs. It feels weird, the vagina between your legs. You gently run your hand over your flat crotch before quickly recoiling. You had a FUCKING vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ...\" You reach up and grip your forehead only to find long strands of hair between your fingers. \"Shit!\" You needed to see yourself. Now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes scan the room for you cellphone. There, on the coffee table! Your trembling hands open the front facing camera and you gasp at what you see. It's Belle Barsamian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wide eyed, open mouthed expression matches exactly the face that you are making. You scrunch up your nose and Belle scrunches her nose. You stick out your tongue and see does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have Belle's body.\" You look back at the television and see <i>\"yourself\"</i> taking shots with Belle's friend, Molly. \"And she has mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back down on the couch and watch more of the show more intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn't anyone say anything?\" Your body has since changed into a pink v-neck and tiny cut-off jeans. Absolutely ridiculous, yet nobody bats an eye. They treat her as if she is Belle and not some weird cross-dressing man posing as a seventeen year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if that means that...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you hear the jingle of keys and the front door unlocking. Justin was back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How goes the job search, Erik?\" Justin asks as he walks into the living room. You can hear a slight annoyance in his voice. But other than that he doesn't say anything about the seventeen year old reality star sitting on his couch and wearing his roommates clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally wipe the sweat from your forehead. He still sees Erik: the lazy, chubby loser and not a hot, busty teenager. \"Funny you should ask. I was just about to head out.\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better take a shower first dude.\" He said with a sniff. \"Cause you fucking stink.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never in your wildest, perverted fantasies did you ever imagine that you would become a woman. But when you suddenly found yourself on your hands and knees getting fucked in the ass by a girl with a strap-on you realized something horrible (and amazing) had happened. Your wish had come true and you switched lives with Camille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCami acted like a stereotypical goth, even at 24 years old. She wore her hair short and dyed it black. She had piercings and tattoos just about everywhere <i>(and you soon learned where everywhere meant)</i>. She worked at a record store and was living with her younger, much more adjusted brother, Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of that changed almost a month ago. You were finally getting accustomed to living Cami's life. You see, when you suddenly switched with her you didn't get her body. Nope, you still had your flat chest and more importantly, penis. But you could slip into her personality and access some limited memories if you concentrated. Her suave demeanor even helped you score a few one night stands. At first you could hardly believe that these gorgeous lesbians were practically lining up to fuck you. Needless to say it quickly went straight to your head. <i>I'm a lesbian now!</i> With each passing day going back to your old life seemed less and less appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke one Friday morning feeling extra giddy. It was almost the weekend and some of your 'new' friends were throwing a house party later tonight. You yawned and stretched before meandering towards the bathroom. You absolutely loved showers now. Your skin now felt much more delicate and smooth to the touch. You toss off your shirt before stepping into the shower. Curious fingertips traced over your pierced nipples as warm water trickled downward, stimulating them. You shivered and gasped--their extra sensitivity was something that still surprised you. They were a lot more fun now not to mention more interesting than before the switch. Whenever they were pinched or sucked on, electricity would shoot through your body. It was hard to believe that such small things could bring you so much pleasure! You turned the shower faucet and stepped out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dried yourself off and examined your fingernails. They were still painted black, but starting to chip. You placed your hands on your stomach and moved them down to your cock. It didn't take much to make you horny these days. Cami's nymphomania was now yours and often demanded release. Not that having a girl's life was erotic enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Cami...I am a girl...and I am a lesbian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved saying this over and over. The juxtaposition alone was almost enough to get you off. The entire world treated you as a woman despite your male body and it was almost intoxicating. You loved being called ma'am or miss. Just being in the situation of men flirting with you made you horny despite having no attraction to them. You started to stroke your penis, but stopped yourself from getting too distracted. <i>I'll have a girl do that for me tonight</i> you grinned. You cockiness was reaching dangerous levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to getting dressed. You pulled up your black panties and buttoned your torn skinny jeans. They were tight, but worn and comfortable. Bras were now almost natural. Cami had very large tits (your most complimented feature now) and even though you didn't have them, it was somehow still painful not to have the support of a bra. Probably some magical stipulation for the switch to work. With your invisible breasts secured in place you button up a flannel shirt over them. <i>Very stereotypically butch Erik...</i> You laughed and smeared gel into your black hair. At least you didn't have to deal with a lot of hair. You start on some eye make-up. Somehow you mastered the smokey-eye technique within hours of your first experimentation with cosmetics a few weeks ago. <i>Perhaps I gained more than just her personality</i>. You were happy with the results, but felt something was missing. You tongued your lower lip and decided to put your piercings back in. Snakebites. You finish and smile at your reflection. Even though, from your point of view, you looked nothing like the real Cami, you still looked feminine and could definitely pass as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what do you do before the party?</span></div></div>",

You weren't quite sure the specifics of Cami and Jake's relationship. They obviously didn't like each other, but since you've become Cami your relationship has improved. You liked Jake. He was a few years younger than you, but seemed just like you (when you were still a guy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Danny is hot.\" You pointed out when her tits were on screen. Jake just awkwardly nodded and you laughed. Making him uncomfortable was something Cami loved to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two marathoned through the show and soon it was almost time for the party. \"Oh by the way, Cassandra is having a house party. You can come too if you want, but its going to be pretty gay.\" You laugh knowing that its going to be almost exclusively lesbians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, but have fun sis. Don't drink too much. Text me if you need a ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed back to your room and grabbed your purse. <i>Dildo, lube, weed, pipe, lighter...</i> You grinned and started packing these items into your purse. Definitely Cami's idea of a fun night. You couldn't wait to get some pussy.</span></div></div>",

I thought the party would of taken off already.\" You said disappointed as you hung up your coat. You looked down at yourself, quite happy with what you choose to wear. Torn jeans with a short schoolgirl skirt over them, a white v-neck with deep cleavage, and a loose skull tie around your neck. Cami liked to wear her snakebite lip piercings. You had them in too--at first you imagined they would get in the way of making-out, but they didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People just started arriving,\" Cassandra said as she walked to the kitchen. \"Help yourself to a drink in the mean time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily obliged her and started mixing a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few drink you were starting to feel buzzed. You walked back into the living room and started to play beer pong. You'd never played it before, but Cami was an expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...if I win you gotta make-out with me.\" You slurred your request to the cute blonde across from you. You took another sip. The girl looked hesitant, but agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou destroyed the poor girl. The girl reluctantly sauntered over to you and wrapped her arms around you. Your eyes met for a moment before sucking face. This girl was definitely the best kisser you'd experienced so far. Her tongue started to explore your mouth and you were in heaven. Your penis started to grow hard and she moved her hands down to your chest. She was about to started groping you before you stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better go someplace more private hon.\" You said to her and took her arm. You led her down to the basement. She saw a couch and pushed you unto it. She jumped onto you and continued where you left off. Her hands starts to squeeze your flat chest and you started to moan. Their sensitivity was off the charts. She pulled your tie off and bound your hands with them. She then lifted your skirt and pulled down your jean. Your hard cock was pressing the black panties to their limit. Thankfully she pulled them off too and your penis sprung forward. She took it in her mouth and started sucking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this girl's mind she was licking Cami's pussy, not sucking cock. She continued to suck and you felt your first orgasm coming. You weren't worried though. You could have multiple climaxes now. Another perk of having Cami's life. Your penis exploded over the girl's face. It wasn't jizz though, more like a vaginal discharge. And your penis stayed rock hard. You tried to struggle your hands free from their binds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled coyly and released you. You ripped her shirt off and gazed at her chest. Her bra was holding up some nice C-cup. You quickly undid her bra and started to suck on her nipples. She moaned and laid down on the other end of the couch. You were on top of her now. You ripped her pants off and revealed her glistening, wet pussy. You smiled and slowly inserted your penis into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain in this girl's mind you were simply tribbing against her. You were still a lesbian to her and not a crossdressing freak. You penis pumped in and out of her. Orgasms came a lot faster for you this way. And with no worries of knocking up this girl you let your juices shoot into her. The unrestricted sex was amazing. You were happy that you never had to worry about a condom ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ejaculaing 4 times into the girl, your juices were starting to ooze out of her. Though it looked exactly the same as hers so it was hard to tell. You finally pulled out and laid back. The girl, panting, laid down next to you feeling completely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is your name?\" You finally asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Holly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camille.\" You replied and stroked her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an amazing lover. I've only been with one other girl before.\" She confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad that I was your second.\" You grinned and played with your softening cock. You both fell asleep not long afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you...</span></div></div>",

But you were able to reach the top of the stairs without her waking. The upstairs was quite, Cassandra must of been still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped outside you shivered. The cold morning air blew against your torn jeans and chest. Goose bumps soon formed and you felt your nipples harden as well. You rubbed your arms and hurried to you car. Once inside you blasted the heat and drove home. While driving back you listened to some music. One of Cami's favorite genres: Screamo Death Metal. A month ago those three words would have never been used in the same sentence, but Cami's personality quickly took you over and you started headbanging along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh I need a shower\" You said as you locked the apartment door. Sweat and other bodily fluids from last night stained your body. You walked down the hallway to the bathroom and passed Jake's room. It sounded like he was still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped into the shower and quickly scrubbed yourself clean. You were careful to be sensitive with your nipples though.

You were in a bedroom. <i>Did I sleep walk into here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of the bed and instantly fall to the ground. It feels like a pair of dumbbells are on your chest and pulling you down. You groan and stand up. You wobble slightly as the foreign weight causes you to stand differently. You pat your chest down gingerly and note that it feels a LOT more sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear shifting in the bed you were just in. It was your cousin Marissa. Why were you in the bed with her? You went to sleep on the floor of the living room. It was Emily and Marissa that shared the only bed last night.

You lowered the toilet seat and finished peeing while sitting down. <i>That was weird. It almost feels more natural to go this way.</i> You looked into the bathroom mirror and finally noticed that something had changed about you. Your hair was long! You jumped away from the mirror and gripped the long locks next to your ears. How did you not notice it before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to piece everything together. How you and Emily had seemingly switched sleeping spots. Then you were reminded of the immense weight on your chest. Emily had huge, fat breasts. Then you remembered the wish that you made last night. To switch lives with her. <i>Fuck! Did that actually come true?</i> You approached the mirror again. <i>Do I actually have her life?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door and you jumped. \"Em are you in there?\" It was Marissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything and she knocked again. \"Umm yeah I'm in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up, I need to pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath to calm yourself and opened the door for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sunshine!\" She smiled and walked past you. <i>Holy shit! She didn't even notice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out into the living room and saw that the rest of your cousins starting to wake up. Emily was sitting up. She was wearing your thin, black hoodie. Her giant breasts stretch the cloth and you could see her nipples through fabric. \"Mornin' Emily.\" She said to you with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She thinks that she is me!</i> You realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the morning being relatively quiet. One of your other cousin started watching Pitch Perfect while everyone ate breakfast. You sat down with her and watched. You didn't notice at first, but you were really loving the music! You never really cared for it before, but somehow Emily's tastes must have been affecting you. Emily seemed disinterested now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie was over, everyone started to leave. \"Em did you want me to drop you off at your apartment?\" Marissa asked you. You had no idea where Emily lived so you quickly agreed to her offer. You went back to the bedroom and started to pack up Emily's suitcase. One of her bras was sitting on top. The once large cups were now tiny. To fit your flat chest you guessed. You picked it up and looked at the tag. Double H cup! Jesus was that how big she was? You quickly threw it was the rest of her clothes and zipped up the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lounging for the rest of the day, huh?\" Marissa asked as she noticed that you were still in Emily's sleepwear. A loose green t-shirt and pajama bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err..yeah.\" You said as you threw the suitcase into the back seat of Marissa's car. \"Just want to get home I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Alice I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit...Alice.</i> Alice was Emily's 3 month old daughter. Your daughter now.</span></div></div>",

There is no way you could take care of this child. Sure you liked kids, but you weren't prepared to have parenthood thrust upon you like <i>THIS.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically searched through your cousin's suitcase for her apartment key. Thankfully you found it and luckily it had the room number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walked down the apartment halls not knowing what would be waiting for you. You found Emily's room and hesitately inserted the key and turned the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily is that you?\" A female voice called out. You cringed at your new name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep it's me.\" The young women greeted you as you slipped off your shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just put Alice down for a nap. So she should be good for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for watching her.\" You reached into the suitcase to find your cousin's wallet. You paid the babysitter and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alone. You take a deep breath and start explore the apartment. It was well furnished and seemed quite cozy. At the end of the hall you saw Emily bedroom. You walked down the hall towards bedroom. You were on the verge of hyperventilating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room was a queen sized bed and a crib next to it. You approached the crib and stared at the small sleeping child in it. Your child. Suddenly you were filled with an intoxicating warmth as you watched the baby sleep. You felt happy! You instinctively started to stroke the soft head of your new daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly left the room and sat down in the living room. Was that a maternal instinct you felt? You were suddenly no longer worried about caring for the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes for a moment when you were suddenly awoken by Alice's cries. You jumped up and winced when your invisible breasts bounced painfully. That would take time getting used to. You entered the bedroom and gently scooped Alice into your arms. You realized that you knew exactly what she needed. </span></div></div>",

You opened the door and groaned. No such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess it wouldn't hurt to try...</i> You thought as you considered actually nursing Alice. Her cries were starting to get louder.

You let the shower warm up before you stepped inside. A shower was exactly what you needed right now. Your hair started to get heavy as water washed through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands started to explore your body. It felt familiar and foreign at the same time. You still had your penis thankfully, but everything was shaved. Your hands glided down your smooth thighs and back up to your chest. You cupped your flat chest. You could feel the soft flesh of your invisible breasts fill your hands. With your eyes closed you could honestly believe that you actually had breasts. You tweaked your nipple and let out a small moan. You let go and felt them sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to wash your hair with a fruity smelling shampoo. You tried to quickly finish up, not wanting to leave Alice unattended for too long. You stepped out of the shower and dried yourself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood there naked you realized that you needed to pee. You remembered back to this morning and how you almost peed your pants. Maybe you needed to sit down to pee now? It wouldn't hurt to try again while you were still naked. You stood in front of the bowl and aimed your penis. Like before, the urine weakly flowed from the tip and down your leg. <i>I guess that confirms that theory.</i> You sat down to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back into the bedroom. Alice was still soundly asleep. You looked over Emily's suitcase. <i>Might as well unpack it.</i> You unzipped it and dumped the contents onto the bed. Surprisingly she didn't pack a lot. Only her outfit from yesterday, her purse, and a toothbrush. You found her dirty laundry hamper and deposited the clothes. <i>Time to get dressed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room was a large dresser. You started at the top drawer and worked down. Bras and panties, t-shirts, jeans. You reached into the underwear drawer and fished out a bra. It was plain and peach colored. The cup size still read Double H. You struggled to put it on, but when you finally did you noticed an immediate difference. Your back didn't hurt and your invisible breasts jiggled a lot less. You felt ecstatic! You smiled and pulled out a matching pair of cream colored panties. It felt like silk as you pulled it up your smooth legs. <i>Wow I'm were wearing women's underwear! My cousin's no less.</i> They felt comfortable too. You opened the shirt drawer and put on a striped yellow and white v-neck. It hugged your body tightly contouring to your shape. If you could see your breasts, you would have a wonderful view of cleavage. Next were some jeans. You had to wiggle into them to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the wall mirror that hung on the back of the door. You had never crossdressed before, but you look really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down on the bed. On the nightstand next to you was a laptop. You reached for it and opened it. The background picture was you lying on a hospital bed holding a newborn Alice. You look absolutely exhausted, but happy. You shivered at the thought of you going through childbirth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up Facebook and start going through your cousin's profile. Unsurprisingly your body had replaced her in ever picture. Pictures of you in a prom dress, a bikini, and most disturbingly you with a large pregnant belly. You quickly shut the laptop not wanting to see that. How could you have even gotten pregnant let alone give birth? You lifted your shirt too look for a scar, but saw no indication of a C-section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I might as well do something.\" You said to Alice.</span></div></div>",

You wandered the building for a little while before finding the parking garage. You reach into Emily's purse for her car keys. You walked through the garage pressing car horn button until you finally found her vechicle. You secured Alice's carseat and punched in the nearest grocery store into Emily's phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a driving for a bit you arrived. Once you were inside you realized you had no idea what to buy. Sure, probably some baby food, but what for you? Did you even like the same food as before. You remembered back this morning when you watched Pitch Perfect. Your taste in music definitely changed. Whose to say your taste in food changed too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed Alice into the shopping cart and started going up and down the aisles. You found baby food and put that in the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went down another aisle and your eyes lit up. Wine! Emily was a connoisseur of wines. You picked out a bottle of white wine and licked your lips. <i>What would pair well with?</i> You thought as you placed in the cart. You headed towards the meat section. Your nose was assaulted by the smell of fish. You almost crinkled your nose in disgust before you realized it smelled delious! That would pair perfect with the wine. You picked up tilapia and continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot five minutes later Alice began to cry. You lift her up and rocked her back worth in your arms. She continued to cry. You smelt her diaper and recoiled. She needed to be changed. <i>Shit I've never changed a diaper before.</i> You placed her back down and searched for a bathroom. You hesitantly enter the women's bathroom. Luckily it was empty. You walked over to the changing station and laid Alice down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay diapers...How hard could this be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into Emily's purse and pull out a new diaper, some wipes, and baby powder. You undo the straps of the diaper and horrible smell of feces fills the air. You quickly toss the dirty diaper and wipe Alice. You powder her bottom and attach the new diaper. You just changed your first diaper. The first of many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the bathroom and went about shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter and hour you felt that you had the right food to satisfy your new pallet. You went the check out. You could tell that the cashier was checking you out. His eyes went to your chest of couple of words. You sighed and paid for your groceries. </span></div></div>",

You brushed off that thought and cracked your eyes open. That's weird. This wasn't your room. You rubbed your bleary eyes thinking that you were just half asleep. Nope same room. You started to worry. How could you have wound up in this foreign room? You kicked off the blanket that was covering your body and you yelped. You were wearing and oversized flannel shirt. Definitely not what you went to bed in last night. You swing your legs off the bed and stand. You look down at them and nearly fall back onto the bed. Your legs are hairless. There's no way that you could have drunkenly shaved your legs last night and there was no way that somebody could have snuck into your room and shaved them for you. Especially, as you looked closer, that there wasn't a single nick or cut anywhere to be seen. Your hands traveled down your thigh and back up it. It was strange feeling your legs so smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back up at the room and tried to figure where exactly you were. The room looked like it belonged to a teenage girl. Hanging on the back of the door leading to the unknown was a mirror. <i>Time to see what the damages are.</i> You think as you take your first step across the room. After a few steps you stopped because you felt weird. Your chest seemed to jiggle up and down as you walked, like you had something attached to them. You looked down at the large flannel shirt that you were swimming in to confirm that this wasn't true. You pushed the feeling from your mind as you approached the mirror. Your reflection was not what you were expecting, and you were expecting the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meredith?!\" You gasp as you look into eyes of the girl who reflected back at you. You clasp your mouth and she mimics you. You step back from the mirror and so does she. You raise your arm and she does exactly the same. You try to fake out the strange illusion, but can't. You pat your body down and confirm that you are still yourself, but Meredith expectantly does the same. For some reason you had her reflection. You walked away from the mirror, not able to stand the freakyness of the situation. You slump onto the bed and feel the jiggling sensation again. Wait. Was that feeling supposed to be her breasts bouncing? You lifted your hands up to your pecs and squeezed. Your chest felt squishy and spongy, but was still flat and toned. Your mind and body were not matching up and creating the strangeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to investigate the mirror once more. Her reflection seemed to do exactly what you did. So maybe it would do this. You unbuttoned the flannel shirt and quickly flung it open. Meredith's toothy smile broke across her face as you stared at her massive breasts in the mirror. They must have been at least a D-cup you guessed. You quickly forgot about everything thanks to those fleshly globes. They were still perky and had upturned nipples despite their size. You tried to to visually take a snapshot of this image when you saw a camera hanging from the wall. You didn't need a mental photograph now! As you grabbed the camera you felt a familiar feeling in your bladder. You needed to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the bedroom door out into the unknown house to search for a bathroom. End of the hall probably. There were a few doors along the hallway and you quietly snuck past them. What if Meredith's parents saw you! They'd think you were some kind of crossdressing freak wearing their daughters clothes. Thankfully you were able to find the bathroom without any difficulty. You stood in front of the toilet and whipped your penis out of the tight panties that you happened to be wearing. <i>So glad that I still have my cock</i> You think as you start to relax your bladder muscle. You quickly stop when the stream of urine weakly flows from the tip of your penis. Somehow you were required to sit down despite having the correct equipment to do the opposite. You lower the toilet seat and finish your business. It feels strange pissing like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood back up and faced the mirror. Meredith still reflected back at you. <i>Perfect</i> You thought as Meredith made a perverted smile. You opened the flannel shirt again and pressed your thumb to your left nipple and pointer finger to the other. The image reflected showed Meredith squishing her breasts together. The erotic image was perfect to capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imgur.com/dhhsScF\" target=\"_blank\">http://imgur.com/dhhsScF</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour penis was starting to strain against the tight panties as you prepared the next picture. You scrunched up your face and puffed your cheeks. While flexing your arm you took another picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imgur.com/EYPuJMr\" target=\"_blank\">http://imgur.com/EYPuJMr</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished that you could fuck this girl, but you knew that you couldn't. You pressed your hand up against the mirror and Meredith's hand copied you. This was the closest you could get to touching. Deciding to get a closer look you climbed up onto the marble counter. Your face was inches away from Meredith's. Her giant breasts were just out of reach. You moved your hand to your chest and made her cup hers. You could feel it's weight fill your hand as you snapped another picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imgur.com/S5sYi3N\" target=\"_blank\">http://imgur.com/S5sYi3N</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost fell off the counter. \"Mare are you almost done in there?\" Shit shit shit. The female was impatient. \"Mare answer me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to hop into the shower.\" You wince as your clearly deep, male voice answers her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up, we leave for church in 30 minutes!\" She didn't even bat an eye at your voice. Did she really think that you were Meredith? You climbed down from the counter and jumped into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to feel up your body with your mind's strange mental image, you quickly showered and went back to Meredith's bedroom. There on the dresser was a note. It must of been there the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Hello Erik, my love! I hope you are well and not scared. I thought that this would be the best way for us to learn something about each other! I really hope that magic spell really worked!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit she did this to you on purpose? You are furious that she would do this to you, but at the same time relieved that is possibly reversible. On a hanger next to the note was a yellow sundress. Did she want you to wear this? You didn't have time to decide as you heard the female voice yell again. You slipped on a bra, pulled up a clean pair of panties and slipped the dress on over your head. It was just as you were leaving the room when you realized that you dressed yourself like it was second nature. You were able to put on a bra with no prior knowledge. What the hell was happening?</span></div></div>",

You fidgeted with the bra that starting to dig into your shoulders. Meredith's knockers being invisibly attached to your chest was starting to get annoying. Sure they felt good, but you couldn't even see them without looking in a mirror! Not to mention their weight was fully intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mare!\" Your 'mother' quietly chastised you. \"Stop tugging at your bra, we are in public!\" You quickly moved your hands down to your lap. You pressed the yellow sundress across your smooth legs. Never had you had shaved legs before, and now you could see the appeal. You slowly pressed your thighs together and rubbed them together creating a warmth from the friction. Your penis wasn't happy about being stuffed into the tight panties, but at least you didn't need to worry about an erection coming to anyones attention. You smiled as just that started to happen. <i>Oops I probably shouldn't get myself horny in the middle of church!</i> You giggled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pastor started the sermon and you were out like a light. You never really went to church before. You started to daydream while the pastor continued to drawl on. Why were you suddenly starting to be okay with being Meredith? Some switch in your mind must of flipped. Was it Meredith's doing? It had to be. You were taken out of your trance by your 'sister'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mare, grab the hymn book.\" You grabbed the book from the back of the pew in front of you and handed it her. She stared at you for a second. \"Aren't you going to sing too?\" Crap. You slide next to her and look down at the lyrics while the organist starts to play. You were never really much of a singer, but you weren't terrible at it. But you were amazed at the melodic sounds that escaped your mouth. You noticed that after the hymn you were more attentive towards the pastor. Meredith's personality was starting to infect you. You should talk with Meredith asap.

The carpet had numerous stains, the vinyl curtain were yellow and some were torn. There were several piles of clothes on the floor, which she presumed to be dirty. The entire room smelled like a combination marijuana and cigarette smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda got out of bed, she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. She looked down and began rubbing her stomach. \"Perhaps I sprained my abdominal muscles\" she thought. After she recovered, Amanda began to search the room. The first door was a closet that looked as packed with tacky clothes that looked like they belonged in Walmart clearance bin and a bunch of baby stuff. The second door led to a hallway where Amanda heard people talking. She definitely did not want to face anyone while naked. She then opened the third door and was rewarded with a dirty bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Amanda went to the toilet and placed toilet paper over the seat. She had to pee badly.

After looking around the bathroom and not being able to find the woman she thought she saw, she looked back towards the mirror and saw the black woman once again as a reflection. Amanda tried to trick reflection by pinching her cheeks and making faces. Unfortunately the mirror always copied her movements perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman that was her reflection was not the beautiful blonde that Amanda was always known to be. This woman had dark brown skin, brown eyes and a big nose. Her lips were plump and her forehead was slightly big, leading to a mess of fuzzy hair that resembled an Afro. Her chin and jaw seemed to be the only features that Amanda even liked. As Amanda looked down the mirror, she saw a thin neck leading to a nice pair of breasts topped with large black nipples and teacup sized areolas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing Amanda knew, another black woman that somewhat resembled her new reflection opened the door. \"Hey girl,  I'm just making sure your ass is up for work\". Amanda walked out of the bathroom and sat down on the bed she woke up in. She was as trying to put all this together until she remembered the wish she made last night about being someone else. She went through a cheap vinyl purse sitting on the floor beside her new bed and found an expired drivers license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe license had a picture of a woman that resembled what Amanda saw in the mirror. Her new name was Tenisha Shanique Coleman. She was now 22 again and <br>\r\n66 inches and 124 lbs. She also found some cheap makeup, a hair brush and a little bag of weed. Amanda was never into drugs so she took the bag out and threw it onto the floor in a corner. Amanda didn't know what to do. She couldn't be this woman. If she was Tenisha, was Tenisha her? Amanda couldn't find a phone nearby. She needed to find a way to change back, but first it looked like she needed to go do this woman's job. Hopefully she could find a phone to call her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda sat up off the bed, she once again felt some abdominal pain. On her new dresser she saw an ID tag that said Tenesha with a McDonalds logo. Amanda searched the dresser drawers until she found a plain white bra. She looked at the tag and it read 36C. \"At least my breasts aren't that much smaller\" Amanda thought. After putting on the bra, she picked out a wrinkled McDonalds shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put the tag on the shirt and walked over to wall mirror that was inside the closet. She was expecting to see a naked black woman, but not a pregnant one. Amanda always wanted children, but wanted to find the right guy to settle down with. She was definitely not ready to be a mother. In the mirror Tenisha's belly swollen. Based on Amanda's guess she was probably 5 or 6 months along. Her hips were quite wide and thighs were thick. Amanda took off her thong and turned around to look at her ass. It definitely was big and bubbly. She examined the stretch marks on her reflection's belly. Amanda was always completely shaved around her vagina, but it looked like Tenisha kept hers wild and untamed. Amanda quickly put on the thong and some black slacks the smelled like grease and fries. The pants felt really loose and the shirt fit Amanda comfortably, however in the reflection, the slacks were skin tight and the shirt barely fit around her belly. She used the comb and a rubber band to put her hair into a pony tail. It looked terrible on Tenisha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed her cheap purse and made her way outside.</span></div></div>",

Tenisha began to wonder if she went out drinking and hooked with some rich guy, but she remembered going to her girlfriend's house and smoking a few blunts after work. Tenisha was positive she fell asleep in her bed. After stepping out of bed, she looked down at her clothing she was wearing. She always slept nude as it was both comfortable and freeing to sleep in. She quickly took off some baggy shirt and freed her 'girls'. Tenisha then noticed her stomach was flat as if she wasn't pregnant anymore. She started panicking and about the thought of being abducted and experimented on. \"I hope some crazy white dude didn't kidnap and drug me\" she said to herself. The room she was in looked nice and was fully furnished. Tenisha walked over to a mirror to see any signs of where her baby went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha walked up to the mirror and saw a topless white woman wearing the same sweatpants she had on. At first Tenisha thought she was looking at a tv screen until the woman in the mirror started copying the same motions as her. She started rapping one of her favorite songs and watched as the woman in the mirror lips followed her perfectly. Tenisha then looked down and cupped her breasts and watched as this reflection did the same. Some how Tenisha had become this blond white woman, one with a body of a goddess. Her breasts in the mirror were a little bigger than her actual ones, but were way perkier. Her nipples were small and bright pink and had areolas the size of a quarter. Her waist was thin and her abs were toned. Tenisha pulled off her sweatpants to get a better look at her new body. As she turned around in front of the mirror, she admired her thin but toned legs and tight butt that would look amazing in yoga pants. Whoever this girl was, she definitely would turn heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha walked around the flat she woke up in nude. Everything looked new or expensive. On a table by the door, she found a purse that she would never be able to afford. Inside she found car keys and a wallet with over 200 dollars in cash with several credit cards. Inside the wallet, she also found what she was looking for, a drivers license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda Nicole Williams. 29 years old. 71 inches tall and 155 lbs. \"Damn Amanda, you a tall one\" Tenisha said. Tenisha continued to look thru the purse setting aside the Audi key Fob when we found Amanda's work ID. \"This bitch is a doctor? No, I'm a doctor\" Tenisha said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a cellphone in the purse started ringing. Tenisha picked it up and answered it. It was...</span></div></div>",

I'll be honest with you, it's gonna take some getting used to looking at you in the mirror.\" Tenisha said with malice. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAmanda was hysterical at this point.

Believing that Tenisha had tricked her, Amanda was about to leave when she saw a familiar car pull up. It was her car, except it was driving way more aggressively than she would ever drive. As it got closer, she heard some very loud rap music that was too fast to understand. When the car pulled up to her, she saw Tenisha wearing some of her clothes and jewelry. Despite having a nice and expensive wardrobe, Tenisha picked the worst clothing combination. Her outfit looked mismatched and god awful with those large hoop earrings that her mother gave her a few years back. She swore she would never wear those things. At least she could still be right about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in bitch\" Tenisha said.</span></div></div>",

Amanda turned the volume down to zero and began speaking. \"Look Tenisha, first of all, I'm not some bitch. Second, you're gonna destroy my car if you keep driving like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Amanda, you're not a bitch, but this is MY car and I'll drive it how I want to. You're right, I can live like a queen if I don't know how to do your work. I expect you got a plan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda had to think quickly, she didn't come up with a plan yet and didn't want to end up on the street. Before she could answer, her old phone started ringing. She quickly picked it up and answered it without thinking of her predicament. It was Lori, one of the receptionists at her practice. \"Hey Lori, sorry I didn't call. I need you to rebook all my appointments for today. I know I missed a few already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori on the other end asked \"is this Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda played along \"Yea its me, I'm really sick and throat hurts. I'm probably going to be out for the rest of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Amanda. I'll let the others know.

Without thinking she started eating some raspberry jelly out of the jar and dipping pickles into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha came up behind her. \"Ha, prego cravings. I'm glad I'm rid of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda continued to sate her fill for the odd combination of food until all the pickles were gone and the jar of jelly was empty. Licking her fingers with the last of the jelly she fingered out. She made her way towards her master bathroom \"I'm taking a shower and then I'm throwing these clothes away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda wasted no time peeling off the rags she was wearing and stepped into the shower. She felt so great and relaxed that she stayed in it until her skin started to prune up and the hot water ran out. She had to have washed her hair at least 3 times. When she stepped out she began drying off with a fresh towel until she felt that somewhat unfamiliar movement in her stomach again. This time the baby kicked her bladder and she had to pee again. After finishing peeing, Amanda walked over to her wall mirror to look at herself again. The familiar reflection of the woman she now hated most looked back. She wasn't too far off of what Amanda wanted to look like, aside from being pregnant (questions she would have to ask Tenisha about later) and being black. Her new skin was chocolate colored and had some of scarring from probably poorly treated acne. Her breasts were probably a cup size smaller and sagged a little. Her nipples were erect and looked swollen. As she looked down, she saw how her belly button was already sticking out and stretch marks were across her mid section. Her new hips looked a little too wide, but probably helped with her unwanted pregnancy. Amanda continued to look down as she took stock of the body she inherited, she didn't like her slightly chubby thighs and boney legs. After lifting up her phantom belly she saw the wild coiled mane of hair covering her vagina in disgust. Putting her hand over her vagina, she couldn't feel any hair despite what the mirror was showing her. \"Totally weird\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 2 hours had passed by the time Amanda emerged from her former room. Based on her new reflection, she shaved her legs, armpits and lady parts. She dried and tried to brush her hair but her hair was much longer than Tenisha's reflection. After settling with a hair band, Amanda emerged wearing her robe with a white camisole and pink brief panties underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amanda did all of this, Tenisha...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Amanda went off to take a shower, Tenisha kicked off her designer boots and turned on the large screened tv with the remote. For a few minutes she switched through all the channels trying to find something to watch. Eventually she found her favorite channel, BET. After an hour she changed the channel again because a show came on about white rappers that she didn't like. \"Stupid crackers wanting to be gangster\" she thought. She didn't like being bored. At times like this she would go over to Deondre's crib to smoke blunts and fuck, but he's in jail for that shooting right now and wouldn't recognize her right now if wasn't in jail. The thought of Deondre pounding her ass made her nipples hard and her panties wet. While scrolling the TV guide she saw some of the premium channels and decided to order some porn. As the movie progressed she took her top and bra off and used one hand to play with a nipple while the other hand was down her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda walked in and was shocked. \"What the hell are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Passing time while you do whatever you do.\"  Tenisha said with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The curtains are open, the neighbors could be able to see you.\" Amanda scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my place and I can get my rocks off wherever and whenever I want. I kept my end of our bargain, you're staying in my place for now. By the way, that's MY bedroom you were in. You can stay in the spare down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was livid. How dare some strange woman lay claim to her bedroom. Her spare room didn't have a large bed or silk bedsheets or all her clothes. \"Look here Lady, this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...MY house?\" Tenisha interrupted. \"I can call the cops and have you thrown out, arrested even. Ever been to jail? I have, well you have now. On a felony even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda paused as she realized that she no longer had control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought\" said Tenisha. \"Look here girl, with my life, you're a high school dropout, a felon and a known drug user to the police. Your boyfriend that you inherited is named Deondre and is the father of your soon to be child. Luckily for you, he is going to prison for shooting some punk ass niggas moving in on his crew's street. If you talked to him like you just talked to me, he would knock your ass into last week. I'm in charge here. To the world, you're nothing and I'm everything.\" Tenisha finished as she started to cry. For the first time, she really was ashamed of the life she lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Amanda felt bad for Tenisha. It did sound like she has had a hard life. Definitely did not want to meet this Deondre though. \"Look Tenisha, I'm sorry. This whole changing bodies and losing all I've ever worked for is hard for me to cope.\" The room became silent as both women were trying to find what words to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha broke the silence. \"Since I woke up today, I was happy. This isn't the life I would want to live, but this life has everything I can't have. I'm sorry you got all my problems and mistakes I made. Now that I have your nice cushy life, I don't know what to do. I can't pretend to be white or a doctor. I don't wanna wind up back in the hood again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sat down on the couch next to Tenisha and pulled her into her embracing arms. It's gonna be ok. We'll get through this. I'm already working on a plan. First we need to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fell asleep easily as her pregnant and malnourished body was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tenisha took a quick and uneventful shower. After unknowingly drying off with the same Amanda used, she headed to her new room to look at her new reflection once again. Tenisha still couldn't believe it, in just one day her life totally changed. She just hoped she didn't screw up this second chance. Once she got bored of looking at Amanda in the mirror, she put on a thong she found buried in Amanda's dresser and hopped in bed. The sheets felt so soft and she got really comfortable. As she was trying to fall asleep her mind wandered to her baby that Amanda was now carrying. She wouldn't mind being an expectant mother if she had this life. Perhaps down the road once things settled, she would find the right man to start a family with.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenisha woke up refreshed. As she sat up in bed she momentarily was confused to where she was at until everything came back to her. Climbing out of bed she rushed to the nearby mirror to confirm what she remembered. Amanda's nude reflection stared back at Tenisha. Watching Amanda's reflection smile, Tenisha turned away happy. Rummaging through dresser drawers, she put on a simple white camisole and walked out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past the kitchen and down the hallway she knocked and entered the guest room where Amanda was still asleep. \"Amanda, its morning time to wake up\" amanda grumbled and didn't move. Tenisha pulled the covers back and shook Amanda's legs until she turned over and yelled at her to stop. Grumbling, Amanda sat up with some trouble and looked grumpy. \"It's 7:30 AM and you said we have a lot of things to do.\" Tenisha reminded her before happily leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was grumpy at first, especially when some black woman woke her up. Then it all hit her. The body swapping and the terrible day she had yesterday. She slowly got out of bed and felt tired and stiff and felt bloated. As she ran her hands over her body, she noticed that her stomach wasn't quite as flat as it was yesterday. Remembering that she was now pregnant, she figured her belly would catch up as the baby got bigger, for now though it wouldn't be noticeable to her if she didn't think about it. She went to the pile of clothes on the nearby dresser and started getting dressed. After a few minutes Amanda emerged wearing blue yoga pants, a pink camisole underneath a grey hoodie with the zipper undone. Her hair was messy and stuck out in odd angles as if someone used hairspray on it in her sleep, as much as she wanted to fix it, her belly demanded she eat. Arriving at the kitchen looking like a mess, Tenisha was already there wearing a nice set of hip hugging jeans and a form fitting t shirt. Tenisha was eating Amanda's cereal as Amanda went through the fridge looking for something specific. After a few moments she pulled out some bottled protein shake and chugged it down. Grabbing a bag of carrots, she went into the bathroom to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha's face greeted Amanda in the mirror. With a lot of water and plenty of brushing Amanda managed to get her hair in the mirror somewhat straight. Still unsatified she pulled it into a messy bun. Amanda spent almost an hour in the bathroom working on her face. Eventually Tenisha knocked on the door needing to use the bathroom. Amanda emerged with her hair in a ponytail carrying and empty carrot bag. \"Sorry, but if I'm stuck with your face, I needed to give it some of my magic and make it more me. I trimmed your.. err my eyebrows and gave myself a quick skin treatment. You.. well I look younger. Tenisha used the bathroom and did very minimal freshening up since she wasn't familiar with white people stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 9 AM when the two got into Amanda's car and left. First stop was a salon Amanda sometimes used when she needed to look nice for a meeting or convention. Tenisha pulled out her new credit cards and paid for Amanda's makeover. Amanda had her hair straightened and styled as best as possible while her nails were trimmed in a conservative French tips. Tenisha thought she looked great by white standards, although she rather impress white people than people like Deondre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the mall. Tenisha enjoyed this part. Both of them went shopping, more so for Amanda. She needed professional outfits for work that would fit her and casual clothes to wear among other things. With an Audi full of bags, the women went back to Amanda's place to put things away. Amanda was excited to put on her silk bedsheets that she missed and filled her closet and dresser with new clothes that she would need. After changing into some jeans and a red t shirt with a maternity band, she asked Tenisha to take her to the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process seemed simple. She told the desk officer who she was and what warrant she believed she had out on her. A female officer came out and cuffed her and brought into a holding area where she was searched. Searched would be an understatement, she was stripped and violated before she was able to get dressed and wait in a cell. After about an hour, another officer brought her into what looked like a mini courtroom. Apparently she had to see a magistrate and she explain herself. The magistrate was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something was up and he wanted to find out. \"Tenisha, this is getting old. It's like you're in here every other week. At least this time you turned yourself in instead of having us find you. Tell me what is so different this time?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was nervous, she never had been in trouble with the law before and didn't want to go to jail. \"Mr. Jackson, I'm so sorry.

Many people tried that over his years working for the law. But Tenisha was different, normally she was irate and rude.

She was poor, uneducated and indigent and she had a known habit for using drugs. Normally when someone skips out on a drug test while on unsupervised probation, they get 90 days in jail. However, Tenisha looks like she has something good going for herself and he didn't want to destroy that. Ultimately he decided to...</span></div></div>",

After getting out of the cell and making it out to the police station's lobby, she called Tenisha to let her know the good news and to ask for a ride home. Tenisha sounded happy on the phone and said she would be on her way over. Amanda was finally at ease. \"First major hurdle down\" she thought. While waiting for Tenisha she had her address updated to her apartment before waiting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stood on the sidewalk in front of the police station, waiting for Tenisha to show up when all of a sudden a couple black men approached her seemed to know her. \"Hey boo, how you been lately?\" One of the men said. Amanda tried to ignore them as she thought they were just trying to hit on her. \"Hey Tenisha, you bitch I'm talking to you!\" The first man said. Amanda had no choice but to respond, they looked angry and could easily hurt her. \"Look I'm not your boo and I'm not your bitch. So leave me be\" Amanda said with fake confidence. The second man then said \"youre  Deondre's bitch and Deondre wants to know when you gonna put money into his account.\" Amanda didn't know what they were talking about so she tried blowing them off. The second man then said \"if you don't pay up Deondre's account, he gonna find someone to kill your stupid ass.\" Amanda was now scared and tried to head inside the police station when they blocked and cornered her. Luckily an officer came walking by before the men could do anything to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda screamed for help as the two men ran off. Amanda immediately kneeled to the ground and began sobbing. The officer said something on his radio that she couldn't understand, then he helped her up and asked if she was ok. That's when she got a good look of him. He was tall and somewhat built, with dark hair and dark eyes. He looked like he was either Greek or Italian with an nice golden tan. Amanda was lost for words. \"I'm...um...fine\" Amanda choked on her tongue like a you school girl. \"I'm glad you're fine Miss...\" the officer said. \"Aman...Tenisha, I'm Tenisha.\" Amanda was so infatuated with this hunk that the almost forgot she was in Tenisha's body. \"Well I'm officer Maldini, Ceaser Maldini. If those men come by and threaten you again, let me know.\" Ceaser told her. Amanda was weak in the knees and felt a tingle in her panties. \"OK... was all she muttered as she stared at his butt as he walked inside the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Tenisha pulled up to the curb in her former car. \"Hey girl, get in. I'm missing my sho on BET right now.\" She hollered out the window. A coupl of people turned their heads. Amanda hopped in and closed the door. \"Tenisha we need to talk. Two men knew me...I mean you and they threatened to kill me if I didn't pay Deondre money...\" Tenisha said \"that's sounds like Trevon and Demarcus. Stay away from them, they kill people and they are Deondre's boys. Stay out of the hood and they won't be your problem.\" Amanda didn't mention the hunky policemen who saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home, Amanda went to take a relaxing shower while Tenisha watched some rap contest on BET. Amanda could hear the tv and Tenisha rapping in the shower, but she was too tired to care. After showering, she put on her signature bed attire, sweat pants and a loose shirt. Too tired to do anything else, went to bed.

Without hesitation Tenisha threw the blankets from the bed and towards the floor revealing her half naked body, Tenisha jumped out from the bed with Amandas firm breasts jiggling as she did so. Tenisha didn't have a care in the world for putting Amanda's bed back together nor did Tenisha share Amanda's courtesy of getting dressed before going to bed. Tenisha stood there proudly of the mess she had just made mere moments after waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention away from the mess and towards the nearby mirror she joyfully jogged towards it. Smirking to herself whilst giving a good squeeze of her new body's assets in the mirror, she had forgone such conservative values that Amanda had held and instead had decided to sleep in nothing but a pair of grey jogging bottoms leaving her bare chest exposed for all to see. \"dayum gurl, this bitch was stacked!\" Tenisha yelled out in excitement as she continued to play around with her new body. As she began to find herself getting lost in admiration of her own new reflection she suddenly came to a halt and exited the room. Silently shuffling her way down the hallway she slowly peeked through the side of the door that led to the spare room. Peering into the room Tenisha spotted Amanda in her body, blissfully  in a deep sleep of her own. slowly shutting the door allowing Amanda to continue her slumber within Tenishas pregnant body, Tenisha could barely find herself able to silence the excitement she felt within Amanda's body. Whilst she wasn't fully alone within the house she could get away with anything she wanted so long as Amanda or rather Tenisha she smuggling thought to herself, stayed asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly sneaking her way down the stairs and hushing her way towards the sofa she leaped over the back of it landing back first onto the sofa in the middle of the room. Tenishas mind began to race with all the joys that came with being in such a well maintained body such as Amanda's, though it was one thought of Tenishas that kept on returning to her time and time again. Just the other day Amanda, sorry Tenisha had interrupted you whilst you was attempting to pleasure yourself, why not continue on with that? With that Amanda's face lit up with a devilish smile. Raising her right hand up into the air then burrying it deep down into her grey jogging bottoms figuring her way around with her slim slender fingers. Finding her way towards Amanda's equally well maintained pussy Tenisha began to teasing rub around it with her new fingers. Biting down onto her bottom lip Tenisha began to feel the rush that kept her egging of for more. Turning  her face upwards as it began to beam red she caught a glance at the window, the curtains wide open. For a brief moment she stopped and hesitated remembering back to what Amanda had lectured her about back in her body. Tenisha shook of these feelings off hesitation, it wasn't Amanda's body it was hers and from now on she was Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha continued to let her hand run wild underneath her jogging bottoms, pushing and rubbing away at her neat pristine womanhood. Tenisha continued to plunge her fingers deeper and deeper within herself, gripping tighter into the arm of the sofa. Every push lead to a moan which she had to muffle as best she could. Bringing herself to a brief halt she pondered somewhat. \"dayum, this girls needs to get laid more. I think i might know just the guy\" Tenisha says with a devilish smile. \"though i think im gonna enjoy myself a little more first\" she continued as she once again got back to pleasuring herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tenisha ran Amanda's well maintained nails across her self, toying and teasing herself with every motion. Tenisha was lost in a world of pleasure yet it was never enough for her, never enough for Amanda's body. Amanda's body yearned for the real thing, like an addiction gone cold turkey. Tenisha grew in frustration as the thought crossed her mind, Amanda was so vanilia, so plain that she didn't even have any bedside \"toys\" of her own. Tenishas frustration grew and grew as she continued to plunge her fingers deeper and deeper, forcing herself to stand upwards slightly away from the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages began to flood Tenishas mind, images of her own memorys and Amanda's body's desires. Tenisha was finding herself craving the real deal, mere moments ago she had made the decision to continue to pleasure herself but by now she was regretting that choice. she was craving just a tease of the real deal, and Amanda's body was only making her yearn for it further. Tenisha continued to rub away changing speeds, bringing herself to the edge. she clutched the nearby pillow on the sofa and tucked it into her mouth, in an attempt to muffle her screams of pleasure. She reached her peak and let out a loud muffled screech of intense pleasure, spitting out the pillow as she sat there exhausted and tired. Whilst she had managed to finish herself off without awaking Amanda in her body and was thus far enjoying the afterglow something just didn't feel right to her. She wanted the real deal, both Tenishas mind which sex had become a daily occurrence too and Amanda's body, so deprived of a mans touch that it needed its fix. These two factors combined was enough to drive Tenisha to the point of insanity. Tenisha had only accentuated the cravings of Amanda's body, Tenishas began to retract her hands grabbing the nearby tv remote as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the tv to the first thing she saw, Tenisha began to attempt to change her focus onto something else. Though she found herself hung up for more, Amanda's body just wouldn't stop. \"dayum gurl, you need some dick or something, this body's hungry\" Tenisha said aloud in Amanda's voice. Tenisha began to look around the room catching a brief glance at the view outside, her memory's came back to her in a quick flash, almost as if Amanda's body was searching them for its own needs. With a body like this who would say no? Tenishas mind flooded her with memory's of when she used to work the streets, about how much men would pay just for 15 minutes of fun. Now armed with Amanda's body however she could easily get just as much action for a far higher price, maybe even get a few extras for herself for free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenishas could feel Amanda's body swell up once more in response to this line of thinking, but if she was gonna prowl around her old hunting ground she should at least wear a bit more first.  Tenisha rose up from the sofa, her new body still aching just a little as she began to silently walk her way upstairs. Quietly she peered once more through the door checking that Amanda was still asleep, smirking to herself at the sight of her body in a near comatose state she swiftly and silently crept into the room grabbing a hold of some of her original clothing. Slowly she made her way into Amanda's room that she had slept in last night, firstly heading over to the mirror and applying some make up. Nothing fancy or well done, instead trashy and bright similar to how she treated her old body, bright red lipstick and blue eye shadow. Tenisha then began to rummage around her bag of clothes that she wore back in her old body. \"haha yes gurl, this will work nicely\" she said in excitement as she wrapped her bright lime green tube top around her new bust, Amanda's breasts being strangled as they were tucked underneath the tube top.  Tenisha stood back up and inspected her ass one last time giving it a squeeze of confidence before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsneaking down the stairs one last time, Tenisha locked up the house and made her way to the car, opening the door and turning the ignition. Speeding off away from the house in excitement she headed down town back to her old hunting grounds searching for prey. after a few minutes she arrived and parked the car nearby, wearing nothing but the jogging bottoms she slept and masturbated in and a bright green tube top. although she was older now there was plenty of men out there who would jump at the chance to get inside her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha begins to stru around the block, what happens?</span></div></div>",

She could feel the breeze flow against her shoulders and stomach, which were left bare thanks to her bright lime green tube top. Tenisha's stride hastend with her growing hunger, due in part to her \"unfinished buisness\" from the sofa just under half an hour ago. Continueing down the street Tenisha could spot some familiar faces she once recognized, clad in a short leopord skirt and a skinny tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha didn't know this woman by name, but by what she was wearing and where she was standing in the street Tenisha knew what she was up to. The woman stood across from Tenisha spotted her, she quickly glanced at Tenisha's outfit, becoming jealous of Tenisha's new body. Tenisha stood out from among the crowd, she was one of the only white people amongst a majoritly black neighborhood. Not only that but her age and appearance did nothing to help hide hide amongst the other girls working the street, though this was not exactly a bad thing for Tenisha herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her was another woman, this one wearing a short denim skirt with a leather jacket being held open allowing the man stood in- front of her a full view. Tenisha's focus however was on the man admiring the view, Tenisha recognised him, a usual that she would often have sex with on nearlly a weekly basis. Tenisha knew exactly what this man was in too, just what it took to make him hers. He stood there, tall, black, handsome and well hung, Tenisha just had to have him. Amandas body began to grow in excitement just as it had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha walked towards the two and pushed the woman away before grabbing ahold of the mans dick through his jeans and gripping it tightly. He let out a brief smirk, Tenisha won as the other woman closed up her leather jacket and walked away. \"Your new around here, i take it your gonna be my fun for the evening?\" The man smuggly asked. Tenisha smirked back at his question \" honey, your gonna be my fun for the whole damn day\" Tenisha responded. \"So how much do you go for?\" He asked, Tenisha briefly hesitated before deciding to take advantage of her new body. \"We can sort out rates after, for now though how bought we go back to my place for some \"fun\" ? \" Tenisha teased, the man simply replied by leaning in and kissing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha grabbed his hand and rushed him back towards Amamda's car, the two got in and speeded of back towards Amandas house. Pulling up into the driveway Tenisha could barely contain her excitment \"wow, this is your house? How come you do this then?\" The man asked amazed at Amanda or rather Tenisha's new home. \"Well i got another job, i just do this for sport, but don't think this means your paying me cheap!\" Tenisha snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were both pulled up sat in the car and sat in the deiveway, what next?...</span></div></div>",

Their  \"fun\" continued as the two of them now both sat atop the front passengers seat, for a brief moment Tenisha managed to pull herself away from the mans face and began to peer out of the cars windows. This wasn't an un-familiar situation to Tenisha back in her old body, but now within Amanda's body and having the car parked in her driveway she had to make sure she had some privacy, after all if she was going to live out Amanda's life she would like to keep her reputation a little cleaner, heck maybe even Amanda would enjoy an audience when she goes back to working Tenisha's side job out on the streets. spotting no one within the area Tenisha leaned back further and pulled her lime green tube top off and away from Amanda's body, freeing Amanda's breasts from their constricted prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man couldn't help himself and instead placed his hands around Tenisha or rather \"Amanda's\" bare chest, Tenisha just simply looked back at the man and could tell he was enjoying himself. He was a regular, and Tenisha knew just exactly what it would take to get her cash. She simply let out a slight smirk as she gripped tightly around his throbbing member and positioned herself back on the drivers seat, though this time placing herself on her knee's. She pulled down his jeans leaving a big enough gap for his penis to jump out at her, she licked her lips seductively at the sight as Amanda's body made her desperate for the sight in front of her. opening her mouth wide, she wrapped her lips around his shaft, using her hot warm tongue to clean his dick up and down. Tenisha continued to use her mouth to pump away at the mans dick, and he was all to happy to be a \"gentleman\" and held back Amanda's long flowing hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenisha continued to use her borrowed body to pleasure the man, fueled on by Amanda's body and its urges.  Hitting every spot she knew the man enjoyed it wasn't long before he blew his hot load into her mouth. The man collapsed back into the chair, eyes shut as Tenisha raised herself back up in the drivers seat, chest still bare and cum covering her lips. Tenisha sat back in enjoyment, savoring the taste and the vents that had just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat next?...</span></div></div>",

You walk into the kitchen and see your wife Alex chopping up some vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is 34 years old. You both met in college. You dated for a few years, but when you accidentally got her pregnant you two got married. Alex had Anne when she was only 20 years old. She still loves you, but you know that she resents that you took away what are supposed to be the best years of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm something smells good!\" You grin as you kiss her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Jeff, I do have a knife in my hands.\" She jokes as you open the fridge for another beer. You force a laugh and walk out onto your patio. You sit down and watch as your daughters play in the back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne is 14 years old and into her first year of high school. While you wished you had a son, you are glad that she is already following in your athletic footsteps.

Alex homeschools her and spoils her rotten to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy come play with us!\" Lucy smiles. You put your drink down and walk over to them. Anne elegantly kick her soccer ball towards you and try your best to pass the soccer ball back towards your daughter. After playing with your daughters for a few minutes you are starting to get winded. <i>Fuck...what I wouldn't give to have their energy again</i> you thought as your walk back to your chair and beer. You sit back down and take a sip, Alex walks out onto the patio and gently strokes your hair as she watches Anne and Lucy play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exhausting isn't it?\" Alex laughs as your labored breathing returns to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. I remember when I was fifteen I could run forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reminisce Alex yanks the beer from your hand. \"Hey I was drinking that!\" You complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anne has soccer practice in an hour and you have to drop her off.\" Your wife explains and you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour you and Anne climb into your mini-van. She is all decked out in her soccer uniform. Usually it was your wife who dropped her off at practice. \"What time should I pick you up honey?\" You ask as you pull out of the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practice should be done around 6, but I wanted to hang out with my teammates after practice. Dawn said that her mom could drive me home afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't stay out too late tonight. You have school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the High School's soccer fields and Anne jumps out of the mini-van and starts jogging away. \"Bye dad! Thanks for the ride!\" She smiles. You beam slightly as she runs towards the fields.

Things used to be so easy with her. In the years since college, your friends have gradually fallen away; as they moved out of town, or they got too busy with work, or they started hanging out with their wives' friends instead, or they simply got tired of hearing you mope over past glories, your social circle grew smaller and smaller. And while you and Alex love each other, your marriage has never been easy; beneath Alex's dutiful affection and her resigned smiles, you know there's always been a simmering resentment over her lost youth. But Anne... things have always been easy with Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr they used to be. Back when she was your little football fan, your little cowgirl, your little superhero and warrior princess, you two understood each other in a way that Alex never could. She was a perfect little tomboy, and it delighted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that she's reached puberty, and now that she's entered high school, things are beginning to change. Sure, she still loves soccer, but she also loves fashion magazines and her dance team and boys. She's entering another world, and sometimes... sometimes it feels like you've lost your little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anne disappears behind the bleachers lining the football field, you whisper, \"I wish that I could be Anne's best friend forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you get Dawn's life but stay in your body, or do you get Dawn's body but stay in your life?</span></div></div>",

One minute you're peering across the passenger seat of your aging minivan, one of Anne's favorite pop singers filling your ears, and the next you're gazing across a field of green grass, dozens of teenaged voices chattering away behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you blacked out? You really haven't had that much to drink, have you? Two and a half beers over the course of a lazy Saturday should be nothing for you. You groan in confusion and raise your hands up to rub your eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly you're met with some kind of puffy green and white... THINGS in your hands. Startled, you give a shout and throw the things to the ground, where they land with a kind of hissing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down at your feet, you realize, gradually, that you know what these are. They're... pom-poms? Yeah, pom-poms, like Alex used to have, back when she was a cheerleader in college. You kick them experimentally with your shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you notice your shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not one of the dirty, beat-up sneakers you put on twenty minutes ago. It's still a tennis shoe, but it's clean and white with pink highlights. Bright pink highlights, like something straight out of Lucy's Barbie collection. You stare at it for a minute, and then your eyes travel up your body. You're also wearing ankle socks. And your legs are shaved, smooth and hairless. And you're wearing a pair of tiny pink shorts, showing off a ridiculous amount of leg. And finally, a white spaghetti strap tank top (you only know what spaghetti straps are from shopping for clothes for Anne, you swear) with the word \"Falconettes\" printed across the front. Something tickles the back of your neck as you move your head, and you reach up and find that your hair, now suddenly much longer, is tied back by ribbons into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even begin to process what you're seeing, you feel a pair of arms wrap around you from behind and a voice you recognize immediately shout, \"Hiya, bestie!\" You let out an embarassingly high-pitched shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeeze, sorry, Dawn,\" Anne says, laughing breathlessly, as you turn around to face her. \"You looked so serious,\" she says between giggling fits. \"I couldn't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn? You know that name. She's Anne's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God. It hits you all at once. It isn't possible, is it? It can't be. Things like this don't happen. Not in real life. But here you are. One minute you're sitting in your minivan, wishing you could be your daughter's best friend. And now here you are... and you've become your daughter's best friend, Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it can't be, you think, looking down at yourself. Sure, you're dressed in a teenage girl's clothes, but you're obviously still in your very male body, your junk clearly stretching out the pink cotton of your shorts, your beer belly sagging unattractively from under your tank top. There's no way anyone in the world would mistake you for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Anne called you Dawn, and she obviously doesn't see you as her dad. Otherwise, she would be mortified to see you crossdressing in front of her classmates, not laughing it up because she startled you. And none of the football players who are running laps in their practice uniforms a few feet away seem to notice anything strange about you, even though several glance your way (and you even catch a couple staring at your ass).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn... you picture Dawn. Petite, blonde, pretty, well-developed for her age (at 15, she's a year older than Anne), and very girly. Very, very girly. You've always been a little surprised, in fact, that she and Anne get along so well, considering how different they are. While Anne was dressing in shorts and playing in the mud as a little girl, Dawn was always in dresses and toting around her dolls. You suspect it's under Dawn's influence that Anne has been experimenting with fashion and makeup recently, and under her tutelag that Anne has begun to think about boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn is on the dance team with Anne; Dawn's mrother regularly drives them home. And Dawn is also on the... oh, fuck. The cheerleading team. Suddenly your outfit and the pom-poms make sense. Because, you realize, the soccer and football teams aren't the only teams that practice on Saturdays...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Anne says as her laughter finally dies down, \"I talked to my dad, and we're cool. He thinks I'm hanging out withe the soccer team tonight, so he won't suspect a thing. I'll meet you afrter practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh... sure,\" you stammer as you take this in. Your heart drops into your stomach, and not just because Anne has something planned with you, as Dawn, after practice. There's something that unsettles you more than whatever teen girl mischief you're going to get dragged into tonight: the fact that Anne lied to you. Even though you've apparently taken over the life of your daughter's best friend, you suddenly feel more like her father than you ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Dawn,\" a girl's voice comes from nearby. \"Hurry up.\" Snapping out of your thoughts, you turn and see a dozen or so teenage girls, dressed in t-shirts and shorts, tank tops and yoga pants, sports bras and sweatpants, standing around a short distance away. That must be the cheerleading team. YOUR team. Looks like you're late for practice. You cringe at the thought of prancing around and shouting cheesy cheers with them.</span></div></div>",

You feel a little queasy at the thought of that... like any red-blooded male, you've dreamed about hanging out in a women's locker room, but now that you actually have the opportunity to do it? Being a 34-year-old man in a high school locker room feels more than a little creepy. Especially with your daughter there too. Oh jeeze, and you won't just see THEM undressing; they'll see YOU undressing. And wearing women's underwear. And oh man, will you be expected to shower? Every new thought makes you cringe a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love ya, Dawnie,\" Anne says as she turns around and jogs toward the soccer field. You sigh, pick up your pom poms, and slump toward the cluster of cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the other girls (\"other\" girls? Did you seriously just think that?), one of them, a slightly older girl who's holding a clipboard, rolls her eyes and gives you a long, exaggerated sigh. \"Finally\" she says. \"You've wasted enough of our time, Dawn.\" She practically spits Dawn's name... she clearly doesn't like you much. Teenage rivalry. As a girl. Oh, that's goign to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, girls,\", Clipboard Girl says, turning from you to the rest of the group, \"let's warm up.\" For the next few minutes, the girl leads you through a series of stretches and exercises. You're pleasantly surprised by how easy they all are... you feel more fit and flexible than you have in years. You back and knee don't even hurt. It's like you're back in college. No, not even college... high school. You're still in your own body, but it's like you're a teenager again. Actually, you sort of are, aren't you? By the time you're done warming up, you're barely winded. You don't exactly want to be a girl, but if it means feeling this young and fit again? Maybe it's worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the girl with the clipboard--who you've decided must be the head cheerleader--describes the routine she wants you to practice. And to your surprise, you understand exactly what she's talking about. You shouldn't be able to follow her, but as she talks about the routine, you can picture exactly what she wants you to do. Somehow all Dawn's knowledge of cheerleading, all her experience, has been transferred into your mind. Do you have her memories? You squint and try to summon something up... but no, you can't remember anything about Dawn's life. Not from her perspective, anyway, though of course you have your own memories of Dawn. Apparently you've only acquired her cheerleading knowledge. As the head cheerleader rambles on, though, you're grateful for that knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne part of the routine is something called a \"liberty\" stunt. You know the stunt, knew it even as a guy, though you wouldn't have been able to name it. It's the one where three cheerleaders lift one girl up in the air, and she stands on one foot, with the other leg bent in front of her, her arms in the air. Dawn, as one of the smallest, lightest girls on the team, is a \"flier\", which means she's the girl who gets lifted into the air. Your mouth goes dry as you think about it; you've never been fond of heights. And the one leg you're going to be balancing on is the one with the bad knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all take their places, and three of them--you don't know their names, but you know they're the ones who are going to be lifting you up--gather around you. They lean down and put their hands together, waiting for you to step up onto them. You hesitate... to them, you're a tiny girl. Dawn is maybe 90 pounds wet. But you're a man, and not a particularly small man. You weigh as much as two and a half, maybe three Dawns. There's no way these girls could possibly lift you up, and you don't want to hurt them, or get hurt yourself. There's no way this could possibly end well. But as you hesitate, they look at you, expectantly. And then the head cheerleader scowls at you. \"What's the holdup, Dawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you put your foot up... and you're surprised to find that the girls lift you with little difficulty. Somehow, to them, you must only weigh as much as Dawn. It defies all logic... but so does everything else about this situation. You blush as one of the girls puts her hand on your butt and pushes you up, but the girls lift you up in the air and you take your position expertly, knee in front of you and hands in the air, your pom-poms stretched out triumphantly. Your bad knee holds your weight with no difficulty. It feel strong, and there's no pain. You try not to look down, try to ignore the slightly nauseous feeling in the pit of your stomach, and revel in this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you get an image of yourself, dressed like a teenage girl and pretty in pink, your big body supported by three small girls, looking absolutely ridiculous, and you begin to teeter. Before you can lose your balance and fall on your head, you let yourself drop, and the three girls catch you effortlessly and set you back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay, Dawn?\" one of the girls says, concern in her eyes. \"You were a little shaky up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you say. \"I'm feeling great, actually.\" And you mean it. You should be feeling humiliated right now. You should be feeling terrified. Your life has been stolen away from you, and you've been plopped down in the clothing and the life of a teenage girl, a cheerleader, a girly girl, a girl as different from you as she could possibly be. This should be the worst, most confusing, most surreal moment of your life. But the only thing you feel right now... is amazing.</span></div></div>",

You were surprised at how far you were able to push your body. Way past what should of been physically possible. But all thanks to the magic of this bizarre situation you were able to do the splits with no trouble and your mass had somehow been altered to that of a petite girl even though your gut said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked away from the other girls to get some space and sat down on the hill overlooking the football field. You started to daydream. Was this really going to be your life now? It didn't seem too bad. You were more athletic than you ever were before, you got your youth back (kinda), and you were now your daughter's best friend again! Though you were troubled at what she had planned for after practice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Dawn! Hello?\" You had completely blanked and didn't notice the other girl sitting down next to you. \"Checkin' out the football boys I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to stammer--to deny the accusations--but you gaze down towards the field again and feel strange. Attraction, arousal. The running back, you determined, was looking up towards you. He was tall and muscular with dark skin. Your cheeks started to burn as your eyes met. He grinned and waved before running back to the other players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackson I see,\" The girl notices. You quietly nod trying to hide your shame. Why were you feeling this way? Did you have Dawn's sexuality? You looked to the girl next to you. Her trim, athletic body definitely made you feel the same way. \"Maybe he'll be at the party tonight.\" She continued and nudged you exiticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was that what Anne had planned? Were they going to sneak off to a party?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up and shrug the question off. \"We should probably get back to practice.\" You grab your tiny pom-poms in your massive hands and walk towards the other girls surrounding the head cheerleader.</span></div></div>",

Staring back was Anne's best friend, Dawn. \"Fuck fuck fuck!\" You wildly ran your hands through your long blonde hair. Her scared, blue eyes scanned her face. You looked down to confirm your suspicions. You had tits! Huge tits especially for a fifteen-year old girl. Your body had completely changed into Dawn's. As you looked down at the large mounds hanging off your chest you noticed something else odd--well more odd than suddenly having a pair of tits--your old, ratty t-shirt looked different. Dawn's tiny body should have been swimming in it, but it seemed to fit her body perfectly. Then you looked at your hands. They were smaller and definitely feminine, but the nails were chewed and dirty. Why did they look so worn and not perfectly manicured? On your finger was your wedding band. <i>Shit I need to get home to Alex. Maybe she can help me figure out what happened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped the steering wheel. \"Okay I need to get home and figure out how this happened!\" You adjusted the seat and drove off. As you sped out of the parking lot you hadn't noticed that a certain cheerleader now had the body of a middle-aged man. But Dawn didn't know that her body had changed. She thought it was perfectly normal to look that way. And so did the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully drove home--you were still getting used to moving Dawn's body. <i>But I don't want to get used to her body!</i> You thought as you pulled into your driveway. <i>How the Hell am I going to explain this to Alex?</i> You trembled as you opened the front door and called out for your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?! Is Anne alright?\" You heard her shrill and run towards the front door. <i>Well here goes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she's fine. But something happened to me.\" <i>Why doesn't she notice anything off about my voice</i> you thought as you rubbed your swan-like neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife turned the corner and look you over. You painfully smiled. \"What do you mean something happened to you. You look fine!\" Your eyes widened. <i>WHAT?!</i> She walked over to you and looked closer. She was now a few inches taller than you. Jesus, you were tiny now. Probably around 5'2\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...I guess it was nothing. I'll be right back.\" You walked past Alex towards your bedroom and headed straight into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this of happened?\" You asked as you reached the mirror. You prodded your face with your finger. Dawn was a beautiful young woman. Her small petite frame was only disrupted by her large chest. <i>She must be at least a D-cup! I swear all the hormones in foods these days are dong this!</i> You started to remove your t-shirt. Her cute belly was well toned--completely opposite of your old belly. Before you could lift your shirt anymore Alex suddenly barged in. She didn't say a word, but she quickly moved towards you and kissed your neck. A foreign, damp feeling started radiating from your crotch and you moaned. <i>Shit! This is turning me on!</i> You thought as you hesitantly returned your wife's kiss. And why wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered in your ear, \"Lucy's over at the neighbor's house.\" Her low voice tickled your ear and was driving you crazy, \"So how about a quick fuck?\" Before you could answer she was already pulling your shirt off the rest of the way and you felt your new, large breasts swing free. They felt even more massive now that they were exposed. The cool air circulating the room kissed your nipples and you shuddered. Your new sex was getting very wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back for a moment. <i>Shit...is this even legal!? I have the body of a teenage girl, but she still thinks I'm her husband...</i> You needed to act fast or her advances would become impossible to resist.</span></div></div>",

The alien sensation of having your boobs played with bringing you close to release. Your wofe wasn't done though.

You are able to pry yourself away from her long enough to start searching for your discarded clothes. You two got pretty wild last night and clothes were tossed everywhere.

You had no idea what happened. At first you thought that maybe you somehow were electrocuted by your laptop. That stupid thing has always been a pain in your ass since you got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the dizziness subsided, you noticed that you felt different. For starters, your hair was now tickling your ears and running down the sides of your neck. You brought your hand up to confirm that your hair somehow did grow longer when you noticed that your snake bite piercings in your lip were gone and you were no longer naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" You groggily asked yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was still dark and you couldn't really see. Climbing out of your bed, you stumbled around to where you thought your light switch was when it dawned on you that this wasn't even your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I?\" You asked aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, your hand managed to snag a light switch and your suspicions were confirmed. This wasn't your room and you had no idea how you got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour DD cup breasts stuck out of a giant white t-shirt with the picture of some black rapper on it. Looking back around the room you're in, you could tell it was another girl's room. But whoever it belonged to had a very different taste and lifestyle than you did. You tried to think how you could have gotten here? You hadn't done any drugs lately. Were you losing your mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came to your mind was that this was some kind of stupid joke your brother was trying to play on you. \"Jake if you're behind this, I'm going to kill you.\" You mumble as you continue to feel nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to leave the room and hunt your brother or whoever was responsible for this but you saw someone out of the corner of your eye. When you look over, you saw that it was your coworker, Regina wearing in an identical t-shirt as you wore. \"Regina! Where the hell am I?! and how did I get here?!\" you demanded. Regina just stood there staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you noticed that it was Regina's reflection in a mirror. You quickly turned and looked all around the room. \"I just saw her. Where the hell is she?\" You looked back towards the mirror and scowled in frustration when it dawned on you. You could see Regina's reflection in the mirror but where was yours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" You asked Regina's reflection which appeared to ask the same thing you did. As you stepped closer to the mirror, Regina's reflection stepped closer as well. Once you were about an arms length away, you raised once of your hands and watched as Regina stared back and mimicked your movements perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you began to realize that this must be Regina's room and her reflection was yours.</span></div></div>",

This was really messed up. Nevertheless you better find something to explain this whole mess. Simply wishing that you had someone else their life doesn't explain this. If that would work every time, you would immediately swap with someone from Hawaii and spend the rest of your days with the Hawaiian girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you open the curtains for some light. The sun has just come up and is shining it's way inside. You quickly look back from it, you hate the burning sun. Or actually you're forced to hate the sun. You have a sensitive skin and it burns easily. So when the rest of your class went to spend time on the beach, you spend your days in a dark and cold room. It's then that when you look at your hands you realize that not might apply to you now. Surely Holly doesn't have the same condition as you have. Her skin looks fairly normal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then quickly shake your head. What are you thinking about? You need to find some clues, not think about Holly's skin. Holly's room is small and pretty normal. It's definitely not painted in that ugly pink color you so hate. You then start to look around. You first look around her desk. You only find some drawings on the desk. Holly has a bunch of them. Some are from video game characters you know. You can't help but admire her drawings, she's really talented. Perhaps she could be more than some one night stand. You quickly shake those thoughts out, no time for this thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room some more, but can't find anything useful. Aside from the clothes from last night, there is nothing unusual in the room. It's then that you notice something sticking out from underneath Holly's bed. You kneel down to the floor and grab hold of it. It's a wooden chest. Perhaps Holly has something inside it that might be useful. Too bad though that the chest is locked, you need a key for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where could you find the key? You didn't come across the key during your search in the room. It might be hidden somewhere. Your sight is then drawn to the mirror. In the reflection you could see yourself naked. You look down and confirm it is true. Well, you didn't notice really. You always liked to spend your time naked, at least with no one seeing you. And with the downgrade of your breasts, walking around was much easier without having to wear a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you continue your search for the key or perhaps get dressed up?</span></div></div>",

You can't find one simple key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down on the bed, you wonder if you would need to think different. When you were younger you used to read some detective novels. Perhaps you shouldn't imagine where you would hide the key, but rather where Holly would hide it. Problem is you barely know something about Holly except for her name, that she's a lesbian just like you and that she likes to draw. Drawing, that could be a clue! It feels like a light bulb went on inside your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one thing you hadn't checked out before. You turn around to face the painting on the wall. It's a beautiful sketch of two women holding each other's hands as they are kissing each other. It's very nicely done, even though it's not done yet, you just feel the passion surrounding these women and the love they have. You can't help but wonder if you will end up with someone like that. It's then that you shake that thought away as you grab the painting from the wall. As you turn the painting around, you can't help but radiate as you find a key taped to the backside of the painting. Finally you found it. Now you can finally check out the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wavering hand you stick the key inside the lock of the chest. You can't help but wonder what you will find inside. Will it be something to help you out of this mess or something totally unrelated. Even though you hope the first, you can't rule out the second possibility.

If that's the case then you shouldn't need to worry. You lie down on the bed lying comfortably on your stomach. There is no need for you to be wearing a bra now. You open the diary and begin to read. While reading the smile on your face slowly disappears. The diary describes Holly's life from when she was a teenager. From what you can gather Holly was a happy cheerful girl when she began to write in her diary, the diary describes all sorts of boring things like how she got an A or how she and her parents went to the park together. Boring stuff. But then Holly describes her parents divorced and from there on things change for her. How she blamed both her parents for not trying to be together, how she could not believe in true love anymore, how she wished she never remembered being with both her parents. It makes you sad and realize even though your parents didn't look after you very often, at least you had them. Holly then tells of her escaping into her own world, taking drugs and having sex with complete strangers. Then her mother finally found out what she was doing and put a stop to it. Holly went to a clinic and a few months later she was declared clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to skip all of this, but something inside of you wanted to keep on reading knowing it must be important. It's then that you finally arrive at the last page of the diary. You hope it finally contains a clue for your situation, but sadly it doesn't. It only says how Holly would go to that party you both went to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slam you shut the diary down. \"What a waste of time.\" You grumble. It didn't say anything useful, only what Holly has been through. It didn't help you with anything. You pick up the book and throw it down into the chest, locking the chest again and kick it underneath the bed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you supposed to do know? Holly's diary didn't tell anything about how you switched. That could mean two things. One is that Holly has no idea what happened to the both of you. Or two, something must have happened at that party which made you swap. One way or the other there is only one person that knows the answer to these questions: Holly.</span></div></div>",

For that to do, you would need to go to your apartment. If Holly stayed where she was, you would find her there. There was also the possibility of calling her on your cellphone, but you have this thing about forgetting the number. No biggie though, it wasn't that far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk over to the clothes Holly was yesterday evening. You pick up the frilly top and the short mini-skirt, remembering yesterday evening when you first saw her. You just lick your lips remembering how good she looked in those clothes, that was one of the reasons why you came with her to her home. A tiny part of yourself wants to wear these clothes just for show, after all you wouldn't wear clothes like these. They were way too showoff, but as for Holly. In the end though you couldn't bear to wear these clothes, not after reading through her diary. So instead you decide to only wear the tiny thong and flimsy bra she was wearing instead. Then you decide to go through her closet, she has a few naughty things lying around but you don't have the time for them (yet). Instead you pick a long skirt with a blouse and some sandals. After combing your hair, which you haven't in years, you feel you're ready. You quietly sneak down the stairs and walk out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you simply walk over to the apartment, it didn't take that long, but you wanted to enjoy Holly's body to wear for just a little while. She's way thinner than you ever were, the feeling of your waist being this small puts a smile on your face. Without having to go on a diet you already have such a nice figure. Too bad though you couldn't keep this body, but you were rather attached to your own. That wouldn't mean you were never going to see Holly after this you have decided. Reading her diary showed she didn't have any faith in people, she had nobody to protect her. Knowing this you just knew what kind of person she was looking for, and you knew you were just perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now standing in front of the apartment you are sharing with your brother. A sense of excitement comes over you as you were rather curious to see how your old body would look like with Holly inside it. You ring the bell and you can hear someone opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the door opening stands...</span></div></div>",

All your hidden secrets are in it. But Holly is probably right. So you hand over your diary to her and she opens it and starts reading. You see her reading your diary so intensely. You can't help but let your eyes roam your former body. Damn it was curvy, your eyes are drawn to that ass of yours. How big it was. You have been eating way too much fastfood, just like your breasts. They're hidden behind the tank top but you can still make out their forms. Nice and juicy. It's at that point that Holly notices you checking her out, but she doesn't mind. In fact she loves it. When she's finally done reading she shuts the diary with a grand slam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...interesting.\" She says with a mysterious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it, now we need to find a way to reverse this swap. You think of anything?\" You ask her but she keeps smiling at you. Now that you look at her, you can see what a cleavage you can create. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of one thing we can try.\" She says as her hand reaches towards your skirts.

So you look around for some clothes to wear. You instantly notice the clothes Holly was wearing yesterday, a frilly crop top and a tiny mini-skirt. Holding the clothes up you remind yourself how good she looked then. Reminding you of her makes you feel a little wet too. You decide to put them on, she probably wears clothes like this all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first put on the flimsy thong and push up bra you found with the clothes. Then you put on the crop top and the mini-skirt. You take a look at yourself in the mirror and see your reflection in the mirror. It's really different from the sort of clothes you like to wear. Usually you don't wear crop tops because of the way they show off your pudgy stomach. But with Holly it's different, she's really skinny so it's no problem wearing something like that. And the mini-skirt too, way too cold for your bump, but it really does show off Holly's nice little bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring longer at your reflection in the mirror you have to admit the sight is turning you on. Here you are standing inside the body of the girl you went out with last night.

Looking back in the mirror you see yourself as Holly standing there with a very naughty expression on her face. The look of it makes you even more hornier than before. There is however the fact that you are not sure how to solve this. Perhaps you should visit your old body, there's a good chance Holly's inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What to do?

Again, Jake's reflection copies your own, but you can feel the bristles of his thick beard as you stroke your smooth face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you break into a smile. This is exactly what you wanted...okay maybe not exactly, but it's still something. You can now date any girl that you wanted, your parents loved you, and you had college to look forward to! And with Jake thinking that he was now you you didn't have to worry about him getting pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the bathroom and walk down the hallway towards your room. You peak inside and see Jake lying on your bed. He is browsing through facebook and is listening to music. You laugh to yourself and continue down the hall towards Jake's room. You open the door and take it all in. This is yours now! You closed the door and jumped onto Jake's bed. On the back of the door is another mirror. This full length mirror lets you see your entire body. You can still barely believe that the world saw you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and walk towards the mirror. Curious, you pull of your shirt. Your large breasts swing free, but your reflection shows only Jake's toned pecs and washboard abs. Your hands travel down your pudgy belly. You feel the abdominal muscles underneath. You stop just above your groin. <i>I might as well take a look...</i> You slowly lower your sweatpants and your eyes bulge as Jake's large penis flops out. You reach down and place your hand on your mound. Jake's reflection grips his cock. Your vagina is starting to moisten and your reflection's penis starts to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you continue exploring?</span></div></div>",

You glance past your cleavage--<i>am I wearing a push-up bra?</i>--and see poofy whiteness. You are wearing a wedding dress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh Nicole! I think I love this one the most.\" You turn your head towards the woman's voice and notice that she is talking to you. She is an older woman, probably fifty or sixty, and is beaming proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely agree with your mom, Nic. And as your Maid of Honor don't I have the final say?\" Says another woman sarcastically. You turn around and are greeted by an angel. She is the most beautiful girl you had every seen. You are still completely speechless--<i>where the hell am I?</i>--as the woman reach out and embrace you. Her smell is intoxicating and your legs wobble. You stumble forward and she catches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Nic?\" Concern drips from her voice succulent voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" You say and you stand up trying to steady yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Says the older woman. She gestures towards the mirror front of you. Somehow you hadn't noticed it before. Perhaps because there is no way the reflection could be you. But as you look closer the woman in the mirror is definitely you, but still different. Your short, black hair has grown out past your shoulders and is blonde. It is professionally styled and is gorgeous. Your round face has minimal make-up and none of which is black. The wedding dress is designed with a lithe woman in mind--completely opposite of your husky frame. Yet the dress hugs your body perfectly, accenting your already large breasts even more. You had no idea that you could look like this--you were so used to wearing your butch Gothic attire. You smile--something you rarely did-- and you looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" You honestly say as you touch your face. Your skin feels radiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we still have four more choices to try one.\" The angel interrupts. You realize that you recognize her. She was in a lot of Nicole's Facebook pictures. She must be her best friend--Darcy was it? Did that mean that your wish actually came true? Were you actually Nicole now? No you still had your own body. But here you were, standing with her mother and best friend trying on wedding dresses and they didn't seem to notice a thing. As far as they were concerned you were Nicole.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that you might as well continue trying on dresses. You never really were a feminine girl, but for some reason you finally saw the appeal. After another hour of modeling the dresses for your \"mother\" and \"best friend\" you were finished. Closing the door to the changing room, you strip out of the latest dress and throw a Nicole\u2019s duffle bag into the corner. As you stand there in the dressing room in only your underwear, you check out your reflection. You were definitely wearing a push bra now that you could see yourself. You unhook it and give your breasts a quick squeeze. They look a lot perkier somehow. Before, your DD-cup breasts would sag quite a bit, but now they were nice and firm. <i>I wonder if that is because Nicole is a smaller size</i> you wonder. Your nipple piercings were gone and there was no evidence that you ever had them. You grabbed the bra and glanced at the size. 28C. <i>That makes no sense!</i> But then again none of this did. You turn around and notice that your back tattoo is gone. You frown. You really liked those bloodied angel wings. However it has been replaced with a different tattoo. I small rose on your hip. Very modest, but still attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Might as well get dressed now.</i> You tied your long blonde hair into a ponytail\u2012something you hadn't done in over 10 years. You opened the duffle bag and reach inside. You sighed as you pulled out a pair of yoga pants, Ugg boots, and a zip up sweatshirt. And it was all fitted for your body. You grumbled and got dressed. You gazed into the mirror and couldn't deny that the outfit makes you look incredibly attractive. Your large butt was accented by the yoga pants and the sweatshirt helped to cover your chubby stomach. You left it unzipped enough to show off some cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which dress are you going to choose?\" The mother asked anxiously as you exited the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obviously not your choice to make, but for some reason you felt drawn to the first dress. An almost instinctual feeling was telling you that it would be Nicole's choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed to the first dress and Darcy squealed with excitement. \"And that's why we are best friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all left the store and your new mother took you to lunch. As you sat there munching on your unfulfilling salad you realized that you are actually getting married\u2012to a man no less! You shuddered at that thought. You were still very much gay, right? After lunch your mother dropped you off at what you assumed is Nicole's apartment. You fished out her keys from her oversized purse. Thankfully it had her room number right on the key. Room #312. You climbed the apartment stairs to the third floor and wandered down the halls to room #312. Did your husband-to-be live with you? You unlocked the door and entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you honey?\" You heard a warm, gentle voice call out. Great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup it's me...Nicole.\" You had trouble saying it. You hung your coat and your \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d turned the corner and gave you a long passionate kiss. For a moment you were disgusted, but then you started to enjoy it. You quickly broke away and gave him a hug. What was wrong with you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about some premarital sex?\" He jokingly suggests but you can tell that he also is being serious.</span></div></div>",

You notice something is odd about it. You take a closer look at Nicole her photo. Something is off about it. It's not Nicole that is on the photo with her boyfriend, but someone familiar. Someone like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\" You mumble. Wait a minute, your voice didn't sound so high normally. And what happened to your arms. You always had a really pale skin, something you were proud of. Now you had a light tan instead. And what happened to your hands? Your fingers used to be chubbier than before. What happened to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the handheld mirror next to your bed. But when you hold it in front of your face, it isn't you looking back in the mirror. \"Aah!\" You let out a big scream and drop the mirror. You can hear someone running outside your room and a minute later your brother Jake is standing in your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? You bit on your piercing again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake stop those stupid jokes. Look at me, this isn't me.\" You say pointing at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, you clearly have a lack of sleep. Trust me, I have seen that hideous face of you more than I could wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so angry at Jake you throw your pillow at him. He quickly dodges it and goes back to his own room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could have happened? Did your wish come true when you asked when you could have her life? You pick up the handheld mirror and take a look again. You are surprised to admit it, but it's really Nicole's face, although it didn't look a hundred percent like hers. For instance you still have the snake bite piercings in your mouth. And instead of the long blond hair Nicole had, your hair was short as your own and looked dyed black. You could still see blond roots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look down confirms that your boobs have decreased in size. A quick squeeze confirms that they must be C-cups now, though you still have your nipple piercings in place. And then your belly, on her facebook page showed some photos off her wearing a new bikini, you remember you admired her tight belly. Well that belly is gone now with you. You still have your chubby belly. But if it means that you have Nicole's body, she has yours. You quickly take your laptop and scroll her facebook page. Wow, you have to admit, with Nicole having your body, she's <i>hot</i>. Her hair is still long and blond, though you can see that it was black like yours. She didn't have any piercings like you did. And wow, when you scroll to that bikini shot you saw earlier, your eyes almost bulge. She was so hot. She now had your DD-cup breasts, and together with her tight body, she was even hotter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then wonder what you should do now?</span></div></div>",

You just looked like one of those cute goth chicks you were always dying to meet. Except that you are one of them now. As you examine your body, you can't ignore your belly. You're way too fat, perhaps you should go work out in the gym? Wait, what are you saying? You already begin to think this is your body now, while technically it still belongs to Nicole.

He put his feet up on the table, got out some chips, and put on an old action movie. His younger brother, Nicholas, dressed in only his shorts, half-watched in the next room while playing some racing game on the computer. Next to the computer was Nicholas\u2019s half-eaten bowl of cereal and his milk stained t-shirt. This was the life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, Madison came home from work earlier than expected. \u201cThis place is a mess, no wonder we can never leave you two alone.\u201d The boys tried to ignore her, but she continued.  \u201cYou both know that we are not allowed to eat outside the kitchen. And is this movie PG-13!? Nicholas, for Christ\u2019s sake, put a damned shirt on.\u201d Nicholas scurried up to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t our mom, Madison. Can you let us have fun for once?\u201d Mark finally replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison turned off the TV and said, \u201cWithout mom and dad, I am in charge. And until you stop being so immature, it\u2019s going to stay that way. Now, clean up your mess or there will be consequences.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, Mark did as he was told. After he was done, he went to his room and looked out the window at Erika Sato\u2019s much bigger house across the street. Her being a year older and in none of his classes, he did not know her that well. From what Mark could tell, Erika had caring parents, no bossy older siblings, and plenty of friends. Her life seemed so perfect. \u201cI wish I had her life,\u201d Mark said to himself out loud. But something else was listening\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Climbing out of the window at this height would be too dangerous so instead, he put on Erika\u2019s slippers and peaked out the bedroom. The door creaked loudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick feet ran down the hall. \u201cGood morning, sis.\u201d Laura barged into the room and hugged Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I can expla-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome downstairs with me, I wanna show you what I\u2019ve been making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cBut-\u201d Laura tugged Mark\u2019s hand and brought him downstairs. <i>Maybe, the girl had some kind of illness</i>. He hoped when she realized the truth it would not traumatize her too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the middle of the living room. On the floor were some drawings and crayons. \u201cTa Daaaaaa!\u201d Laura looked up at Mark for approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice, but I have to get going\u201d Mark dashed out of the large house before any other members of the Sato family saw him. Laura called after him but he did not turn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ridiculousness of running across the neighborhood in Erika\u2019s nightgown seeped in, but it would all be over once he was home.  <i>Where are my keys?! </i>\u201cMother fucker\u201d he said aloud. He knocked on his house hoping that Nicholas would answer. He could just play this off as a joke to Nicholas, but Madison would know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his dread, he saw Madison head to the door. After seeing him in the window, she looked confused. Madison opened the door and greeted him, \u201cHi, Erika. Everything alright?\u201d Mark knew Madison well enough to know she did not joke around like this. So, he decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cUm, yea, I\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d Mark put on his best Erika voice. \u201cIs Mark home? I need some Northbrook students for a project and I couldn\u2019t find him on Facebook, so here I am... haha!\u201d His laugh was too loud to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Madison looked confused so Mark added, \u201cThe outfit is like for the project!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Satisfied enough, Madison said,  \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping in as usual.
