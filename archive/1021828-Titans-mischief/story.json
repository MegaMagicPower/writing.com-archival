He explained the reasoning for the three men attacking them was due to their own accord. The two mean kidnapped the three men's sister, then used her for their own pleasure. Quarion was mortified by this. He inquired where the woman was at. The man on the ground said she was held captive in a cave miles away where no one would find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This is just horrible, I swallowed three men because they were taking revenge on you two,\" Quarion said, \" Now they suffer for it... Not if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuarion closed his fist with the man and his broken leg. He squeezed tightly and crushed him to death, then dropped him in front of the man on the ground. Before the man could even run, Quarion raised his giant sandal over the villager and crushed him on the spot. The man laid crushed in the giant foot print of Quarion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there wasn't much time, Quarion grabbed a tree and shoved it down his throat trying to trigger his gag reflex.

Two seemed to be alright but the other one looked dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am so sorry for my misunderstanding. I took care of the men who took your sister. They lay on the ground,\" Quarion said pointing to the two bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at the man crushed in Quarion's hand, then the one crushed by his sole. They turned back to Quarion and voiced their disgust for the death of their brother. Quarion apologized for his behavior and made sure to help find their sister before he moved on.
