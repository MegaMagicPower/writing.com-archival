            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Important note for those who don't know the show very well: Bo's name was Beth before her first succubus kill (which will happen in this chapter). Oh, and all of this happens in his car or truck (I don't remember which and I can't get the dvds any time soon, and I'm assuming it's his truck/car) when they had sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" Beth Dennis asked her boyfriend, Kyle Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure.\" Kyle said and started unbuttoning Beth's top. She soon started to take off his pants. They gotten off all of their clothes except for their underwear and started to kiss each other. Beth gently pushed Kyle down and laid on top of him and continued kissing him as he grabbed her ass. As they are doing it, Kyle noticed Beth's ass moving outwards a little bit, her belly pushing more and more against his, and he swear that her boobs were getting bigger, but he didn't give it much thought to it since he was getting laid for the first (and only) time in his life. As they went on, Kyle began to feel weaker and weaker as Beth began to feel stronger and bigger. When Beth stopped kissing him for a moment to catch her breath, she noticed that Kyle isn't grabbing her ass anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I starting to be too much for you?\" asked Beth. When she didn't hear an answer, and noticed the \"dead smile\" (if you have watched the show, a succubus' dead victim's appearance is different (again, I don't have the dvds so I don't exactly remember it as well. Just about the only thing I remember are the eyes are open, there appears to be some marks on the face, and the victim has a smile on their face), she started to worry. \"Kyle?\" She tried to get his attention by shaking him a bit. She then checked his heart but she didn't feel any heartbeat. \"Oh god. He's dead.\" Her (adapted, but she doesn't know that yet) parents told her that sex was evil, but she didn't believe them. Panicking, she grabbed her clothes, gotten out of the car, and ran into the nearby woods, not noticing her boobs and ass jiggling a little more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Beth stopped running, she started to put her clothes back on but she found that this is a bit harder than before. When she finally gotten her pants over her bigger ass, unbutton, she decided to look at her body to figure out why her pants feel tighter than before. Beth first saw her boobs being about half a cup bigger. Under her breasts was a little potbelly barely visible since her boobs are hiding all of her belly (her boobs stick out a little bigger out than her belly does). She then felt her ass and thighs, surprised by the fact that her hands met them sooner than before. Even through she is still in shock about Kyle's death, Beth felt a bit satisfied and sexier with her bigger body. After she was done touching her bigger assets, she buttoned up her pants, which felt uncomfortable with her belly pushing out, straining the button. She picked up her bra and put it on, surprised that it is able to contain her larger breasts, but a little too tight than she would had liked. She then put on her button up shirt, with her belly and boobs straining the buttons, leaving two buttons on top undone so she can look down her cleavage. Then, reality hit her in the head: she had just killed her boyfriend. She don't know what to do, so, she ran. She don't know where she's going, but she know that she have to always be on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long will Bo be running?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was several years later, and Bo (formerly Beth) was busy being a bartender in one of Canada's bars. The years - and feeding - have been, well, fattening. Her breasts were now 3Ds, large and firm, but also rather pear-shaped, almost drooping, if it wasn't for her bra. Her stomach was heavy and distended...or it would've had, if it wasn't for the corset that she began to wore, when her belly apron began to be a problem...but that didn't solve her shortness of breath, but actually made it worse. Her butt, however, wasn't restrained, and as such it jammed out in a shelf-like protuberance behind her, supported onto thick and solid legs. Bo's arms matched those legs, being covered in thick layers of subcutaneous fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo's face, however, had changed most of all: with its heavy eyelids, fledgling third chin and budging cheeks, Bo really looked like a BBW, and her make-up didn't help her any. Behind her heavy eyelids, though, Bo's eyes were alert and attentive, and right now they noticed one of her male customers slip something into the drink of his new blonde girl friend (she failed to see the blonde swipe his vallet earlier, though). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo's character has changed too. Every time she had sex, she would end up killing her partner and gaining weight. She didn't like that, so her sexual life had dwindled to a trickle, and Bo had to fill up the emptiness in her life with food and cheap TV movies - she was basically a couch potato. That said, she was still a fundamentally decent person, and seeing the girl leave - with the guy following shortly after with some very dishonest intentions - did make her indigant. Slowly, in lieu of her bulk and poor exercise, she did make it to the elevator before it left, and then...</span></div></div>",

She has gained more weight from her second and all of the fatty foods she has been eating to try to feed her unnatural hunger. The food doesn't seem to be helping much, but so began to enjoy stuffing her stomach and feeling her body getting bigger. The bigger she gets, the more attractive she gets to both men and women, which surprised her since she always thought people hated thicker people (in reality, all of the fat is amplifying her succubus powers, but she doesn't know that, yet). Most of the new weight went to her boobs, belly (which she can now see past her breasts since her boobs didn't grow as fast as her belly), thighs, and ass but she also gained some around other parts of her body such as her face and arms. Let's say she is around 180 lbs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bo ate another creme-filled doughnut, a button on her tight shirt popped off. She mourned in delight due to her full gut and the button popping. As she gotten up to collect her fourth button (the first three were from different shirts and a pair of pants) the zipper of her pants went down and her belly started to push out which also caused her shirt to raise a little bit giving her a slight muffin top. She bent down to grab her trophy but as she did, the backside of her pants ripped, showing her fat ass and tight panties. She smiled at the feeling of her ass ripping her pants. She stood back up, button in hand, walked towards a table with a small case holding her other popped off buttons, and placed her new one with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What should I do now?</i> Bo thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
