The student would have just passed by if he/she did not notice what the prize was. The winner gets to go to the Circus of Desire, the most exclusive circus that has ever existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few reasons why this circus is different from others.One such reason is that it is always open, and it never leaves where it is located; while a vast forest that is surrounded by a giant wall is located right outside the city. It is very difficult to get tickets to this circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this student tries his/her luck, and just happens to win. Now he/she (and some friends?) will be allowed access to this legendary circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day Saturday morning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she is standing right outside the main entrance. Sure, getting into this place is everyone's dream, at least from his/her school, however, there are as many rumors about this place as its popularity.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter handing over the ticket he/she (and party?) enter and the gates close behind him/her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in front of the winner are markers, pointing the way to some of this places attractions.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Circus of Desires, where everything you could ever want lies just beyond these gates\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your father used to take you to circuses all the time, and thus, clowns remind you of your childhood, and make you nostalgic for simpler times. Unfortunately, most people find clowns creepy, and think you\u2019re immature or weird for liking them, so you\u2019ve mostly kept it to yourself. When you got your hands on a backstage pass at the greatest circus in the world, though, you knew you couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity. You wanted to meet one of the clowns, and ask them how they pull off all their amazing tricks and feats of aerobics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excitedly march towards some trailers in a backlot of the circus. You see trailers for all kinds of staff members, and even pass by a few lions and elephants, but eventually, you came across one with two smiling, female clowns painted along the side, along with the words; <i>One\u2019s hungry, one\u2019s busty! Together, they\u2019re the Yoyo Sisters!</i> That was a little weird, but you were more intrigued by the prospect of female clowns. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen or heard of those before. Strange. Without further ado, you nervously knock on the trailer door, grasping the ticket in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp when the door opens to reveal the tallest woman you\u2019ve ever seen! She must be at least 8 feet! Like any other clown, her skin was painted white, but her hair and makeup were vividly purple. Her mismatched clown costume was also various, subdued shades of blue and purple, rather than the while reds and yellows you\u2019d expect from a clown. Most notably, though, was her, uh, \u2018physique\u2019. She had a perfect hourglass figure, with wide hips and humongous, round breasts, her outfit shamelessly revealing her cleavage. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOh! Well, look what we have here,\u201d</span> she smirked, speaking in a surprisingly calm and velvety voice as she bends down to face you eye-level. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIf it isn\u2019t a precious little human\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, you hear an excited voice from deeper in the trailer. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cA human!?\u201d</span> You gawk as another, similarly sized clown rounds the corner. She was about the same height, and looked more like a typical clown, with orange hair, a big red noise, and a typical red-and-yellow outfit. Compared to the other clown, she had a huge pear shape, meaning her breasts were a lot smaller\u2026 but her hips and belly were absolutely gigantic! Each was bigger than your entire body, and they jiggled as she ran towards you, a huge smile on her face. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOhmygosh! You are the most adorable little thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you up in the air with incredible ease, before hugging you against her pudgy, pillowy body like you were some sort of teddy bear. <b>\u201cAh! P-put me down!\u201d</b> You cry out. Immediately, the purple-haired one grabs you from her hands, and places you gently on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cExcuse my sister, here. She can get a little\u2026 carried away sometimes,\u201d</span> she chuckled, before stepping aside, allowing you to enter their trailer. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cPlease, come in, sweetie. Make yourself at home. I presume you have a backstage pass?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cY-yes, I do,\u201d</b> you nervously reply, handing her your ticket as you step into their trailer. It was a lot bigger on the inside then it looked like on the outside. To accommodate the clown womens\u2019 height, not only was the ceiling quite high, but all the furniture was massive. You watch as the pudgy one hops over onto the couch, which can barely contain her massive hips. <b>\u201cWhy do you keep calling me \u2018human\u2019? Aren\u2019t you humans, too?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWe\u2019re not humans, silly! We\u2019re clowns!\u201d</span> She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d</b> You ask, your confusion only growing by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOther circuses just have people just dressed up in clown masks\u2026 but not this one!\u201d</span> She smiles, kicking her feet up. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThis circus imports genuine clowns straight from the clown planet! They really spare no expense!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her. You\u2019re not sure if she\u2019s joking, or if she\u2019s crazy. <b>\u201cIs that supposed to be why you\u2019re so tall?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cMm. Handsome <i>and</i> observant\u2026\u201d</span> The other clown coos. You shiver as she bends over and massages your shoulders from behind. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAnyway, allow us to introduce ourselves. I\u2019m Lulu.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m Popsy!\u201d</span> The orange-haired clown introduces herself, shaking your hand roughly. Lulu leads you over to the couch, and sets you down in the middle as she takes a seat beside you. Soon, you were squeezed up uncomfortably inbetween them as they watched TV. Popsy was chowing down on a seemingly endless amount of corn dogs, almost swallowing each one down before immediately grabbing another. Meanwhile, Lulu was simply relaxing and painting her nails. Neither seemed like particularly clown-like behavior. You were starting to regret coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026\u201d</b> You eventually work up the courage to ask. <b>\u201cAre you two going to do something funny, or\u2026?\u201d </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh? Just \u2018cause we\u2019re clowns, we have to be funny all the time?\u201d</span> Popsy pouts. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that\u2019s a stereotype!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-well, no! But\u2026\u201d</b> You stuttered, only for Lulu to reassuringly hook an arm around you, pulling you up against her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I must apologize if this is not the backstage experience you were expecting,\u201d</span> Lulu says. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWe just got back from a big show a few minutes ago, so we\u2019re pretty burned out. If you want, though, we can show you around the circus\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. <b>\u201cThat sounds fun, I guess.\u201d</b> Maybe this won\u2019t be so bad...</span></div></div>",

Of course, you were more interested in them then in the circus. When you got an opportunity, you decided to ask them about their clown work. <b>\u201cSo, um\u2026 what\u2019s it like? You know, working for the circus?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cExcellent. Couldn\u2019t imagine a better job,\u201d</span> Lulu smiled. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cMaking people smile is a dream come true in and of itself\u2026 but the paycheck definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint, either.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh? What kind of stunts do you do?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all sorts of things really, though the trapeze and tightrope walking are my passions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cReally? I love those!\u201d</b> You smile, immediately perking up. <b>\u201cI always wondered what the secret is.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThere\u2019s no secret. It\u2019s all balance and aerobics,\u201d</span> she chuckles. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cLuckily, us clowns are natural at both, if it\u2019s for the sake of making people smile.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a little deflated when she starts talking about clowns as if they\u2019re another species again. You didn\u2019t know if they were joking or what, but you wished they\u2019d just talk like normal people. <b>\u201cMaybe you could show me what you can do later?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagente\">\u201cSounds fun,\u201d</span> she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the chubbier, more bubbly clown, Popsy. <b>\u201cHow about you? What kind of stunts do you do?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets a huge smile on her face the moment you talk to her.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cYou know sword swallowers?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I know what sword swallowers are,\u201d</b> you nod. obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m like that, except I can swallow anything! Swords, chainsaws, molten lava, audience members\u2026\u201d</span> She excitedly slaps her huge belly, giggling as she watches it jiggle. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cMy tummy can handle anything you throw at it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cW-wait\u2026\u201d</b> You do a double-take. <b>\u201c<i>Audience members</i>? You mean, people?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYep! Gobbling up a few people from the crowd is a real showstopper!\u201d</span> She smiles. You notice that her mouth is indeed more than large enough to swallow someone\u2026 and her belly large enough to fit someone inside, for that matter. \u201cIt\u2019s my most popular trick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cA-are they okay afterwards?\u201d</b> You ask, not sure whether she\u2019s joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cBetter than okay! They get to be part of all this!\u201d</span> She says, running her hands over her pudgy thighs. You shudder as you realize the implications of what she just said. You want to just make your excuses and leave, but before you can, Lulu speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThere\u2019s the tent up ahead. It should be empty, but our equipment\u2019s still there,\u201d</span> she says, pointing up to a large tent up ahead. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cPerhaps we could show you our tricks, if you\u2019re so curious?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, Popsy rushes excitedly forward. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOo!

Somehow, against all the odds, he was one of the few people in town to receive a ticket that allowed access to the famous, yet mysterious, circus everyone talked about.  He knew of some people that managed to gain entrance at some point but they refused to revile anything to him and would always say, \"You have to see if for yourself to believe !\"  Now it was time to see if this place can live up to all the hype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far it didn't look all that different from any regular old circus; not that he found anything wrong with that mind you.  In fact there was quite a fair bit of people here despite the rarity of the tickets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was quickly broken out of his thoughts by the trumpeting sound of an elephant.  Terry smiled and made his way over to where he heard the noise.  He was always a big lover of animals and would always try to go see them first whenever he went to places like these.  Heck it was one of the few reasons why he would try to apply for a job at places like vets or zoos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt take didn't him long to find the elephant section.  Right off the bat he could a couple of elephants just milling about by themselves.  The odd thing was that none of them with either in a pin or even tied to anything to keep them from wondering off.  'These guys must have been trained really well if no one is going to keep an eye on them', Terry thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far from the herd, he saw something that just put a big old grin on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elephant was trudging around the area with a load of a passengers on top of its' back.  Of course they would have elephant rides here, why wouldn't they?  Terry remembered the one time he rode one when he was about 10 years old; oh the nostalgia was coming back to him.  He wanted to ride one so badly, but curiosity was getting the better of him regarding the other elephants.  Something about how nonchalant everyone was really made want to get closer.  </span></div></div>",

He still couldn't believe it, even as he runs to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Friday, with nothing else to do over the weekend, he was planing to spend every second there. His bag gets tossed to the side as he picks up his cell phone. He knows exactly who to give the other tickets to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 lucky friends he called arrive and go up to his room. They knock and he tells them to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one is a girl, smaller than him with light brown hair, brown eyes, and an average chest. Her name is Megan.<br>\r\nThe 2nd one is another girl. She is the same height as Keith with long black hair and green eyes. Her name is Evelyn, or Eve or short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are Keith's closest friends who hes known since they were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: \"What did you want to show us? You sounded very excited on the phone. Ooohhh come on! Hurry up and tell me!\".<br>\r\nEve: \"Yeah.....I was just about to go on my daily run\".<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Eve, this is worth it\". With 1 hand, he shows the girls the tickets.<br>\r\nMegan: \"What are these? Tickets?\", she gets a closer look. \"OH MY GOD! Are these tickets for the circus?!\".<br>\r\nEve: \"What? Really? They are! How did you get these?\".<br>\r\n\"I was lucky. I won them not even an hour ago at a lottery in the city. And guess who I'm giving the extra tickets to?\".<br>\r\nMegan's face lights up and she tackles him. \"Really? You're giving us a ticket?\".<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\nMegan: \"Oh thank you!\", she happily yells, jumping onto him like she usually does. \"These tickets are so valuable too! I cant believe I actually get to go there!\".<br>\r\nEve: \"I cant believe this either. Thanks for the ticket\".<br>\r\n\"Who else would I take? So go get ready. I think the 3 of us should go together\".<br>\r\nEve: \"I though you would say that. I take it were going tomorrow?\".<br>\r\n\"Yes. We're going to spend the weekend there\".<br>\r\nEve: \"Just the 3 of us.....Alright. I'm going to leave then. We'll meet up here early tomorrow. How about 8?\".<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. See ya later Eve\".<br>\r\nMegan finally gets off of him. \"I should get going too. There are a few things I need to do until we leave. I CANT WAIT! I dont know how I'll get to sleep tonight!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leave, each heading to their individual homes to get ready for tomorrow and Keith does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big day finally arrives. Eve and Megan arrive and the 3 of them head and arrive at the circus.<br>\r\nMegan: \"I cant believe I'm actually here!\".<br>\r\nEve: \"I know\".<br>\r\n\"Well, lets get going you 2.\".<br>\r\nMegan &amp; Eve. \"Alright/Ok\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each give their tickets to the creepy guy at the gate and step into the circus. Just a short ways from the entrance was a decent sized paved area with countless signs and roads leading to the many places in the large enclosed area of the circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: \"Wow. So many places to go. I'm so excited! Where do we even begin?\"&gt;<br>\r\nEve: \"This is our first, probably only, time here. How about we head to the \"Main Grounds\". I think that would be a good place to start\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Lets go there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the 3 of them take the main road to the largest town in the circus.</span></div></div>",

But I will tell you something interesting.....You 3 are new here, so as an employee here, I should tell you a few things. This circus, it isnt normal. Sure it has clowns, elephants, and other things you would expect at a circus, but there is so much more to it than that. This place was made for people to relax, to have fun, as such, everything you could possibly think, and stuff you couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams, is located SOMEWHERE in this park. Of course this includes more mature topics and stuff that goes beyond what you currently know\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: \"And what exactly does that mean?

It rumbles and bulges out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, the vendor turns the knob some more, increasing the flow of gas into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach inflates even faster and she starts to lift off of the ground.

It depends on the gas used, the person, the quality of the gas, and a few other things. Though the average I've seen is 8 hours, but I've seen it wear off after a few minutes and last as long as a full day.

Why do you think tickets to this place are so hard to get?\".<br>\r\nThey shrug.<br>\r\n\"Thats because once you do get a ticket, you can come and go whenever you like. Your marked down the second you get in so even 50 years from now you can still enter just because you were lucky enough to get your hands on a ticket\".<br>\r\nKeith: \"Seriously?\".<br>\r\n\"Seriously. That is just the kind of place this is.....I told you about this place and you have your balloons, so, thats it, and it seems I have another customer, so....Come again, and maybe next time you can give this a try\", he says, looking at Eve.

Your naked\".<br>\r\nMegan: \"Huh?\", she looks at her chest and sees her bare boobs dangling near his face. She screams and covers her chest.

There's no way I can beat that thing! One hit and its over\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was hiding behind one of the pillars, peering around it as she watched Keith run around and barely dodge it's attacks. (What is he suppose to do? Theres no way he can hurt it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to think of something, but nothings coming to her. (Come on! There has to be some way! Something in this room that can be used against it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced against a pillar, it looks like Keith was going to lose. The monster's fist flys towards him, but he jumps to the side at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Eve sighs, but then she notices something. The monster had pulled back his hand, and it looked like it was in pain. (Thats it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster had just missed Keith again and was about to try again when it suddenly straightened up. It tries to reach behind it, but its arms are too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head then pops up from behind, it was Eve, and she had climbed up it's back. \"What are you doing?\". She then wraps something around the monster's face, blinding it. But she wasn't done, pulling out a rock she got from it punching that one pillar, she hits the top of it's head several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts to thrash and roar as she continues to beat it with the rock. She sees it's hands coming for her, and she jumps toward Keith. He catches her, \"what were you thinking? All you did was make it mad! You could of been hurt!\". He looks up and sees it rip whatever was on it off. \"What did you use to-\", he looks down at her and stops mid-sentence. Eve was naked. She had used the shirt, the only thing covering her, to temporarily blind it. They both blush.<br>\r\nEve: \"N-nows not the time for this! I know what I'm doing, head over there!\".<br>\r\n\"O-ok\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs in the direction that she is pointing, she has him stop, telling him to pick something up, she then has stand in front of a nearby pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: \"Now throw those rocks at it!\".<br>\r\n\"What?!\".<br>\r\nEve: \"Just do it!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith starts chucking the rocks at him while Eve throws out insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster looses what little control it has. With a loud roar, it charges them. Keith was about to move, but Eve stops him. \"Wait for it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the monster right on top of them, she yells, \"now!\", and Keith jumps and avoids the charging beast by a few inches. It slams through the pillar, and hits the wall on the opposite side. The dust settles and the remains of the pillar are scattered around the unconscious creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: \"W-we did it\".<br>\r\n\"Well, you did most of the work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the room begins to shake.<br>\r\n\"What now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster vanishes and the damaged pillars fix themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last door unlocks.</span></div></div>",

The building, compared to everything else that they have encountered and seen, was normal looking. A rectangle shaped building with a door and a few windows, nothing to make it stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: What is this place?<br>\r\nEve: Yeah, where did you bring us?<br>\r\n\"You'll see once we get inside\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like the outside, the inside seems normal.

Are you serious!?<br>\r\nMegan: Can we even do that here?<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can. Here, read this\", he says, while handing them the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Eve read the excerpt from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT IS POSSIBLE TO STAY IN THE CIRCUS. THIS IS DONE BY PURCHASING A HOUSE FROM 1 OF THE PLACES LISTED BELOW. BUT I MUST INFORM YOU THAT DOING THIS, UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HERE, WILL COST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. HOWEVER, BY BUYING A PLACE TO LIVE HERE, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE. DUPLICATES WILL BE MADE OF YOU, JUST LIKE IF YOU DECIDE TO STAY LONGER THAN PLANNED, AND THE DUPLICATES WILL TAKE OVER YOUR LIVES UNTIL YOU WISH TO GO BACK. BY DOING THIS, YOU CAN ENJOY THE MANY WONDERS AND EXCITEMENTS OF THE CIRCUS MORE FREELY THAN YOU COULD EVER HOPE TO DO SO BY COMMUTING HERE FROM OUTSIDE OUR WALLS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Eve just stare at the page, reading it over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: Really? W-we can stay! We never have to leave!?<br>\r\nEve: This is amazing\", she looks at Keith, \"are we really going to do this?<br>\r\nHe smiles at them, \"yes, our winning that contest should cover the cost of a house\".<br>\r\nEve: Hopefully, let me see the pamphlet he gave you\". She flips through it. \"It may cost a lot, but its still nothing compared to the price of houses outside the circuis\".<br>\r\n\"I know\".<br>\r\nMegan: Really?<br>\r\nEve: Yes, according to this, we can afford the best kind of house here, a mansion.<br>\r\nMegan:.....We're going to live in a mansion!?<br>\r\n\"Yes we are\".<br>\r\nEve: Then all we have to do now is pick where to put it and what goes in it.<br>\r\n\"Yup\".<br>\r\nMegan: Then what are we waiting for! Lets get started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of picking and choosing, they are ready to purchase their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk up to the attendant and tell him what they want, where it goes, and what goes in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttendant: ......and it is done. Thank you for purchasing a house, we hope you enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant gives them directions to their new home and they start off towards it and their new lives.</span></div></div>",

Tell me, what did she do?\".<br>\r\nEve: Oh, yeah, let me think, after I woke her up the usual way, we started going through the clothes.....!!!!!!<br>\r\n\"Did you figure something out?\"<br>\r\nEve: I-I think\", she walks over to the bed and picks up the other yellow sock, the first 1 still on Megan's leg.\".....Of course, It's the sock\".<br>\r\n\"The sock?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve tells him about the extra clothes they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: ......And as she started to put it on, she started to regress\".<br>\r\n\"So the clothes we got from Lisa made her a kid again.....wait.....no.....<br>\r\nEve: What?<br>\r\n\"If she gave us clothes that made her younger.....then.....no....\".<br>\r\nEve: What!?<br>\r\nHe looks at her, \"what if, the clothes that you're wearing, are why you haven't changed back yet?\".<br>\r\nEve: !!!!! Of course!<br>\r\nMegan: B-but why would she do that to us?<br>\r\nEve: Because she can. Think about what kind of place this is. I don't think she meant anything bad by it. She was just pranking us.<br>\r\nMegan: Then how do we change back?<br>\r\nEve: We probably just take these off.<br>\r\nMegan looks down at the sock and realizes that she is only wearing, besides the 1 sock, a too large shirt. She blushes, but then bends over to take it off.<br>\r\nEve: Wait.<br>\r\nMegan: What?<br>\r\nEve: Lets go take a bath before we take em off.<br>\r\nMegan: ?????Ok.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take a change of clothes and head for the nearest bathroom, leaving Keith behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes taking them off work?</span></div></div>",

Let's give it a little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later and they still haven't changed back.

So I'm going to go ask her.<br>\r\nMegan agrees and puts on 1 of her small sets of clothes and they exit the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look for Keith and find him in 1 of the game rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is on a couch, watching a large screen TV. He hears them and turns around, getting a surprise to see them still small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still kids? Did it not work?\".<br>\r\nEve: No, it didnt. We even gave it a little time, nothing.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do now?\".<br>\r\nEve: I want to talk to Lisa.<br>\r\n\"I see......But thats going to have to wait......\".<br>\r\nEve: Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith points towards the closest window. While they were in the bathroom, a large thunderstorm had started and was raging outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan&amp;Eve just stare out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Until it passes, we're kinda stuck.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 of them, thinking that they were going to find a way to change back, depressingly look out the window. Keith walks over to them, kneels, and places a hand on both of their heads. They turn around and look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like we're going to be stuck inside forever. The storm will pass, and I promise, the second it does, the 3 of us will pay Lisa a visit and fix the 2 of you\".<br>\r\nThey smile at him, and Megan asks, \"what are we going to do to pass the time?\".<br>\r\n\"Well......we ARE in a game room.....there are movies, video games, ping pong, air hockey, and a lot of other things here we can do\".<br>\r\nEve: Alright, lets have some fun while were waiting.<br>\r\nMegan: Yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith gets up and steps away from them.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: Keith.<br>\r\nHe turns around.<br>\r\nMegan&amp;Eve: Thanks.<br>\r\n\".....Y-Yeah.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass as they play games, watch movies, and the 2 age regressed girls team up against him in ping pong and a few other games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm still hasn't passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide to check the forecast on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: Great.....its suppose to last all day.....<br>\r\nMegan: And its getting late.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like we'll be able to go today\".<br>\r\nMegan and Eve are depressed again.<br>\r\n\"Look, you 2, we live here now, so we couldn't make into town today, we'll go tomorrow\".<br>\r\nEve: Alright<br>\r\nMegan: I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey play for a few more hours, make dinner, and then head back to 1 of the 2 game rooms for a little longer, all the while the storm raged outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm finally ends, but its too late to go now. With no choice but to go tomorrow, they head for their rooms for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith enters his room and Eve&amp;Megan begin talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room, Keith slips on his new pair of pajamas and gets into bed. His door opens and Megan and Eve walk in, in their pajamas as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you 2 need something?\".<br>\r\nThey look at each other, then back at him.<br>\r\nMegan: W-we want to sleep with you.....<br>\r\n\"What!?\".<br>\r\nMegan: W-we can't?<br>\r\n\"......N-no, I didn't mean it like that.....but.....you 2 Eve?\".<br>\r\nEve: .....y-yes....\", she shyly says, looking away from him.<br>\r\n\".....I-I guess it's alright.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan walks over to 1 side of the bed and crawls in while Eve slowly shuffles her way to the other side and stops, looking away and blushing. She eventually gets in and lays down, facing away from Keith. Megan; however, use to her tackling Keith, uses his shoulder as a pillow while laying herself against him and making herself comfortable. She looks over at Eve, and then whispers something to Keith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Really?)<br>\r\nMegan: (Yes! Do it! She'll like it. She's just being shy!)<br>\r\n(Ok.....).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving his arm from under Megan's head and around her body, he leans over and wraps his arms around Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, and blushing, \"W-what are you doing?\".<br>\r\n\"Megan said to do this and that you'll like it\".<br>\r\nAt her size, her struggles are in vain as he flips her over and lays her against him, just as Megan was. Eve looks over at Megan, who was smiling at her as he puts an arm around her and lays her head against his shoulder. He puts his other arm back under and over Megan as he gets himself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: You like this, don't you?<br>\r\nEve: .....I.....um......<br>\r\nMegan: What? Are you going to move?<br>\r\nEve: ......n-no......<br>\r\nMegan: See? You do like it!<br>\r\n\"Stop teasing her Megan\".<br>\r\nMegan: Alright.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight you 2\".<br>\r\nMegan: Goodnight.<br>\r\nEve: G-goodnight.....</span></div></div>",

It had not been easy gaining admittance, and they were glad to be past registering at the odd place.  Since she didn't have her own ticket, the only way that they were both allowed in together was if Brooke agreed to wear a strange locking round mask-blindfold device.  The girls were told that the mask could be removed upon approval by the \"Parkmaster\", and they needed to go directly across the square from the gate until they reached the building known as the \"Task Quarters\", where arrangements would be made for them to enjoy the rest of their day at the circus park wearing \"Visitors\" ankle-bands, upon approval from said \"Parkmaster\".  \"Visitor\"-ankle bands  were a step down from the \"Preferred\"-wristband that Gabriella received from the old man and his lottery, but at least both girls would get to experience the place blindfold-free, and it would be worth it for them to both be able to see the place together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thus, Gabriella was carefully leading her bulbous-headed friend through the square filled with dancers, performers, cotton candy and refreshment vendors hawking their wares.

Brooke was shut off from a vast cornucopia of sights, sounds, and smells with her head locked into the odd device.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had not appeared at the gate as though there were so many people crowding the park, but as they neared the center of the place, Gabriella lost sight of the building they were seeking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Halfway across the activity-filled place, the girls reach an amazing fountain of colored waters, constantly changing as naked people of all ages continually climb on top of each other, altering the flow of the waters so that they merge, separate, and continue splashing all over surrounding pool.  At one side of the pool, a naked man with a gorgeous body stands like a chiseled statue, supporting a massive umbrella which shades some of the park visitors, who are relaxing in chairs sipping from strange drinks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gabriella decides to stop here for a minute before they continue to the Taskmasters Quarters.<br>\r\n   One part of her wants her best friend Brooke to at least be able to <u>feel</u> what she is seeing, so she leads her to the middle of the huge umbrella, where the rigid man with the sculpted body supports the central pole aloft above the spectators poolside enjoying the human-fountain display.

You see a sign which read RIDES and decided to follow that path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The many rides all stood out to you, as you look to find the one you wished to ride first. You ran your eyes through each of the rides, before you stopped and looked at the ride which made your jaw drop. The large train on the sign which read TRAIN OF TERROR made you instantly walk towards the small looking building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You walk into the room which was painted a dark red. You stand behind a line full of partially transformed people, going from so small transformansions such as a tail, to a woman who's body was literally made out of bread.

You follow the Circus veteran around the seemingly infinite campus of the circus before she stops at a large building which looks like a restaurant. You both walk up to the host who was standing at his podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why hello ladies, welcome to chateau de circus, where we combine the wonders of food with the wonders of transformation.

She is naked, and quite alive as she stands up when he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I didn't know I'd have the honor of being eaten by such lovely ladies\" she says as Donna picks up the knife and pushes her back into her chest. \"Ow! Be more gentle will ya!\" She asks as Donna slices her at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sweety, I don't know if you understand the digestive system, but this ain't gonna be sweet\" Your partner says as she hands you the torso and head of the cheese woman. She winces in pain as Donna chows down on her legs and ass, but you just hold the woman and stare at her in curiousity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know, I'm having second thoughts on this!\" The girl screams as you chuckle and bite off her arms, leaving her as a chest and head. You then nibble up her stomach and cheese tits, leaving her a head of cheese. \"Please just end it!\" She said as you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I'll wait.\" You say sinisterly as you set her head on the plate. She yelled in retaliation, but you fixed that by taking your lips and smearing hers off of her face. \"That's better.\" Donna laughed as you two resumed your conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So how do we pay?\" You ask Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We either become food, or they change us in some random way. Either way, it's worth it. You were delicious sweety!\" She said before patting her stomach and lifting the head of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then places it in your mouth before you roll her around with your tongue, causing as much pain as possible before swallowing the poor girl. The waiter looked over and saw you burp, and presumed you were done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now ladies, if you follow me I will let you pay.\" You follow the man and he raises his hand to reveal two pills. \"Now which one?\"</span></div></div>",

He spent Friday night packing and finishing everything that needed to be done so that he could spend the entire weekend there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrives at the gate leading into the Circus. He hands over his ticket to the creepy guy and heads inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing all of the signs at the entrance. He takes his time and decides where he is going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heads towards the rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the path for a while, he finally arrives. It was a somewhat small area filled with rides, buildings, booths, and all sorts of things. The sign above this side said. WELCOME TO CIRCUS TOWN B. \"So there are more places like this?\", he says out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My umbrella!\", he hears a girl's voice yell. He sees an umbrella fly past him, he instinctively reaches out and grabs it. He turns in the direction of the voice, only to see a girl turn the corner running. They collide and hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry!\", she says. \"It's ok. Wait, Karen!?\". \"Huh? Kyle! What are you doing here?!\", she says surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren is on the basketball team at their high school. She has short red hair and blue eyes. With less than average breasts and a body smaller than most girl's at their school, they knew each other because they are each the best in their sport and are both quite popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up and helps her to her feet. Then handing her her umbrella, they head into the small town and find an empty desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a surprise\", Kyle says. \"I wasn't expecting to find anyone that I knew here\". \"Same here,\" Karen says. \"How long have you been here?\", she suddenly asks, \"Today is my first day\". \"You too? This is my first day here as well! That's weird\", Kyle says and Karen agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, why do you have an umbrella?\". \"Oh, I heard that there was suppose to be a chance of it raining today\". And just as she finished saying this, there is a flash of lightning followed by a heavy downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both get up and she quickly opens it. \"Great, now I wish I had packed an umbrella\". Thinking for a second, she walks over to him and puts the umbrella above both of them. \"Uh...thanks,\" he nervously says. She just nods, both of them embarrassed. \"...I'll hold the umbrella,\" he offers, since he was taller than her. She then hands it to him as they both head for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking cover under the closest ride, they wait for the thunderstorm to end. Looking up, his whole body tenses up as he sees where they are. Noticing this, she looks where he is looking and tenses up as well. They are at the entrance into the Tunnel of Love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick laugh, \"great, look where we ended up!\", Karen says. \"Yeah, what are the chances of this!, Kyle says with a quick short laugh of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost half an hour pass as they both nervously wait for the storm to pass. He looks around the place, and sees other people taking cover, and others are just walking around as normal. He notices a some people exit a covered ride like the one that they are at across from them. They notice the storm and head back inside for another go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to Karen, \"that just gave me an idea\". \"What did?\", she curiously asks. \"I just saw some people exit a ride and then head back in. They had an inside ride like this one here\". He starts to get nervous. \"We don't know um how long this storm will last.....\". She gets embarrassed as well. \"If you don't mind, we could just take the ride to pass some time\". A brief pause and she says, \"...ok...I guess it's alright...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head inside and see that there isn't a line. The only person there is the attendant that helps people at the start of a ride. They walk up to him and he starts talking. \"Welcome you 2 to the Tunnel of Love. Please place your belongings in one of the bins and if this is your first time. Read the sign next to the bins\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst placing their bags into adjacent slots. They proceed to read the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHIS TUNNEL OF LOVE IS THE ONLY RIDE LIKE IT IN EXISTENCE. THE COUPLE THAT TAKES THIS RIDE WILL EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT WILL TRULY HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR PARTNER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THE EFFECTS ARE REVERSED BY TAKING THE RIDE AGAIN. OR A FEW DAYS PASS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days pass\", Kyle says as he finishes reading it out loud. Both blushing by this, Karen suddenly says, \"What does it mean by it's effects?\". \"I don't know. Maybe it gives you something in there?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head back over to the man and he moves, letting them pass the bars.</span></div></div>",

The boat is small, pink, in the shape of a heart, and has a single safety bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pause again. If they get into the boat. They would be forced to touch each other the entire ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ladies first?\", Kyle says. \"....Alright\", she says as she steps into the boat. He follows right behind, both of them touching. The safety bar coming down forces them even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun you 2\", the man says as the boat departs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head into the start of the ride. Into a small dark tunnel. He can feel her pressing up against him. \"Are you alright?\", he asks. Still pressing up against him, she responds, \"..I..don't do so well in the dark....sorry about this\". It's alright\", he responds, putting his arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's completely dark, no light at all. A skeleton pops out of nowhere, followed by Karen screaming. It was one of those horror tunnels of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more of these events, and Karen has just about completely broken down. She has buried her face into him, and was fiercely holding onto him, shaking. \"She's really scared,\" he thinks. \"She is usually so brave. I guess this just proves that everyone is scared of something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little over halfway into it, and she has not gotten better. He continues holding onto her, trying to calm her down. A large ghoul like figure appears in front of them, and it shoots out a multicolored beam of light that hits them, causing both of them to gasp. \"What was that?\", he says out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turn a corner and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. \"I can see the exit. We're just about done\", he tells her, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exit and arrive back at the start. \"Thank you Kyle\", Kyle says, \"don't mention it\", Karen says. Wait what? They noticed something different about their voices. They look at each other. Then they both scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I staring at myself!\". \"Kyle? Is that you? Why do you look like me!\". The boat docks and the safety bar raises. They are both panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walks up to the panicking pair. \"I see you 2 did not fully understand what this ride does\". \"The ride? You mean this was suppose to happen!\", Kyle says in Karen's voice. They both get out of the boat. \"You read the sign , right? That should explain everything\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits them both at the same time. The sign did warn of effects. \"Ok, now that we know what's wrong, let's try to remain calm\", Karen says. Kyle agrees, \"yeah, to reverse this, all we have to do is ride again\", he immediately remembers how scared she was. \"But if you don't want to, we could just wait for it to wear off\". \"But that could take days. I don't want you to stay like this just so I won't be scared\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?</span></div></div>",

The baggy clothing around him suddenly vanishes, leaving him naked. You can clearly see his dick shrivel away and sucked into him as it changes to its counterpart.

He points to the tallest building in this area. \"I'm pretty sure that that's a hotel\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk inside the tall building. This place definitely looks like a hotel, a fancy hotel. Everything looks like it cost a fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you 2 like a room?\", the person behind the desk asks. \"This place really is a hotel?\". \"Yes, it was decided a long time ago that the people visiting our circus may need to spend the night. There is at least one hotel in each town, and each hotel is free. So, would you like a room?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I guess so\". \"Alright, here is your key\". He hands the room key to Kyle. \"Can we get 2 rooms?\", Karen nervously asks. \"I'm terribly sorry, but that is our last available room\". \"I guess it's fine. Shall we head up Karen?\". \"Alright\". With a sudden \"ah!\", the attendant says one last thing to them as they head towards the elevator that will take them to their room. \"I see, you 2 have switched bodies. Interesting. Well, enjoy your stay\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get off at their floor and find their room. Sliding the card into the door, they enter their shared room. Blushing, and surprised looks on their faces, they can't believe the room they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small 2 person bed with red covers and pillows was in the middle of the room and against the back wall facing a TV. A small bathroom was by the door and the floor was a bright red carpet floor. There was a single red chair with a small red pillow and there were thin red curtains over the window overlooking the town. No matter how you looked at it, it was a room made for couple's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was the first one to snap out of it. Taking a few steps forward, he places their bags by the bed. 'Ok, let's just stay calm. This was the only room they had left, at least we got a room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your right\", Karen says, as she too comes out of her trance. \"I guess this really isn't that big of a deal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they said that, they are both still really nervous. Kyle then notices that Karen is squirming a bit. \"Are you alright?\", he asks. With a jolt, \"oh....uh......I have to use the bathroom\". A moment of hesitation, and with a sigh, \"just go\". She gets up and goes to the bathroom in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exits and sits back down on the bed. She gives him a nervous thanks and says that he can use the bathroom if he needs to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's now late, and they are both tired. \"Look, you take the bed Karen. I'll use the chair\". He starts to look for something he could use to cover himself while he sleeps, but Karen soon stops him. \"You can sleep here too, I don't mind\". \"Thank you\", he says as he gets into the opposite side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed is really small, they are practically touching, making it hard for both of them to sleep, though somehow, they eventually drift off, as their first day in the Circus of Desire comes to an end.</span></div></div>",

He  gets a shock as he sees the 2 mounds sticking out of his chest, he then recalls what happened the previous day, \"right, right, I'm a girl right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\", he says, noticing that something is pressing up against him. Looking behind himself, he sees someone is holding him. \"Guess she grabbed me in her sleep\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a closer look, he notices that the person who is holding him is a girl, \"What?!\", he yells, leaping out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl has long black hair and black eyes, but something is wrong. Then it hits him. She is wearing the same clothes that he had put on yesterday, and he doesn't see his original body anywhere. Somehow, Karen had become a girl again, but while in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decides not to wake her, he instead pulls the covers over her and sits in the chair, waiting for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a soft moan, Karen finally wakes up. She sits up and rubs her eyes. \"Finally awake Karen? Well good morning\". Sleepily looking at him, \"mmm....good morning\". Kyle stands up and walks over to the bed, sitting down next to her. \"I need to ask you something. Did you do anything strange before we went to bed?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Did something happen?\". He points at her chest. She looks down. She immediately wakes up. \"What? How did these get there? Why am I a girl again?\", saying so while holding the new breasts on Kyle's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her to calm down. \"Ummm, let me think..... The only thing I can think of is the piece of chocolate I had in the bowl over there\". She points to a small table by the bed with a light, telephone, and a bowl filled with small wrapped chocolates. He picks up the card that was by the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHESE CHOCOLATES ARE GUARANTEED TO MAKE A COUPLE CLOSER. EACH PIECE CHANGES THE GENDER OF WHOEVER EATS IT. BE WARNED, THE EFFECT WILL WEAR OFF AFTER 12 HOURS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, another time limit, and we still have a few hours until it wears off\". \"I'm sorry Kyle, I shouldn't have eaten them\". \"It's fine, it will eventually wear off. I'm going to take a shower now, is that alright?\". She nods. \"Ok, I'll make it as fast as possible\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes off his shirt and gulps while staring at her breasts. He says \"Must resist\", over and over in his head as he takes off her skirt, unhooks her bra, and pulls down her panties. He looks at the mirror above the sink, and just stares at the naked body of Karen in the reflection. He places a hand on her breast, \"AH! No I can't do this!\". He turns on the shower and gets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating before he starts to wash Karen's body, he hears the bathroom door open. Karen walks in. \"Karen?\", what are you doing?\". She takes in a deep breath, and starts to undress. \"Well, um, I though that it would be fine if we both took a shower, I mean, your in my body, and yours is now a girl....So, I though it would be alright\". She steps in, reaching down, she shuts off the shower and starts to fill up the tub. Standing back up, she is looking straight into Kyle's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly leaps forward and embraces him. He's stunned for a brief moment, he then puts his arms around her as they stand there, embracing each other while water fills up the tub that there standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sit down, the bath having filled up. Kyle sitting back while Karen laying against him, followed by him putting his arms around her. They sit like this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sits up, picking a bar of soap, she turns around and hands it to him. \"If you don't mind....could you wash me?\", blushing a bit while saying this. He looks at her, with a light smile, he takes the soap, \"alright, but I'm next\". She smiles back as he starts with her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the soap and a nearby towel, he starts to wash Karen's back. He takes his time, moving from one part of her body to another. He cleans every part of her. After he finished, Karen turns around and takes the soap and towel and proceeds to wash him. She finishes and they lay back once more as time seems to fly by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they figured they'd been in there long enough. They get up and towel off, brush their hair, etc. But they don't get dressed, instead they just wrap a towel around themselves and leave the room. They get back onto the bed and watch TV for a bit, while they cuddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren suddenly looks at Kyle, with a serious look on her face. He sits up, noting she seems to have something important to say. She seems nervous. \"There is something I want to tell you\". She inches closer to him. \"I-I-I..\", she stops and takes a deep breath, \"I think I love you\", her face completely flushed, and looking down. He places both hands on either side of her face. Gently bringing her back t eye level, \"me too\", he says, kissing her. She smiles as her eyes tear up a bit. She lunges at him, giving him a big hug as they both fall back onto the bed......</span></div></div>",

Karen takes it to the next step by grabbing her old breasts and rubbing his clit.

She has a fair sized pair of breasts and long, strong legs. Her name is Nicole. In preparation for the long awaited event, Nicole put on her short, cut-off denim skirt and a long sleeve shirt which shows a good deal of skin, from about an inch below her breasts to the low waistline of her skirt. A 'V' neckline shows ample cleavage and her round, well shaped ass is perfectly displayed by the tight fit of the skirt. Tonight she feels sexy and is ready to have fun.<br>\r\n   As Nicole approaches the tunnel of love, she notices three lines forming at the begining of the ride. Each has a sign over the starting point of the line. The far left sign reads, \"To Be Paired With Boy\", the middle one, \"To Be Paired With Girl\" and the one on the far right reads, \"For Those Who Like Surprises\". This is something she has never seen before. Excited and anxious, she gets in the far right lane.<br>\r\n   \"What are you hoping for?\" asks a girl ahead of her in line. She is a short haired blonde with a white, spagetti strap shirt and tight, black leather pants. She has perky breasts, bright green eyes and a lip ring.<br>\r\n   \"I'm not too picky. Just hope whoever it is, they are as hot as you\" The blonde blushes and Nicole smiles. \"My name is Nicole by the way.\"<br>\r\n   \"Samantha.\" and the two girls shake hands, looking at eachother in a very obvious way. They talk to eachother for a few minutes and get to know one another. Once they reach the end of the line, the opperater smilles at Nicole and she says, \"I know who to pair you with. You!\"<br>\r\n   \"Me?\" asks Samantha in a small, sheepish voice. The opperator nods and the two girls seat themselves on the ride.<br>\r\n   \"I wonder what the ride will be like.\" Samantha tells Nicole.<br>\r\n   \"Hopefully fun.\" And Nicole takes Samanthas hand as they start to ride. once inside they see hearts and cupids decorating the walls and petals on the floor beside the trail of water. Nicole squeezes Samanthas hand as they ride past dancing swans and singing cupids. Samantha relaxes with the soft love song playing and rests her head on Nicoles shoulder. Lifting her chin gently with her left hand, Nicole kisses her on the her soft, puffy lips. Samantha is surprised and then decides to kiss back. Nicole presses her tongue into her partners mouth and they explore eachothers mouths in a sentuous french kiss. Suddenly they enter a room that is pitch black. Nicole feels a small, soft hand creep up her leg and under her skirt. She is glad she isn't wearing any underwear. She moans in pleasure as the once mildly timid girl now probes her vaginal opening. They begin to explore eachothers bodies with eager hands and mouths when the turn a corner and there is light once more. Nicoles skirt is pushed up around her waist and Samantha's top has been removed, showing her supple breasts and stomach. Finally, at the end of the ride, a small waterfall drenches the two in their boat.<br>\r\n   Once off the boat, the ride opperator hands them towels and they dry off as they head the the exit.<br>\r\n   \"Where to next?\" asks Samantha, who is smiling and holding Nicole's hand. \"Elephants?\"<br>\r\n   \"How about the roller coaster!\"</span></div></div>",

She closed the door, hung the suit on a hand rail and, trying to look past the smell, began to strip down. When she was fully undressed, she realized that she needed to use the facilities.

With a gut wrenching splash, she landed in a pool of human refuse 4 and a half feet deep. Jessica's head broke the surface, immediately uttering a deafening scream of fear and shock. When the shock dissipated, she recollected herself and decided the first thing she could do would be to put the suit on, being her only shield of decency. She put her legs through the holes fairly easily, but with such a smaller suit, it required more effort pinning the rest to her succulent frame. When in was finally on, it hugged her frame to the point of being worse than going naked, the rubber tightness making all of her curves stand out in hi-def, but she couldn't take it off, because the back automatically sealed and she was unable to undo it. To make matters worse, when she put it on, some of the refuse was trapped inside against her body.

The girl hears Evelyn say this and looks at her, giving her a big smile.</span></div></div>",

Slowly looking behind her, her eyes widen as she sees someone she knows<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kyle, someone she knew from her school, he is one of the most popular guys at school, good grades and good in sports. He is pretty well built, taller than her, at least her original height, has blue eyes and blond hair. \"What is he doing here?\" she says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting him to see her like this, her eyes start to tear up. Seeing this, he starts to panick. \"W-wait, don't start crying, it-its fine,\" he keeps going like this, trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues, \"let, let me guess. This is your first day here right?\" she simply nodes her head, eyes still watering, as she slowly continues to shrink. \"Uh,\" he says with a relieved look on his face, \"that explains it then, ok, then you probably do not know what this place is really about, so I'll explain it to you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The circus part of this place is a front, there really is a circus further in, but its not what this place is really about\". She can only give him a confused look. \"This place, was designed for fun and relaxation. There are places to relax, such as benches, restaraunts, and even some places to play sports, though, as you noticed, there are some \"different\" things here, like that petite fruit you just ate, who ever eats one of those shrinks to about the size of a doll for 30 minutes, and there are many other things like it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving calmed down enough, she manages to say something, \"h-how long have you been here?\". \"Hm, me, oh about a month, I come every weekend and when I have some free time\". With another surprised look she asks, \"how do you keep getting in? I just happened to win a contest yesterday?\". \"So that is how you ended up here, I heard there was a contest in town for a ticket into this place, as to how I keep coming here, once you get a ticket and give it to the guy at the front gate, you can always come back. They like, take a picture of you or something, that is how, I got a ticket a month ago and have been able to come back ever since\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, she had shrunk by a lot, she was less than half her original height. Finally, unable to hold anymore, her pants fell to the ground, as well as her panties. Blushing bright red, she immediately tries to cover herself, however, doing so caused her shirt to drop even more, causing her to trip, falling to the ground. \"Ah!, are you ok? Kyle asks. \"Ow, I-I guess\" she responds\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts to walk over to her, panicking again, she tries to cover herself up better. He sits down next to her. \"If you want, I can show you around,\" he says. Surprised by this, she responds \"i-if you want to, I am fine with it\". \"Ok we just need to wait for your shrinking to stop then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing again, they both wait as she continues to shrink, until she is finally the size of a doll. Sitting at where the head part of her shirt was, she just sits there, covering herself with her shirt. \"Ah\" Kyle says as his face lights up, \"I just got an idea\" he says as he rummages through his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it\" he say pulling out a bright red handkerchief, \"I have learned a long time ago that bringing things like this can help, here use this to cover yourself,\" he says handing it to her. \"Thanks,\" she says as she takes it and wraps it around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then bends over, putting his right hands palm in front of her. \"Now then, I did promise you that tour, and we have 30 minutes till your back to normal, oh, and congradulations on winning that contest,\" \"gee, thanks\" Nami says as she climbs onto his hand. He puts her on his shoulder, packs her clothes into her bag, picks his and her bag up, and turns his head and says, \"where do you want to go?\"</span></div></div>",

The gas slowly enters and fills up the chamber, making it impossible for Kyle to see inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside of the chamber, nami is freaking out, she cant see and she is starting to feel strange. By now, she has inhaled quite a bit of this gas, and its starting to get to her, her entire body feels like it is burning, but in a good way, she is stumbling around inside and cant see straight, not that she can see through all this gas anyway. She finally just leans herself against the glass and closes her eyes, hoping that whatever is happening to her will wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine finally stops making noise and producing the strange gas. Nami opens her eyes to see the gas disapearing. As the last of the gas vanishes, the door slides open letting her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the chamber, she looks over at Kyle and just sees him staring at her. \"Am I glad to get out of there, ? whats wrong, why are you staring at me?\" Getting an itch on her head, she puts one hand up to scratch it, \"hmmm? whats this?\" she says as she feels something strange on the side of her head. After a second of thought, she realizes what it was. Quickly looking around she sees some mirrors near the machine. Running over to one of the mirrors, falling on he knees, her eyes widen at what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side of her head, on both sides, where dog ears, red in color, slightly drooping like dog ears. With one hand on each ear, she cant believe what she is seeing. Still looking at herself in the mirror,still on her knees, something catches her eye, looking behind her she gets another shock, a semi-long semi-bushy red tail is sticking out of her pants. Letting go of her new ears, she grabs her tail, \"I-I'm a dog!?\" she says in a high pitch voice.</span></div></div>",

Nami was feeling both terror and pleasure by this. She hated what he was doing to her, but it just felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly gets faster, and she knew what that meant. \"..... can't hold it in much longer girl,\" he says, then, with one large thrust, he releases all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands up, as a few final drops fall on her stomach, he then moves to her feet, \"well, I think its time to start the final part, don't you?\"</span></div></div>",

The entire time that she was on the ground, she had been trying to move, but now she is only trying it every minute or so. After waiting long enough, she tries to mover her hand, and her hand starts to twitch, its wearing off. Trying once more to mover her hand, she is finally able to, lifting it up and testing it, she is in full control once more. She decides to try to sit up, and is able to, the spell has completely worn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to move, she sits herself up, making sure that the blanket is covering her. \"I see the spell has worn off,\" Kyle says as she gets up. Nami just sits there for a few seconds, and then looks at him. \"...W-what? Is something wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?\" He then notices something, her eyes are starting to tear up again. \"Uh, no don't cry, not now.\" But she doesn't, instead she just leaps at him, burying her head in his chest and saying, \"Thank you,\" over and over again. Stalling for a minute, he eventually puts his arms around her and says, \"no problem\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he gently pulls her off of him and hands her her bag. \"So um, here's your bag, get dressed and we'll be on our way,\" he says as he gets up and walks over to his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it out of the ground, he starts to clean it off as Nami pulls her spare set of clothes from her bag and gets dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up, she closes her bag and goes over to Kyle as he finishes up too. He then opens up his bag and simply drops the sword into it. This surprises her, the bag itself was smaller than the sword, how did it fit? Noticing her surprise, he says, \"I got this bag here, it can hold a lot more than you think it would\". \"...Ok,\" Nami says quickly turning her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his bag, he picks it up and walks over to her, \"let's go...oh wait a second,\" he says as he walks over to Nami's ripped up clothing. Gathering it all up, he heads back over to Nami and hands it to her, \"here, take these anyway, where we are going, we can get them fixed,\" she takes them and puts them in her bag as they continue down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Nami finally starts to talk again, \"....so, is that guy dead now?\" she asks him. \"No, like I told you before, no one can die here, he will simply get sent to one of the many respawn places here. And like I also told you, people here don't really have to worry about consequences, you know how it is, when you don't have to worry about death, people tend to be more relaxed and can get away with a lot of things\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but where did he learn magic? I thought that stuff wasn't real\". \"Oh, its real, in this place there are many places where you can learn things like that. Though considering his strength and stuff, I guess he learned his stuff at the Colosseum\". \"Colosseum?\" she asks, \"ah right, you wouldn't know about that, you see, its one of the attractions here, there are plenty of shops and stores, as well as places to learn things like magic, people go there to watch people team up or solo fights against other people or monsters\".</span></div></div>",

That building there is a free hotel. That's where we should spend the night\", Nami agrees and they head towards the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the tall building, Nami stops and stares at the inside. It looked expensive. Kyle just walks up to the front desk, \"hello. We would like a room\". \"Alright\", the attendant says. She finds and hands him the key to their room, \"enjoy your stay\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to her, \"I got us a room, let's go. What's wrong?\", he says, noticing that she is fidgeting a bit and seems to be nervous. Then it hits him, \"right. Want me to get another room?\". \"N-no. It's fine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair enter their room and place their things by the large single bed. Kyle then tells her that he is going to take a quick shower. He exits and Nami takes one. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging through his bag, he removes something and turns towards Nami. She turns to look at him as he starts to talk to her. \"Hey, Nami. While we were in town, I....got you something\", he shows her a small box in his hands. She takes it, surprised, embarrassed, and happy. A small red collar was inside the box. She looks up at him, confused. He smiles and starts to stroke one of her ears. The dog part of her takes over, she lays her head on his lap and he continues to pet her. \"I know you like being part dog, so I got you this. I used some of the money I got during the month that I've been here\". Sitting her back up, he takes the collar, \"mind if I put it on?\". She lifts her head up, making it easier for him. Nami looks down at the collar and notices something. There is a small gold heart shaped trinket attached to the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front had her name engraved into it. She flipped it over, it said that to return her to him if found. Blushing a bit, she looks up and hugs him. \"Glad you like it\", he says, petting her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time was different, she lifts her head up and starts to lick him. He is surprised by this, but before he can say anything, she kisses him, and they both fall backwards and onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start making out. Kyle makes the next move, he starts to rub her breasts, she lets out a surprised noise, but she doesn't resist. Nami suddenly stops, she sits up, still blushing, but with a smile on her face, she removes her shirt and skirt. She sits there, and Kyle does the same, the both of them are now in their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches back and unhooks her bra. Gently laying her on her back, he starts to play with her breasts. He does this, and they kiss a few more times. Backing up, he uses both hands to slowly remove her panties. She cringes as he starts to rub her slit with a single finger. After playing with both her pussy and her breasts, he pulls off his boxers, revealing his erect member. \"I'm going to put it in now\", he tells her. Still blushing, she responds, \"be gentle\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly inserting his dick, he starts to move back and forth. They go at it for over 10 minutes. Nami is now on all 4s as Kyle hits her from behind. \"I can't last much longer, should I release in you?\". Nami stammers for a bit, but finally manages to say, \"yes\". Then with one final thrust, they both yell and cum at the same time. Nami falls on her stomach, panting, and cum slowly dripping out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a few minutes, Kyle flips her over and starts to clean her once again. She gets up, and they both go to bed, the 2 of them holding each other tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami wakes up, but somethings wrong....</span></div></div>",

He continues, \"though, I though that you might be upset, and that is one of the reasons I got you that collar\". She looks at the collar, the only thing that she is wearing, \"the collar?

He watches as the left side of the door is opened, and standing in front of him is a girl in a maid outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quite attractive and looked around his age, she has long black hair and blue eyes, large breasts and a very nice body. She smiles at him and says, \"hello, what can I do for you?\". He quickly responds with, \"oh, uh I was just walking along that path and stumbled upon this house,\" \"I see,\" she says back, \"well, if you'd like, you are welcomed to come inside, I am sure the master would love meeting you\". He thinks about this for a second and decides to take up her offer, why not? She seems like a nice girl and this \"master\" peeks his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" she says as she heads into the house.

A different maid comes out of this one. She is slightly smaller than the previous maid with smaller breast as well, she has blue hair and blue eyes and is still quite pretty. \"Oh, I didn't know we had a guest, I'll be right back with some tea,\" she says quickly leaving through the same door. She comes back a few minutes later and places a tray in front of Alex and pours him a cup. \"Thanks,\" he said as he took a drink, he really did not like tea, but didn't want to be rude to her. \"Is there anything else I can get you?\" she asks, \"no, no I'm fine,\" he quickly responds. He finishes up and she takes the tray and dishes with her through the door she had entered from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes pass as the door where the first maid went through finally opens.

There is a single window, with curtains. A large dresser, and lamp, and a ceiling fan/light. The main point of the room was the bed. A  large king sized bed with the slidable curtains is in the middle of the room. He has to admit, it looks really comfortable, even though everything was a shade of purples, pinks, and whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\", Catherine asks after he had examined the room. \"Well, it looks really comfortable. And there are a lot of, um, light colors?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up behind him and grabs him. She lowers her lips to one of his ears, \"It's good that you like it. Since it could be yours. Ladies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets out of her grasp and backs away from her. \"What?\", he says, followed by Mariana and Ami each grabbing him by an arm. He tries to break free, but the girls are stronger than they look. \"Wh-what are you doing?\", he says in a surprised voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little initiation test. To see if you can join us\", she says as she inches towards him. She grabs his head, and kisses him, her tongue dancing in his mouth. The maids then place him on the floor, still holding onto him. Mariana takes over for Ami, and holds keeps him pinned by holding his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi goes towards his feet. She takes off his shoes his socks. Placing her hands on his pants, \"let's see what he's got!\" she says as she yanks them and his boxers off in one pull. It's small. With disappointed looks on their faces, Catherine says, \"oh well, just finish up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed and upset at the same time, this is the first time that a girl has seen his member. His face bright red, he has been struggling in vain the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress\", she says as she starts to play with his cock with her hands. She pokes it, strokes it, rubs it, and does just about everything that she can think of with her hands. His cock hardens as he starts to give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases and leans in closer, as she starts to suck it. A little bit of this, and he can't hold out any longer. Ami's face widens and her cheeks puff up. Her head shoots back as she starts to cough. His cock had grown to a foot long. \"What the hell was that!\" Ami says as she stops coughing and notices how big he's gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, there is a sudden scream as all 3 of them rush over to it. \"What is this? How can he have a foot long cock?!\", they keep talking like this as they fondle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure, Catherine stands up. \"I think we found him\", she says and they both agree. \"Congratulations Alex. You now work for me!\". \"What? Why? What is going on!?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you should know now. For you see, we have been looking for a long time now for someone with a massive dick like yours\". \"And what if I refuse!\". \"You can't\", she says with an evil grin, \"you don't have a choice in this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as we planned now!\", Catherine says as her maids grab hold of him again. They remove the last of his clothes and put him onto the bed. Catherine gets onto the bed and crawls over to him. Starring him in the face, she kisses him again. \"How long I have waited for this!

You stare at the woman, struggling hopelessly against the rope which bound her to the wood, and decided that she would become a silver woman on a necklace, and snapping your fingers, watching as the woman dwindled down to four inches and became metal. You walk over to your victim before picking her up by the string which went through her head and placed the necklace over your head. You walk back to the senior witch, tiny woman hanging in cleavage, and look at her. \"Where to next Wendy?\" you ask her.</span></div></div>",

You quickly find a trail which leads deeper into the forest, looking around at the beauties of nature. You were now one of the most powerful creatures in the entire Circus, and you were excited to test out this newfound dominance. You ponder on what you could do, as you see the path dump out onto a large road. There are people littered around here, scurrying here and there. You see all sorts of vehicles, from carriages to chariots as transportation for the many people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look and spot a woman who appears to be new, like you and walk up to her. She is all alone, and therefore you feel safe to snap your fingers and change her into a winged beauty of a horse. She is completely subservient, and the rest of the crowd barely gives you a glance as this was such commonplace. It was rare to see a witch, but most had been for so long that they didn't care for anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You mount your new Pegasus, ad giddy her into the sky. This was amazing, you could see the people grow smaller and smaller as you fly high. You look and see a fork in the road leading to four separate trails.

They are all watching a man in a business suit give a speech behind a podium.You walk to the back of the crowd and watch the speech play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello and welcome to the Competition!\" he says joyously. \"As I'm sure all of you know, we are in desperate need of a leader for the new town! Because of this, we are holding a competition to see who is the most powerful here. You must demonstrate your knowledge and skills in order to show your superiority. The only rule is, No Rules!\" Everyone cheers at this last proclamation as he steps down from the podium and a redheaded woman steps up. If you would settle down, I would like to announce the first contest! We are going to have a One on One basketball tournament to see athletic skill.\" You smile at this thought, seeing the endless ways you could win. \"Now everyone make your way to the basketball courts, and we'll instruct anyone who wants to compete after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You follow the crowd towards the seemingly endless rows of basketball courts, heading over to where they told the competitors to stand. The same redheaded woman came over and started splitting people off, assigning opponents. She eventually gets to you, where she tells you and a blonde woman of about 6'3 to head over to court 34. You walk alongside the woman, who currently towers over you. She laughs at your serious face as you enter the court, where there is one referee waiting for you two. \"two minute games. we start in three minutes. Get ready ladies.\" he says to you two as you head over to your side of the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You have to do something fast, so you focus in on your skills and snap your fingers. Before you know it, you are steadily growing taller and more muscular, much to the shock of the other girl. She looks terrified as you shoot up to ten feet tall. The ref laughs at the turning of the tables as you pop your knuckles. Thinking how this isn't enough, you snap your fingers and watch as you shoot up another three feet to thirteen feet. The seven foot difference would make for a much more interesting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The ref blows his whistle and throws the ball up as you grab it and run her over, setting the ball in the goal with literally no effort whatsoever. You dont even give her a chance to get the ball, scoring until the time runs out. The girl is eliminated as you move on in the tournament. You make your way through the tourney like this, dominating everyone you play, absolutely recking havoc on the rest of the populace. You win until you make it to the championship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They lead you into an arena, packed with cheering people as you look on the other side to see a 7 foot tall black woman, stretching herself out. She looks like she could actually pose a threat to you. Her muscles bulge out of her tank top as she dunks the ball over and over again. You panic, deciding to take extra measures before the game started. You snap your fingers and watch as she slowly shrinks from her height at seven feet to a pathetic three feet. She is terrified as you snap once more and watch her muscular frame morph into fat, becoming easily 250 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The game starts and you let her grab the jump ball. You chuckle as she tries to pull up, but you wrap your hand around the ball and take it.You look down at the barbie sized girl and pick her up in the hand you aren't dribbling in. You examine her before deciding that you might as well just end the game. You toss her into the stands, and put on a show, dunking in tremendous fashion. The crowd erupts as the ref blows the whistle and confetti rains down. The man in a business suit comes down and carries a trophy. You snap your fingers and shrink back to normal size, as he hands you the trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do I get the town?\" You ask the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well</span></div></div>",

You follow him out of the building before snapping and granting yourself the power of flight. You soar off into the sky and watch the crowds stare up in amazement, heading over to the new town. You fly to the new Coville and look down at the empty plot of land, before snapping and with a single thought watching as dozens of skyscrapers sprout up from the grass. You then build a river to flow through the middle of the town, a concrete riverwalk running parallel on both sides.Smaller buildings appeared in between the skyscrapers, and an amusement park grew at the end of the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look at your grand creation and fly down, making out the biggest skyscraper and pronouncing it your headquarters.

The tube on each flower closes shut and they compact together. Suddenly, the flowers reopen and return to their normal shape as numerous small glowing pollen like spheres shoot out of each flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing she could do as the glowing pollen spread around the entire area completely covering everything around the flowers, including her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbles around for the next minute as she coughs wipes the pollen from her face.

Her eyes widen when her hand touches her skin, she is not wearing anything, she is completely naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing bright red, she takes a few steps backwards and trips, falling once more, but onto something soft. Getting back onto her feet, she reaches for what she fell on, it felt like a blade of grass, but it was too big! \"What is this?\" she says to herself as she continues to examine the strange object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes quickly snap shut as a sudden bright light hits her in the face again. \"That must be those flowers, at least I'll be able to see,\" she says as she waits for her vision to come back. Her vision finally adjusting to the light, her face is filled with the look of both shock and horror at what she is looking at. Yes, they are the same flowers, but they were far too big! Quickly looking behind her, she sees what the object was that was on her, it was her clothes. She had shrunk, and was not around 1 foot in height.</span></div></div>",

The top of one of the flowers opens up even more and 4 yellow glowing objects that look like stigma rise out of the top of the flower. One quickly stretches itself out of the flower and lunges itself in Sarah's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught completely off guard, it quickly wraps itself around her, pinning her arms at her side. She tries as hard as she can to break free, but its useless, it is too strong. She still tries though, as it lifts her up off of the ground and dangles her over the top of the flower. With one quick movement, it pulls her inside along with the other ones and closes itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lets her go and she is now sitting at the base of the flower. She can still see though, and looking around, she tries hitting the plant, but nothing happens, there is no way out for her.She eventually just sits down and waits for it to do whatever its going to do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly jumps to her feet, looking down, she sees what caused her to get up. There at the very center of the flower, a hole had appeared, she looked down it and could not see the bottom. Though with a sigh of relief, she sits back down, the hole was not big enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower does not like this, it starts moving itself, up and down, twisting itself, and moving in all sorts of positions trying to get her to go down the hole. Sarah is flopping all over the place, hitting the walls and floor, just getting tossed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her dismay, her head hits the hole and gets sucked in, only her shoulders prevent her from going in deeper as she tries to pull her head out. Knowing that she is stuck in its hole, it tries even harder to pull her in deeper. She feels her body shift as a familiar feeling comes over her, wondering what it was, she realizes it as she suddenly gets sucked in some more, the plant was making her even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders finally slip through as she feels the flower pulling her in deeper and deeper as the shrinking finally stops. With every pull of the flower finds herself getting sucked in more and more as her breasts go leaving her ass and legs the only thing outside the hole now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her butt too gets sucked in, she is feeling nothing but pleasure, with every pull, she felt a wave of pleasure run throughout her body. Her legs get sucked in and with one final pull, her feet enters too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pulling goes a lot faster now as her feet get sucked in, moving deeper and deeper down the plant, she cums multiple times. Her head finally finds the exit as she is looking at its stomach? With one large movement, her entire body enters this chamber. Looking around, she sees multiple holes on its ceiling, the entire flower patch was made of only a few of these creatures! There is no stomach acid though, just a chamber, she continues to look around, hoping to find someway out of this thing before it continues with whatever it is planning.</span></div></div>",

A strange bluish liquid starts seeping out of the walls and onto the floor as Sarah backs up. The liquid hits her feet and a strange tingling sensation runs up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take how great it felt, she falls on her ass and is unable to get back up. The sensation gets bigger and bigger as more of her body touches it. As the feeling gets stronger, Sarah is completely taken by the pleasure that she is feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally regaining enough control of herself she manages to look down, and this completely brings her back. This strange liquid was slowly melting her. She saw her body being softened and then liquified. Starting to panick, she tries to get away, but her hands and most of her legs have been melted and are swimming around her. The liquid continues, dissolving her hips, torso, and breasts until her head hit the strange bluish liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....No....I......don't......want to be....plant food....\", Sarah manages to say as her head melts and joins the rest of her body floating the the liquid that melted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she sits up with a confused look on her face,\"where am I?\" she says out loud, then it all came back to her, \"how am I alive?

The problem is that it can't be made by normal means. I mean, the main ingredient is a person after all\". Sarah stops struggling, Vivian's words had paralyzed her. \"What's wrong? You look pale. Whatever, it doesn't matter. Let's begin, shall we?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 2nd hand comes out of the ceiling and grabs onto one arm as the first grabs the other, holding her in the air by her arms. After the hands had a tight hold, a 3rd emerges and moves right in front of her. It then proceeds to remove every article of clothing on her and puts them in a basket.  \"Just as I though!\", Vivian happily says, \"your perfect for this!\". 2 more hands appear and each grab a leg and spreads them while the 3rd hand finds and places a very large bowl below Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same hand then opens a cabinet and pulls out a small bag. It then pours this bluish powder along her from her neck to her pussy. \"That's a special powder that will change your body. You'll find out what I mean soon enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to feel, odd. She feels hot and is starting to pant. \"What's going on?\", saying in her head, \"i feel...strange...and my head, all ...fuzzy....\".

Vivian steps forward and stares down at her. \"How does it feel? It should be hard to think right now. But if you think that felt good, just wait for the next part\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later. \"It's been long enough, the powder should be in full effect now. Let's see\". She lifts her right hand and presses it into Sarah's stomach. It goes through and reforms back after she pulls her hand out. \"Good the dough is ready\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she call me? Dough? Ugh...it's getting harder to think straight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time\", says Vivian, snapping her fingers, causing 2 hands to reappear. Sarah manages to look up at them just before they grab her head and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fold her head and legs into her stomach and then place her arms there. They stick together. One hand them starts to pound the dough until it was flat while the other spreads flour on one of the counters. The hands then lift the flattened Sarah out of the bowl and onto the table, spread a bit of flour on her, then proceed to kneed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian recalls the hands, \"I'll take it from here\". She places a bit of flour on her hands and starts to kneed her herself. She pounds, flattens, and rolls Sarah over and over until she gets what she wanted. Sarah is now a flesh colored ball of dough that's about the size of a basketball. She pokes the dough with a finger, \"oh, perfect! Nice and hot too!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian rummages through a cabinet and pulls out a large cake pan. After greasing it, she picks up the dough and places it in the pan. There is a sudden ding. \"Just on time! Looks like the oven is done preheating\". She then opens the oven and places the pan inside and sets the timer. \"Now to wait\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Sarah is still barely conscious. \"Uh..uh...I..can't believe...uh...this. I'm being..cooked\". The temperature increases as she starts to harden and expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer hits 0 and there is another ding. \"It's done!\", Vivian cheers. She puts on oven mitts and takes out the pan. She removes Sarah and places her on a large plate. Taking a small sample. \"This is heavenly! So soft, so moist and fluffy! I knew you would make a great cake!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to decorate her. Putting on a layer of white frosting, and using pink icing and strawberries as decorations. \"There!

I'll even pay you next time!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way towards where the party is suppose to be, the girl holds up the cake. \"I wonder who you are? All I know is that your a girl\". She shrugs. \"I guess it can't be helped, my name is Melissa. Nice to meet you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at a large house in the forest, Melissa lifts her back up. \"Well, here we are, my home. There is still some time before my friends arrive, so I guess you'll have to wait\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts Sarah in her kitchen and starts to prepare for the party. After a few minutes, she starts to converse with the cake. \"I'm having 2 people over tonight. My friends Cathy and Brian. There going to spend the night as we just have fun. And when you reform, you can come over anytime. I have to meet you in person\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and the door bell rings. \"Ah! There here!\". She opens the door and greats them. Cathy has short brown hair and brown eyes and Brian also has short brown hair but with black eyes. She welcomes them as they enter her home and they sit and talk in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy's stomach growls, interrupting their conversation. \"Great! Time for cake!\", Melissa happily says as she quickly gets up and heads towards the kitchen. She then emerges with some drinks, gives 2 to her guests, and puts one in her seat and heads back towards the kitchen. \"Why are you so excited?\", Brian asks. \"It's the cake I bought! It's special!\". \"How is it special?\". \"You'll see!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen. \"Okay cake, I hope your ready to meet my friends!\". She removes Sarah and places her on a plate. She then carries her out to her friends and places her in between them. \"That cake looks delicious\", Cathy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it will be beyond any cake we have ever eaten! For you see, this cake is really a girl!\". There both a bit shocked. \"You mean this is one of those human cakes!?\", Melissa nods. \"Wow, you found something rare! This is going to be amazing!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa picks up the large knife and starts to divide Sarah up between them, each of them getting a 3rd of her. With Sarah now in 3 pieces, Melissa takes the first bite. She sticks her fork into her and removes a piece of the golden brown cake. Lifting it up, she places it into her mouth. Her face lights up and she places her free hand oh her face. \"Oh my god! This is amazing! And it's warm!\". Brian and Cathy try her as well, followed by their faces lighting up and agreeing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah quickly disappears as they make short work of her. Melissa takes the last bite of her and washes her down with her drink. They all sit back and rub their stomachs. \"Oh, I ate too much! But I couldn't help it! She was so good. That was so worth it!\", and her friends agree.</span></div></div>",

She was in their stomachs, all 3 of them, and it was like she was in 3 places at once. She could see and hear in them as well. Truly strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is done. What now?\", Cathy asks. \"I don't know, we have a few things we could do. Watch some TV, go on a walk. We could even do it\", Melissa says. They both instantly say that they want to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 of them walk upstairs and enter Melissa's room. They strip and start a 3some. They kiss, massage, and fuck each other over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only speeds up her digestion. She can feel herself melt into goo as she rocks back and forth in their bodies. Of course this in itself was a pleasure beyond explanation. But she still hasn't lost consciousness, on the contrary, she is wide awake. She feels herself sucked into their intestines as she slowly vanishes, her body being used to fuel what is going on on the outside. She finally stops moving as she is deposited into the large intestine. She feels herself slowly harden and compact as she is pushed to the final part of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each feel the pressure and take turns going to the restroom one by one, and each time, she feels part of her vanish. Melissa was the last one to use the restroom. She sits down and lets her out. She gets up and looks at Sarah as she flushes. \"It was nice meeting you! I hope we see each other again\", and Sarah blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wakes up the next day. It's now Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, she sees that she is naked. Looking to her left, she sees her stuff on the table. Quickly getting dressed, she makes for the exit as the person in charge of this place says goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, she is in the same town as that bakery. \"Of course I'd be here, that house wasn't too far away and of course a town would have one of these revival stations\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds an empty table outside and sits down, thinking of what has happened so far. \"Ok, so far, I've been shrunk, digested, and absorbed by a plant. Forced to have sex with that nurse, Jessica and lost my virginity. Went into that girl's bakery, what was her name? Vivian? Who turned me into a cake and sold me to Melissa, who her and her 2 friends ate me. I can't believe I saw myself come out of their asses and flushed 3 times....But, I can't lie, that was amazing. This place, this circus really is amazing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembers Vivian's and Melissa's offer. Should she go see the one that turned her into a cake? Of the one that ate her?</span></div></div>",

Follow me.\"  Sarah followed Vivian into the back room, where another girl Sarah's age was lying on the table, unable to move.  A bell rang.  \"Do me a favor and knead her, will you?  I need to attend to my customer.\"<br>\r\nSarah leaned over the girl, hesitant.  The girl seemed quite dazed, much like Sarah had when she had been turned to dough.  \"Well, here goes nothing.\"  Awkwardly, she began massaging the girl's left leg.  It felt exactly like dough.  Curious, Sarah picked up the girls right leg and twisted it around her left.  They stuck together.  After a bit of kneading, the girl took on the appearance of a mermaid.  Sarah, gaining confidence, moved up the girl's body, kneading her stomach.  When she worked her way to the girl's breasts, she hesitated, but figured the girl was too dazed to care.  Her breasts gave way nicely, and Sarah folded her arms over her now kneaded chest and massaged them into her body.  Finally, she worked her way up to the girl's neck as a muffled scream was heard from the front.  Sarah picked up the girl's head.  It was soft like the rest of her body, although Sarah expected different for some reason.  She hesitated again, as the girl was staring into her eyes, then pushed her head into her body.  Wondering what was taking Vivian so long, she began shaping the dough into various forms.  She noticed that her hands were quite sticky, so she licked one out of curiosity.  IT was the most amazing dough she had ever tasted!  She nibbled a bit more, then remembered that the cake girl wasn't hers and returned to shaping it just as the door opened.</span></div></div>",

Ah, good, you've done well.  Maybe I'll have to hire you on my staff!\"  Vivian took over, and soon the dough girl was loaded into a cake pan and was baking in the oven.  \"Now, for you!  A good cake needs frosting, of course!  How about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.  I'm still not quite used to this.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it eventually, don't worry.  Now, I'd advise you to strip.  We can't have cloth clogging up the blenders now, can we?\"<br>\r\nSarah hesitantly undressed.  \"Blenders?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Frosting has to be light and fluffy!  Now step up here.\"  Sarah climbed a large ladder.  At the top was a slide that led down into the largest mixing bowl she had ever seen.  A pale blue light washed over her, causing her body to tingle.  Vivian pressed a button, and giant blenders lowered into the bowl and began spinning.  Sarah noticed that the slide led right next to the blender.  \"Go on, slide down!\"<br>\r\nSarah hesitantly began sliding down the large slide, braking as much as possible.  Soon, she reached the blender.  She began to have second thoughts and became quite scared, but before she could turn over and crawl back up the slide, her foot caught it and was instantly whipped away into white fluffy frosting.  The blender began to pull her towards it, and she watched as her legs were being converted to frosting upon contact with the blades.  The sensation was quite strange.  As she slid further and further, the bowl began to fill with her frosting \"legs\" (although they certainly looked nothing like legs now).  When it reached her knees, she managed to grab a hold of a ridge in the slide and halt her progress.  But how long can she hold on?</span></div></div>",

The last part of her to slide in was her hands.<br>\r\nVivian stopped the blender when Sarah was good and fluffy.  \"Excellent.  When the cake is done, I shall spread you on her.

Y'know, your bodies are quite brittle and tasty; I wouldn't start a fight.\"<br>\r\nSarah thought about it.  Maybe being eaten would reform her as a human.

The nurse began licking Sarah's hands, and they melted in her mouth.  \"Mmm, tasty!  You chocolate girls sure taste good!\"  The nurse polished off her arms and grabbed her legs, breaking them off one by one and eating them.  Then the nurse grabbed Sarah's head and broke it off.  She ate Sarah's body and then carried her head to the lounge.  the nurse got out two large dishes.  The first she filled with ice cream, and the second she put Sarah's head in.  \"I've been wanting hot chocolate syrup on ice cream all day.  Lucky you!\"  She put Sarah into the microwave and turned it on.  Sarah felt her body soften, and watched as a pool of melted chocolate formed around her head.  Soon her face melted, leaving her blind.  When her entire body was nothing but syrup, the nurse took her out, poured her on the ice cream, and polished her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reformed once more later, with a third nurse in the room.

However, as she reached outside, she noticed that the sun seemed hotter than usual.  She had never felt the sun's heat like this before, but as she looked at a thermometer, it read merely 90 degrees.  She began to sweat a lot, and she wiped her forehead.  Wait, sweat?  Her thought process slowly clicked into place.  Chocolate doesn't sweat, and it felt like she took off a bit of her forehead when she wiped it...  She looked behind her and realized that she was leaving chocolate footprints...  Her vision began to get hazy, and when she reached up to wipe her nose, her fingers stuck together and she wiped it clean off!  She realized that she was melting!  She sat on a curb to think how to cope with this, but the hot cement only accelerated the process and she found that she couldn't stand back up.  She became dimly aware of Candy standing above her half-melted body, laughing.  She could feel herself sinking into a puddle of her own chocolate, but she wasn't completely unconscious.  She could sense the approach of a machine, a street cleaner.  She felt her liquid body get sucked up into the machine and come into contact with a strong acid.  Then she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that Sarah knew, she was back at the revival clinic, and a third nurse was checking her over.

All our meals are prepared fresh; you can watch us make it.\"  Jelly went to the back room and came back with a bright pink vacuum-sealed bag, which she cut open to reveal a girl with her arms and legs tied up.  She was about Sarah's age.  \"Normally our products are willing, but this girl tried to shoplift from us.\"  Jelly squirted the girl with a spray bottle, and then took a giant knife and whacked her feet off.  Sarah winced, but then saw that there was no blood.  Looking closer, it looked like skin had appeared to cover up the hole.  \"We sprayed her with a special compound that converts her entire body into food.  It's much less messy this way, and we don't have to worry about cooking her.\"  Jelly took the feet (which were still tied together) and dropped them on a tray, and they vanished.  Peanut Butter continued her narrative.  \"We have a deal with a foot fetish place.  We don't like feet here; they're too oddly shaped, so they pay us for them.\"  Jelly took the knife and began slicing the girl's legs into thin round discs.  Peanut Butter got out a gigantic salad bowl filled with lettuce and began adding them to it.  When Jelly reached the waist, she untied the girl's hands and neatly diced each one of her fingers.  Then she sliced her arms like she had done with her legs.  The girl was quiet the entire time.  When all that left of the girl was her torso and head, Jelly began slicing her breasts into gradually growing discs until her chest was level with the rest of her body.  \"This gives the torso slices a nice round look instead of having two bumps.\"  Jelly then began dicing the girl's torso, stopping when her neck was finished.  Peanut Butter spread the last few slices onto the salad, and Jelly plopped the girl's head on top.  \"Enjoy!  But don't forget, you owe us after your meal!\"</span></div></div>",

She pulls out a giant flower bag and covers a metal table top with it. \"Please get on the table Melissa. Sarah, follow me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah follows her to a giant bowl attached to what looks like a giant mixer. \"Your going in there, but first, drink this\", she hands her a small vial filled with a glowing green liquid. Taking it, Sarah gulps and quickly chugs it down. She then steps into the bowl and sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian goes to her fridge and takes out a bag of strawberries. She washes and cleans a few of them and takes them back over to the mixer. She picks up one of the strawberries with her left hand and holds her palm flat over the bowl. Using her free hand, she reaches into a pocked and removes a small gun shaped device. Pointing it at the lone strawberry in her other hand. She zaps it, the strawberry quickly increases in size, it is now about the size of a basketball. It slides out of her hand and falls into the bowl, Vivian proceeds to do this with the remaining strawberries she had prepared. Then taking out the biggest bag of sugar that she has ever seen, Vivian dumps about a 4th of the bag in with her and the strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those strawberries determine what flavor you will be, and the sugar will sweeten you, thought you don't really need it\", she tells her, walking over to the mixer's control panel. \"Sarah, I guess I should tell you what I'm going to do\", she starts, while pressing a few buttons. \"I am going to try something new. I am going to turn the 2 of you into a giant strawberry flavored doughnut. \"Wha?\", Sarah says surprised. \"Really! Awesome!\", Melissa says, both surprised and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Your going to be the jelly, Sarah. And then I'll place you inside Melissa, who is going to be the doughnut\". She presses one final button as the machine springs to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat looks like a giant laser comes out of the machine. It hits her with a red beam. She then starts to feel a strange sensation in her stomach, then it hits her, that liquid she drank earlier, it must be reacting to the light!. She grabs her stomach as this strange tingling bubbling sensation starts to spread from her stomach and all across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down and sees that her stomach is changing color. It is now a clear while, and it's spreading!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body is completely see through. \"Time for the next part\", Vivian says. 2 giant beaters appear from the mixer and enter the bowl. They start to spin, trapping one of Sarah's arms in one of the beaters. She is sucked in, mashed, and combined with the sugar and strawberries. Vivian lets this go on for 5 minutes, \"That should be long enough\". The beaters stop and leave the bowl. Dipping a finger into the strawberry jam, \"oh! That is really good Jam!\". She removes the bowl and takes it over to Melissa, who has been watching the entire event on the cold floured table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.... That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen!\". Vivian tells her that she can taste Sarah, and she does, agreeing with her how great she tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's your turn, lay down. This won't take long\". Melissa lays down and Vivian pours some bluish powder on her. She than waits for a few minutes, letting the powder take effect. She tests Melissa, making sure that she is ready, her hand easily sinks into her now soft flesh. Melissa would be saying something about this, but the same effect that the powder had on Sarah is now happening to Melissa. Vivian snaps, and 2 hands come out of the ceiling. The hands then stick a funnel into Melissa's pussy and proceed to pour the Sarah Jam into the funnel and inside Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's stomach immediately expands as it takes Sarah into it. As the last of Sarah enters Melissa, Vivian quickly shuts her pussy, trapping Sarah inside. She both Vivian and the hands proceed to kneed Melissa's entire body into a doughnut shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant jelly doughnut is now on the metal table. \"Time for the finishing touches\". She pours some cinnamon and sugar on top, completing her creation. She has the hands place them on a giant baking sheet and puts them into an oven to bake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finish, and Vivian takes them out. \"Amazing, I think I've outdone myself. But I've never tried anything like this. Should I eat them myself?\".</span></div></div>",

With the tree right in front of her, she waits for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then hears Heather's voice over the loudspeaker. \"That plant is a hybrid apple tree, it was created to make high quality apples from easy to require materials, in other words, from humans\". But before she could complain, the tree attacks. A large root pops out of the ground and the tip engulfs her head. Heather and Melissa can hear muffled screams coming from inside as Sarah tries to escape it's clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the sides of the root and pulls with all her strength, but it's no use, the tree continues to pull her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to get taken in by the tree, now with only her ass and below out of the expanding root, it doesn't even take 10 seconds for her entire body to be swallowed up. The root doesn't disappear back underground, it stays at the surface, with the obvious bulge of Sarah struggling inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in from outside, they watch as her struggles begin to slow down. \"What's going on?\", Melissa asks. Heather turns to her and responds, \"it's starting to absorb her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watch as her struggles lessen as the bulge in the root starts to shrink. The root finally returns back to it's normal size, having finally finished with Sarah. It then goes back underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just have to wait a few minutes for the final part\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was scary, at first, the plant had completely devoured her and she was screaming and thrashing out of both shock and horror. But, the longer she spent in there, the better it felt. She eventually stopped struggling and let the tree do whatever it was doing to her, then, darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see anything, but she could feel herself moving. She felt herself go down, then up, then she was sitting in one place for a while. This was short lived, she felt herself thrust forward at tremendous speed, and then their was light, she could see, and hear. She was still in the same room, and could see Melissa and Heather through the window, but she couldn't speak or move. \"What is going on?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey see a bulge moving on one of the branches. It emerges from the tree, travels across the branch and once it hits the tip, it stops. Something red starts to emerge from it, and a shiny red apple is now dangling from the branch of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's safe to go in now. I made sure it won't attack us\". They enter the chamber and walk up to the tree. Reaching up, Heather plucks the apple and examines it. \"Success. It worked perfectly\". She then handed the apple to Melissa. \"That apple there is your friend, you can have her. Now if you would so kindly leave. I have a ton of data to go over now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa leaves the store and finds an empty table outside. Placing the Sarah apple in front of her, \"first a cake and now an apple! Lucky you, I want to try something like that. Whatever, I eventually will\", she picks  the apple up. \"But what to do with you? You do look tasty\".</span></div></div>",

Is something going on there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer, he asks someone what was happening<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandom person: Huh? Oh, it is something amazing!

No way I could pass this up, no matter how small the odds are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting in line and waiting for almost 1/2 an hour, it is finally Brian's turn. The two girls that were running the lottery were twins that looked to be around his age. One had long silver hair, and the others hair was short; their eyes were blue with average breasts. Though they were wearing different outfits. The long haired twin was wearing a leotard, like an acrobat would wear. The other one was sort of wearing a clown suit, though it wasn't complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin 1: So your next, whats your name? I'm Seren and this is my sister Luna.<br>\r\nBrian: I'm Brian.<br>\r\nSeren: Ok Brian, as you probably already know, pick a number up there on the board. After each person takes a guess, we switch what is behind each door. So take your pick from the 100 numbers, and who knows! Maybe you'll be the lucky 1 to win the big prize! A ticket to the Circus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian thinks decides on a number, \"hmm....how about 24....\".<br>\r\nSeren: Ok, show us what is behind number 24 Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna simply nods and slowly brings her hand to Brian's pick. She grabs the little door with the number on it, and suddenly swings it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian couldn't believe his eyes. Right there, on the other side of the door was the ticket with a large WINNER printed on the board behind it. A loud celebratory music starts as balloons fall on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren: Congratulations! You have won the ticket to our Circus! Luna, please hand Brian the ticket\". Luna nods and takes the ticket down and then hands it to Brian. She smiles and says in a monotone voice, \"congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cheers and some grumbles from the audience, the crowd disperses as the twins pull Brian to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren: Finally! We have been at this all day!<br>\r\nLuna nods.<br>\r\nSeren: Again, congratulations on winning Brian!<br>\r\nBrain: T-thanks.....I can't believe I won.<br>\r\nWith a grin Seren says, \"oh, you think your happy now? Just wait until you see what the Circus is like!<br>\r\nBrian: What's it like? What do you mean?<br>\r\nSeren: Sorry, can't say anything about it outside of the Circus. You'll just have to see for yourself!<br>\r\nLuna: Yeah.<br>\r\nSeren: You have been given an extremely rare chance here! So go home and get ready, cause your life has just made a turn for the better. Your life will never be the same again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to the twins, he rushes home and quickly throws some supplies into a bag and makes his way to the Circus.

This place is so big after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, he sees a familiar sight, long flowing silver hair. It was Seren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: S-Seren?<br>\r\nSeren: Yes, thats right.<br>\r\nBrian: What are you doing here!?<br>\r\nSeren: ? I work here. I'm an acrobat of this circus group here.<br>\r\nBrian: Really? Then that explains that you were wearing that yesterday.<br>\r\nSeren: Yep! It wasn't just to find a someone to give the ticket to. Oh! That's right! Luna is here as well. She helps out with the animals and is also one of our clowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs his arm and starts to pull him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren: Come on! Her next show is about to start! Let's go!<br>\r\nBrian: O-ok....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs She pulls him towards the main tent, she quickly says, \"and again, congratulations on winning!\".<br>\r\nBrian: T-thanks.<br>\r\nAnd she continues to force him towards the next show.....</span></div></div>",

She is still wearing the same getup as the previous day. An incomplete clown suit with a red nose, a blue star under her left eye. With that blank look still on her face, she walks over to a large steel cage that had been placed there before she had made her appearance. Luna unlocks the cage and the door swings open. With her back to the now open cage, Luna takes a few steps forward as the creature steps outside of it's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a giant brown and yellow frog. It too was dressed up in clown attire. It walks over to and stops at Luna's side. Some stage hands then bring out various props for her routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: .....And what the heck is that!?<br>\r\nSeren: Oh...that's right! You just got here today. You don't know about any this.<br>\r\nBrian: Huh? What do you mean?<br>\r\nSeren: Well.....I'll tell you later. Just watch for now. The announcer is about to talk. Luna....isn't much of a talker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnouncer: FOR OUR NEXT ACT IS OUR VERY OWN LUNA, MASTER OF BEASTS! IT IS SAID THAT THERE IS NO CREATURE ON THIS PLANET THAT SHE CAN NOT TAME! TAKE THE MONSTER AT HER SIDE. IT IS A DREADED SAND FROG. A FROG SPECIES THAT LIVES IN THE VARIOUS DESERTS IN THE CIRCUS. IT IS KNOWN FOR IT'S FEROCITY AS IT ALWAYS ATTACKS AND DEVOURS WHATEVER IT COMES ACROSS! AND YET SHE HAS COMPLETELY TAMED ONE! SO SIT BACK AND BE AMAZED BY HER SKILLS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd goes crazy as Luna begins. She snaps and the frog jumps to attention. She simply points to a row of targets that had been set up and the frog immediately fires it's tongue in quick succession, hitting each target dead center. Taking several large hoops, she starts tossing them up into the air and various heights, and each time her partner easily passes through each one. For the next half hour, Luna puts on quite a show. Displaying the sand frog's strength, speed, and agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her show winds down, the frog lowers it's head and Luna jumps onto it. The frog then raises it's head back up and Luna bows to the audience. Once again the crowd goes wild. Luna then suddenly jumps straight and up, the frog then opens it's large mouth and it's tongue shoots out and wraps around Luna's waist. The frog closes it's mouth as Luna gets pulled in and swallows. It then walks back to and into it's cage as an attendant shuts and locks the door. With cheering and clapping from the crowd, Brian still can't believe what he just saw. He quickly turns to Seren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: It...it ate her!? I-is she going to be ok? How come no one is panicking.....just cheering.....and that frog. The way it was moving.....It's really alive!?<br>\r\nSeren: Yeah....well....just calm down.....I'll explain everything in a few minutes. But first let's go meet her.<br>\r\nBrian: Huh? Who?<br>\r\nSeren: Luna of course.<br>\r\nBriang: But she was just eaten.....<br>\r\nSeren: Just follow me. I'll explain everything once we're there.....</span></div></div>",

It was a single story small square building made of metal with only a few decorations. They head inside and Brian gets surprised for two entirely different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Luna wast there. Second.....she was getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stare at each other, then blush bright red at the same time. Seren then grabs Brian and throws him outside, apologizing to him as she closes the door. A minute later, she opens the door and says that it is okay for him to come back inside. The three of them sit down at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: S-sorry about that.....<br>\r\nSeren: No, don't apologize, it was my fault for not checking.<br>\r\nLuna: ....Yeah.....don't worry about it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren then breaks the silence that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren: Still....isn't it amazing that we met up with him Luna! Even though this place is so big!<br>\r\nLuna: Yes.....Did he watch my performance?<br>\r\nSeren: Yeah he did.<br>\r\nBrian: I was pretty surprised by it. That you were a beast master and then that giant frog thing eating you.<br>\r\nSeren: Oh, that's right! Brian here still doesn't know about this place, the Circus. We should show him around and tell him about it.<br>\r\nLuna nods.<br>\r\nSeren: First things first. You probably want to know why Luna is fine and how she ended up here.<br>\r\nBrian: Definitely.<br>\r\nSeren: Ok. This building that we are in is called a Revival Station. There is at least one near every main town, area, and so on. We have one here at our circus group, obviously, and there a few more scattered here and there.<br>\r\nBrian: Revival station. That sounds like something from a video game.<br>\r\nSeren: Yeah....well.....That isn't far off. You see.....as long as you are in the Circus....you cannot die.<br>\r\nBrian: What!?\", he surprisingly says.<br>\r\nSeren: Yeah. Well you saw it for yourself. Luna was eaten by her pet and then she ended up here. She did technically \"die\". She was brought back here where she woke up in a new body.<br>\r\nBrian just stares at her, a dumbfounded look on his face.<br>\r\nSeran: Yeah.....I know it's hard to accept. But that is how it is. If something happens to you while you are in the Circus. You will wake up in a new body at the nearest Revival Station. You'll eventually get used to it.<br>\r\nBrian: T-that is a little hard to accept.<br>\r\nLuna: It is true.<br>\r\nSeren: Yeah.....Heh.....I just got a great idea.<br>\r\nBrian: What?<br>\r\nSeren: Why don't we just show you? It is a lot easier to acknowledge something when you experience it for yourself.<br>\r\nLuna: That is a good idea.<br>\r\nBrian: .....What?<br>\r\nSeren; Don't worry about it!\", she says, smiling. \"Just leave it to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren and Luna both stand up. The two of them lead Brian out of the Revival Station and back outside.....</span></div></div>",

Though we do work in this circus here, we have had plenty of time to take trips around the place. I mean, we haven't even seen everything even here. New stuff gets added all the time.

It was dark in that closet, barely any light was getting in. Brian squinted his eyes as he tried to see what was on him. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. It looks like a pair of pants had wrapped itself around his leg. A shirt then grabs his right arm and both articles of clothing begin to pull him away from the door. His struggles are in vain as more and more clothing continue to restrain him as well as pull him in deeper and deeper into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clothes continue to completely engulf his body, he starts to feel as though his body is on fire as his vision is cut off and everything truly goes dark.</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, he looks around and finds that he was still in the same room and that he had been moved to one of the couches in it. Putting a hand to his head, \"wha-what happened? The last thing I remember....huh? My voice...does it sound higher?....!!!!!.....What the hell!?\" he yells, as he notices something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were now two large lumps sticking out from his chest. He grabs them, then sees that his arms are now thinner as well. Starting to panic, a strand of his hair falls into his face and it was far too long. Reaching up with his smaller arms, he finds that he now has long hair and that his face is softer and smaller as well. It then dawns on him what happened as he looks at the lower half of his body. His legs were smaller, his butt was bigger, and his groin was flat. He was now a she. A familiar voice then calls out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Ah! Hey, Luna! Brian woke up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks in the direction that the voice came from and sees Luna and Seren walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: S-Seren? Wha....something really weird has happened to me! I-I'm a girl now!? Why....how could something like this have happened!?<br>\r\nSeren just smiles at him and says, \"I know!\".<br>\r\nBrian: Wha-<br>\r\nSeren: You don't remember? Think about what happened before you passed out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to think back and his face shows a both confused and surprised look as he remembers that it was the two of them that had pushed him into the closet and the burning sensation he felt shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: I-I remember! It was the two of you! Why did you do this to me?<br>\r\nSeren: What do you mean? We told you that we were going to show you what can happen in the Circus. It just happened earlier than we thought. Both Luna and I have already been to this room, which really surprised both of us. So we decided to play a harmless little prank on you!<br>\r\nLuna nods.<br>\r\nBrian: H-Harmless!? I'm a girl now! What the hell am I suppose to do with this body!?<br>\r\nSeren: What to do, huh....well just, get up and lets go to the next room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna and Seren each grab one of her hands and pulls her to her feet. They then proceed to look her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeren: Hmmm I still cant believe it! To think that you would look so good as a girl!<br>\r\nThis surprises him, \"what are you saying!?\".<br>\r\nLuna: Yes. She is pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey direct him to a tall standing mirror and she gets a big surprise. The reflection that was looking back was that of a slightly smaller girl with long brown hair, large breasts, and a killer body. No matter how she looked at her new self, she could not help but to think that she was very pretty, as Luna had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes and both Seren and Luna smile as they pull her away and lead her to the exit to the room...</span></div></div>",
