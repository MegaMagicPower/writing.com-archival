She'd gotten the call a few hours ago that someone had selected her, and would be renting her life, but there had been no other information with the phone call. Those things, they had said, would be discussed when she arrived. Scanning the lobby, she wondered if any of the people checking in were clients, and if one of them was a client she'd be renting her life to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person she spotted was an older gentleman, somewhere around her father's age, or maybe a little younger. He wore a business suit in a way that proclaimed his importance to the world. Everything about him said 'money,' from the well tailored fit of his suit to the expensive Rolex watch on his wrist. His once dark hair showed the signs of fading to a steely gray, but he wore it in a way that said 'distinguished' far more than it said 'old.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the older man, a younger career woman in her late twenties or early thirties stood, working her way through the mountain of paperwork with methodical precision. She had clearly come straight from work, and her simple skirt hugged her thick thighs and full rear end in a way that managed to be sexy while still being professional. Her blouse showed a hint of impressive cleavage, but not nearly enough to invite comments about dress code. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other people bustled around the reception counter at the far end, at least one of whom appeared to be a mother, trying desperately to reign in her three children while processing paperwork. Also at the far end, a woman who's every inch shouted: Stripper. From the platform heel shoes, to the micro mini skirt and the overly large fake breasts, very little about the woman was not on display. Lisa wondered if she was here as a client, or to rent out her own life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther musing was interrupted however when a side door opened and a young woman dressed in scrubs called: \"Lisa, we're ready for you to come back.\"</span></div></div>",

I understand this is your first time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lisa said, a little nervous as she followed the woman back into the complex. She hadn't known what to expect, but once she got over the jitters, she couldn't help but feel that it was a little disappointing. The hallways felt more like the back area of a clinic than a strange or mystic realm that would transform her life. \"The brochure said that the process was painless, but that it could be disorienting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both are absolutely true,\" Tina said, stopping at a door. \"It's really difficult to explain until you've gone through it once, but I have done it myself and I assure you it's really quite painless. I'm going to let you into the room here, and once you get in, if you would change out of your clothes and into the gown provided, we'll get things under way. Just take a seat on the stool, we'll worry about the fancy chair once you've changed. I'll be taking your clothes and your purse once you're out of them, and handing those to the person who's taking your life. Once we're finished, I'll bring their items to you so that you can get dressed. After that, we'll go over the specifics of the person who's life you'll be living while they rent yours, and give you a little time to settle into it before you leave. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I don't get to find out about the person who's renting my life until after it's done?\" Lisa asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll be perfectly honest, we've found that it creates problems. We had too many people back out when they found that the life they would be living wasn't appealing to them. In general, our clients lead nice lives, and can afford our services, but they all have reasons to want to be someone else for a little while. We've found that by setting your requirements for rental rate, and availability, in advance, we're able to find a client who can meet those requirements and execute the agreement. After all, they are the client, if you wanted to vacation in someone else's life of your choosing, then <i>you</i> would be the client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Lisa said, stepping into the room. Despite what Tina had said, she found it hard to not look at the futuristic couch in the center of the room, or at the circle of strange and arcane symbols that were carved into the tile floor around the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after getting dressed in the simple white hospital gown, Tina took her clothing away and helped her into the softly padded couch. A clear shield was lowered in place over her eyes and lights began to dance across her face as Tina began to work her magic. A strange pulling sensation enveloped Lisa from the bottom of her toes to the top of her head, and the flashing lights before her eyes began to blur together as magic pulled her identity from her. Moments later, she drifted into a deep sleep while a new identity was laid over her body, and skills were downloaded from the client and mapped into her own brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa woke, it was with a different identity, but who's?</span></div></div>",

Not painful at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Lisa said, sitting up in the chair. \"But then, it helps that I had such a charming woman to help me through it all,\" the words slipped out of her mouth before she knew what she was saying. \"Where did that come from? Is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the skills from the person renting your life,\" Tina said as she began to lay out a suit that looked very familiar. \"And Mr. Landry is very specific when he does this, he wants to make sure that who ever is filling in for him is a constant charmer. Large parts of his life would fall apart if you weren't skilled at attracting, and handling beautiful women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens now?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Mr Landry,\" Tina said, helping Lisa up and out of the chair. \"We get you up, dressed, and ready for your trip. You've already said your good byes to your family, and your personal secretary will be meeting you at the airport. Don't worry, we've arranged a car for you, and you'll have plenty of time on the drive there to review the file that we prepared. The file contains information about your family, co-workers, projects, mistresses, and several other miscellaneous details like the pin for your bank card.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistresses? I see why you said I needed his skill with ladies,\" Lisa said as she stood up and began getting dressed. It should have felt odd, somehow, putting on boxers, but they fit comfortably as though she had purchased them herself. The same was true of her sensible shoes, and the crisp button down shirt, though putting the shirt on without a bra was certainly odd. \"And people will really think that I'm him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Mr. Landry,\" Tina said, already working to get Lisa used to being addressed by her current identity's name. \"That's where the magic comes in. As far as the world is concerned, you're Matt Landry, and he's Lisa Hale. Now, let me show you to the car that's waiting to take you to the airport.\"</span></div></div>",

This was much more expensive and formal clothing than she was used to wearing, on top of it being made for a man. Yet the suit fit her perfectly, and as she checked her expensive wristwatch, she began to feel the confidence that a master of the universe like Matt Landry probably felt every minute of every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studied Tina, whose attention was focused on paperwork as they waited for the car to be ready. Medical scrubs weren\u2019t the most flattering outfit, but Lisa could see that Tina had a fit, curvy body underneath. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at her chest, the way her honey blonde hair swisher against the nape of her neck, the little birthmark just below her earlobe. She began to feel flush. Some friends of hers were gay, or bi, but Lisa had never been interested in women before. Now, though, this pretty one in front of her was all that she could imagine wanting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina noticed Lisa\u2019s eyes on her and looked up from her papers. She smiled nervously and asked, lIs everything okay, Mr. Landry?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTina, do you see me as Matt Landry, too?\u201d Lisa asked, her heart starting to pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina blushed. \u201cOf course I do, Mr. Landry. That\u2019s how the system works. For everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped and decided to go for it. She reached a hand out and brushed a strand of hair off of Tina\u2019s face. \u201cAnd what does this feel like?\u201d she asked, her voice dripping with confidence and charm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina shuddered a bit and said, very quietly, \u201cLike a very handsome and powerful man is touching my face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thrilled to the sound of that. She moved in closer and put her other hand on the small of Tina\u2019s back. \u201cAnd do you like the way it feels?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d Tina said, all traces of her cool professionalism gone. This woman clearly wanted Lisa, and Lisa wanted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that,\u201d said Lisa, and she leaned in to kiss Tina firmly on the mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan the car wait a while?\u201d she asked with a wicked grin, before wondering how sex would work in this odd life-swapped situation. </span></div></div>",

She let out a soft, surprised moan that very much pleased Lisa to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad to hear that,\" Lisa whispered, her kisses gradually moving higher up Tina's neck. As she worked her way towards the mouth, she felt a strange and extremely pleasurable sensation coming from her crotch. She looked down and was startled to see a tent being pitched in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately pulled back from Tina and began scrambling to undo her belt and lower her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Mr. Landry?\" Tina asked, both concerned and frustrated that the foreplay had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... is that?\" she asked, as she lowered her suit pants and boxer briefs to the ground and saw a very large \u2014 and unmistakably erect \u2014 penis pointing out where her vagina was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked down and giggled. \"Oh, that?\" she asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that!\" Lisa said, starting to panic a little. \"I thought I was only switching lives with this guy! Why do I have his... his...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penis?\" Tina said. \"It's okay, you can say it. It's yours for the moment.\" And with that, Tina reached out and put her soft, cool fingers on the head and shaft, working them up and down in a way that made Lisa's entire body feel like it was exploding with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigod, what is happening right now?\" she murmured, barely able to control her vocal chords, let alone the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina continued to stroke Lisa's ever-expanding cock, and began getting down on her knees to take things to the next stage. \"When we do same-sex swaps, we leave the bodies entirely alone, because that's not what the client is paying for. But we realized early on that for cross-gender swaps, some alterations were required to make things work. The new Lisa Hale wouldn't truly get to enjoy her transformation if she couldn't enjoy sex the way any other 18-year-old girl could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made some sense to Lisa, but her logic centers had been put on hold, and all she could focus on were the sensations coming from what Tina was doing to her new male anatomy. She looked down and saw Tina smile up at her, before the hand job became a blow job, and Lisa lost control of her body and mind altogether.</span></div></div>",

As she and Tina awkwardly redressed, she felt Matt's phone buzz in her pocket, with a text from someone named Tracy Milgrim. It said, simply, \"Miss Hale, please stop fucking around and get in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed and showed the text to Tina, who explained that Tracy was Matt Landry's executive assistant and \u2014 as far as Tina knew \u2014 the only person in Landry's life who would be aware of the switch. \"To help make sure you don't wreck his company, or life, while he's otherwise occupied living yours,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Lisa said, though now she became nervous at the thought of Matt Landry wrecking her own life \u2014 especially since she didn't have anyone back home who knew that she'd swapped places for the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina led her out of the building, where a sleek black SUV was waiting, a driver in a black suit holding the door for her. \"Welcome, Mr. Landry,\" he told her. \"We should still make it to the airport with time to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lisa's first time being driven by a chauffeur, or riding in such a palatial car. She spread out the way she always saw guys doing it when they sat, then opened the file Tracy had left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head began to spin as she skimmed the materials. Tina hadn't been kidding about how much detail would be in here. There was a long file about Landry's tech company, another about his wife Kelly, another about a mistress named Jacqueline, more about coworkers, friends, etc. It was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a minibar in this thing?\" she asked the driver. He smiled in the rearview mirror, and a second later, a panel opened up in front of her as if by magic, revealing row after row of travel-sized alcohol bottles. \"I'm not legally old enough to drink,\" she told herself, \"but who's going to know that?\" She unscrewed a bottle of vodka and took a long pull, almost gagging on the taste but quickly enjoying the floating sensation she got from the alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she had drunk three bottles and not made any further headway with the files, and the car was pulling onto a private airstrip, where Lisa saw two things: a shiny private jet, and a very unhappy \u2014 and very pretty \u2014 redhead who she could only assume was Tracy Milgrim. </span></div></div>",

Everything you asked for in your request: good looking, successful, all american girl. Fairly traditional family, college bound, just graduated from high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" he said, flipping through the file and looking over the details of her life. \"Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink,\" he muttered, taking in more details. \"Just broke up with her boyfriend and doesn't particularly want to get back together with him, poor bastard,\" Matt continued. \"And the other bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Emma said, pulling out a large envelope filled with cash. \"Matt, I can't keep doing this,\" she said as she handed the bundle over to him. \"It breaks all of the rules we've set at the Nexus. The clients who rent out their lives are trusting us to make sure that the life they come back to is fairly similar to the one they left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too fucking bad,\" Matt said, taking the envelope and counting through the bills to make sure it was all there. \"They sign a waiver and I've read the damn thing, I'm not breaking any rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Matt,\" she said, hoping she could talk him out of his plans. \"Most of our clients want to vacation in someone else's life to experience something different from their own. To get an escape. They don't rent someone else's life to see how badly they can mess it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my problem Em,\" he said, slipping out of the chair and waiting for the disorientation to pass as he realized how much this Lisa girl must be. He was used to things looking bigger when he took over the life of a woman, but he didn't think he'd ever taken on the life of someone quite as small as Lisa Hale was. \"She's renting out her life and I'm paying handsomely to do what I want with it. If what I want happens to be doing things completely different than what she normally does, so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just phone Ms. Hale... let her know what your plans are so she can show your life the same respect you're intending to show hers?\" Emma was bluffing, but she didn't know what else to do. The last girl that Matt had rented was still going through rehab for the heroin addiction that Matt had acquired while partying away in her life, and the one before that was had given up on ever losing the weight she'd gained when Matt decided to spend two months on a couch catching up on three years of television he'd been too busy to watch in his own life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. Tell her,\" Matt said, calling her bluff. \"Maybe I should drop by the Board... I'm sure a few of the new members would be happy to find a reason to dismiss you and I'm sure there are dozens of people they could think of to take over the life of Deputy Director Emma Nail for the next twenty to thirty years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, fine,\" Emma said, slumping in defeat. \"You win Matt. Just... just consider giving it a try okay? Lisa's a good girl and her life could be a nice break from the kind of stress you usually deal with. Take the money in that envelope and spend it to have a really relaxing vacation or something. Whatever. It's your vacation. I'll leave you to get dressed unless you need anything more from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that will be all Em,\" he said in clear dismissal as he picked up Lisa's clothes. For a moment, he considered the small, plain white bra in his hands before he shoved it in her purse along with her panties. She might not have the kind of jugs that made men stare no matter what she wore, but there were other ways to make sure people noticed her body and if that meant going braless, he was fine with that.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing Lisa\u2019s phone he texted his loyal assistant, Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: Is everything set?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve: Yes, I\u2019m with Ms. Hale right now and taking her to the first meeting. I\u2019ve arranged for a packed schedule so she be very, very busy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt: Nice!

She had zero scruples and was always efficient in getting whatever Matt needed done. She had helped him make the arrangements for every one of his rentals while making sure no one ever suspected it wasn\u2019t really Matt Landry managing his company. \u201cThis is going to be so much fun!\u201d he mused to himself. His plan was to turn \u201cAll-American girl\u201d Lisa Hale into a slutty party girl. Looking around as he walked through the Nexus he saw a few glances follow the gentle sway of his unsupported breasts. He felt a pleasant warmth from Ms. Hale\u2019s pussy, which was comfortably nestled between his legs. For a moment he wondered how Lisa took to waking up with his formidable member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as he was about to leave the Nexus Matt spotted the stripper Lisa had noticed earlier and felt a pang of jealousy at all the lust-filled stares the woman was getting. Bra or no bra, he couldn\u2019t compete with someone like that.

The doctor was an older man, with a thick, greying beard and a portly figure. Matt had picked him because of two main reasons. Dr. Conway was at the cutting edge of plastic surgery technology and his procedures took hours of recovery instead of weeks. Also, he was more than willing to forget his morals for the right price. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if I was willing to carry out such procedures on someone so young, I don\u2019t believe babysitting or whatever it is you do pay well enough for such expensive surgeries,\u201d the doctor continued, turning up his nose at what he perceived to be an average young woman. Before Matt could get a word in edgewise Dr. Conway continued, \u201cYoung lady, I took this last minute appointment as a favor to an esteemed client,\u201d referring to Matt\u2019s own assistant, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure my shoes alone are worth more than everything you are currently wearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you quite finished looking down your nose at me, Doc?\u201d Evan replied, trying to keep his temper in check. He wasn\u2019t used to people being so dismissive of him, even when he\u2019d rented other women before. Perhaps including some procedures to age Lisa\u2019s appearance wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. It might even add to the thrill of messing with her life. \u201cIf you would be quiet for a moment and listen might be able to \u2026 lessen your concerns for my age and my resources,\u201d Matt tried his best to infuse Lisa\u2019s voice with his usual confidence, but Lisa\u2019s girl-next-door charm didn\u2019t really go very far for such scenarios. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor\u2019s eyebrow went up incredulously, \u201cYoung lady \u2026 \u201c he started, but Matt cut him off, \u201cJust check your bank account, please,\u201d Matt said in exasperation. Dr. Conway rolled his eyes, but he humored the apparent young woman sitting across from him. He logged into his bank account and his eyes went wide. \u201cI believe that should just about cover your services?\u201d Matt asked, not bothering to hide a smirk. Eve, was an exceptional assistant and had transferred a significant sum into the doctor\u2019s account. \u201cWell, I \u2026  you see \u2026 I only spoke of your age out of concern, I care about my client\u2019s making informed decisions, of course!\u201d he stammered, pulling at the collar of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Matt said drily. \u201cUh, could you tell me exactly what you\u2019re looking for, Ms. Hale? By the way, I can have my assistant bring in some water or tea if you\u2019d like?\u201d he offered. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Matt was enjoying being in control of the situation once more, especially while being in the body of someone who would never have gotten that sort of reaction before. \u201cI want you to give me nice, big tits,\u201d he was gesturing out in front of his chest,\u201d but I want them to have a bit of sag  and jiggle too. I want them to just spill over in whatever I wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d he was taking down notes , \u201cYou spoke of your rear too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I want to put those models on social media to shame. I want a juicy ass and thic hips,\u201d he specified, almost salivating at the woman he was going to turn Lisa into. \u201cAnything on your face?\u201d the doctor asked. \u201cOf course! I was thinking you could make me look a bit older. Give me big lips and have that look like maybe I\u2019ve overdone it a bit, you know?\u201d He nodded. \u201cI see, well, I understand you\u2019d like this done quickly, rest assured that with my procedure you\u2019ll be out of here by this time tomorrow and you\u2019ll love the new you, Ms. Hale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will,\u201d he smiled an evil smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning it on revealed a password lock that he was currently unable to open due to not yet reading the the papers containing personal information that the Nexus and Lisa had left him in regards to his new temporary life, thankfully his new phone had an optional fingerprint lock to which his new fingers now matched. Once unlocked, Matt opened up the camera and  facing an adjacent mirror began to pose and take selfies of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow quaint,\u201d he muttered as he pulled down one of the straps of the spaghetti top he now wore  exposing his new left breast, flicking the nipple sent a sensation of pleasure that left him bitting his lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh sensitive thing aren't I,\u201d he moaned as he felt his new female genitalia begin to get moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d he began, looking down at his flat male chest and then at the mirror displaying the image of the perky teenage wonders that he now owned. With little hesitation he cupped the underside of his male chest watching as the girl in the mirror did the same, then pushing up he tried to lift his chest towards his mouth. Taking the nipple in his mouth he began to tug and suck on the nub sending further feelings of bliss across his body. With one last lick he dropped his boob glistening with saliva with drool connecting nipple to lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets find out what other things this body can do,\u201d Matt giggled as he began stretching out his legs. Feeling no resistance he continued until he was in a full split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his now baby blue painted toenails he giggled \u201cCheerleader, nice.\u201d Having a quick glance in the mirror at the girl he now was he gave a devious smirk before sliding a hand between the waist band of his stretched shorts and then plunging his hand into his new snatch, revelling in how tight he now was. \u201cOh YES!!\u201d He cried, bring his hand out and then watching as the girl in the mirror ran the glistening fingers across her plump lower lip before putting it into her mouth tasting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst still in the splits, Matt reached for his phone and began dialling a number to an unknown caller. The phone rang for no more than a second before it was picked up and a willowy  female voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Landry, I take it all went according to plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Hale now Laura, how are things on your end?\u201d Questioned Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll is set Miss Hale. Your \u2018mom\u2019, Elizabeth, has arrived at the Nexus and is being prepped for the swap as we speak. Pretty soon I will no longer be the personal secretary of Mr Matt Landry but the doting mother of Lisa Hale.\u201d Laura replied, playing along with her soon to be daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s like so totally sweet, I\u2019ll be outside waiting for you MOM! Speak to you soon.\u201d Matt giggled doing his best to put on a valley girl accent and ending the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled looking at Lisa in the mirror. His plan was simple, after finding out about the Hales financial situation it didn't take much to persuade Elizabeth Hale, Lisa\u2019s mother to rent out her life to his secretary Laura Stiles. With Laura in the life of the matriarch of the Hale household, the two planned to get up to some rather naughty stuff as the two women without bringing to much attention to themselves. What really made it exciting was that they would have to convince the other Hales that were indeed who they appeared to be whilst still being able to mess with them if they fancied doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry baby, mommy will soon be here,\u201d he smiled to the girl in the mirror, this break was going to be a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Laura had shown up at the house while Elizabeth was alone. She\u2019d never seen the woman before, but when she mentioned that she knew about Elizabeth\u2019s online gambling debt she\u2019d almost yanked the woman inside. No one was supposed to know that she\u2019d lost the family\u2019s savings through online gambling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her and her husband\u2019s salary they were barely able to make ends meet and they had been dipping into Lisa\u2019s college fund to pay the bills. Lisa still thought her college life was a sure thing, but nothing could be further from the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only supposed to be temporary and they\u2019d put the money back when she got that promotion at work, but she got passed over by some kid fresh out of college. When she was young she\u2019d made a lot of money playing cards and she thought maybe she could do that again. A friend had told Elizabeth about some online gambling sites where they\u2019d made a lot of money. At first it went really well. She was on fire and it looked like such an easy way to fix her family\u2019s money woes. She knew if she made a big enough bet she could cover all their debts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe transferred most of the savings they had left and clicked to place her bet. In a heartbreaking moment she went from a winning stream to losing it all. Elizabeth was desperate. Laura had offered to pay off her debt and a bit more. It seemed too good to be true, but as a show of good faith Laura had already transferred half the sum into Elizabeth\u2019s account. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth didn\u2019t really understand why Laura would want to swap with her, but if it meant her family wouldn\u2019t be homeless, she wasn\u2019t going to ask too many questions. After signing some paperwork and getting some instructions from a technician at the Nexus, Elizabeth closed her eyes before the procedure took place. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird, like you said. It definitely wasn't painful. Um, when will the blurry fade? I remember things getting blurry when the lights were going, right before I nodded off, but, it's not going away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Tina said, handing over a pair of squared glasses with thin metal frames. \"Your eyes have not been damaged or changed at all, but, part of bending reality for you to assume Angela Stein's life is that she wears glasses. So, if you are not wearing glasses, or contacts, then the world is blurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Lisa said, putting on the glasses and marveling as the world snapped back into focus. \"I expect that will take a little getting used to. Are there other things I should expect to be odd like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you get dressed and we can go over those things,\" Tina said, handing over the clothes that Angela had worn to The Nexus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slipped into the other woman's panties with only a moment of hesitation, feeling slightly odd about wearing another woman's underwear, but deciding not to dwell on it over much. She did, however, stop when she picked up the bra, finding it to be substantially different in design from the light bras she was used to wearing. \"36DDD?\" Lisa read off the label. \"Um, this won't fit me, I'm no where near that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just slip it on dear, you'll find it fits just as well as the panties did. And believe me, even though you aren't that big, if you try going bra-less, not only will you feel the effects, but you'll feel them as though you were that big. And trust me, there's a reason that women as busty as Angela, or should I say, as busty as you, don't go without support!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumbling for a moment with the extra hooks in the bra, she quickly found the support more welcome than she had expected. Tina hadn't been kidding that things would affect her strangely while living Angela's life. More fumbling followed as she slid into the other woman's thigh high stockings and garter belt, before pulling on her size 8 skirt and struggling into the blouse that hugged her chest like no other shirt ever had. \"So, I guess getting dressed isn't one of the things that comes with the 'skills' I get from her, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry Angela,\" Tina said, already starting to call Lisa by the name that went with her current identity. \"But, Monday morning when you get to work, you'll find all the knowledge that goes with an undergraduate degree in accounting and masters in business administration is tucked away within your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, that sounds important,\" Lisa said, digging through her new purse to find an impressive collection of credit cards, business cards, and other nick knacks within. \"I had thought she was a secretary, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heaven's no, I doubt many secretaries would be able to afford to rent your life for an entire month,\" Tina said, collecting a folder of information about Angela's life for Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whole month?\" Lisa asked, a little surprised. \"I only put down for ten weeks that I'm available, and she paid for almost half of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did. She said that she'd skipped summer vacation after her senior year to get ready for school in the fall, and she missed her senior class trip. She was very insistent in booking this that she be able to go on your senior class trip, since she missed hers ten years ago.

Her heals clicked rhythmically on the tile floor as she walked through the lobby, drawing eyes that simply responded to the sound. Once most people in the lobby saw her, they looked away, back to whatever magazines they were reading or their smart phones. Male eyes, however, she noticed lingered longer, particularly on her bust and hips. It was a strange feeling, but one she found herself almost enjoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the bright evening sun of the parking lot, she began to fumble in her purse for a pair of sunglasses before realizing that the lenses of the prescription glasses she wore were adjusting to the light. Walking out into the parking lot, she clicked the button on her car keys and followed the 'chirp' until she found herself at a recent model Lexus, neatly maintained and freshly washed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said, sliding into the soft leather interior. \"They weren't kidding about the kind of people who could afford this kind of vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to sit in the car's air conditioned interior, Lisa flipped through the folder of information, looking for the most important bits.... address, immediate schedule, relationships. There, perhaps, the file was a little sad. Significant Other: None. Best Friend: Hanna Dawson, Other Friends: None. Was Angela really this lonely? There were pictures of co-workers, lists of things that were coming up at work in the next month, but Lisa skipped over that, looking only for things that would be relevant for the weekend. She could study up for Monday later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbies: Wine collecting, reading, yoga, and photography. Well, none of those sounded too boring, and the wine part would be fun, especially since Lisa wouldn't be old enough to buy her own alcohol for another three years!

No one had mentioned doing so, and she assumed that the packet she got from Angela would include much the same information she had left in the packet that was to be given to Angela. What was odd, more than just the presence of the note, was that it was addressed to her as 'Lisa'. Figuring that anything important enough to leave her a personal note should be read sooner than later, Lisa unfolded it and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you read this, you will be closer to me than any member of my own family. I realize that this is a business transaction, but I want you to know why I chose your life. I feel that of everyone available, you will be the best choice to live my life while I enjoy yours. You seem like a responsible young woman, and I feel that I will be able to trust you with my job and home while I live your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than that though, I want you to know how precious of a gift I'm receiving. I've been the 'sensible one' for a long time, and by becoming you, I feel I'll have an opportunity to cut loose a bit and have a glimpse of what could have been. For me to have that, you have to give up that priceless opportunity. I think the money that I've paid for the opportunity is hardly enough, after all, the time that we have and the memories that we build are worth more than mere dollars and cents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I have two things I want to give you while you're living my life. The first is very simple: I want you to know that I have budgeted an extra $10,000 in 'fun' that is reserved for your use. I would have used the money to rent more time in your life, but I feel like you should be able to enjoy some of the finer things in life while I rob you of your summer vacation. Visit a spa, go shopping, take a weekend trip, or do something that just interests you. I understand that with my job to work around, it's not a full time vacation, but I hope you make good use of the money and the time left to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing I want to give you is a request, but one I hope you will enjoy. I'm not very outgoing... and as you can see from the file, I have few friends. I haven't had a boyfriend since my sophomore year in college. I'd like to ask you to date while you're living my life. You don't have to, I understand if you don't. And you don't have to worry about 'finding me a man,' that I can continue to date once things are done, but if you do, I would count it a huge blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPer the terms of the rental agreement, we won't be allowed to communicate during the rental, but I do have the wild fantasy that we may see each other again after the month is up, and I hope that we can be friends then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding up the letter, Lisa spent a few minutes lost in thought before she was able to get herself moving. She'd tried to think of this as just a different way of having a summer job, but hadn't given much thought to how it would impact her own life.... or how much impact she could have on Amanda's. The letter; however, made her feel very much like she had made the right decision. Perhaps the summer could give them both something they needed. And pleasant surprises to come home to for both of them!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive back to Angela's apartment was both quick, and amazingly comfortable. The summer heat had rolled in last week and showed no signs of fading. While Lisa's own car was sufficient to the task of getting her to and from school and sporting events, it was woefully inadequate in the luxury realms of comfortable seats and air conditioning. Driving in heals was less awkward than she feared, but the combination of the shoes and the smooth acceleration left her far closer to getting a ticket than she wanted, and she was sure that it was the last thing Angela would want to come home to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment itself struck Lisa as small, especially compared to her parent's sprawling two story suburban home, but every inch of it was well furnished in tasteful luxury. Her heels clicked on the polished hardwood as she explored the apartment, taking in the small, well appointed kitchen with a floor to ceiling wine closet. When Angela had listed wine collecting as among her hobbies, she hadn't been kidding. Outside of the kitchen was a small formal eating area, with a table that would comfortably seat 2-3, though she had chairs for 4, and beyond that, a spacious living room with full height windows showing a commanding view of the sun setting over the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said, walking out onto the high rise apartment's balcony and reveling in the cool breeze coming off the water. \"I could get used to this pretty quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering back in side, she found a small office, with computer desk and laptop, and several book shelves, lined with everything from murder mystery to cheap romance. In one corner of the office, a comfortable reading chair sat next to a small table that already held a wine glass and half finished bottle. A copy of a new hard cover mystery lay on the table next to the wine,  a bookmark proclaiming that Angela had been half way through the book when she started this vacation. \"That has to suck,\" Lisa said, picking up the book. \"She won't find out who did it till she gets back from vacation. Unless she blows my allowance on a copy of her own I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the office and the bedroom, she found another luxury feature of the apartment: the bathroom. And calling it a bathroom seemed a bit like a joke, personal spa felt more like it. The room had a glass shower with 3 separate shower heads, and that was in addition to the massive jetted tub that filled a corner of the room. The opulent features of the room could only distract her for moments though, because for the first time since The Nexus worked their magic, she got a good look at herself in the mirror, and the sight took her breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had talked about mirrors when explaining the process, and she hadn't given them much thought until seeing herself reflected. Her eyes flicked down to look at her body, if only to confirm that it was still as she expected it to be, unchanged by the process, before returning to the vision in the mirror. The woman in the mirror looked like Lisa, there was no mistaking that. She hadn't taken on Angela's face or complete outward appearance. But she had taken on many of Angela's attributes in the reflection. She looked older, closer to entering her thirties than entering her twenties. More than that, her figure was remarkably different, displaying the valley of cleavage that the 36DDD bra she wore was designed to not only support, but uplift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbuttoning her blouse, Lisa ran her fingers over her torso, taking in the soft, yielding flesh and the pale complexion, along with the immaculate manicure on her nails. By no means was she anything that she would call 'fat,' but she certainly had more flesh rounding out her figure and curves. She shimmied out of the skirt next, standing to examine her reflection in nothing but her stockings and underwear, and she had to admit that what she saw impressed her. She was no model, but she was undeniably pretty, if in a plain but curvy kind of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so that's how everyone sees me right now. This is unreal.... and so, so cool!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is a good life.\" Lisa said to herself. She was lying with her head against the wall inside the jetted tub. The bubbles were going at a steady rate, on a tile next to her was a fine glass of wine and next to it the murder mystery novel Angela was reading. Lisa's first thoughts were to read something more her style, but then she thought that this was Angela's life so she should get used to Angela's things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing examining her \"altered\" body, Lisa decided to change into something more comfortable. Luckily she found a pair of sweatpants with a hoodie which wasn't used that often. She felt a bit like her old self dressed like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the old clothes in the laundry bin, her tummy rumbled a bit. Lisa was a bit curious about what to cook for herself. Luckily she had helped her mom enough times with dinner to know how to cook. When looking in the refrigerator Lisa noticed the health snacks she kept . \"Wonder why she would want to do that? She's got a good enough figure.\" She mumbled as she found the ingredient for pasta to make. She quickly finished up making the meal and then began to eat. She noticed that while eating she was eating perfectly with fork and knife. <br>\r\nBut while eating she looked around herself. The only things around her were the four empty chairs. She suddenly missed home, back home when during dinner the whole family was talking with each other. Suddenly having this quiet mood around, was something she was not used to. No wonder Angela wanted to take her life. \"Well I'm going to change that.\" She promised herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the dishes inside the dishwasher Lisa checked out the laptop. She found a sticky note giving the password and that she should tear this note up after reading it. On the laptop wasn't anything special, most was about work-related stuff. Things she should go through tomorrow. Turning the laptop off, she suddenly yawned. This happened to be a long day, a good night sleep was just what she needed. After spending some time in the tub of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here she was sitting now comfortable in her own tub. This would be one of the perks of this life. Lisa grabbed the glass with wine and made out a toast: \"To Angela, and that she may enjoy my life to the fullest extent.\" She took a sip of the wine and continued with the novel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Lisa woke up the next day she was wondering for a few seconds where she was. The bedroom was much larger than normal and her bed much more softer and why was everything blurry? When Lisa looked down she saw she wasn't wearing her usual underwear. It took just a few seconds before she remembered yesterday's events. The swapping of lives with Angela, the hot tub she relaxed in and drinking too much wine. Lisa could make out the shape of a pair of glasses on the nightstand and when she put them on her vision cleared up immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better.\" She said to herself. She looked at the alarm clock, it was only eight. Normally she would sleep until 10 but this wasn't exactly her life. So she decided to get out of bed. She first took a quick shower, when she dried herself off she had to take another look in the mirror. It was weird seeing herself in the mirror but also not. When she put her hands underneath her breasts they looked the same but felt much bigger. A little brush of her nipples showed her she wasn't that turned on anymore. Tom loved to play with them. Lisa wondered how Angela would deal with him. Well she shouldn't worry about her, she was a grownup after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was disappointed when she looked in Angela's wardrobe, she was going through it a bit fast yesterday but Angela didn't really have much clothes except for skirts and blouses. Perhaps she should make it a shopping day today. Wanting to get used to getting dressed she decided to wear a white blouse with a gray skirt complete with stockings. Looking in the mirror Lisa had to admit it did look good on her, perhaps that's was one of the reasons Angela wore the combination often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to make breakfast, noticing a kiwi lying in the fridge. She managed to cut it in half and spooned it out. It didn't taste that bad as she thought. At last Lisa was ready for her day, but the problem was what she should do today? She could go to the mall, spend some of the money Angela had given her. Or she could study the documents Angela had given her for her work Monday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa decided to go out and have some fun. Tomorrow it was Sunday and then she could go study the whole day. Lisa packed Angela's purse and locked the apartment door behind her as she could think of the fun she would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into the Lexus and went off for the mall. At one point she had to hit the brakes as she was driving too fast. She noticed then the car had cruise control so she decided to use it. Lisa was so hoping Angela got a ticket, after all it they had snapped a picture they would see Angela sitting there and not her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found a parking space she could drive right into. The Lexus was a bit bigger than her old car, and she didn't want to pull up at only her second drive in the car. When Lisa stepped outside she could feel a fresh breeze, she had to hold down her skirt a bit so it wouldn't flapper. Near the entry of the mall she saw a couple of youngsters checking her out. She felt a little naughty and blew them a kiss. A few of them turned red while another one turned straight around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mall she looked up, where she could see a cloud free sky and the sun shining bright. Lisa had a good feeling about today. The first thing she wanted do was to buy some trendy clothes. Angela's clothes were nice but not really appropriate for her age. She had a good figure and guys would certainly date her when she looked prettier. Lisa wasn't entirely sure if she was the one to do the dating but that was for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wondered where she should go first. There was a lingerie store. Angela could certainly use some nice underwear, the ones in her wardrobe were all rather plain. Even Lisa had some sexy underwear when she went out with Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was also a normal clothing store which had basically everything.</span></div></div>",

When she stepped inside she noticed it was quiet inside. No customer in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" A voice suddenly asked. Lisa jumped up at suddenly hearing that voice. \"No I'm fine, I'm just browsing.\" She answered. She turned around and saw a girl who would be round her twenties, having short cut hair, wearing a tight pink shirt amplifying her bosom and some torn jeans. Lisa got this weird feeling she knew her. And then it hit her, it was Katie. She knew Katie when she still was a junior at high school. Katie was a popular girl when she was around. She got in all kinds of trouble, always hanging around with the bad crowd. When she graduated nobody heard anything from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know me or something?\" Katie asked as she walked over to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, you only remind me of someone I knew.\" Lisa made up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to look around.\" Katie said before she returned to reading a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Lisa responded as she browsed the store. It was weird looking around for underwear that was meant for her, but for a bigger size. She found some new bra's that matched her new breasts size. Plus she picked out a couple of thongs, she wondered if they would feel better than before. But the weirdest thing was when she had to bend to grab the thongs. In the reflection she could see Katie checking her out, not that high-profile but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had found what she was looking for, she asked Katie if she could use the changing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out.\" She just said while her eyes remained at breast level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stepped inside the changing room and moved the curtain. She proceeded to undress herself. When she was standing there looking at herself in the mirror she felt quite happy for some reason. The more she looked at her figure, the more she liked it. She then proceeded to get dressed in the first matching outfit: A black bra with a pink bow in the middle with a thong. A look in the mirror told her she looked pretty hot. If she didn't pick this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa suddenly noticed....</span></div></div>",

A familiar voice answers: No I'm fine, just browsing.\" What was up with that voice. Lisa was thinking. She could swear she recognized that voice. When Lisa moved the curtain away a little bit, she was surprised to see her mom in the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa quickly pulled the curtain back as she leaned against the wall of the changing room. What was her mother doing here? She would never go to a store like this. When her mom found the sexy underwear she had bought for Tom her mother had a one on one conversation in which she told Lisa a thousand times that a boy should be happy with her the way she was. Underwear wouldn't solve that. But now Lisa had spotted her own mom in a lingerie store. When she took another peak, she saw how her mother held a red bra in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't know why, but she was curious as to what her mother was up to. She took the lingerie off and decided to purchase it when she would leave. She then put on Angela's clothes again and stepped out of the changing room. She decided to pretend to look for some other pieces. She observed how her mom would look at almost anything the store had to offer, but then stand rather confused. Lisa was looking at some nice black stockings when she felt someone patting against her back. When she turned around her mom stood there right in front of her. \"Excuse me, I know this might be weird but could you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to swallow when she replied sure. \"My husband will be back soon from his trip and I was thinking about surprising him. \"What do you think suits me better?\" She held out two items in her hand. This red bra, thong and stockings or this teddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These or this?\" Her mother asked again. \"I'm rather confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo am I. Lisa thought. She looked at both sets, but she was still in shock seeing her mother like this. Her mother wouldn't wear these sorts of things.  Her mother must've been really excited to see her father again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked again, but couldn't make her choice either. The red bra, thong and stockings were a nice combination but Lisa wasn't sure her mother should be wearing this. She was almost forty years old. The teddy would be nice, but it might be a bit more 'usual'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lisa realized her mother didn't see her as her daughter but just a stranger. She was just Angela not her daughter Lisa. Her mother wouldn't surely accept an advice from some stranger. So Lisa answered:</span></div></div>",

When she had suggested something like that a few months back, her mother shrugged it off saying she was too old for it. What a change it would bring, telling it as a successful career woman. Lisa shrugged it off and paid for her lingerie. She also bought an extra pair of stockings. She didn't know but she was kinda getting used to having her legs exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was outside the store she went off to look for something else.

But after seeing there was a sale on clothes, she just couldn't resist herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had found a few things; a nice frilly top, a pair of worn jeans, a pair of not so high heels and a nice enough jacket. She took them to a changing room and tried them on. When she looked in the mirror, she was once again amazed. Although she did look more in her thirties, the clothes did suit her. Her cleavage came out right, the jeans showed her bubbly butt, and the heels she gave her a more outgoing look. In fact when Lisa thought about it, it made her look <i>hot </i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on her own clothes again, she found a few other bargains she couldn't resist; two tops and three jeans. She then waited in the line at the checkout aisle. Looking over the people in front of her she saw Steven behind the register. Lisa couldn't help but smile when she saw Steven busy. He was of Angela's age, a bit dull looking but very gentle and nice. She wondered, no she couldn't. Although... Angela asked Lisa for help to hook up with a guy. Steven was a guy, and of her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't help but feel that it would be a life breaking experience for Angela if she would ask Steven out.

She didn't ask some guy out, but someone she knew from her old life. The guy was very shy, but also very nice to her. She liked him a bit, he was not like her boyfriend Tom. That guy was only posting pictures on Facebook of his muscles or about how many workouts he had done that day; Lisa had told him that it was way too much but he wouldn't listen to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw a car coming out of the corner of her eye. To her surprise it was Steven in an old Ford. What a piece of junk. She rode a piece of junk as well, but she didn't expect someone who was so old to ride one.

When Tom went to the movies with her, he wanted to watch action or comedies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie was over, Steven and Lisa were still sitting there. Steven had an emotionless expression while Lisa had to get her handkerchief out of her purse. The ending was so sad. Lisa looked around for the first time. Everyone else was gone, Steven had put an arm around her and she had lied her head on his chest. This was really embarrassing. Steven didn't seem to mind though. He was still far away. When Lisa had pulled his arm, he suddenly woke up. He told her he was still thinking about the sad ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they decided to drive home. Lisa was still talking to Steven when she realized they were at her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're here.\" Lisa told Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked around and realized it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I t-thought we were somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Lisa giggled. Both her and Steven didn't know what to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll go.\" Lisa told Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you b-better.\" Steven told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

Lisa wished she could continue with it. But then she had to let go. Lisa didn't want Steven to think that he had her wrapped around his fingers, he had to do something for it too. She then stepped out of the car and told him to call her. When Lisa entered the building, Steven was still sitting there in his car, probably thinking what just had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa entered her apartment and pulled off the high heels and jumped on the bed. She had a date with Steven! And it was the exact sort of date she wanted, nice dinner, catching a movie together. This was probably one of her best nights ever. Ugh, if only she had someone to talk to now. Lisa missed Megan, this was the exact sort of thing she wanted to talk about with her best friend. Sadly Lisa was stuck inside the live of Angela, and Angela had her life. She wondered how Angela was doing. Probably good, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was in the mood for drinking a wine perhaps, but then she remembered tomorrow was Sunday. The day after that, she had to go to work as Angela. And she hadn't done a thing for it. Just like high school, she thought. First thing tomorrow she had to go studying. Lisa undressed herself, put off her make-up, brushed her teeth, slipped into her nightgown and went to bed. She closed her eyes and dreamed about her date with Steven.</span></div></div>",

While Lisa just wanted to sleep and think about how wonderful it was yesterday, she knew she had to learn this stuff today. So as always she had stepped out of bed early and with some extra strong coffee she was busy reading the files Angela left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Angela's schedule out of her head by now, tomorrow they had a meeting discussing an important client. The day after she had to receive same client, discuss business, go out to dinner et cetra. Wednesday she had a meeting about her performance. Lisa was surprised by how many meetings Angela had, some days she had more meetings than to do actual work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing she hated the most was remembering the names of her co-workers and superiors. There weren't that many, but she found herself drifting off to last night every time. How could she ever forget that? That wonderful movie, that special kiss. Remembering that kiss made her giggle like a schoolgirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Lisa you have to focus. Focus. Lisa grabbed a photo and thought of the name. His name is Eric, works in the IT, wavy blond hair, a real cuty except for his zero fashion glasses, Angela usually uh... goes out to lunch with him. Lisa turned the photo around and let out a shout. She had it right. This was going to be easy.</span></div></div>",

She was completely tired, Lisa puts off her glasses as she rubbed her eyes. Memorizing things was different than before, not that she would forget stuff but more that she had to study harder to remember things. Like her brain was full and she had to pack every detail of information inside some far away corner of her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that Steven didn't call or text her back the whole day. She was a bit worried about it. Was it that kiss that did it? Was it too soon? Lisa liked Steven, though she wasn't sure what to think about it. After all Lisa and Angela would go back to their own lives in a month. Would Angela like Steven as much as she did now? <br>\r\nTo shake off the anxious feelings Lisa grabbed a wine bottle and a glass. She poured the wine in her glass and held it in front of her nose. She smelled the sweet scent of the wine as it made her more relaxed. She took a little sip, it was good quality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird isn't it? I mean I never had a sip of wine in my life before and now I suddenly know what a good wine tastes like.</i> <br>\r\nLisa took another sip as she looked outside the window. It was a nice view, seeing the river with the moon in the back. It made her calm.  Lisa suddenly stood up and opened the door leading to the balcony. She let her arms hang on the railing as she felt the soft summer breeze in her face. She let her thoughts go free, not thinking about being Angela, Steven or any of those things. For a few minutes she felt she was <i>Lisa Hale</i> again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then let out a sigh and  brushed her hair away from her face as she went inside the apartment again.

I am not a very social person, I rarely go out besides hanging out with my best friend Hanna who I haven't talked to in a while due to work being so stressful for the both of us plus I haven't dated anyone since I was in college. Best part about getting my successful request swapping into a high school graduate is that I can finally go on the Senior trip! I might be in someone else's shoes for a whole month but it will be a learning experience for me adjusting my life style that I can get back in my normal life. Funny enough I was at the store buying some cute sleepwear that had leopard print on it and saw a cute man at the registrar named Steven, when I was making the purchase he was nervous along with me. My heart was telling me to make a move but my gut was telling me to walk away, stuff like that I need to get over and hopefully I can do that in a younger person's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Angela</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! After reading her first entry you realize that somehow the relationship she had in college took a toll on her when she broke up with whomever back then and now she's afraid today to make a move on a cute guy? I have a month to go on a date or two with a guy and one of them could be that gentleman named Steven, seems an easy task. You have enough time for the last entry she put...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Friday, June 29th:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Diary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found out today from The Nexus that the person's body I will be living in for the next month is Lisa, she is eighteen years old. Her online profile reads that <b>height 5'7\", she is physically fit with B-cup breasts and shoulder length brown hair. She is considered pretty by most, in a very 'active girl' kind of way. In high school, she was involved in cheer leading and dance, as well as cross country. Her family is fairly normal, upper middle class, and Lisa has been a fairly successful student through school. Having just graduated, she is preparing for her last summer vacation before starting college in the fall. She has decided, however, to rent her life out to The Nexus for the summer, as a way to pay for school in the fall.</b> Seems to me she along with her family is struggling with financial aid part of college. I really should do something about it to make her time fun inside my body, I will give her $10,000 just to spend on fun things. Spa? Shopping Spree? Anything she can do, tomorrow I bark up upon a new journey and slip into a new pair of shoes as Lisa....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow you can't believe Angela did that for you, putting aside ten grand of her own money to make this month that more special? You begin to get a little emotional from it but then you realize you have limited time to finish the diary for her. You might as well document your time in Angela's body right? Why not? You take the pen out from the side pocket and you begin to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Monday, July 2nd:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Diary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa here for the first entry inside of Angela's body. Let me just say Angela your life so far is awesome! I went shopping over the weekend and made a move on Steven for you, he's really cute and you should date him when you return back into your body! My plan is to go on a date or two before the month is over. By the time you read this you will find out how that relationship is going so I should say stay tuned? First day of work was super stressful but glad it's over but decided to call up Hanna Dawson, your best friend who you haven't talked to in a while. Currently sitting here in the leopard pajama set you bought along with those slippers that were next to your bed waiting for her to come over and we are going to have a nice wine night. I wanted to get to know Hanna better and feel super close to here. Anyway onto the night that should be special!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Lisa </span>Angela</i></span></div></div>",

You go into the bathroom and lock the doors as you get ready to take a shower but first you search through the medicine cabinet to find some medicine and find a tylonol and take it while sipping a cup of water. You are feeling a tad better already as you take your clothes off and jump in the shower as the hot water is hotting your body you can tell you are waking up by the minute and are ready to take on the day. When your done you dry off and get ready by making yourself professional with Angelina's suits that she had in her closet and get dressed and head downstairs to make yourself a cup of coffee. You look out your window to see Hannah's car is now gone with the guest room empty as you check your phone before you head to work you see you got a text message from her and it reads \"Had a real fun time last night, have fun at work today because today is going to suck for the both of us.

It was strange, not being able to see clearly until she put on Angela's glasses, and the feeling of the soft bed and luxurious bedding made it hard to want to get out of bed. Still, there was a lot that Lisa wanted to do with the weekend before she had to work Angela's job on Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night, she had spent quite a bit of time exploring Angela's life, her facebook account, reading her email, and getting to know the space she'd be living in. There had been a few other surprises she'd found that hadn't quite matched up with the profile Angela had left for her. The profile, for example, had listed yoga as a hobby... but while the wine collecting may have been understated, the yoga hobby consisted of a yoga mat tucked into the back of the closet, and a DVD still in its shrink wrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso concerning was the 'best friend' that the profile mentioned: Hannah Dawson. From what Lisa could tell, Hannah and Angela hadn't spoken since near christmas, and the months before that had largely been a series of emails back and forth, planning outings that Angela frequently cancelled or rescheduled for work. If this was the best friendship that she had, it wasn't in good shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiether was Angela's wardrobe in good shape.  The closets contained plenty of things to wear to the office, but dreadfully little to wear outside of that, and much of what Angela did have looked like it had been in her wardrobe for a long time. Lisa could certainly understand why Angela wanted this kind of vacation, and now, she was starting to see all the things she could do to help Angela out while she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with all the energy and exuberance of an eighteen year old, Lisa set about the task of making things better, and the first step was...</span></div></div>",

Strangely putting on a bra went faster than before, but there was one thing that was bothering her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina, why does my bra feel so tight, while my breasts fit in them perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lyzette her bra, or better said your bra, is a few cup sizes smaller than your actually size to make them \"look better.\" Tina explained Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found it oddly putting on the clothes she now had to wear. She had to wear a top a few sizes too small, so her mid rift was exposed. A panther fur jacket. The skirt was easy to get on, although she couldn't move her legs very far. But the oddest were the pump heels she was wearing. She never wore them before, but when she put them on, she found out she could walk them like a pro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is one of the skills I have now?\" Lisa asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked up from the board she was holding, \"That's right Lyzette, you're used to wearing these all the time so it would be rather strange if you would wear something else. After all, you're a prime stripper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prime stripper? I thought she was just a poor one?\" Lisa asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor?

There's a folder here with all of the information you'll need to live Lyzette's life for the next few weeks. Car keys, address, there's even a DVD with video of her most common dance routines so that you can watch them before you have to perform them. The skills you need are all there, but some times it helps to get a mental kick start before you dive in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks,\" Lisa said, taking the folder from Tina before turning to the door. \"So, I just come back in three weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there's an appointment card in the folder for you. Just be back on that day and time. You may not swap directly back into your own life, that will depend on if we've managed to book your life back to back, but either way, you'll need to be here to return Lyzette's life to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll see you in three weeks, thank you again,\" Lisa finished before leaving the room. Walking out through the waiting room was a unique experience for Lisa. Not only could she feel her breasts bouncing in the overly tight bra that she had taken from the stripper, but she could feel every eye in the lobby take notice of her. One woman, a mother of two young boys, went as far as to cover the eyes of her children when Lisa strode across the floor. Her heels clicked, her ass wiggled temptingly, and she stepped in such a way as to give her breasts an extra bit of jiggle in the cups of her bra. And it felt completely normal to do so. <i>So, this is what it's like to be super sexy,</i> she thought. <i>I kind of like it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the parking lot she pulled a pair of designer sunglasses out of Lyzette's leather purse, pausing for a moment when she encountered a pack of slim cigarettes. \"So, I smoke now too,\" she said softly, continuing to dig through the purse for her car keys. \"Ah ha!\" Keys in hand, she strode confidently across the parking lot towards the only car in the lot that matched the keys. After all, there weren't many people in the United States that drove a Fiat Spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the stylish convertible, Lisa took a few minutes to browse the folder before deciding what to do. Not only did it contain all of the basic information she would need to live Lyzette's life for the next week, but it was obvious that Lyzette had planned to make sure that Lisa stayed successful while living her life. There was a schedule of events that ran out for three weeks, all of her appointments and detailed notes about each appointment. This, she filed away for later, thumbing further through the packet to find where she would be living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe address was for an area of town she had rarely been to, a gated community with large homes that backed onto a local lake. Tina hadn't been kidding when she said that Lyzette made amazingly good money as a stripper. In her wallet, she found several major credit cards, and over $1,000 in loose bills. The one thing she didn't find anywhere in the packet, was any mention of family or a boyfriend. As near as she could tell, Lyzette lived the high life, and she lived it alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's why she wanted to be me for a little while,\" Lisa mused. \"There aren't all that many friends listed here, and no one is marked as a 'close friend.' Still, the next three weeks should be fun. I hope Lyzette has as much fun being me as I'm going to have being her!\"</span></div></div>",

She then put on the plain pink panties, some jeans and a simple shirt. Lyzette found her pretty boring clothed, but she had chosen Lisa's life for a reason. When she had put on the pair of flats, Lyzette was ready to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina escorted her back to the lobby, while she was used that young man would bulge their eyes when they followed her and older men tended to touch her, nothing of the sort happened now. No one seemed to notice her, she was just too plainly. Lyzette wasn't sure what to think about it, she wanted to swap her life because she couldn't handle the life she had. The parties she had to go to, the men she had to pleasure. But the one thing she did love about it, was the attention she got because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the exit Tina handed her a folder containing information about Lisa's life. She gave her a hand and told her to enjoy herself. With only that Lyzette was standing outside, but she didn't worry. She was left alone in this worlds all the time, so she didn't worry. She first had to find Lisa's car, she knew she had one. After searching around for half an hour she finally found the car she could her key on. It was more like a pile of junk. The windshields were half broken, there was no air conditioner and the drivers seat missed a piece of fabric. Now she had to figure out what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily with her experience she knew how to drive it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the mall, it was quiet for the time of day. She locked the car doors (even though she wouldn't know anyone who would want to steal a scrap of junk like that) and went inside. It was a long time for Lyzette since the last time she was here. She didn't have much free time left with her work (she was sleeping most of the day), and when she needed clothes she would buy them online. It would be fun to try and put on clothes before buying them though, instead of the opposite way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went inside a clothing store, she looked around a bit. Lyzette had a good taste of fashion, she needed one in her line of work. Clients would prefer Lyzette to wear some type of clothing on occasions. Looking inside Lisa's wallet there was not much money in it, so Lyzette had to spend it wisely too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she was sure, she wouldn't stay dressed like this. There were two sorts of outfit she could mix. One would be sexy but stylish, showing off a little but not too much. The other would be way exposed and some people might say a little bit slutty. But Lyzette liked wearing that sort of clothes, it got all the attention she wanted. Although she wasn't sure that Lisa would want to wear something like that.

Nothing she'd seen in Lisa's file mentioned a job of any sort, which was both good and bad. Good because it meant she could just enjoy the vacation, but bad because it meant her spending money would be a bit lean. Still, there was a great deal to be had here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with some short shorts, and a few mini skirts that were about as short as the shorts were. She hoped Lisa had some decent heels to go with them, butt she didn't have much hope of that. Next, she browsed over to tops, grabbing several halter tops and scoop neck shirts that would show near obscene amounts of cleavage. Those were her favorite, after all, there was nothing quite like the look you got from guys who thought you were about to pop out of a shirt. A final basic t-shirt made it's way into her basket because it was a stretchy material that would cling to every inch of her and would be especially attention getting when she wore it bra-less. And it was 75% off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot how much I loved bargain hunting,\" she said with a smile. In her early years, she hadn't had much, but she'd always been good with money, and making one night's tips go as far as it could stopped her from becoming one of the many 'worn out' strippers she'd seen in so many of the clubs. It let her be pickier about her gigs, and her clients, and picky had become 'exclusive' very quickly for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped into the changing room, she got the first look in a full length mirror she'd had since visiting The Nexus. \"Is that really how people see me?\" She said, touching the reflection in wonder. She still looked like herself, but it was almost like looking back in a time machine. Her face looked much more youthful, and her body looked less developed. Most notably, her large and surgically enhanced bust was a shadow of it's former self, showcasing perky teenage breasts that would barely make up a handful. Turning to inspect her backside, she found her ass to be less full than she was used to, but every bit as perky as her breasts appeared. While her waist was trim, it looked less so because of the narrower hips and reduced bust. Looking down at herself, she confirmed that nothing had changed about her physically, but the reflection in the mirror was a different story. Stripping off her shirt and shimmying out of her jeans, she traced the familiar tattoos down her side and thighs and marveled at the bare skin reflected in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is a trip. I'm going to have so much fun with this! You know, what I should do is....\"</span></div></div>",

She could probably get herself a nice Sugar Daddy if she played things right and when they switched back Lisa would even thank her! She picked up new make up to really accent Lisa\u2019s look. The lip plumper alone had done wonders. Then came a visit to a few clothing stores to get more provocative outfits and sexy high-heels.

For the moment she got a simple tramp stamp on her lower back. She\u2019d always wanted to get heavily tattooed, but her usual clients wouldn\u2019t go for that. That didn\u2019t matter while she was in someone else\u2019s life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Lisa was going to be surprised when she got her life back, Lyzette figured the girl should thank her. She was going to set her up so she wouldn\u2019t have to ever worry about going to some boring college or some normal job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what to do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On her way into the mall, she saw that a local strip club had an amateur night, with a cash price for the one who got the most tips. She just had to participate. Not only for the money, which could really help her out, but also because it was the one thing she loved to do the most. While she was pickier about her gigs and clients, sometimes she just wanted to return to where it all began. That was going to be tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette paid for the clothes and quickly changed into a short mini skirt and a halter top. She could see her panties when she bowed a little, nice. Lyzette felt better already with these clothes on. She found some second hand pumps in a little store, and soon she had her old clothing style back. Looking at her reflection in the window of a shop she winked at herself, she looked really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette put the pedal to the metal returning to her new home. It was a suburban home, nothing special like her own apartment. The door was locked which was really weird. Lyzette had to go search through the file she got from Lisa to know where she could find the key. Unlocking the door she stepped inside. \"Hello?\" She asked out loud. Nobody answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\" Lyzette said to herself as she let go off her bags. There was a note lying on a table in the hallway. Her \"mom\" had to go with Stephanie, her sister, to a cheerleading contest. There was some macaroni in the fridge. They wouldn't be home until late at night. Lyzette felt relieved knowing that, she could have her fun today and worry tomorrow about explaining her change in clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already six o' clock, Lyzette had to hurry. But first she had to eat something, her stomach was complaining. She put the macaroni in the microwave for a few minutes, and when it was ready she ate as fast as she could. When she was finished she felt she had enough energy for tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her bags and went upstairs to her room. Lisa's room was not that feminine, but you could see there lived a girl here. Lyzette was pleasantly surprised Lisa had a vanity table, that would make things much more easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror she saw that Lisa had put on mascara and a touch of lip gloss. It went well with her face, but should she put on more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No, she thought. This would be fine. In fact, it was probably better that she keep the makeup light. The reflection in the mirror looked... fresh. Young. Almost innocent. That would go over very well with a certain type of crowd and clientele. Glancing over at the clock, she saw that she still had a bit of time before she needed to head to the club, plenty of time to look over the file and poke around at the life she'd be living for the next month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the laptop on Lisa's desk, Lyzette keyed in the password from the file and started browsing. There wasn't much in her email, it was even free of the usual 'because you've ordered from us before, buy this now...' adverts. Her facebook account was another matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... who's this Tom fellow?\" Lyzette mused, clicking through messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Babe, I'm sorry about what I said before, I've been thinking about us a lot. I want you back, msg me so we can talk.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Babe, I spent some time on the field today playing a pick up game with Rick and Alex. I get it. I really do. Not having you cheering for me on the sidelines made me wonder why I was trying so hard. I caught this awesome pass, 60 yards of a hail mary that Rick threw and after bowling down that punk from Westside I turned to where you usually stand to smile and wave... you weren't there. I miss you babe. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the most recent one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey babe, there's a party on Friday that Alex is throwing. It's just a bunch of the usual crew. Megan will be there. Call me, I want to pick you up and take you there. We don't have to do anything, just talk to me. I miss you. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this sap? Lyzette wondered. Needy and self centered at the same time. Then again, it was high school. Curious, she clicked onto his page to take a look. \"Wow,\" she breathed, flipping through page after page of Tom, usually shirtless, working out, hanging out at the beach, or otherwise looking handsome. \"I wonder how far they've gone? I bet I could show him a thing or two. Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking on his most recent message, she typed a brief reply: <i>I'm still not happy, but you can pick me up at 7:00 on friday. We can talk then.</i> Lyzette wasn't quite sure yet what he'd done that had upset Lisa, but she wasn't about to let him get off easy. After all, she wanted him eager to make it up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenning a quick note to 'her' parents, Lyzette grabbed Lisa's cheer uniform and headed for her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh school cheerleader doing her first strip routine... the crowd would eat it up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The club holding the contest was called Aces, and it sat in the no man's land of middle class strip clubs. It was clean enough, new enough, and well located enough to avoid being the kind of dive club that gave discount lap dances between 8 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon with 3rd rate, over the hill girls holding down shifts that no reasonable place would be open for. At the same time, it wasn't posh enough for lines, velvet ropes, a cover charge at the door and more than one VIP lounge. This was a club for the middle and upper middle class. A place where Joe white collar worker could pretend that the girl on stage was his college sweet heart that got away before he went home and pounded out ten minutes of missionary sex with the 'safe girl' that he married instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the dancers here were college age, very few of them over twenty five, with most of them doing short term flirts with something seedy.... They hadn't chosen this as a life style, and half of them were just party girls getting part time kicks. Most of the white collar Joes wouldn't know the difference anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign out front offered $5,000 cash for the top performance, and every dancer got to keep her tips regardless. As armature nights went, it was a pretty hefty purse, but the school year had just ended and that meant any of the dancers who were graduating were likely moving on. This wasn't a contest. It was a recruiting event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up to the bouncer at the gate, Lyzette got a much briefer looking over than she was used to before the burly fellow said: \"Name?\" His tone was bored and he was looking more at the clip board than he was at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie Fox,\" Lyzette said, giving a stage name she'd tossed together on the way over. It wasn't great, but she hadn't had much time to put serious thought into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, how about your real name,\" the tough guy said. \"And some ID that matches it? Sorry miss, but if you're not legal, you're not getting in no matter how cute that button nose of yours is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, sorry. It's Lisa, Lisa Hale,\" Lyzette said, handing over her ID. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking her ID, not batting an eye at the age, or difference in appearance between Lyzette's real form and the cute young girl on the drivers license, the burly fellow smiled and pulled a form off his clip board. \"All right Lisa, just put Susie Fox on the line where it says 'stage name', but if any of your teachers are in the crowd it's not going to help you much. Take the form inside and give it to Lacy, she's in charge of the girls for the contest. She's easy to spot, red head that's less than five foot nothing and the only one not wearing heels. Contest starts in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you...?\" Lyzette asked, trailing off and hoping to get a name out of the fellow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike,' he said, opening the door for her. \"Oh, and at the end of the night, exit by this door. Wait for me, I'll walk you to your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mike,\" she said, glad to know that the club valued the safety of it's dancers enough to assign security to walk girls back to their cars. She'd had more encounters between the front door and her car than she cared to remember and seeing that level of care made her feel better about stepping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got inside, she was hustled off to a dressing room where several other wide eyed girls were getting introduced to the wonders of the back room of a strip club. Most of the girls were cute, though at least three of them were clearly hopping to get by simply by virtue of having big breasts. Another two were practicing walking in heels, and Lyzette dismissed them as being non-competition. Against the far wall, one girl was stretching, and moving with technique that shouted 'ballet.' She had an amazing physique, and could either be a real threat... or someone who didn't understand where classic dance met the sex saturated world of the strip club. Either way, she was probably the only girl that Lyzette had to worry about losing to if this was all that was going to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, listen up,\" a voice called as a diminutive red head stepped into the room with a clip board. \"There are a few things you need to know about tonight, so let me set the record straight. This is warm up hour, but the house is full for the contest so everyone work it. Win or lose, tips are yours with a few exceptions. You aren't being charged for stage time tonight, but the DJ still needs to be tipped, and so does security. That comes out of your tips, but the rest is yours. Be nice to the regular girls that are working the side stages, they're giving up prime time for you guys to have some fun tonight. You can stay as long as you'd like, but you will not leave with a customer, and if we catch you slipping numbers to anyone than we will report you to the police for soliciting. Our girls are dancers, entertainers, and above all NOT WHORES. We catch that kind of behavior, and you can explain it to the judge because we won't lose our licence for your extra income. Do I make myself clear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacy waited only a moment before continuing. \"Okay, costumes on, you've got a few minutes to get ready before I come back here with a roster and the order that you'll compete in. You each get a single song, if you didn't bring your own music, talk to the DJ and pick a good one. Turn your tips into me at the end of your set. Girl with the most tips wins the big prize. Everyone who does well will also be considered for a job offer, so even if you don't win the night, you may come out ahead in the end. Get ready girls, it's going to be fun!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There is an art to picking music to dance to in a strip club. It's one of the reasons that tipping the DJ is so important. Matching movement to song is something any dancer understands, but that's only part of it. Hundreds of girls learn to dance in school. Like Lisa, they become cheerleaders or take dance classes to kill a PE credit, and they learn to move their body to the music. That's great, and it gets you a head start in the club, but that's only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first three girls Lyzette watched knew a little about how to move, and they were pretty for sure. They danced around the stage, they shook their breasts, and they gyrated about like they were on the dance floor of a club. People hooted and hollered, and the guys in the front row put some cash on the stage... and that was about it. Brittany Spears, Nickleback and Dev. The longest song played lasted three minutes and forty seconds. The girls didn't pick up their money till the end of the song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDancing would get you started, but it wouldn't make you money. You had to know what the clients were here for, and it wasn't just to watch you, it was to interact with you. If they wanted to watch titties they couldn't touch, they could watch any porn they wanted, and wank it while they were at it. You had to do better than that. You had to work the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl up lit off with a Miley Cyrus song. Whatever it was, she only made it a minute in before she got too red faced and embarrassed to finish, and ran off stage. If you weren't committed, you didn't get anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth girl looked like she might really know something, or had at least watched some of the right movies. She picked up money as she went, and got bills stuffed into her panties and bra, but she let the men get way too much fondle on while placing the money and when she had underwear full of bills, she wasn't sure how to strip out of it. Her song was Lady Gaga. 3:23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they got down to the only person Lyzette had been worried about. The ballet dancer. She didn't have the kind of figure that had been shaking around the stage, but she had a body and training that could work a pole, and a good dancer on a pole could get money flung at the stage... The music started and the ballerina took to the stage wearing a large enveloping cloak and stepping out to show flashes of leg to the siren song of violin over a techno back beat. Moments later the cloak dropped to reveal a dancer wearing nothing but body paint, and the crowd went nuts. For two minutes and twenty five seconds the dancer poured energy into a performance that was erotic, stimulating, and out of place on the grimy stage of the strip clubs. It left the men in the front row hard, and even Lyzette a bit wet... but the men were too busy watching to remember to put more money on the stage, and the dancer was too busy executing her routine to pick up any of the money. Still, it would be an impressive act to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was on her. The lights pivoted, the DJ announced \"Susie Fox,\" and the familiar chords of Metallica's Ain't My Bitch filled the club. In the back of the club, regulars began to move towards the stage and a few of the older dancers working side stages looked up with a twinkle in their eyes. Pop music tended to produce tracks that were between 3:00 and 4:00 minutes long, and radio liked that because they could play the same number of songs but fit in more commercial breaks in per hour. But in a strip club, a long song meant more time to work over the clients for their money, and Lyzette had picked a middling Metallica track weighing in at 5:04. Nearly a minute and a half longer than the longest song her competition had provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tip the DJ because if you do, he takes care of you and slips a long song into your set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette hit the stage like a hammer, cheer leader costume, pom poms and all, but in the first minute, she was warming up the crowd. White collar Joe in the front row needed to have his tie loosened when she took his dollar bill, and after that, he got no love till there was more cash in front of him. But his buddy, Blue Collar Bob looked so tired that a little hair ruffle was in order to perk up his day and his interest... and this was the first minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second minute, she lost her top and panties, but kept the bra and skirt. After all, if she could flash someone as she rolled about the stage it was naughtier than if she was all on display. The singles that appeared on the edge of the bar she tucked back into collars and breast pockets. \"Dig deep sweetie,\" she said to one group as she gave back a single. Picking up her panties from the stage and wrapping them around one man head to pull him close she made sure to speak loud enough for the front row to hear. \"Best offer tonight takes home a prize,\" she said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few men scrambled to stack ones, one gentleman making a pyramid of folded bills. Others dropped fives and twenties on the bar right there. Lyzette scooped up the money quickly and stuffed the panties in Joe White Collar's front pocket. After that, it was time to drop money by the pole and shimmy out of the skirt and bra. Three minutes in and she felt like she'd already won but she was pulling out all the stops she thought she could get away with. The pole she avoided for anything but some crude teasing, displaying any level of real skill with a pole would make people question her as an amateur, but it gave her a chance to pull back from the front row and let a few more bills pile up before she went back into the fray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched the crowd closely, taking note of where the big bills showed up and dedicating the final minutes of her performance to personal time with the biggest tippers. She held the tie of one gentleman while doing a stage roll over it, spreading her legs to either side of his head as she went and briefly giving him the best view of the evening. She picked up a folded twenty as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother client got his head pressed right between her breasts, something that usually sent clients over the edge with her enhanced bust, but still had a pleasant effect from the lesser assets that everyone in the room believed her to possess. She took a hundred dollar bill from him that had his phone number scrawled hastily on it in sharpie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the song ended, leaving Lyzette with a pile of bills and a roar of applause. There was less money on the stage than the deposit one of her current clients paid to entertain at their private parties, but it had been a lot more fun. The roar of the crowd brought it all back. Why she did this, why she loved it. A room full of men cheering because they'd seen her naked. And what could be better? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that they'd paid her to do it!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, nice night everyone,\" Lacy, the club owner said to the group of girls gathered in the back. \"I've got envelopes with your names on them that have your tips for the night. For the few of you that are over twenty one, the bar is open and your first drink is on the house. Lisa, congratulations, you're our winner for the night with $427 for your set, nicely done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the girls applauded, though a few looked stunned at the difference between the handful of bills in their own envelopes and the sum that Lacy had announced for Lyzette. Even Lyzette was a bit surprised.... on her best nights in a club of this size, she rarely pulled more than $500 a dance and she hadn't expected to do so well during amature hour. \"Thank you,\" she said, blushing faintly as she took the envelope along with the check for first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the diminutive red head continued speaking. \"If I call you're name, I'd like you to stay behind in the dressing room for a few minutes so that I can make a proper offer. Lisa, Annabelle, Natalie, and Gwen. Everyone else, thank you again for coming out and when we do our next amature night in three months, please consider coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette eyed the other girls, not terribly surprised at the selection. Anabelle was the ballerina and the girl could certainly move. She was petite, with sculpted legs and a firm toned body. She'd let her long auburn hair down out of the tight bun she'd worn to perform and it fell in waves over her slim shoulders and pert breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was another good choice. She looked a bit older, closer to a college senior than freshman, and she'd been the one to dance right before Annabelle. She had moves, and men would be happy to stare at either her full c-cup breasts or the supple curve of her ass. The long blond hair didn't hurt any either, and the butterfly tattoo on her hip was just the right tone of edgey and inviting for the average customer to think it would mean she's easy... if they pony up enough money to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one made Lyzette cringe a bit. Gwen had been one of the first girls to dance, and she hadn't been that good at it. She had a body that most women would kill for, DDs and a tiny waist, but she had no clue how to use it. Her brunette hair was cut shoulder length in a style that screamed 'professional' and not 'professional sex worker.' With some work, she could probably pull off a sexy secretary number, or a naughty teacher... but only if she learned to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rest of the contestants stepped out, Lacy turned to the remaining four girls to make her pitch. Reaching into her purse, she pulled out a stack of one hundred dollar bills and began counting them into four piles, stopping when there were five bills in each pile. \"I see I have your attention. Girls, you all have something different to offer the club, and I think you'd all be good additions to our little family here. The money in front of you is an advance. It's yours if you want it. Starting terms are really simple. You each work three evenings a week, and you work a minimum of two blocks each night. A block is two hours long. They don't have to be back to back, but it's four hours of time in the evening. Your first month will be 100% weeknights, but I may give you some early blocks on a Friday night as well. Saturdays have to be earned. Your rental fees are $25 a block for stage time, and I expect you to tip out at the end of the night. I'd suggest planning to use that advance for your first couple of nights and to expand your wardrobes a bit, but that's up to you. Questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was the only one to speak immediately, and her question made the club owner grin. \"When can we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monday night,\" Lacy said with a smile. \"Are all of you interested then?\" Seeing nods from all of the girls, she hand a pile of cash to each of the girls. \"Wonderful. Be here monday at 5:00 for paperwork, you start dancing at 7:00. And Lisa, Annabelle, I'd like a word with each of you before you go.\" It took only a moment for Natalie and Gwen to take their money and head out of the changing room, both giggling like school girls and talking about how they were going to spend their new found fortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't keep you two long,\" Lacy said once the door to the changing room had closed. \"But there's something extra I wanted to talk to you two about. You girls can dance, and there's no lying about it. You've got moves. With that goes some serious star power. But I'm going to be 100% honest with you. In two months, Gwen will be out earning both of you. She's not the best dancer, but she has the body that men will pay the most to see. Given the time to learn to dance, those jugs of hers will pay the bills like you wouldn't believe. But... she needs to learn to dance. And even Natalie could use some help in building a routine that gets attention. So... I want to offer to make an investment in you both, if you'll make an investment in some of the other girls. Dr. Watts is a plastic surgeon that we've referred several girls to over the years for 'enhancement.' If you'll sign on for a year, the club will pay for it. You won't be able to dance for a few weeks after a boob job, but if you'll come in to work with the other new girls on their dancing... we'll make sure you can pay your rent while you heal. So, what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

I won't be taken seriously in ballet with fake breasts, so if I have to do that to work here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh take the money,\" Lacy said, slightly offended. \"Honey, small is sexy and like I said, you've got moves.

You okay with that?\" Lacy finished, holding the envelope back out to Annabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with that,\" she said with a smile. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you Ms School Spirit,\" she said, turning to Lyzette. \"Could be the difference for you between needing to work five nights a week and needing to work three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll do it,\" she said, sounding every bit as eager as most eighteen year olds would. \"Um,\" she hesitated. \"Does that mean you'll be picking my new, um, size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's really between you and Dr. Watts to figure out,\" Lacy said. \"It's your body, and he's the surgeon. We'd like you to go for at least a D-cup, but if Dr. Watts says that's not realistic, then we can settle for less. In general, bigger is better,\" she said, and Lyzette nodded along with her. Lyzette had noticed it herself when she'd gotten her second boob job to go up to her current size her income had gone up by a significant amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, where do I sign?\" Lyzette asked. She hadn't planned on stripping while vacationing in Lisa's life, but with the opportunity in front of her, she couldn't pass it up. These were the glory days where she could be brazen about what she did and revel in the power her body would command over a crowd. It would be a nice break from having to discretely arrive at senator's beach cabins or the unlisted residence of CEOs and oil barons. Those people had the money to make her come to them, but there was too much power struggle, too much tension to truly revel in her sexuality when she was taking her clothes off for VIPs. No... this would be a vacation and a half... and besides, after living Lyzette's life for a month, she was sure that Lisa wouldn't mind coming back to the changes. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After putting away the money and changing back into her street clothes, Lyzette walked back to Lisa's car with an extra bounce in her step. It was day one of her vacation and she already had extra cash in her pocket and a chance to do something she loved without the stress of her own high profile clientele. If this went well, she might see about booking an extra few weeks in Lisa's life... after all, there was no harm in extending her vacation as long as Lisa's life was available... her own life would be covered just fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up to the drivers side door of Lisa's run down car, Lyzette's silent celebration was interrupted by the sound of soft, feminine sobs coming from the car next to hers. Peeking over the roof, she saw Gwen, the girl who'd done such a bad job dancing, bent over her steering wheel and sobbing into the sleeves of her jacket. Walking up to her window, Lyzette tapped gently on the glass. \"Hey, Gwen right? Are you okay?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her car, Gwen rolled down the window and wiped furiously at her tear streaked face. \"Oh god, I'm a mess. I'm sorry. I'll be okay, I promise... I just... I just need to...\" she broke off as another round of choking sobs wracked her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Lyzette said, opening the other woman's car door and reaching in to put an arm around her. \"It's okay. You did okay in there, and you got a job. You just need a bit of practice to get good at it. Lacy even asked Annabelle and I to help you with your dancing. You'll be making bank in no time, I promise,\" she said, trying to cheer the other woman up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats,\" sob, \"really,\" sob, \"nice of you,\" Gwen managed between sobs. \"But... but I... I don't... I... I don't have, have, any where, -ere to go n-now. I... I n-needed to, to w-win tonight,\" she said, tears continuing to stream down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, honey,\" Lyzette said, instantly reminded of several girls she'd worked with over the years who had very little and nothing to fall back on if the tips weren't good except turning tricks. Gwen, however, didn't strike her as the type. She looked too... neat to be someone who had been living rough for long. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my boyfriend,\" she started, then stopped and started over. \"My <i>ex</i>-boyfriend. He, he kicked me out. He said that th-the only th-thing I'm g-good for is...is a pair of, of big tits and... and he's done s-supp-porting me. He's got some... s-some new g-girl now. I j-just graduated l-last term and n-no one will h-hire me, a-and I c-can't do my old j-job for the sc-school any m-more because I'm n-not a s-s-student any m-more,\" Gwen stammered, gasping for air and trying to continue as sobs wracked her body. \"A-and so I.. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came here,\" Lyzette said softly, \"to put those 'tits' to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm,\" Gwen paused, taking a deep breath and trying to steady herself. \"I'm sorry Lisa,\" she said. \"You were, really great tonight and... and you deserved to win. I was just... just hoping I'd get enough money for a hotel for a few days to figure things out and... and to get away from Gary, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I totally, totally get it,\" Lyzette said nodding. \"Tell you what,\" she continued. \"How about you and I go get a cup of coffee... and a slice of pie somewhere that's cheap and open twenty-four hours. My treat. We can talk things out a bit and figure out what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" sniff, \"that sounds great,\" Gwen said. \"Can, um.. can you drive? I don't know how much gas I have left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Lyzette said as she stood up. \"I'll, um... I'll have to clean up some of the junk in the passenger seat,\" she said, taking in the mess that Lisa had left in her own car. \"But sure, I can drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lisa,\" Gwen said with a smile. \"You're the best.\"</span></div></div>",

Mostly about money.... He was really upset when I spent money on a new outfit to interview in, but... I had to do something! I started looking for work a month before graduation because I knew I'd lose my job in the library, but no one wants to hire a fresh grad with 'no experience' so... I don't know. I felt really good about the last few interviews but they all told me they wanted someone who was 'more seasoned,' and I just thought, maybe, if I looked like I was a little more put together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get fighting,\" Lyzette said, taking another bite of her pie. \"But there's a long road between fighting about money and fucking another woman in your living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you know... I mean... we were fighting... and we weren't really having sex very often,\" Gwen said, having a hard time looking up from her coffee. \"He was staying out late a lot with his friends. He came home at two or three in the morning and he always smelled like smoke and beer... it just... he'd just crawl into bed and start snoring,\" she said, sounding defeated. \"When I got up, he was already gone for work... and when he came home after work... we fought until he'd storm out of the house. Some nights... some nights he never came home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm guessing he was finding someone else to get his rocks off with when he wasn't coming home,\" Lyzette said, shaking her head. \"You're way too nice for a guy like that. Seriously. He's treating you like a door mat and walking all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Gwen said with a deep sigh. \"I just wish... I don't know... I just wish I knew what to do now. I can't go home... I think I can get a hotel for the next few nights with the money from tonight, but Lacy said we need to get outfits and I don't have any money for food and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey,\" Lyzette interrupted, reaching out across the table and taking one of Gwen's hands in her own. \"One step at a time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's a lot,\" Lyzette nodded. \"Um...\" she started, then hesitated. The whole time Gwen had been explaining her problem, Lyzette had been thinking on solutions... what she could do to help this poor young girl out. She knew that she was supposed to be living the life of a care free eighteen year old, but she just couldn't turn off the part of her brain that had been a stripper for a long time and had seen dozens of girls just like Gwen who needed a little help to avoid sliding rapidly down the slippery slope from stripper to prostitute. \"I think,\" she said slowly. \"I think I might have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Gwen said, looking up from her coffee at last. Her green eyes were puffy from crying, but for the first time tonight, there was a glimmer of something else.. something... hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... for tonight at least... I think there's space in my room at home. You can crash with me instead of trying to find a hotel. And that's one less night to worry about,\" she said, testing the waters gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lisa, you don't have to... I mean, um... it would... it would really help. Are you sure you won't get in trouble? I don't want to cause problems with your parents,\" she said, hesitating and hoping that it was something Lisa had already thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's where the other part comes in...\" Lyzette said, taking a deep breath of her own before plunging forward. \"I think we should move in somewhere together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Gwen said, sitting back in her chair a little stunned. \"Um... like, roommates? We, um, we just met, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, we just met... but... we're going to be working together, and, um, we're going to be working together in a place where we're both naked anyway.... And, well, I think we can help each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help each other?\" Gwen asked. \"How so? I mean... I don't have the money to get a place... I don't have anything. I've been living off of Gary's money for the past month and so... I just don't know how I could help you at all. I mean... you dance great, you've got money and family and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I need someone who can help me out for a little while,\" Lyzette said, cutting Gwen off. \"Look, um... I talked to Lacy after you left the back room. She asked me to help you with your dancing, and I will!\" Lyzette added the last bit with a rush. \"But she also told me she thought you'd make a lot more money than me once you got better at dancing because your, um.. well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacked?\" Gwen asked with a self deprecating laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. So, she asked me to sign on for a year, and if I promised to do that, and to help you, and Natalie too, with your dancing... she'd pay for a set of implants for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-M-G, are you serious?\" Gwen asked. \"Are you going to do it? I mean, really going to do it? Do you... um, do you want to be a, um... a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stripper?\" Lyzette asked, raising an eye brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I guess. Do you really want to be a stripper that badly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why wouldn't I?\" Lyzette asked. \"I mean, not forever, you now? But if I could pay for school instead of taking a bunch of loans? Besides,\" she said, cupping her already augmented breasts, knowing that they looked much more humble to Gwen. \"I could use a little help here anyway...So, I figured it would be nice to have a friend to live with while I'm recovering... I can help you start on your dance and you can take care of me after surgery.... and then, we can work the hell out of that club until neither of us is depending on someone else's money! So, what do you think?\" She asked. \"Roomies?\"</span></div></div>",

We should do it. We should totally do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Lyzette said with a sigh of relief. Now all she had to do was figure out how to make all of that happen. She had a few thousand dollars, yes... and she was sure that would cover a few months rent and a deposit... and that way she could enjoy her vacation without worrying about living with Lisa's family... after all, being eighteen should be about having a chance to get out on her own... live life a little wild... and parent's just weren't at the top of her list of things to enjoy about being young again. \"I think my folks should be asleep by now. You can crash in my room tonight and tomorrow we go apartment hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, deal,\" Gwen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that, both women were tip-toeing upstairs, high heeled shoes in hand, working to make sure they didn't disturb Lisa's family. Slipping quietly into the bedroom, Lyzette looked about for the best place to set up a sleeping bag... or extra blankets, or... anything really. Some kind of reasonable space for Gwen to crash. She hadn't counted on just how small Lisa's room really was though. Between the bed, desk, vanity, and all of the odds and ends, there wasn't a great deal of space available. \"So, um,\" she whispered. \"I think the best idea is probably... if you want to just crash in bed with me? Sorry, it's a really small room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Gwen whispered back, pulling off her shirt and wiggling out of the spray painted on skirt she'd worn to the strip club. \"It's way better than sleeping in my car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of her own outfit, Lyzette debated about looking for a sleep shirt, but gave up on the idea fairly quickly. She hated sleeping in anything much more than a pair of panties, and even if she hadn't been feeling the weight of her enhanced chest since the change at the Nexus, she didn't feel comfortable trying to sleep in anything too confining. Dropping her bra to the ground she slipped under the blankets and held them up for Gwen to join her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa?\" Gwen whispered from inches away as she slid into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Lyzette asked, already beginning to drift off as the excitement of the day wore off, letting her feel just how long she'd been up and how much she'd done today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You're the best.\"</span></div></div>",

Outside, only the dimmest of early morning light was filtering in through Lisa's bedroom window. Inches from her face, gently lit by the early morning light, she found the twin swells of Gwen's DDs, her pert nipples pointed almost directly at Lyzette. During the night, both women had rolled to face each other and pulled close to each other. One of Gwen's arms draped across Lyzette's trim waist and Lyzette found her own hand resting on the other woman's gently curving hip. Between Lyzette's thighs, Gwen had slid her leg up, her own thigh resting against Lyzette's moist slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette leaned forward, just enough to bring her lips within a breath of Gwen's pert nipple. Slowly, as if in a dream, she parted her lips and reached out with her tongue, swirling it around Gwen's nipple before pulling into her own mouth.  The mists of sleep began to fall away as she felt heat building between her legs, her nether lips further moistening as the lips of her mouth worked at Gwen's nipple. <i>What am I doing...?</i> she thought, enough sleep finally falling away for her to begin to think clearly. Pulling back, she tried to ignore the wetness between her legs as she looked for a way to disentangle herself from Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Gwen moaned in a soft whisper. \"Don't stop,\" she said, tracing her fingers up Lyzette's  back and pulling her back towards her own heaving bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, tentatively, Lyzette reached out again with her tongue, teasing at Gwen's erect nipple before looking up at the other woman's face. \"Like that?\" she asked, emboldened by the smile she saw on Gwen's lush lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but, up here,\" Gwen said, drawing Lyzette's chin up towards her own face, parting her lips for a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette needed no further prompting and moments later her tongue was darting back and forth, chasing Gwens tongue around her mouth. Gwen reached down, guiding Lyzette's hand towards her full DD breast before twining her fingers in Lyzette's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the soft morning light, the two women lost themselves in exploration of each other's bodies. Gwen, driven by loss and a desire to connect to another person the way she'd once connected to her lost boyfriend and Lyzette, lost in a swirl of feelings and emotions and hormones that she'd never experienced before. Oh, she'd done stage acts with other women before, sure, but for the first time in her life, Lyzette was in the arms of another woman, kissing, caressing and caring about nothing other than her own pleasure and the pleasure of the woman in her arms. There was no audience to put on a show for, just the two of them... and it was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaylight had broken before the two women collapsed into each other's arms, sweating slightly and completely sated. Sleep came for them both soon after, pulling them back into the soft world of dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My god,</i> Lyzette thought as she drifted off to sleep. <i>Lisa must be gay! It wasn't in any of her paperwork... I wonder if she even knows? This vacation just keeps getting more interesting....</i></span></div></div>",

Her dreams had been odd and tumbled, full of visions of her and Gwen. Dreams of her making out with Gwen on stage. Dreams of her and Gwen buying a house and settling down together... even a dream of both of them being pregnant at the same time. And in all of her dreams, even the dreams of them as a married couple, she was her eighteen year old self. She kept hearing it from Gwen over and over again in her dreams: 'I love you Lisa.' When Lyzette woke, her mind spun for a moment, and for a few seconds, she had a hard time remembering if she was Lyzette or Lisa. \"I liked it,\" she said. \"I liked it a lot. I just... did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than anything,\" Gwen said with a smile. \"I've never been with a girl before,\" she added, blushing. \"Is it always this good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't really know,\" Lyzette said with a shy grin. \"You're my first girlfriend. I just... I just want to make sure that this is really what you want. That this isn't something that just happened because you broke up with your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Gwen said, biting her lip and pouting slightly. The look was so adorably cute and vulnerable that it was all Lyzette could do to keep from wrapping her arms around the other woman. \"I think it's something we can try, right?\" she said at last. \"I mean... I need to find a place and you want to find a place and... we can try it and see if we like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Lyzette said, leaning in to kiss Gwen lightly. \"No plans, just see where it goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So, now what?\" Gwen asked. \"Your mom knocked earlier to say she was going to be out late tonight and that there was money on the table for dinner by the way.

Gwen's healthy double d's pushed up against the relatively small ones Lyzette now, but it felt great to her anyways. She had one hand around Gwen's back, pulling them close together. Their faces were practically touching, as they slept soundly. That is, until they were both surprised by someone walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's dad walked into the room, startling them both. The two were taken by surprised, quickly separating themselves and covering up with the blanket. Luckily Lisa's dad didn't see how close they were together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry\" He started. \"I didn't realize you had a friend over\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad. I told you to knock before you enter!\" Lyzette made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, jeez.\" He replied. \"You know, this wouldn't happen if you moved out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm going to move out today, we're going to go look at apartments today. Now get out of my room and stop checking out Gwen.\" Lyzette told him. Embarrassed, he left the room promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that\" Lyzette told Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" Gwen said. \"It's nothing a little kiss won't solve\" She said, moving her face close to Lyzette's once again. The two girls locked lips for the second time, tongues dancing between their two mouths. Lyzette massaged Gwen's chest, Gwen returning the favor by toying with Lyzette's bottom. After they were done, they decided to head out and look for apartments. Lyzette headed to Lisa's, now her, closet to look for something to wear. Lisa's clothes tended to be more conservative. She elected to pick out a thong from the closet, as well as a push up bra to improve her assets. Out came a pair of short shorts and a tank top, and some flats to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might need to borrow something...\" Gwen said. She kept her own underwear on, but needed some clothes, all she had was her outfit from yesterday. Lyzette gave her the only thing she thought would fit her, a loose crop top. It got hung up on her boobs and showed off her tummy, but it covered well enough. A pair of shorts finished off the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set off for apartment hunting. After many unsuccessful attempts, they found a good one and signed for it. They decided they should sleep there tonight.</span></div></div>",

I would be all for it if it didn\u2019t mean a few weeks out of commission,\u201d replied Lyzette, omitting the fact that she wouldn\u2019t be in Lisa\u2019s body for too long. \u201cWell, hold that thought. What about you, Annabelle? Are you up for this offer?\u201d asked Gwen. \u201cOh, absolutely, count me in!\u201d exclaimed Annabelle with a giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s great, head on over to Tammy and she\u2019ll deal with all the paperwork for you. Annabelle happily left Lyzette and Lacy as she headed to get signed up for her new contract and her new enhancements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow, I know you don\u2019t want to go through the lengthy recovery, but I guess you\u2019re interested in the job?\u201d asked Lacy. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m interested in the plastic surgery too, but I just wish it didn\u2019t mean that long of a recovery,\u201d you explained.  \u201cI might have a solution for that, but it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t offer to anyone because of the expense. You really do move like a pro and I\u2019m certain that with the right enhancements you could be one of our top earners and you\u2019re so young that you\u2019ll have a long enough career to make it worthwhile for all of us,\u201d Lazy said. Lyzzete was aware that she wasn\u2019t in her original body and her stay in it was only temporary, but this was a great opportunity and from the way she was sure the real Lisa wouldn\u2019t complain, \u2018after all, I\u2019m just trying to make this body hotter.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sounds great, but I haven\u2019t heard of anything like this before. What\u2019s the catch?\u201d Lyzette asked; not quite as eager and gullible as her apparent age would suggest. \u201cWell, Iike I said, this would be a very expensive affair. The process is carried out by Dr. Watts as well, it\u2019s a pretty new process. It\u2019s an in-and-out procedure and with only about a day\u2019s worth of recovery. Having said that, instead of a year contract, this would be 5 year deal and we would want you to make more dramatic enhancements in order to make more bang for our buck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDramatic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I love the innocent look you have going on, and we can certainly play off of that in your sets, but a nice pair of at least E cups would be a definite enhancement, a fuller ass would bring a nice balance and maybe we could plump up those lips just a bit. Some nice tattoos would also go a long way. Are you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette tried to think about it for a second, she knew it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do while in someone else\u2019s body, but just the thought of starting her career from scratch was getting her excited. \u201cI\u2019m in, I\u2019m definitely in.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyzette tried to shrug off the jitters she felt as she walked into Dr. Watt's office. It was hardly the first time she'd gone to see a plastic surgeon after all! Still, the fight she'd gotten into with Lisa's mom last night was echoing in her mind as she changed into the hospital robe that was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had started with Mrs. Hale laying into her about coming home late and not texting when she was going to be home or where she was.... and Lyzette hadn't handled it well. It was so similar to how her father had treated her when she'd gone gone out with friends or a boyfriend... and it was a large part of why she'd run away from home when she wasn't much older than Lisa. Which is why she'd started stripping to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Lyzette had stomped upstairs and shut herself into Lisa's room rather than deal with it. This was her vacation, damn it, and she'd be damned long before she let some washed up house wife ruin it. Thankfully, she'd found solace in venting on Lisa's Facebook page and several of Lisa's friends had been sympathetic to 'parent drama,' including Lisa's studly ex-boyfriend who seemed to be angling for a way back into her good graces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa?\" A warm, jovial voice called along with a knock at the door, preceding the entrance of a smiling and well groomed man in his early to mid forties. \"I'm Dr. Watts,\" he said, extending a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa,\" Lyzette said after only the briefest hesitation. \"Lisa Hale,\" she finished, shaking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lisa, I got a call from Lacy this morning and she said that you were interested in having some fairly extensive work done, but that you were worried about healing and recovery time. So, why don't we start with: Why the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Lyzette said slowly, trying to find words that wouldn't reveal the fact that she really just didn't want to spend half her vacation recovering from surgery. \"I leave for my senior class trip to Mexico in a few days,\" she said. \"So, the timing is kind of bad... and this is my last year of summer break before college, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see,\" Dr. Watts said, jotting down a few notes. \"I can completely understand. But, in some ways, doing this early in your summer vacation is exactly the best thing you can do. After all, you'll have time be completely healed before you start classes in the fall, and none of your college friends will think anything of the 'new you' because they'll be meeting you for the first time with your surgery already complete. But, I can certainly understand wanting to be in 'bikini body' shape for your class trip... so, I think I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" Lyzette said, excited that the doctor was buying into her story. \"Lacy said something about a way to only need a day to recover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, there is that,\" Dr. Watts said, pausing for a moment. \"Look, Lisa,\" he continued, setting down his clip board. \"I don't want you to get into something you don't want to do. The procedure that you're talking about is expensive, and Lacy has some pretty firm terms about what she wants to see happen if we're going to do it that way. I don't want you to get anything done that you don't personally want, so if you want something more modest then just speak up and we'll do things the old fashioned way, after you get back from Mexico.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" Lyzette said. \"I... um, well, Lacy said that she'd want me to be 'at least' an E-cup if we did this... and... and that got me wondering just how big this procedure can do. I mean, I've, um, I've read a lot about dancers going really big and everything I've read says it takes months or years to get really big with two or three surgeries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with traditional medicine, yes. I'm going to be honest, this procedure is very new, and very expensive. Not many people are able to afford it which makes it very exclusive. But, essentially, the only limits are what you're willing to accept and what we can bend the laws of physics into allowing to happen, so... how big do you have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think... something really big,\" Lyzette said, allowing her excitement to show through. \"I mean, I don't want to just be a dancer,\" she added. \"I want to be a model. Well, a glamour model. Pinup style. You know... I've always looked at models like Jordan Carver and Denise Milani. That's the kind of look I want... Boobs that everyone stares at, and cleavage that makes it hard for guys to look me in the eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Dr. Watts said, picking his clip board back up. \"Well, why don't you strip out of that hospital gown and let's have a look at what we've got to work with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Lyzette slipped out of the crinkly hospital gown, smiling to herself as the doctor examined her already augmented breasts and made notes about a 'smaller than average' teenage bust. Every time something small like that occurred it reminded her of the awesome power of The Nexus to make people see things that weren't really there and treat the absurd as though it were normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said, straightening up from a close examination of her breasts. \"It's going to take a lot of work, but I think we can come out with some very impressive assets for you. Now, why don't you turn around and let's see what we can do about a backside to match,\" he continued. As Lyzette turned, he poked at her buttocks and murmured in appreciation. \"You've got excellent muscle definition here... but distinctly lacking in volume. We can adjust that too,\" he added, making additional notes. \"Now, Lacy said something about your lips and I see what she means... since you said pinup, I think we can do a little bit to the shape of your lips to give you a better pout... just the sort of thing to leave men drooling without being so much that you've got permanent 'duck face.' So, what do you think? I've got the paperwork right here if you want to move forward, or, if you want to take it home and think about it, you can do that too. There's no need to rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't need to think about it,\" Lyzette said, eagerly grabbing the form. If she was lucky, she could even find a way to do some photo shoots while she was on vacation. She'd always wanted to try being a glamour model instead of a private dancer... it felt... more significant.  In her day to day life, a few dozen men might jerk off to the thought of touching her body on any given day... but those models had thousands of fans... and that was the sort of thing she wanted to try to experience, even if only briefly. Dashing a signature on the paperwork without bothering to read it, she turned back to Dr. Watts and asked: \"So, when can you squeeze me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" he said, taking the paperwork and pen back from her. \"Nine AM sharp. I'll write you a prescription for some meds that I want you to take when you get up in the morning, and you'll need to have someone drive you here and back home. We're going to be doing a lot of work on you, so expect that it's going to take a six or more hours. When we're done, you'll be pretty out of it until you wake up the day after. But, by then, your 'recovery' will be complete and you can go on with life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Lyzette asked, reaching out and taking the prescription that Dr. Watts handed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, except for the shopping you'll need to do for a wardrobe to contain your new sexy shape... yes, that's it. I'll leave you to get dressed,\" Dr. Watts said, standing to leave. \"If you have any questions between now and tomorrow morning,\" he added. \"Just call the number on that prescription.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you doctor,\" Lyzette said, standing to shake his hand without bothering to put on clothing. \"I can't wait.\"</span></div></div>",

She could just imagine the gaze of countless people on her new curves and it was the most excited she had been about anything in a long time. She called up Lacy and she arranged to have one of her people at the club drive Lyzette, after all, she wanted to make sure everything went well with the new investment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette was there at Nine AM on the dot. The medication Dr. Watts had prescribed for her had given her a tingling feeling that had spread all over her body as she got to his office. \u201cWell, are you ready dear?\u201d asked Dr. Watts when Lyzette got to his office. \u201cYes doctor, I\u2019ve haven\u2019t thought about anything else since I left you yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get started in a moment, but I wanted to let you know that I spoke with Lacy after your examination yesterday. She is really glad that you\u2019re so excited about going so big, but she wanted to make some changes to what we discussed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh? What changes?\u201d asked Lyzette with some worry in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing mayor dear, she wanted us to go a little plumper on your lips than we originally discussed. She wants you to have \u2026 and these are her words, not mine, \u2018cock sucking lips,\u2019 \u201c he informed Lizette with  a hint of blush across his cheeks. Lizette brushed her lips absentmindedly, \u201c I \u2026 uh \u2026 I hadn\u2019t thought of going that big with my lips, Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear, you will look amazing, I will make sure of that, and Lucy has final say on the procedure and how big we go as per the contract. She just wants you to have a real pornstar body,\u201d he explains. That alarmed you a little bit, but before you could say anything about it, the tingling sensation had become very intense, \u201cI see it\u2019s time to begin, don\u2019t worry dear, you\u2019re in good hands, you will love your new body.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several hours later, Lyzette's eyes fluttered open only to be greeted by darkness and the feeling of something across her eyes. \"Mmmm,\" she moaned softly, still feeling the after effects of the sedation. She felt... a little drowsy, and mentally, a bit... foggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake,\" a soft woman's voice said. \"Hold on, the doctor wanted to be here when you wake up. I'll be right back with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling back into the hospital bed, Lyzette tried to take stock of how she felt. For the first time since she had stepped into Lisa's life, her chest felt.. heavy. Not sore and stretched like she'd felt after her own last surgery, just... heavy. Her face felt odd... her lips felt swollen and she had a hard time keeping them pressed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there's my Star patient,\" Dr. Watts said warmly as he entered the room. \"How are you feeling Lisa? Any pain or discomfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Lyzette managed to say, feeling very dehydrated as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Dr. Watts said as he picked up something that rattled slightly. \"I'm going to give you an ice cube. You just suck on this for a few moments while we get you ready for your reveal. I promise, you'll be amazed at the results.\" Moving around beside her, Dr. Watts began to unwind the bandages that covered her eyes. Strictly speaking,t hey hadn't been necessary, but he'd wanted to ensure that he was present when she got her first look at herself. \"I'll help you out of bed in a moment to get a look at the changes below the neck,\" he said as he pulled out a mirror, \"but I thought you'd like to see your face first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Lyzette gasped in surprise. She'd gotten used to looking at a reflection of a more youthful self since renting Lisa's life, but the face that looked back at her in the mirror had changed in more ways than just the shape of her lips! The lips themselves were impressive. They were very full and lush with a pouting lower lip and a well defined 'cupid's bow' upper lip. It was her eyes though, that truly grabbed her attention. Trailing back from her left temple and cheek bone towards her hairline, nearly a dozen small stars had been tattooed in a soft, feminine pattern. A similar pattern flowed down her neck on the right side, from just behind her ear to where it vanished beneath the blankets that covered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tattoos?\" Lyzette asked, a bit surprised. They were beautiful, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the artist that Lacy sent over really did an excellent job,\" Dr. Watts said. \"You'll see the rest in a moment. Here, I'm going to ask you to keep your eyes closed and we'll help you up and over to a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding out of the hospital bed, Lyzette was amazed at the feeling of weight on her chest and the jiggle from her ass as she walked across the floor with her eyes screwed tightly shut. How big had he made her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can look now,\" Dr. Watts said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, Lyzette's plumped lips parted in amazement as her jaw dropped. When she'd first seen her reflection in the mirror after taking on Lisa's life she had seen a vision of herself that was more girlish than womanly in her curves, but had a pleasantly fit and perky body. She'd been cute in a very 'girl next door' kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the mirror now was something very different. The breasts were the first thing Lyzette stared at, after all, they had been what started this. She'd expected something large and spherical... after all, most fake breasts that got large always wound up like that. But that wasn't what she had. Instead, she had breasts that, while they dominated her torso, they hung in a way that could almost be called natural, though they were far too perky for their size. Her reflection's new orbs dwarfed Lyzettes own enhanced chest, touching each other in the center and spilling out to the sides in a way that showed they were large enough to be seen from behind her. \"How big...?\" Lyzette asked as she placed her hands beneath the curve of her new endowments. She hefted them, feeling their weight and watching the incredibly deep valley of cleavage they formed as she squeezed them together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30HH,\" Dr. Watts said proudly. \"It took quite a bit of doing. About half of your new breast volume is actually natural breast tissue, replicated from your own breast cells,\" he added. \"That's part of the new procedure. At this point, even if we removed the implants, you'd only go down to about a DD. The reason we didn't do more with natural breast tissue is to give you a shape and projection that's difficult for breasts of your new size to maintain without, um, a bit of help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking lower, Lyzette found yet more tattoos. A trail of stars spilled down her right side, following the curve of her waist before sweeping over her hips. More stars on her left flowed from her freshly shaved pubic area over the hip and, twisting, across her lower back to meat up with the stars on the right. Further inspection of the stars trailing down her left leg, however, was interrupted when she twisted and got a good look at what had once been a perky teenaged butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Lyzette said, dropping her hefty breasts and running her hands over her new bubble butt. It was still firm and perky but now, not only was it larger fuller... it was wider. Even her hips felt like they had become wider to support the enhanced shape of her ass. \"How much of that is me?\" Lyzette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we used a very similar technique to what we did for your breasts,\" he said proudly. \"Much of that is replicated muscle fiber. You're a very fit young woman and we didn't want to leave you with anything that was mostly fatty tissue. There's also a silicone gel implant in each cheek to give you some additional lift and fullness. We worked around the hips as well to give you a fleshed out shape. You can see,\" he said, tracing a hand up her thigh, over her hip and then to the swell of her breast. \"You have a significant hourglass figure without needing to do anything to your already trim waist. We just needed to flesh out the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you did an excellent job Dr. Watts,\" Lacy said from the doorway. \"I have a gift for you Lisa,\" Lacy said, walking into the room. \"I figure you don't have anything that fits anymore,\" she said, producing a small bag from one of the near by shopping centers. \"So, once Dr. Watts had your new measurements, I picked you up a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette reached out and picked up the bag, glancing at the tag attached to the handle. \"Starlight?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's you honey,\" Lacy said with a smile. \"I couldn't think of a better stage name for our new Star performer. And Rick really did a great job with the theme in your tattoos. Honey, with the moves you already have and the body Dr. Watts just gave you, men aren't going to know whether they'd rather fuck your ass, tits or face. Yeah...  Martin's going to love working with you when you're not dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?\" Lyzette asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Lacy said with a smile. \"When Dr. Watts told me that you wanted to get into the world of big bust modeling I called a friend of mine who works with a lot of the local talent. He said he'd need a bit of time to get things started, but you'll have your own XXX website in no time. Your fans are going to be lining up to see you dance live. My cut as your agent is only thirty percent,\" she said draping an arm around Lyzette. \"Play your cards right with this and you'll be too busy living the successful high life to worry about going to college. Now, I'll leave you to get dressed,\" she said. \"Then, we can get down to the club and give those money makers of yours a test drive.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everyone had left the room, before opening the care package, Lyzette did what she'd been afraid to do while everyone was watching her. She looked at her own body without a mirror. Raising her hands to her voluminous breasts, she marveled at the feeling of their size. They were even bigger than they looked in the mirror. The tattoos of stars crossed over the scattering of tattoos she already had as though they had simply been inked on top of the previous designs. Her already womanly ass now jutted in a way that bordered on cartoonish. \"I feel like Jessica Rabbit,\" she said as she looked over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the mirror, she was greeted by a vision of the world's bustiest teen model... or at least she was about to be. She was obviously young, fresh, and bursting at the seams with sexy. \"This is just unreal,\" Lyzette said, touching the mirror and watching her inflated lips move as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the bag at last, the first thing Lyzette pulled out was a black lacy thong. Sliding it up her legs, she then turned to inspect her reflection, giggling a little when she realized that the fuller cheeks of her ass swallowed the thong leaving little more than the black lace waistband visible. After that came a matching bra with a staggering five hooks. \"Wow,\" she said, once she had her heaving breasts settled in the gigantic cups. The girl in the mirror just kept getting sexier... already she was beginning to wonder if she'd need to pay a visit to Dr. Watts when she was done with this vacation... if he was capable of results like this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the underwear came a black micro mini skirt that stretched across the full cheeks of her ass and barely managed to be decent when she was standing. The scoop necked tank top that went with it set off the whole look in a deep emerald green while exposing a tremendous amount of her new cleavage. A pair of platform heels a touch over 4\" tall completed the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what else is in here,\" Lyzette said, reaching back into the bag. Beneath the clothing she found a box containing three very realistic dildos of increasing size and underneath them, a similar box of butt plugs, also in increasing size. A note was attached: <i>\"You'll want to start now and work your way up to the big ones.\"</i> \"Lacy wasn't kidding when she said 'porn star' lips... I wonder how XXX this website is going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking the sex toys away, Lyzette turned one last time to admire the reflection of the busty teenager in the mirror. Bending over she pressed her breasts together to create a jaw dropping view down her shirt and blew a kiss at the mirror. \"Oh yeah,\" she said with a large smile on her plumped up lips. \"Time to hit the stage and make it rain,\" she said, turning to the door. She wasn't even a week into her vacation and already she was on her way to living the kind of life she wished she'd been able to create for herself years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf things kept going like this, it would be hard to go back to her own life. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay Lisa,\" Martin Vin said, adjusting one of the studio lights to fall more directly on Lyzette. \"We're going to start with some really basic glamour shots with the short shorts and bikini top. I know this is your first time, but just relax and have fun with it. We're just looking to build up a good set of stock photos for your website, banner ads, things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Lyzette said, looking around the studio as she took her place in front of the lights. \"How's this?\" she asked, striking a sexy pose, bent forward to give Martin a good shot at her breasts as the bikini top struggled to keep her new 30HH breasts from falling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been three days since Lyzette had gotten out of surgery and they'd been an incredibly eventful rush of activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd left Dr. Watts clinic, she'd gone directly to her debut at Lacy's club... and the debut had been every bit as amazing as she'd hoped it would be. It was a weeknight, and the crowd was a little smaller than the club was capable of hosting, but that had worked out for the better. Her first set had been a little awkward. She'd nearly fallen half a dozen times as her chest shifted significantly more than she was used to. The last stumble had nearly sent her sprawling into the lap of a customer in the front row! But she'd gotten the hang of herself by the third set and that was when the crowd really started building anyway. By the end of the night she'd walked out with more than enough cash to start replacing Lisa's wardrobe with things more suited to her new body and lifestyle and Lyzette was looking forward to a shopping spree with the extra cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she'd gotten back to Lisa's home. Elizabeth, Lisa's mother, had been waiting up in the living room when Lyzette stumbled through the door at three in the morning and if she'd been angry about the late hour, the combination of plastic surgery and tattoos had put her over the top. They'd fought and it got loud enough to wake Lisa's siblings who'd been equally stunned when they saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Martin said, bringing Lyzette back to the present as he snapped several photos. \"Let's get a few with you leaning back on the chair over there,\" he said pointing. \"Really pull your shoulders back and push your chest forward....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight with Lisa's mom had ended with Lyzette storming back outside shouting \"I'm an adult and <i>it's my life!</i>\" which might not have been the best thing to say, but it had felt so much like the fights she had with her own family that she couldn't keep it bottled up. She'd headed for down town and a hotel, figuring she could crash for the night and figure out what to do next in the morning when her cell phone started ringing off the hook. When she saw it was Lisa's mother, she'd very nearly ignored it but she'd answered anyway, and in the end, she was glad she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of more yelling or demands that she come back home, Elizabeth Hale started with a sobbing apology. She felt like she must have failed some how and she just wanted her little girl to come home so she could understand. When Lyzette had walked back into the Hale house, both of Lisa's siblings had gone to bed and Elizabeth had brought out a bottle of wine. \"If you're old enough for... for that, then you're old enough to have a glass with me and talk... like two women,\" she'd said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Martin said, standing up. \"Why don't you go ahead and take the top off and we'll do a few shots with you holding your tits. Make sure to keep your nipples covered if you can. Then we'll do a few of you lying down and from behind... just teasing right now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Lyzette said, reaching up and unlacing the bikini top. She didn't hurry to cover herself, she was used to being naked in front of people, but some how... this felt a little different. It felt... edgier. Cameras aren't allowed in the clubs... but these photos would become fodder for countless men to get off to... and that feeling made her feel more empowered and sexy than stripping on stage ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Elizabeth had stayed up late that night... they'd finished off an entire bottle of wine before the sobbing was done. The next day, they'd gone out shopping together as a mother and daughter. While Lyzette had been planning to splurge on all sorts of naughty outfits, she'd actually found it to be more rewarding to enjoy a mother / daughter outing. Her own mother still wouldn't speak to her, but Elizabeth, while she was still clearly confused by the sudden transformation, was trying to understand and be supportive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's do a full nude,\" Martin said. \"Not too many of these, and legs together, we're not giving up everything yet. Again, think glamour, not really porn. We'll get there soon enough,\" he added as he watched Lyzette shimmy out of the ultra short shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette still wasn't sure if she would spend her entire vacation living with the Hales. She'd talked to Lisa's mom about moving out and getting an apartment so she didn't corrupt the kids, but Elizabeth wasn't hearing any of it. She wanted her to stay home where it was safe... and where she could keep an eye on her. Part of Lyzette wanted to rebel further. It was, after all, her vacation, and parents cramped her style a bit. Still, it was hard to walk out on parents as nice as Lisa's mother was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Martin said, putting away his camera. \"You did great Lisa. People are going to be all over 'Starlight's' page, just clamoring for a chance to see more of those tits of yours. I'll see you back in a few days, bring plenty of toys. We'll do a set that's mostly masturbation and stripping until I can line up some other talent to go further with you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great,\" Lyzette said smiling. \"I'm supposed to be going on my senior class trip soon... can we do that before I leave?\" she asked. \"I could use the spending money...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure,\" Martin said with a smile. \"I'll tell you what,\" he added. \"If you've got any girl friends that you'd like to bring with you... I could use more young talent. People in the 'barely legal' category always bring in some decent money. I'd toss you a bonus for anyone you bring with you, double if they'll do girl on girl with you that day. Sound reasonable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Lyzette said, wondering if Lisa had any friends who she could talk into it. After all, you never knew until you tried....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was nearly five in the morning when Lisa walked into Lyzette's bedroom in her high rise apartment. \"Oh god, finally,\" she said, kicking off the six inch spiked heals with clear platforms and running her toes through the plush carpet. Walking across the carpet she dropped her purse, stuffed full of hundred and even thousand dollar bills as she made a beeline for Lyzette's opulent bathroom and a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight's client's had been CEOs and business executives from half a dozen different countries, most of which didn't speak English. Her entire body felt sticky and reeked of liquor after several hours spent serving up champagne body shots to important potential partners of her primary employer. She'd had mouths in her cleavage, mouths on her stomach, the small of her back... anywhere that someone could pour booze on her to drink it off, she'd had booze poured on her. The men had poured as much cash on the floor as they'd poured expensive alcohol on her, much of it in currency she'd have to have converted to US dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the large marble shower, Lisa turned on the hot spray, grateful to at last wash away the feeling of filth that had come with her work tonight. The dancing was never the worst part. That she actually enjoyed. Much of it was similar to dance moves she'd used as a cheerleader if she really thought about it. No, it was the 'working the party' part of the evenings she was coming to hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her third party since taking over Lyzette's life and already she was coming to understand why such a wealthy woman would want to escape her life. Everything that Lisa had heard about strip clubs said that people weren't allowed to touch the dancers, but at private parties, it was a very, very different world. She'd been pulled into laps, fondled, spanked... and the skills she'd gotten from Lyzette didn't stop it from happening... she just stopped things before they went 'too far.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just three more weeks,\" she promised herself as she began to shampoo her long hair, rinsing away the residue of vodka and champagne. \"And at least I get the next few days for some pampering,\" she added. There had been notes in Lyzette's file about salon appointments and in home massage. There had also been a note about being free to engage in 'retail therapy' and she had to admit she was curious about what it would be like to shop for a person like Lyzette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping her breasts, she marveled at how heavy they felt in her hands. They were still her pert, perky B-cups but they pulled at her chest as though they were Lyzette's silicone filled F-cups. \"Bikini shopping,\" Lisa said with a smile. \"There's no way I'm ever going to be this big... so, while I've got them, I might as well see what all the fuss is about. Maybe even get some really naughty tan lines,\" she added with a smirk. \"Three more weeks... and then six more as who knows who. Maybe... maybe when this is over I can take a vacation of my own... rent someone else's life for a little while and let them do my first week or two of classes...that would be nice,\" she finished, turning off the water and wrapping a towel around the bust that reality thought was much larger than it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the steam covered mirror, she saw the reflection of what she could look like a little more than ten years from now. Thinner, fitter and with huge silicone breasts. It wasn't a bad look when she thought about it... and the opulent setting was certainly a bonus to the look. Still, she was glad that she'd be making her way to fame, or at least fortune, on the strength of her mind and education rather than on the size of her tits. Shaking her head at it all she padded across the soft carpet and into Lyzette's master bedroom, collapsing at last on to the soft bed and drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just three more weeks,\" she murmured as sleep pulled her under. \"Three more weeks...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lyzette smiled as she lay back in the warm summer sun. Her newly enhanced breasts strained against the small scraps of material that comprised her bikini top and she knew that by the time this vacation was over she would either have to spend some time tanning topless or go home with very naughty tan lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd spent the first day in Mexico partying with many of Lisa's friends, and she'd found that with her figure, no one at the clubs was inclined to ask her for ID. Everyone assumed she was plenty old enough to drink and do as she pleased. The extra money she'd gotten from the photo shoot had helped her have plenty of cash to blow on skimpy clubbing outfits and scandalous swimwear as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Megan shifted a bit on the blanket, adjusting her top and trying to find a position to relax in that wasn't too hot in the summer sun. \"Aren't you getting a bit warm?\" Megan asked, amazed that her formerly pale friend was doing so well with so much time in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" she said, adjusting her own position on the blanket. \"Do you want to take a dip in the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Megan laughed. \"Not in this suit. I don't know how you manage that skimpy top without falling out, but I swear if I take too deep of a breath in this I'll pop right out! God if my mom could see me in this I think even she would send me back to change. I don't know how I let you talk me into it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were the one complaining that no one was looking at you when you were next to me. I figured that showing a little more skin wouldn't hurt things any. Here, why don't we try the bar over there,\" she said, pointing to a near by stand on the beach. \"I'm sure they've got something to cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, the two women walked delicately across the hot sand towards the small bar. There was already a small crowd of summer vacationers gathered around the stand, many of them Americans but some from further off as well. \"I... I don't know what I want,\" Megan said, staring at the short menu. \"Is a long island iced tea like a normal ice tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette laughed softly. \"Not quite. Here, let's keep to something with lots of crushed ice. Two pina coladas,\" she said to the bar tender, holding up two fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that four,\" a deep male voice said from behind her in a posh British accent. \"On me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, senior,\" the bar tender said, taking the man's money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Lisa and Megan were greeted by the sight of two tall, solidly muscled men with pale skin and dark short hair. \"Thank you,\" Lyzette said warmly, haven half expected someone would buy their drinks for them. \"Does that drink come with a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James,\" the taller of the two said as he extended a hand, taking hers to kiss it gently. \"And this is my brother Erik. You're Americans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're,\" Megan started, only to be cut off by Lyzette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Canadian,\" Lyzette said. \"From Victoria. I'm Lisa, this is Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Erik said with a warm smile. Taking a long pull on his drink he smiled watching the two girls do the same. \"Say, we've got a volleyball net set up a little bit down the beach... you two want to play a game? Say... me and Megan vs you and James?\" he said, addressing the question to Lyzette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Megan said. \"We're not quite dressed for jumping up and down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" Lyzette said with a smile. \"I'm sure they'll be gentleman about any 'wardrobe malfunctions' ... it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect gentlemen,\" James said quickly with a charming smile of his own. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Megan said with a nervous smile. \"I mean... you only live once right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" James said, wrapping an arm around Megan and pointing her in the direction of the net. \"Right over here, it'll be a blast.\"</span></div></div>",

She had had client after client with barely a moment\u2019s respite. Her only chance to rest was on her way from one client to the next. She could certainly understand why the original Lyzette had wanted a vacation. \u2018But I can\u2019t really complain, I had never dreamed off being flown in a private jet or sipping Champaign on my way to a Caribbean island,\u2019 Lisa thought. The stewardess came by to offer her dinner, her menu options as amazingly as they had been throughout her time as Lyzette. She gave the young woman her instructions for the mean and headed to the bathroom. She marveled at the heels on her feet, more expensive than the mortgage on her parent\u2019s house. The dress she had on, a one shoulder, asymmetrical bespoke design was worth enough to make most people do a double take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the bathroom, something worlds away from any airplane bathroom she had ever been in before this experience; no plastic or cheap materials, just wood and the finest things around. The image starting back at her from the mirror was still the most surprising of all the things around her. The stewardess was not much older than her real age, but she felt so much older than her. The woman in the mirror screamed sexuality and class wrapped in a skin tight dress. When she looked down she still saw the body she was used to, but in the mirror she saw a woman with much larger breasts, with the faintest laugh lines around her eyes and a body that would make most men lose all thought of restraint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs exhausted as she felt, she truly enjoyed her current life. She enjoyed the look in the client\u2019s eyes as she walked in, the lavish gifts they regaled her with, the exuberantly expensive clothes and the many wonders of living in Lyzette\u2019s fabulously expensive shows. When it came time to go back to being plain old Lisa she wasn\u2019t sure how she would ever get accustomed to that life again. Maybe she could come up with some arrangement or find a way to rent out her life to more people like Lyzette. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't want you to do too much to her body... I think DDs will be fine on her. Plump up the lips just a little and a little more volume in the ass. I want 'Girl Next Door Sex Pot' not Stripperella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\" he asked the diminutive thirty year old red head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rick is going to take care of the tattoos. For the boobs, since she said busty model, why don't you go ahead and aim for something record breaking? I mean, really knock yourself out. Same for the ass. And really plump up the lips. It should be a look that says 'fuck toy, slightly used,\" she finished with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's going to be your body to go back to when her contract is up,\" Dr. Watts cautioned. \"Are you sure that's what you want to come back to in five years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my body to come back to in five years if she manages to pay back the costs of the procedure,\" Lacy said with a laugh. \"There's no way she's going to manage that, and go to school if she's just stripping. My body has maybe three or four years left in it, even after you work your wonders, and then, unless she's shooting hard core porn, there's no way she's going to make enough to pay off the debt. At that point, I get to keep her body, and everything that I've done with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lacy, that's...\" Dr. Watts started, a little uncomfortable with what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what? I've been sending you girls for the past three years to experiment on. I've made sure they're well managed so they don't make a fuss when they leave. You said you'd perfected your brain transplant technique and that you owed me one when I found a girl who was willing. Lisa signed the paperwork, she's willing. She's accepting a five year contract for a 'total body makeover' with a shape to specify my needs. Well, I need her to have the shape of a thirty year old petite Irish girl with the biggest tits money can buy and lips that demand to suck cock! I want her to be a fat assed, heavily tattooed slut. Since I've already agreed to let you do that to the body I currently own, it should be pretty straight forward to say that the easiest way for you to fulfill my terms was to give her my body as a 'donor.' And I'm willing to sign over my body to her as a willing donation. I spent eight years with my legs spread for Donivan before the fat fuck died and left me that club, and I'll be damned if I let be the story of my life. No one has ever looked at me the way they looked at her tonight. That's what I want. I want my brain in her body, and you're going to make that happen. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Watts sighed deeply before nodding. \"Yes Lacy, absolutely clear.\" Pulling out a syringe he gestured for her to take a seat in a near by wheel chair. \"If you'll have a seat, I can get started on you first before I move your brain into her body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good. And Dr. Watts,\" Lacy said as the drugs began to dim her vision. \"I'm not kidding...  really.... big.... tits....\"</span></div></div>",

Once the two patients had been prepped for the procedures he doubted if he should go ahead with the whole thing or not. Stealing years from Lisa by sticking her mind in the body of another woman, a body modified to be a basically a walking, talking sex dream, did not sit well with his conscience, but in the end, his conscience had little to do with his job in the end. He was not an evil man, he was a scientist, he wanted to further his experiments and Lacy had been a great source of both money and subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the modifications to both bodies had been simple enough. Dr. Watts had pretty much perfected the procedure, he could manipulate tissues, enlarge them, re-shape them and basically do what normal science took months or years to accomplish in a single day. Lisa\u2019s original body had been not been modified by much. The body was certainly sexier, with DD cup breast that were shaped to look natural and with a pleasant bounce and jiggle. The butt had also been enlarged, with a nice, sensuous curve. The lips had been plumped up, but not beyond what nature might have accomplished on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacy\u2019s original body was a different story altogether. Where Dr. Watts had been careful to give Lisa\u2019s body a voluptuous, yet natural look, Lacy\u2019s body was an homage to enhancements. Her boobs were enormous, and easily fit Lacy\u2019s request for \u201crecord breaking\u201d tits. Her boobs were counter-balanced but her ass, which was equally record setting and having taken the liberty of shrinking her waist to give her a truly outrageous hourglass figure. Her assets were the kind that whose curves could be seen from behind. Her lips had been made into something that begged to suck on a long hard phallic item, they were large, plump and well outside the realm of Mother Nature. The tattoo artist, Rick, had done an amazing job, covering her body in highly artistic patterns, stylized and provocative words, seductive designs and intricate designs that wound their way around her body. All that packaged in the petite frame, with long fiery red tresses, emerald green eyes and carefully maintained, flawless skin.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transfer of their minds to the other\u2019s body had been the most complex aspect of the procedure. It took several hours and there was an odd power fluctuation at one point, but everything went according to plan. Dr. Watts wondered how the woman now in Lacy\u2019s body would react to her new situation, \u201cShe signed the papers, I guess she should have read before signing.

I need you to fetch Director Nail. We've got a class two interference with a client. I'm still looking at the damage, but I put our chance at a successful recovery at less than thirty percent. Probably less than twenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" the young intern said, nearly dropping the stack of paperwork he'd been sorting. \"Um... what do I tell her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was already tapping keys, new information flashing on her screen as she ran through the commands. \"Tell her that Lyzette Diamond ran into a Mad Scientist... maybe a latent Techno Wizard and that she's been through a brain transplant. And on your way to her, get Simon. We're going to need his help to get this sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Jack said with a nod before taking off at a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her computer, Kelly started pulling together everything The Nexus could find on Dr. Watts,  this... Lacy woman, and what had taken place. They had a good read on Lyzette's body because the enchantments were still bending reality around it, making it appear that she had the body of young, teenaged Lisa. Kelly could see the mild surgical alterations that had been performed, but those alterations were taking significant strain to allow to co-exist with Lyzette's actual body. Essentially, there were two sets of breast implants along with a significant volume of additional tissue, all contained in the same space, and the magical engines of The Nexus were working overtime to maintain that illusion, much less all of the others it was maintaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, they had a dimmer read on Lyzette's brain. They could see that it had been placed within another body, and that the body it had been placed in was both older than Lisa's and substantially different. There were traces of magic in that body, and not magic that had come from The Nexus. Likely it had been part of whatever this Dr. Watts had done, whether he realized he was using magic or not. And that was dangerous... really dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, talk to me,\" Director Emma Nail said in a commanding voice as she strode into the control room, heels clicking sharply on the floor. Behind her, a comforting older man in robes walked softly into the room, taking his place against a wall and looking impassively at the data on Kelly's screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ma'am,\" Kelly started. \"I think... I think someone tried to steel Lisa's body. I think this woman,\" she said, pulling up Lacy's photo, \"got this man,\" she indicated Dr. Watts, \"to perform a quasi-magical brain transplant. I'm looking at the readings... and we're loosing touch with Lyzette's brain very quickly. The body we've got a much better hold on, but it's taking three times the normal energy to hold the reality bends together. And, that's not all,\" she said, pulling up even more screens. \"It's causing strain to maintain Lisa in Lyzette's life. The connection to Lyzette's skills is getting weaker. Within a few days, I don't know if Lisa will be able to keep living Lyzette's life. I mean, we can keep her in the life at that point, but she won't have access to Lyzette's knowledge anymore to live it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fuck,\" Emma said sourly. \"Options?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... we could send a team to capture all three of them... that is, Dr. Watts, Lacy and Lyzette. Bring them back to The Nexus and try to get Dr. Watts to put them back like they were. Or... I guess, if he won't do it... we could have someone take on Dr. Watts life and skills, then do it,\" she finished. \"But if anything goes wrong... people could die. I don't know how risky that brain transplant was. If it can't be reversed... I don't know what we can do. If it was a one time process, we could wind up killing Lyzette and Lacy both, and stranding Lisa in Lyzette's life without her skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds horribly risky,\" Emma said, pursing her lips. \"But if we do it that way, we can put everyone back as they should be in the end, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. I think that Lisa would have to keep the surgical alterations to her body, but she'd get her body and life back. Lyzette would get her body back and the alterations would be transferred to Lisa. Then we just dump Lacy and Dr. Watts and keep them the hell away from us. Add them to the watch list for clients who might run into them... or figure out a way to hand them over to the authorities. I'm sure they're guilty of other crimes we could expose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another option,\" Simon said, coming off the wall at last. \"We could smooth out reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Simon?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We push the bends back to their sources. We force reality to age Lisa's body and to youthen Lyzette's We remove the skills from Lyzette's brain and give them to Lisa. We make the transfer between the two of them a reality. Lyzette will have to live with the consequences of what she did to Lisa's life and we reconcile with Lisa for damages done. She can continue on as a contractor, renting out Lyzette's life if she'd like, or we can see if we can find her another life if someone would like to trade permanently with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has something like that ever been done?\" Kelly asked. \"I've never heard of anything like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been done before,\" Simon said gravely. \"Six times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would think that kind of thing would be a very profitable service Simon,\" Director Nail mused. \"Why hasn't the board given us a green light to start selling that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Simon said. \"The last time it was done, it scrambled everyone involved. The lead Wizard, Daniel, wound up with the body of an overweight middle age housewife and the life of a womanizing stock broker. He forgot everything he knows about magic but he makes a mean batch of chocolate chip cookies these days... which somehow results in an endless stream of beautiful young women sleeping with him. Most of his magical knowledge wound up with the housewife and the stock broker has been desperately searching for a man to settle down with and raise a family ever since. It was a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god,\" Kelly murmured.  \"No wonder we haven't tried it since.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be willing to try it for this,\" Simon said. \"This way, at least Lisa gets a whole life to live, and so does Lyzette. They may not be the lives they wanted, but  no one dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no one gets made whole,\" Kelly said. \"If things work with my plan, we have a chance to make everything right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call Emma,\" Simon said simply. \"What do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

Since you basically receive your money from us you could consider us your employer, and Nexus takes good care of both, their employees and their clients. But in this case the client fucked up. And we don't accept unrecoverable damage to our employees because of careless clients.\" <br>\r\n\"What Dr. Simon Fasler wants to say with that is, you will be the one to decide on the course of action we take from her on.\" Ms. Knox explained, then she said:<br>\r\n\"Screen!\" and a big screen appeared behind her.<br>\r\nSimon got closer to the screen and went through some data till he turned around again and looked into Lisa's eyes that looked for him like Lyzette's. <br>\r\nThen he threw a picture of Lisa's body as it looked now in A3 on the screen and said: \"That's your body now.\", then he threw a picture of Lacy's body, currently inhabited by Lyzette on the screen \"That's the body with which the swap was performed.\" <br>\r\nLisa was shocked. She has always been the natural type. She has also been always pretty decent, the few days she had to live as a stripper hadn't changed anything of that.<br>\r\n\"S-so\" Lisa said, still with the horror written on her face \"this (she pointed at Lacy's \"enhanced\" body) would be my body if I return Lyzette's life to her...?\" she then read through the data of the body shown below the picture \"and she's 30?! I will be 30?!\" Lisa now went from horrified to panicking. <br>\r\n\"Please calm down\" Kelly said \"we wouldn't have called you here if we hadn't have a solution..kind of..\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of solution could there be for...this?!\". <br>\r\n\"Actually there are two....solutions...if you want to calm them that\" Simon said<br>\r\n\"The first one would be the usual one since it comforts both parties, the second one is...less conventional..but in this case it might be more to your liking.\" <br>\r\n\"What would those options be?\" Lisa asked now a bit calmer again.<br>\r\nThis time Emma Nail took the word, <br>\r\n\"Option 1: we gather Lacy, Lyzette and the doctor who performed the brain swap and make him reverse the swap. Then we will break up the rental, you get fully paid and Lyzette is charged a fee for breaking the contract. <br>\r\nIn the end you are in your body, but you still have the 'enhancements'. <br>\r\nOption 2: we make a permanent transfer, you will legally own Lyzette's life. You will gain her age and her skills and the only alterations to your body will be those she has done to herself. We would also keep the eyes open for people who want to have a life like yours so you could swap permanently again on a later occasion. This would also mean that Lyzette from then on owns the life she ruined for you, and she also loses a big deal of skills since they will completely be yours then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a word of consultation, there is a small chance for Lyzette to regain \"her\" body again, but without her skills, her chances are going towards 0!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n\"It's your turn\" Simon added.<br>\r\n\"Decide\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going with...<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nOption 2, this bitch can just go fuck herself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded, Kelly shrugged and Simon didn't show any particular expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, you will supervise the process, get started immediately!\" Ms Nail said <br>\r\n\"Immediately?\" Lisa said confused, \"don't you need Lyzette for the process?\" <br>\r\n\"Not really, the strings were already attached, we are basically ripping out the \"roots\" of her skills and set some of yours free. They will automatically attach to her. So we just need you to make it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n\"Follow me\" Simon said and lead her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Simon appeared again half an hour later it was because...</span></div></div>",

She didn't know that the skills she intended to make the money to pay Lacy back with, were gone by now. The part Lyzette couldn't have noticed though were the change of her body, as she didn't inhabit it anymore. <br>\r\nHer body meanwhile aged back to 18 and lost the implants, but then it got the changes that were accomplished by the magic surgery...and It played out pretty nicely. But for the next five years it was more like Lacy's body and probably even after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was just happy to be more herself again, even though she was never going to be herself again..but maybe she would find a good swap for her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very good dear\" Kelly commented. <br>\r\n\"So,..my name is still Lyzette?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"Should beeee..\" said Kelly while looking through the data \"yeah, you are still Lyzette Diamond, name, job, money, everything\" <br>\r\n\"I have looked into her...my file,\" Lisa said \"her contract is for two more years\", <br>\r\nKelly nodded, <br>\r\n\"What then?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's your decision, you can then sign another contract or do something else, it's your life, and since Miss Lyzette is earning reeally well you are free to do everything you want, after all your salary is close to that of a pro actor\" Simon said.<br>\r\n\"So I could also go to university?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you would have to go to college first...and finish highschool, and that wouldn't be easy either, after all your knowledge of school stuff and your studying skills were one of the things we had to set free..\" Simon explained. <br>\r\n\"That's worrying\" Lisa said \"does that mean I only know stuff that Lyzette knew?\" <br>\r\nKelly and Emma looked at Simon.<br>\r\n\"No,no..no, but everything you HAD to know for school/to pass should be with Lyzette by now..\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Lisa shrugged, \"I will make it work out the way I want somehow\". <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Simon said, \"and don't forget, you can still swap with someone else, there are lots of people who'd be happy to be a prime stripper without having to worry about money\". <br>\r\n\"True\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Lisa said with her cellphone buzzing \"looks like my next client is getting impatient, I thank you a lot for what you have done for me, I won't forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lyzette woke up in Lacy's enhanced body. <br>\r\nLyzette couldn't see anything when she tried to open her eyes but she felt completely different. She could feel tge weight hanging on her chest and her lips and somehow she felt...more used..older..even older than she had felt as Lyzette. <br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she tried to call someone for help. The voice she heard sounded like neither Lisa nor her own.<br>\r\nIt sounded like...Lacy....<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Lyzette wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen someone entered the room.<br>\r\nIt was Dr. Watts.<br>\r\n\"Hello Lisa\" he said with his calm relaxing voice \"I see you are awake.\"<br>\r\n\"Something is strange *cough* with my voice, can you give me a glass of water?\" Lyzette asked. <br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" Dr. Watts said handing her a glass almost immediately. <br>\r\nLyzette thanked him and gulped it down.<br>\r\n\"So, can you now show me the results?\" Lyzette asked, wondering how she still sounded like Lacy.<br>\r\n\"Ohh!...Uhm.. Sure!\" he said sounding nervous as he began taking off the bandages. He knew there was a lot to explain to her and he didn't want to be the one to do that...which was also why, in case \"Lisa\" got angry Lacy had agreed to take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bandages were now completely taken off Lyzette could already see the massive breasts that had exceeded everything she would have imagined. <br>\r\n\"W..which size are..these..\" Lyzette said poking the big breasts she could see clearly, which confused her. <br>\r\n\"38HH\" Dr. Watts said, \"you might want to see everything, there's a full length mirror over there, can you stand up?\" <br>\r\nLyzette was still feeling dizzy but said<br>\r\n\"Sure! If you could lend me a hand\".<br>\r\nDr. Watts did so and soon she was standing infront of the mirror looking at was clearly not originally Lisa's body.<br>\r\n\"I look like a sex toy!\" Lyzette said \"these things are just massive...you could open coconuts with them!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Dr. Watts commented <br>\r\n\"And these lips..talking is like an exercise...and that's not an ass\" she said turning her ass to the mirror \"it's a fridge..and I feel so...old...\"<br>\r\nThen she went completely silent. <br>\r\nDr. Watts got a bit nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she broke the silence she sounded outraged <br>\r\n\"A little plumper?!?!!\" she shouted as Dr. Watts started panicky pressing a small red button \"\"Nothing mayor dear\" you said, what did you do to me I never agreed on this!\" <br>\r\n\"Sh-she will explain to you\" the doctor said while still panickly pressing the button till finally someone opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Watts... you are too soft\" the woman said shaking her head.<br>\r\nBut the person didn't look like Lisa, or an enhanced Lisa to Lyzette's suprise, she looked like an enhanced young Lyzette! <br>\r\n\"Fuck, those guys at nexus must have messed up....even if she stole \"my\" body shouldn't it look like Lisa's body?...no.. Only if I look at her mirror image...but I..she..looks so much young..Fuck, that doesn't matter! She stole my..\" all those thoughts were shooting through Lyzette's brain. <br>\r\nThen she began shouting again:<br>\r\n\"You wicked.. you stole my body!\" <br>\r\n\"No, you gave it to me and I decided to take it! You should have read the paperwork!\" Lacy said \"but don't worry, just 310 150,-$ and you can go back..in 5 years...\"<br>\r\n5 years?!, had Lyzette really dammed Lisa to spend maybe an eternity and at least 5 years in this body?! Those were the questions Lyzette asked herself but she didn't know that the person she had really dammed was herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I advise you to play by the contract now, or you will end up in this body forever.\" Lacy said, pretty sure that there was no way \"Lisa\" could make so much money. \"I will see you at the club once you are back from Mexico, ol' girl. Dr. Watts will make sure you get home or wherever, good luck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette was outraged but also outsmarted, there was nothing she could do right now so she got dressed in clothes that were specially prepared for her and want to get into the car, but after her first step in the high heels she fell over and broke the heel...<br>\r\n\"That means bad news...\" Lyzette though and got into the car without her heels on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you were to step on a scale right now you would weigh about a hundred and eighty pounds. If we were to measure your height, you'd be five inches shorter at 5'2\". As to the tired... Mrs Thompson isn't quite as fit as you are and you're feeling that. She also doesn't get as much sleep as you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa said, adjusting to the strange sensations. All of her body felt heavy, but her chest ached with the weight. \"Why doesn't she get as much sleep? And is there something wrong with her? My chest feels really funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing wrong with her,\" Tina said, helping Lisa to stand up. \"For the next two days, you're going to be Mrs. Wendy Thompson,\" Tina continued, reading information off of the sheet. \"Age twenty nine, wife of Bill Thompson a thirty four year old general contractor. You have three children, Alex, William Jr, and Stephanie, ages five, three and eleven months respectively. That feeling in your chest is an adjustment that will allow you to continue to breastfeed Stephanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa said, reaching up and cupping her breasts, feeling how heavy and swollen they felt. \"This is what it feels like to be nursing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Tina said, handing over a large nursing bra along with Wendy's basic panties, mom jeans and button up blouse. \"From the notes in the file, Alex and William are a bit of a handful, and Stephanie is fussy and doesn't sleep through the night. Wendy isn't what you'd call wealthy, but this was her way of taking a vacation from being a mom for a few days. You'll come back on Wednesday to get settled back into your life and we'll try to have someone else lined up for you either that day or the next day. Here's a file for you, but because you're caring for her children, we've copied most of her parenting skills over to you so you should find that things like her children's names come quickly to mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Lisa said, taking the file after she finished buttoning up her jeans. She had to suck her stomach in a little bit to get the size fourteens to fit, which was just mind boggling, but she felt strangely proud of herself for not needing an even larger size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you have questions, I'll leave you here for a few minutes to go over the file before you have to collect Wendy's children from the lobby. Once you do, I don't know that you'll get much time to yourself to look that file over.

She once again felt her breasts that felt swollen and bloated. \"Aside from feeling like crap and wearing different clothes, I still look the same.\" Lisa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure if this was all even real, Lisa took her first steps since the transference and walked over to the mirror on the wall. What Tina had told her didn't seem quite real, so she decided to see for herself and she couldn't believe what she saw. Staring back at her was the reflection of a somewhat chubby woman with dull brown hair with massive breasts bulging out of her blouse wearing the same clothes as she was. \"So this is Wendy Thompson...\" Lisa muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood in front of the mirror and touched her face before moving her hands down to her breasts and feeling them again as Wendy's reflection copy her perfectly. Lisa turned to her side to get a better view of how she looked like as Wendy and grimaced when she saw her new gut and large, saggy ass in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back towards the mirror and tried straightening out her hair. \"Thank goodness that I only have to look like this for just two days.\" Lisa said to her new reflection. She had always prided herself for being in shape and now she had a gut and way too much junk in the trunk. Lifting up the bottom of her blouse, Lisa saw Wendy's flabby stomach covered in loose skin and stretch marks. Lowering her blouse back down, Lisa wanted to get going and make it through the next two days as quickly as possible. She went back towards the transference chair and picked up Wendy's mom purse. Going through it, she managed to find her cellphone and wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's time to be Wendy Thompson for a couple days.\" Lisa told herself as she hefted Wendy's mom bag onto her shoulder and headed out the door.</span></div></div>",

The moment Lisa walked into the play area she somehow recognized Wendy\u2019s \u2013 her children. Alex and Billy were playing with some foam tubes and one of the attendants was holding little Stephanie, trying to calm her down. \u201cMrs. Thompson, you\u2019re back! I think the little one is a hungry,\u201d said the attendant the moment she saw Lisa enter the room. \u201cYes, I think so too. Do you have a nursing room I could use?\u201d Lisa asked, instinctively recognizing her new daughter\u2019s cry and knowing what she had to do. \u201cYes, of course. Right through that door,\u201d she indicated towards a door on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed baby Stephanie from the attendant, \u201cWould you mind watching over the boys just a little bit longer, please?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went through the door and felt an odd sensation. She felt as though she\u2019d been in rooms like that many times before and at the same time she was aware that she\u2019d never nursed a baby before or need a room like that at all. She sad down in a comfortable chair and rearranged her top, unclasping her the front of her bra so she could feed the baby. The experience was surreal. It was almost like she was on autopilot as she simply knew everything she needed to do to feed her child. \u201cAfter three kids I guess it all just happens,\u201d she said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she little Stephanie was done she redid her top and walked back the play area. \u201cKids, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d she called out to the two boys. They ran towards her and both clamped on to her legs. \u201cMom! Can we go get some ice cream!\u201d pleaded Alex, her eldest and Billy just shook his head up and down like a bobble head. Lisa looked down at the baby in her arms and the two boys and in that moment she felt a connection to them she\u2019d never experienced before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. If you\u2019re good we might get some ice cream with daddy when he gets home from work, alright?\u201d she offered as an incentive. \u201cAlriiight,\u201d they both said in unison, though Billy spoke with an adorable lisp.  Lisa grabbed all her things and put the baby in the stroller while the boys walked next to her. A little while later she was getting the kids seated in the Thompson\u2019s minivan. She\u2019d never pictured herself as a mini-van sort of woman, but something about it gelt safe and comfortable. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been the first time in a several years since she sat up without being weighed down by her heavy, milk filled breasts or accompanied by back pain. As Wendy looked down, she noticed that she still looked the same but felt... different. She felt somewhat bigger and full of energy she hadn't had since high school. \"You sure this worked? I still look like me. Unless this Lisa Hale is my identical twin, I doubt anyone would confuse me for her.\" Wendy said as she reached up to cup her breasts. They were still hers, but some how, they felt lighter and firmer in her hands... and the best part was that they didn't feel bloated or swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything went just fine.\" Tina said as she laid out the clothes Lisa's had been wearing. \"You're Lisa Hale right now. And her life is yours for the next two days. Lisa is quite a bit taller than you so you're seeing the world from her height. Everything you do and feel will be as if you were her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm this Lisa woman, than how come I still look the same?\" Wendy asked as she looked at her stretched out chubby legs past her large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the world, you're physically Lisa Hale\" Tina tried to explain. She handed Wendy a small mirror. \"If you look into the mirror, you'll see what others see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy took the mirror from her and looked at her face. Staring back at her was a completely different woman. She looked somewhat similar to what Wendy looked like as a teenager, except her skin was perfectly clear... and she looked... cuter with a thinner nose. Tilting the mirror down, Wendy saw the reflection of a fit, young girl with pert breasts underneath the hospital gown she wore. \"She is so... pretty. So everyone will see me as her?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wanted to be a young woman with a fun life and free of responsibilities. We thought she was a perfect fit for what you were looking for. She is as young as we're legally allowed to rent out. She just graduated high school where she was a cheerleader and was very popular. She has no job or pressing obligations, so you're free to enjoy being her for the next few days.\" Tina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Wendy said as she put down the mirror and picked up Lisa's clothes. \"But what about these? How can I fit into these?\" she asked as she held up Lisa's skinny jeans and her small bra. \"I doubt I could even fit one of my legs into these jeans without tearing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will fit just fine. Like I said earlier, you're physically her right now but only you and Lisa can see your original forms. When you put on her clothes, our magic will warp them to fit you just as well as they fit her. Here, this folder has all the information you'll need to live as her for the next two days,\" Tina said as she sat the folder down on the table next to the rest of Lisa's clothes. \"If you don't have any questions, I'll leave so you can get dressed.\" Tina finished as she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What about my children and husband? Won't they notice that I'm gone for two days?\" Wendy asked. \"You don't need to worry about your family. While you enjoy being Lisa Hale for the next couple days, Lisa will take over mom duties as you. And Wendy, try to have fun. Not many people get to be 18 twice.\" Tina said before walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy finally had some privacy to get dressed. \"So I get to be a pretty young cheerleader for the next two days while she gets to babysit the kids as me?\" Wendy thought as she picked up the folder and quickly skimmed through it before setting it back down. She grabbed Lisa's tiny panties and slid them up her legs and felt surprised when they expanded to accommodate her larger frame. Next she tried putting on the skinny jeans, which also expanded to fit her perfectly. \"I guess this is one way to fit into a size 2 again...\" she said as she ran her hands over her denim encased butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing getting dressed and checking her new self out in the mirror again, Wendy thought about her situation. \"So I'm 18 again with no husband or children to worry about. What should I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Completely painless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't bad at all,\" Wendy said as she sat up. For the first time in a long while, the sensation of sitting up wasn't accompanied by the feeling of her heavy, milk filled breasts pulling her forward. Looking down, she saw that she still looked exactly like she had before, but the chair felt... different. Like it was bigger, but not as high off the ground. \"I feel kind of... funny,\" she said, reaching up to cup her breasts. They were still hers, but some how, they felt smaller in her hands.. like she could completely cover them up, which she hadn't felt since she was a much younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's to be expected,\" the employee said as she laid out Lisa's clothing for Wendy. \"You're Lisa Hale now, for the next two days.

The face that looked back at her was very similar to her own face at eighteen, except she'd never had skin that clear... and she looked... cuter she guessed. Looking downwards she saw the reflection of a trim, fit young girl with pert breasts and light muscular definition.\"Oh, wow. I'm... pretty. You didn't mention I'd get to be this pretty,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did ask for a young girl who's life would be fun to live.

Here, this is a file with all of the information you'll need to live her life for the next two days,\" the woman said, handing over a folder. \"I'll leave you to get dressed, if you have any questions, stop by the front desk on your way out,\" she finished as she opened the door and left to give Wendy some privacy to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days as a pretty young cheerleader,\" Wendy said, picking up the file. \"No kids, no husband, no chores... but what should I do first?\"</span></div></div>",

You never call without a text first. OMG, it's not Tom is it? Is he messing with you after you told him that it's over? Because it's so totally over. No one tells my friend that she isn't good for anything but being a baby machine and cooking his dinners like some kind of Stepford wife,\" Megan said, completely unaware that she was talking to just that kind of stay at home wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that,\" Wendy said, suppressing the brief irritation at the notion that Lisa was some how a better kind of woman than her. \"I'm just, really bored and I thought we could do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we should totally do something!\" Megan squealed. \"You promised we'd go swimsuit shopping before we fly out next week, and I hear that there's a summer sale at Wet. If the sale's really good, we might even be able to pick up a few outfits for the trip there. I know your folks are kind of strict about your clothes, but if you have to stash something skimpy in my luggage, I will totally cover for you,\" she gushed, already thinking about giving her friend a mini-makeover. Not that Megan expected Lisa to actually buy anything so skimpy her parent's wouldn't approve, but it never hurt to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome,\" Wendy said with a grin. \"I'll be right over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Wendy found herself following in Megan's wake as the bubbly young girl lead her through the crowds at the local mall towards Wet, a one stop shop for swim and beach wear and their Summer Kick Off sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have to promise me,\" Megan was saying as they walked into the store, \"that you'll at least try a two piece or two. I mean, you would look insanely cute in something like that blue one over there,\" she continued, pointing to a modest blue halter bikini with large cups and straps. \"Or even that green and black one,\" she said, pointing out something that had a more sports bra like look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Wendy said, eyeing the first one. She had a hard time not feeling like she'd fall out of something that had that plunging of a neckline. \"I guess I'll try the black and green one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoil sport,\" Megan said as she picked the suit up off the rack. \"But I get to see you in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Wendy said, taking the suit. \"But only if you try the blue one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Megan giggled, picking up a suit for herself. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the changing room, Wendy wiggled her way into the bikini bottoms before preparing to struggle into the sports bra like top. When she slid it on though, she was amazed at the ease with which it slid on. Looking in the mirror, she was also stunned to realize how flat chested it made her look. Her reflection had a trim, tone waist, slender hips and thanks to the compression effect of the top, virtually no chest. Bouncing up and down, she felt barely any movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've got mine on,\" Megan called from outside the changing room, let's see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside, Wendy was greeted by the sight of Lisa's best friend, looking stunning in the blue swim suit, getting just enough lift from the suit for the younger girl to flash an inviting amount of cleavage. \"Oh that's just not fair,\" Wendy complained. \"You're beautiful! I feel like I'm twelve in this,\" she said, picking at the breast flattening top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it's a good color on you though,\" Megan said, trying to cheer her friend up. She was honestly impressed that Lisa had been willing to try a two piece at all. All of their trips to the beach before, she'd worn one piece racing suits. \"Um, hang on, let me change out of this one and I'll see if I can find you something... you just wait here and I'll pass things over the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Wendy replied, stepping back into the changing room. It was strange, she thought as she stripped out of the tight suit, cupping her own breasts and looking at them to reassure herself she hadn't shrunk. She'd been in Lisa's life for over two hours now, but she had yet to feel like she needed to pump or nurse Stephanie. It was obvious that the Nexus's magic was doing more than just making everyone think she was someone else. \"I wonder,\" she said softly. There wasn't much room in the changing room, but there looked like there was just enough.... Starting slowly she stretched forward, spreading her legs further and further apart... she expected to feel pain and resistance, but it never came. Moments later, she was sitting on the ground in a full front split! \"Cheerleader,\" she said with a giggle. \"This is so cool! I wonder what else I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa, try these,\" she heard from outside the changing room as Megan handed in more suits. \"I think they'll be lots better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Wendy said, bouncing up from the floor with youthful energy that she hadn't felt in years. \"Let's see what you got me...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking the swimsuits that Megan passed over, Wendy looked at the three options she'd been given...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a very simple swimsuit in basic black. The bottoms were a classic bikini cut and the top was a fairly modest bandeau with a little cutout in the center. The second one was a pink and black number with boyshort style bottoms and a more tankini type of top. It was modest, but the neckline came down low enough that it would show off the tops of the pert breasts the world currently thought she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one though is what drew her eye the most. It wasn't really practical for swimming, more for sunbathing and coming up with interesting tan lines. It was bright white, which, against the pale complexion that she and Lisa shared, would result in people easily thinking she was nude at a casual quick glance. The bottoms were a small triangle and then a collection of three straps that ran from back to front over the hips. The top was similar three thin straps running around the back to connect to the small cups in the front. It would offer virtually no support and was the sort of thing she'd never be able to wear in her real life, but Lisa... Lisa could probably pull it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the tiny swim suit, Wendy turned to admire her reflection in the mirror. Slim, sexy, fit... the cute girl in the mirror winked back at her, and Wendy couldn't help but giggle. She had meant the wink to be comical, but on the girl in the mirror, it looked... cute and... flirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I want to see,\" Megan said hearing Wendy's giggle. \"Come on, show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Wendy answered, opening the door and striking a pose like she was a cheerleader on the field. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, I didn't think you'd actually put that on! Hold on, I so have to take a picture of you in that,\" Megan said delightfully as she pulled out her phone and snapped several pictures. \"Now I have proof! Look, here, you have to see how hot you look,\" she gushed, handing Wendy the phone so she could admire the photos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really me?\" she said, touching the phone. Wendy had never been one of the 'hot ones'... she'd been the girl people settled for. The cute one maybe... usually the cute, slightly chubby one... but never one of the 'hot ones.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ALL you,\" Megan said grinning. \"You so have to buy it. I mean... if you don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't, then what?\" Wendy asked with a laugh. \"You'll make me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't... I'll just buy it... and when we get to Mexico, I'll cut up your other clothes so you have to wear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't!\" Wendy laughed. \"You wouldn't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe... but I could just put these pictures up on Facebook and tell everyone its what you'll be wearing down there....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that I think you would do. But you don't have to,\" Wendy said, turning to look back at herself in the mirror. \"I totally love it. I don't want to wait till we go to Mexico to wear it,\" she added, feeling a slight pang of regret that she couldn't afford to rent Lisa's life longer. To be at the beach in a swimsuit like this, looking like this... it would be a real dream vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't exactly wear it out of the store..\" Megan said, privately thrilled that Lisa was opening up at last about being the beautiful girl she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Wendy asked. \"I mean... not just this... but if I were to grab a pair of those shorts, or one of those short skirts over on that wall,\" she said, pointing out the store's modest collection of more practical beach wear. \"Shorts and a bikini top is just fine for summer, isn't it? And maybe we could find somewhere to go out for ice cream after this. Doesn't that sound nice? Hanging out in the sun with ice cream? But you have to get the blue one! You looked so awesome in it and the top would go great with some of those shorts,\" she added in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what,\" Megan said after thinking about it for just a few moments. \"You're right, that does sound awesome. And I know just the place for ice cream. It's a frozen yogurt place right across from Inferno,\" she said, naming one of the town's local MMA and Crossfit gyms. \"I bet there are some guys there who might even buy our ice cream for us!\"</span></div></div>",

While they'd joked about having boys buy them ice cream, they both decided it wasn't worth waiting around on anyone and despite being early in the summer, it was still warm enough to want the cold treat while they sat out in the sun. Besides, they'd parked facing the gym and there were plenty of cute guys coming and going while they enjoyed their treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, is that Dean Richards?\" Megan asked, pointing out a pair of solidly toned men exiting the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean?\" Wendy asked? She wracked her brain, trying to remember if she'd read anything about a dean in Lisa's file but the name didn't ring a bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you weren't on the squad sophomore year, were you?\" Megan said. \"He was on the football team that year.

I wouldn't have noticed except Megan pointed you out. She was on the cheer squad when you were team captain a few years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" he blurted, taking in Megan's curves, well displayed by her blue bikini top and micro short shorts. \"You're Megan Rhodes aren't you? You used to do that insane dismount from the top of the pyramid at games... with the spin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that?\" Megan gasped, blushing that her crush remembered her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard not to. I got into it a bit with that ass hat Rick when he dropped you because he was trying to cop a feel when he caught you. I don't have a problem with guys who want to be cheerleaders,\" he said. \"But pervy creeps aren't cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I didn't know you did that, Megan said, blushing furiously. \"I kind of wondered why he asked to move to the other side of the formation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Mike,\" the other man said, extending a hand to Wendy. \"Sorry, but if you get this guy going he's never going to be polite enough to ask you for your name....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, I didn't mean to....\" Dean said started, realizing that he'd been staring intently at Megan and virtually ignoring the girl who'd called them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm w-Lisa,\" Wendy said, almost forgetting she wasn't herself but catching it quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's cool running into you Megan,\" Dean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your girlfriend's waiting on you,\" Megan said, knowing full well that there was no way that Dean Richards was single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No,\" Dean started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wishes,\" Mike added. \"No, we're headed up to his old man's place on the river. He's trying to get their boat back in shape for this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He really let it go over the winter and there's a ton of work to do to get it cleaned up. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could help with that, couldn't we Meg?\" Wendy said. \"I mean... if it's just scrubbing and stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we could do that... um, that is, if you wanted us to come along,\" Megan  added, leaning forward just enough to give Dean a good look at her cleavage. \"Could you use a few extra hands?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally,\" Mike answered for Dean, clapping a hand on his friend's shoulder. \"I'll get the truck, you guys can follow me. Dean, why don't you give them the address in case we get split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Dean said, fishing out his phone. \"Here, if you give me your number, I can just text you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine!\" Wendy cried, snatching his phone with a youthful giggle. Turning on the camera, she aimed the phone at Megan. \"Smile!\" she said, snapping a quick picture of her new best friend, making sure to get her awesome cleavage in the frame. \"There,\" she said, tossing the phone back to Dean. \"Now you have a picture to make a contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, you are such a dork,\" Megan said, silently thanking Wendy but way too embarrassed to admit it in front of Dean. \"So here, my number is....\"</span></div></div>",

Moments later she was inhaling the pungent smoke and exhaling a steady stream as though she'd done so for years. \"That's better,\" she sighed contentedly. \"So, who am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Tina said, handing over a thick folder. \"Are Ms. Mindy Lang, attorney at law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lawyer?

There may be some room for improvements... Did I just say that?

As a lawyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she, that is, you now, Ms. Lang,\" Tina said, starting to use the name that Lisa would carry for the next few days. \"If you check your ID, you'll see that you're only 4'11\" tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four foot,\" Lisa said, a little stunned. \"Not even five feet tall?

Is this going to fit?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will fit just fine,\" Tina said. \"You'll find that everything in her wardrobe fits, even though you're not actually the same size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Lisa said, slipping into the bra and relaxing as the straps took some of the weight off her chest. She hadn't realized until this moment that she'd been needing the support of a good bra. \"Busty little thing aren't I?\" Slipping into the skirt and blouse she frowned. \"And then cover it all up. There's even a scarf to make sure no one stares at my chest, what fun is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I gather that Ms. Lang has wanted to be respected for her brain rather than her body,\" Tina speculated, passing over the last of Mindy's things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For someone who covers up this much, she sure cares a lot about her looks. That itinerary has a trip to the gym every single day along with a hair appointment, manicure and pedicure....

Even though people seemed much larger to her, they got out of her way as she strode towards them. People looked up at the sound of her heels striking the ground with her powerful stride. She felt... stronger than she'd ever felt before. More in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into Mindy's BMW she set the folder down in the passenger seat and prepared to drive off towards the first stop on Mindy's itinerary. A glimpse in the rear view mirror, however, stopped her cold. Reflected back at her was a face that looked similar to her own, but was also very, very different. She could see the set of age on her features, the faint lines covered by skillful makeup and the more worn look to her skin in general. More than that though was the difference she saw in the shape of her face, and the tone of her skin. \"I'm Asian now? No wonder I'm short!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the surprise aside, she pulled out of the parking lot and headed towards Mindy's mid town apartment. It was a nice area of town, not exceptionally well off, but very trendy with easy access to several local hot spots. After parking in the underground garage, she got off the elevator on the top floor and strode into her new home for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this, I could get used to,\" she said, taking in the sleek, modern furnishings and elegant, minimalist design. The building wasn't tall, only five stories, but it gave her a wonderful view of the park across the street and the city beyond the park. Slipping out of the towering heels, she padded across the apartment and towards the bedroom, for the first time realizing how much shorter she felt with her altered perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the itinerary, she had a dinner reservation in a few hours, though it was a reservation for one, which felt odd. Though she didn't have instructions to do so, Lisa really didn't want to go out in the overly stiff business attire she was currently wearing and she hoped that there was something nice she could wear instead. Maybe an expensive designer dress or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Lisa said, stunned at what she found in Mindy's walk in closet. On one wall, more outfits exactly like what she wore now. Skirt suits, pant suits, and things a lawyer could wear to a court room. On the opposite wall, some of what she had been looking for. Nice, elegant dresses and dozens of pairs of ultra high heeled shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back wall, however, was what made Lisa pause and take notice. Leather corsets. Vinyl. Thigh high spike heeled boots. Whips, floggers, and an assortment of gags. \"She's a dominatrix!\"</span></div></div>",

I won't give you answers to everything, but I will explain the important parts. This is the most important part of my life.The life I live at the law firm is kept well away from this. I left very explicit instructions for The Nexus to make sure that part of you gaining my skills was that you gained all of my sexual skills and my sense of... kink. If you're a little wet just looking at some of my tools then everything has worked as it's supposed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a very detailed itinerary in the file. You may or may not choose to follow it. If you do, you'll be marching to my beat, and my orders, and I'm sure you've gained enough of my strength of will to resist that. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right about that,\" Lisa muttered. Already her skin was beginning to crawl at the notion of following Mindy's instructions. This was, after all, her life for the weekend. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The itinerary serves one purpose. There is a very special young girl who will be auditioning this weekend for a position as your live in submissive. She's very similar to you in many ways. I'm hoping that your insight may help you bring her to heel... I expect her to be a little difficult until you get through to her. If you feel she is worthy, and if she will accept you, then I want you to take her out Sunday for a tattoo to mark her as mine. I know it's not what you were expecting, but I promise you, if you succeed, I will make it very, very worth your while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dinner reservation tonight is where you will meet Michael, one of my favorite long term clients. Use tonight to 'warm up' on the notion of breaking someone in... I promise you, his tolerance for pain is high. If, after that, you wish to accept my request, be ready for the applicant to show up at your doorstep tomorrow morning. The appointments for hair, nails, etc aren't for you... they're so you can shape her to fit your desires and remake her into a perfect pet submissive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look forward to speaking with you when this is over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mistress Mindy</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Lisa said, already finding herself a little moist at the thought of using some of the tools before her on an \"client\" with a \"high pain tolerance.\" Running a finger along the edge of a vinyl corset she smiled wickedly. \"You know...\" </span></div></div>",

Deciding that she would make the dinner appointment as the letter suggested she set about exploring her home for the weekend.

The master bathroom had a luxurious, soaking bathtub with a great many lotions, perfumes and other such thing organized like an in-home spa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the different bottles available to her, Lisa started imagining this new submissive tending to her needs like an obedient pet. Just the thought of it exited her in ways that she had never experienced before, but which also felt entirely natural and empowering to her.

She chose to dress in one of the designer outfits she\u2019d seen in the closet, but under it she wore a steel-boned corset that brought in her waist considerably and made her already large breasts even more prominent.

She said she wanted to do only a simple swap with you since you both went to the same school and she would be around classmates that she knew. She didn't want to exchange any personality traits or knowledge so she could vacation as if she was actually there herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa said, letting the information sink in for a moment. She'd known that someone would most likely want to rent her life during the trip that she thought had a life she didn't want to be in, but this was the first time she was directly confronted with it and the idea of the important parts of her summer vacation that she would not get back. This would be her last vacation with Megan before college.... and Tammy would be living it while she would lounge around until it was time to push a baby out of her vagina. Trying to find a positive in all this, she thought \"At least my first year in college will be paid for. I hope she doesn't have too much fun in Mexico. So, how does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple,\" the woman said, gesturing for Lisa to proceed into one of the small rooms off the hallway. \"You'll need to change into the robe there, and we'll take your clothing over to Ms. Clark. Then, you lie down on the chair in the center of the room and relax. At that point, we do all the work to make sure you have what you'll need to live Ms. Clark's life for the next two months, and that people will think you are her and vice versa. During the process, you'll be asleep. When you wake up, for the next two months, you will be Ms. Clark, and she'll be Lisa Hale. After that, you get dressed in the clothing she wore here, drive off in her car, and spend the next two months being her while she vacations as you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There we go,\" Tina said, watching Lisa's eyes flutter back open. \"That wasn't so bad now was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Lisa said, trying to sit up in the chair. She looked down feeling both heavy and disoriented. \"But I feel really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different?\" Tina asked. \"Probably a bit heavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and hungry\" Lisa said, trying to adjust to the strange feelings. The chair felt somewhat larger than it had when she'd first climbed into it, and when she looked down, the chair looked a little bit larger. She still looked the same, but it felt... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, Tammy who is renting your life is a few inches shorter and much heavier now\" Tina said as she reached down and picked up a neatly folded stack of clothing. \"While you're in her life, you'll have the same displacement in the world that she would, meanwhile, she'll have the same displacement you would. If you were to step on a scale right now you would weigh about 45 pounds heavier than your normal self. If we were to measure your height, you'd be about 4 inches shorter at 5'3\". As to the hunger... Ms. Clark's body needs to sustain two people and you're feeling that. She also has an influx of hormones that you normally wouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Lisa said, adjusting to the strange sensations. Her body felt heavy all over, but her chest and back ached from the weight. \"Does she even sleep on her back? And is there something wrong with her? My chest feels really funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there is nothing wrong with her,\" Tina said, helping Lisa to stand up. \"For the next two months, you're going to be Tammy Clark.\" Tina continued, reading information off of the sheet. \"Age eighteen, dropped out of highschool 4 months ago after getting pregnant. You live with your single mother, Alexandra Clark and younger sister Jeanne. That feeling in your chest is an adjustment that will allow you to breastfeed her baby when you give birth next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird\" Lisa said while reaching up and cupping her breasts, feeling how heavy and swollen they felt. \"Is this what it feels like to be lactating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" Tina said, handing over a large maternity bra along with Tammy's brief panties, black leggings and button up blue blouse. \"From the notes in the file, Tammy moved to your school for her senior year. She briefly knew you on the cheerleading squad before quitting after becoming pregnant. Tammy also wrote that she had a reputation as the school slut which is now your reputation.\" \"Eww\" Lisa thought in a typical teenage manner. \"You'll be coming back in two months to get settled back into your life and we'll try to have your payment ready the following business day.\" Tina handed her a sealed manila folder \"This is for you, because Tammy opted to only swap minds with you, she made you a sealed file with information she felt you needed to navigate her life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Lisa said, setting the file down before she began picking through her new clothing. The clothing looked a bit too short to fit properly. \"38GG?\" Lisa read off the label. \"Um, this won't fit me, I'm no where near that big!\" Tina told her \"Just slip it on dear, you'll find it fits just as well as it did Tammy. You've already mentioned how much your back hurt. When pregnant women have their breasts fill up with milk like Tammy, or should I say you, that bra provides enough back support to offset that weight.\" Lisa seemed consider Tina's advice as she put the bra down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you have questions, I'll leave you alone to get dressed. Any questions?\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I've got it,\" Lisa said. \"So when I walk out, people will think I'm Tammy and I just do what she would do for the next two months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and good luck. We'll see you back here in a couple months to return Ms. Clark to her life,\" Tina finished as she stepped outside and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then pulled her robe off and looked her body over. Everything looked mostly the same to her with the exception of her nipples and her physique. Normally her nipples were small and light brown, now they were gigantic and all puffy and pink. When she squeezed one, some white fluid came oozing out. Looking farther down her body, it looked like her minus her toned stomach that became soft and somewhat doughy and her legs that lost their athletic tone. Lisa saw that her vagina grew a fur coat on it when it was clean shaven this morning. Feeling her butt, it felt looser and saggy too. \"I guess I won't need my fitness to lay around and pop out Tammy's baby\" Lisa muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the panty briefs, she put them without too much trouble. Turning around, she grabbed the bra and walked over to a mirror in the corner of the room to put it on. Her reflection startled her and caused her to drop the bra in her hands. Tammy's reflection stared back at Lisa. She had the same blond hair and doe eyes that she remembered Tammy had. Recalling her delicate and feminine, the reflection showed dull hair with split ends and blue eyes that lost their youthful sparkle. Tammy definitely looked as if she had seen better days. Her breasts looked engorged and drooped down. That's when she noticed her nipples, looking down at her chest and up at Tammy's reflection she noticed that she must have exchanged nipples with her. Her belly was huge on her. She clearly lost her all of her athletic physique as her arms and thighs had built up some extra fat on them. Her had hips widened from when she last remembered, probably to accommodate the baby growing in her uterus. And that bush... her new bush looked exactly like the one in Tammy's reflection but was brown instead of blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over painfully to pick up the bra she dropped, she looked up to see Tammy's reflection copy her movements. He breasts and belly looked even bigger from this angle. Lisa easily put on the bra that looked too big on her. But according to her reflection, it fit her snugly. She had to sit down and get her new leggings and sandals on. Once she buttoned up her blouse, she looked at her reflection one last time. \"I can't believe I'm inside Tammy Clark's whale body. This money better be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Tammy pulled some strands of her hair in front of her face and inspected them. \"This is perfect. I still have my own body but her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You have her body as she has yours. Our technicians and magicians just merely moved your souls into each others bodies. Unfortunately our technologies' limitations force patients to see themselves as who they are with their naked eyes.\" Tina set down a set of clothes on the chair next to Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha\" Tammy said to Tina as she felt up her tighter butt and thighs before inspecting the pile of clothes. Tammy held out some hip hugging jeans and a simple pink shirt before looking at light blue thong and bra that looked way too small for her. Part of Tammy was hesitant to wear another woman's underwear but the other part of her yearned to wear something other than preggo clothes. Tina interrupted her thoughts on the matter by placing a somewhat thick folder down on a nearby counter. \"Here's the folder Lisa built on her life if you find yourself needing to navigate more of her life than you thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you alone so you can get dressed. Do you have any questions Ms. Clark?\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I gotta pack for MY flight.\" Tammy said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy your trip. We'll see you back here in a couple months to return Ms. Hale to her life,\" Tina finished saying as she stepped outside and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy immediately threw off the robe she was wearing and marveled at her body. It looked just as toned and fit as she remembered herself being 8 months ago. The only thing that seemed different were her nipples. They were much smaller and brown instead of her usual pink ones. Tammy cupped her perky breasts and felt a tingling sensation in her crotch. \"I've missed you girls\" Tammy said to her breasts as if they were people. Tammy normally had a perky set of C cup breasts that used to make her stand out with her smaller frame. After getting pregnant, they grew like much of everything else and became too tender for her to enjoy playing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy's hands wandered down and felt a tight set of abs and eventually cupped an equally tight set of buttocks. \"This is amazing, I'm going to get so many guys with a body like this.\" Feeling herself getting wet, Tammy put a hand over her vagina and felt how smooth it was. \"She must have had plans if she shaved herself. Well, those are my plans now. I hope he's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up and sliding the thong on, Tammy went over to the nearby mirror to see how it looked on her. She couldn't tell as Lisa's reflection stared back at her in the mirror. Tammy at first thought it was weird seeing Lisa's face instead of her own, but she thought it was worth it to have her fit body. Tammy thought Lisa was pretty enough, though a bit small in the chest department. That's when Tammy noticed her nipples were the same as Lisa's. Tammy decided to finsh getting dressed, she had planes to catch and guys to fuck. \"God, it's been so long since I've been laid. I can't wait to get some cock.\" Tammy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Tammy emerged out of the building eagerly heading towards her newly rented life.</span></div></div>",

After driving to her temporary home, she spent the entire day on the couch eating junk food and binge watching her favorite shows. Tammy's family didn't seem to be so bad either. Her mom, whom Tammy really took after worked as a personal assistant in a prominent law firm always brought home plenty of food for Lisa to eat. Lisa couldn't believe how much she could eat in a day. Living Tammy's life was really easy aside from the annoying contractions she had to deal with a couple times a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Lisa woke up to start another day. Still in her panties and oversized tank top, she rolled out of bed. \"I'm starting to get bored watching tv all day. Perhaps I can find something else to do today.\" Lisa thought. As she made her way towards the bathroom, she felt the baby girl kick inside her. She loved the feeling. She couldn't wait to start her family after college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom, Lisa took off her clothes and sat down on the toilet to pee and start her morning by pumping her breasts. Once she was done, she poured her fresh milk down the drain in the sink and turned on the shower. Lisa always enjoyed her morning shower, but in Tammy's body it felt even better. The water hitting her extra sensitive breasts made her horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pressured water satisfied her nipples, Lisa used one of her hands to rub her clit. Her pregnant body had a torqued sex drive and she needed to sate it a couple times a day. Since becoming Tammy, she could get herself to orgasm several times in the shower and her hormones made the afterglow more intense. Hopping out of the shower, she wiped the steam off of the mirror behind the sink and looked at her reflection. Tammy stared at her back with a nice smile and motherly glow. Lisa wrapped a towel around herself and went back into her room to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can find a new show to watch today...\" Lisa said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since arriving in Mexico a few days ago, she wasted no time hitting the beach and seeking hunky guys to fuck. She pulled the masculine arm off of her crawled out of bed naked. The guy sleeping in her bed was a hunky Brazilian guy named Raoul. He was the best lay she had since she started her trip. His accent made her knees tremble and her pussy wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the bathroom to pee and clean out Raoul's seed from inside her, Tammy admired the nice tan she was getting. Flushing away the used toilet paper, she stood up and walked past the giant wall mirror in the bathroom. She turned back to look at her reflection. Lisa looked amazing, she had a nice tan that accentuated her athletic body. Tammy became a little jealous. \"I would look better than her if Tom hadn't knocked me up. I wish I never slept with him.\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy didn't like Lisa. Although she thought of herself prettier, she blamed Lisa for her misfortune of becoming pregnant and ultimately dropping out of high school. \"If you were less of a prude and serviced your man, he wouldn't have had to go behind your back and knock me up.\" Lisa told her reflection as if it was actually Lisa in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom still naked, Tammy wanted to enjoy her day while Raoul recharged. She slid on a skimpy bathing suit and blew him a kiss before heading outside to work on her tan and drink another margarita. \"I hope that bitch enjoys living my failed life while I live it up in here.\" Tammy said to her reflection as she straightened out her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy emerged from her room wearing sandals and holding a towel with her bag determined to find a good spot on the beach.</span></div></div>",

Lisa didn't shave her legs or use any makeup since she became Tammy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa just finished eating a medium pizza her mom dropped by during her lunch bream when all of a sudden Lisa felt her vagina hurt and spasm. Lisa suddenly noticed that her panties were wet and sticky when her vagina started hurting even more. \"Oh God. I think my water just broke.\" Lisa said to herself while panicking. Calling her temporary mother, Lisa began crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, she coming now.\" Lisa told Alexandra over the phone. Mrs. Clark quickly picked up who she thought was her daughter and rushed to the hospital. Lisa never felt so exposed in her life. Multiple strangers that she didn't know had her legs spread and peered between her legs constantly as if she was some kind of specimen. Once she got settled into a room, she was stripped naked and her legs were strapped to stirrups so her vagina could be wide open. The pain was unbearable, it felt like her vagina was being ripped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with pain medication, Lisa spent nearly 4 hours in pain before she felt something begin to push apart her vagina even further. Doctors and nurses gather around her and wiped the blood off that formed between her legs. \"Push Tammy, we need you to push\" the doctor told her. Lisa struggled through the pain and forced muscles she didn't even know she had to get this baby out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more Tammy, give us one more good push\" the doctor told Lisa. Tired and covered in sweat, Lisa managed to push again. Suddenly she heard a scream followed by crying. Between her legs, the doctor pulled out a tiny infant attached to an umbilical cord. Lisa felt herself become filled with joy and happiness. She managed to catch her breath when the doctors handed her Tammy's child; her child for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy never left any instructions for her regarding what she wanted to name her daughter when she was born. Trying to think on the fly, Lisa told the nurse that her daughter's name would be Dawn. Tired and fatigued, Lisa managed to spend almost 2 hours with Dawn. She even got to breast feed her. Needing some rest, a nurse took Dawn to rest in the infant ward down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa fell asleep for several hours before visiting with Alexandra, Jeanne and Dawn again. The following day Lisa felt much better, she even managed to get out of bed to use the bathroom on her own. Closing the door, Lisa sat on the toilet to pee and release more blood from her uterus. Deciding to inspect her vagina, she felt how sore and stretched out it was. Taking off her hospital gown, Lisa decided to give her reflection a once over in the mirror above the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy in the reflection looked tired with matted hair and bags under her eyes. Her breasts had stretch marks as they dropped down. Her stomach looked flabby as excess skin hung loose. She looked pale and malnourished. \"I guess I look exactly how I feel. Hopefully Tammy can lose this weight when she gets back.\" Lisa thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her gown back on, she went back to her bed to wait for Dawn's feeding time.</span></div></div>",

She never encountered anyone with a bigger cock before. She had to fuck him before her vacation ended in a couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down, Tammy lamented the end of her trip. She definitely didn't want to go back to being a frumpy teenage mother. She didn't even want her kid. \"I'll throw the kid up for adoption and whip my body back into shape. Then I can go back to partying and getting laid.\" She thought. As much as she hated to admit it, she loved Lisa's body and didn't want to part with it. As she laid on her towel thinking about all of this, a shadow approached and blocked out the sun for her. Turning around, she saw Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa. It's been a while. Magen said you ditched her and did your own thing when you got here. I figured we could catch up before our flight leaves tomorrow.\" Tom said in order to strike up a conversation with his on-off again girlfriend. Tammy looked at him while forgetting that she was in Lisa's body and chided him. \"I'll never forgive you Tom for that night after homecoming game. You ruined my life!\". Tom didn't totally understand, but realized that Lisa must have found out about him cheating on her with that blonde cheerleader.\" Look Lise, she got me drunk and seduced me. I don't even remember her name.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy took off her sunglasses and turned towards him with a look of hatred. Realizing that she was still Lisa at the moment, she laid into him. \"Tammy, her name was Tammy and you knocked her up! She didn't seduce you. You told her she was prettier and lied about breaking up with me and going out with her.\" Tom was confused. Lisa seemed to know everything. She even knew that he was now a father, which was something he didn't even know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom tried to play it cool. \"Look Lise, we been through a lot and I love you more than...\" Tammy interrupted his stupid speech \"Cut the crap Tom, I'm not buying it. Go play your game with someone else. I wanna finish my tan before I go home.\" Tom walked off, partially confused and partially hurt that Lisa gave him the cold shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa spent ordered another margarita while texting Raoul. He left two days ago and forced her to find a new piece of meat to put in between her legs at night. She immediately closed her phone when Aaron came up and asked if she wanted to watch a movie at his place. Tammy curled her mouth into a smile. She definitely was going to get fucked by the biggest cock she ever seen.</span></div></div>",

She wore the same black leggings from the last time she was here and a loose sleeveless blouse with beautiful red rose pattern and toeless sandals that showed off her freshly painted red toe nails. Lisa wore her longer hair in a lose ponytail and had on golden stud earrings. To the world, she looked like a beautiful young mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was proud of herself. After giving birth, she borrowed some money from Ms. Clark and got a makeover. Changing her diet, Lisa began eating healthier and even started doing some of her old cheerleader routines. Almost 4 weeks into this change, the results were a great success despite still not losing most of Tammy's excess weight. Tammy's reflection was still that of a somewhat pudgy, but homely teen that looked revitalized. Walking into the waiting room, Lisa saw a beautifully tanned blonde woman in capris and a skimpy light blue tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy turned around and saw a familiar face staring back at her. It was the one she'd seen in the mirror for the last 2 months. Ever since returning from Mexico last week, she had been dreading this day. She finally admitted to herself that she loved Lisa's life and body. She was wished she could keep it and go off to college in her place. She could be a cheerleader again and party again with hot guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa approached Tammy and said \"Hi\". Tammy wasn't too thrilled and Lisa could see this. Trying to strike up a conversation, Lisa introduced Tammy to her new daughter Dawn. However, Lisa was taken aback by Tammy's lack of interest in her own daughter. \"What's wrong Tammy? Did your vacation not go well?\" Lisa asked. Tammy looked at her with venom \"my vacation was fine, I got laid plenty of times and enjoyed partying with lots of hunky guys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was taken aback by all of this. Tammy basically made it sound like she used her body to fuck all of Mexico. Lisa was generally more conservative about whom and how often she had sex. Aside from Tom, she only had slept with one other guy. Why would Tammy be like this to her. She made it sound like she wanted to insult her. \"Tammy what is your problem, you're making it sound like I ruined your life or something. I even brought your daughter into this world and started trying to get your body into shape again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I don't even want that child. I was going to have an abortion if my mom would have let me. I only got pregnant because your stupid boyfriend Tom cheated on you and knocked me up. If you took care of him better, I would have graduated and enjoyed my own trip to Mexico.\" Lisa was shocked and outraged. She didn't know Tom cheated on her behind her back and she couldn't stand this irresponsible slut blamed her for all her problems. The same slut that used her body to fuck half of Mexico while she birthed and reared Dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy, I don't care that you probably misused my body. But how could you be so heartless to your own daughter?\" Lisa asked Tammy. \"You can keep her, I would so rather trade her for a fit body like yours. I'd rather cheer, fuck and party than be some frumpy mom with no prospects in life. What kind of hot guy would date that?\" Tammy said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs some of the people in the waiting room watched the argument unfold, Tina stepped out and interrupted it. \"Ah Miss Clark and Miss Hale. It good to see you back. Are you two ready to get back to your lives?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once past the waiting room, Lisa asked \"Were you serious about not wanting Dawn?\". \"Of course I am serious. Why do you think I didn't have much baby stuff or even bothered to leave you with a name for her? I don't want any kids, I just want to party and fuck my way through life.\" Tammy told her with all seriousness. Lisa gave Tammy an offer \"I'll take Dawn and raise her if you don't want her.\" Tammy looked at Lisa and asked \"How would you raise a child by yourself and make it through college?\" Tammy asked. \"I would just get a normal job somewhere and raise Dawn without college.\" Lisa said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at a conference room, Tammy made Lisa a counter offer \"I'll let you have the kid if I can keep your body.\" Tammy said with a smirk. She was good at finding weaknesses in people and exploiting them. Lisa definitely had a weakness for that kid that she didn't even give two shits about. Lisa thought about her life. She loved her family and looked forward to going to college. She even pawned off her body for two months to pay her tuition. But after carrying, birthing and nursing little Dawn, she felt attached to her. Maybe it was the hormones in her body or maybe it was her maternal instinct, but she wanted Dawn to be raised by a mother that truly loved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could give Tammy an answer, Tina came in to escort her to a transference room. She felt really bad and unsure what to do as she pushed Dawn in the stroller towards her transference room. As she approached the door, Dawn began to cry. It was almost as if she knew she was going to lose a loving mother for an unloving one. Tina closed the door so Lisa could disrobe and get setup in the chair. Lisa took off her top and bra to breastfeed Dawn one last time. Once she settled down, Lisa kicked off her sandals and slid off her leggings and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing at Tammy's naked reflection, Lisa inspected the form she wore. Tammy's body looked so cute and innocent compared to her actual personality. Lisa cupped her breasts as she watched Tammy's reflection cup its sagging breasts with stretch marks and spider veins on them. She thought they may not be pretty now, but they were sustaining a life and she felt proud of them. Looking at her belly, it was still flabby it hadn't seen much exercise in the last 9 months. Some of the skin hadn't even tightened up yet. There were sure to be plenty of stretch marks as Tammy nor Lisa had been using any oils to reduce them. Her vagina still had a massive overgrown bush that couldn't hide her now puffy and somewhat swollen vagina. Turning around, Lisa looked at her ass in the mirror. It looked wide and full of fat, probably from when her hips widened during her pregnancy. Those would never go back to fit the size 4s that Lisa was used to wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa knew Tammy's body would never look as good her body, but it was the body that would control Dawn's fate. Tina came in and noticed Lisa was still naked. \"I'm sorry Ms. Hale, I figured you would have been all ready to switch back.\" Lisa asked Tina \"What if neither of us wish to switch back?\" Tina looked at her and said, that's not unheard of. If both parties wish to stay in their current lives, we can arrange that at the cost of your payment from the service. If you want, we can discuss this back in the conference room with Ms. Clark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put on the robe and her sandals and pushed Dawn's stroller back into the conference room she was in before. As she sat waiting, Tammy emerged wearing the same matching robe. \"I hear you're offering me your body and life for mine. I'll be happy to trade you for it.\" Tammy said. Lisa thought she sounded like a sociopath. She felt bad for her family, to inherit such an awful person as a daughter. But she couldn't allow a child to suffer while she went to college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina walked in with some clipboards. \"This is the amendment to your contracts. Ms. Hail will waive her payment and Ms. Clark will relinquish her claim on her body and life in exchange for Ms. Hale's. Lisa read over the amendment and quickly signed. Tammy read it over slower and made sure there weren't any loopholes before asking about the \"finalized procedure they needed to undergo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The finalized procedure is necessary to fully integrate your souls into the bodies you currently possess. It's just as painless as the one you underwent to end up in each other's bodies. The only difference is your souls will be able to see your actual body without the aid of a mirror.\" Tammy asked \"So I'll look down and see Lisa's body as mine and hear her voice instead of my old one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Tina said. \"For all intents and purposes, you will find no physical trace that you were once Tammy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy thought about this for a second. \"This will work for me I guess. Hopefully I'll get used to seeing her as me.\" Tammy said snarkily. Once she signed her copy, Tina collected the documents and looked them over. \"Ok, back into the transference rooms you two.\" Lisa and Tammy got up and went into their respective rooms. Tammy seemed clearly happier than Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down in the chair. She tried thinking about the decision she made, if it was the right one. Before she could dwell upon it, she felt dizzy and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Ms. Hale, or should I say Ms. Clark for now on\" Tina greeted Lisa as she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel groggy, but not strange\" Lisa told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope so, you're still in the same body that you walked in here with.\" Tina warmly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat up and noticed Dawn was asleep in her stroller. Tina helped her out of the chair and said \"I'll leave you to get dressed Ms. Clark.\" before walking out. Lisa took off her robe and looked down. Her body was different, it was Tammy's... no hers. She was now the blonde teenage mom who just recently given birth. She cupped her now larger sagging breasts and felt her flabby stomach. She would miss her taller athletic form, but she now had a life she could enjoy and make her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, the new Tammy Clark walked outside the Nexus building pushing her new daughter with a smile on her face. Getting into her new car, she went home to go workout and spend some quality time with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the new Lisa Hale walked outside the Nexus building and got into her parent's SUV and headed to her home. She had packing to do for college and a party to attend later that night. She didn't have any money to pay for her tuition, but at the moment she only cared about getting laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She read up on parenting and post pregnancy beauty tips. She continued to exercise and work out. She now ran a mile every morning and it definitely was paying off. Most of her excess weight was gone and her skin had tightened up on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Tammy even got a hold of Tom, the one night stand that fathered her child. Putting their issues aside, he agreed to help Tammy raise Dawn and be part of her life. Tom and Tammy even managed to kindle a relationship that looked like it would turn into more. Tammy was happy how her life was turning out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy who has become Lisa enjoyed her first few weeks in her new body. She went to the gym several times a week and tanned at least once a week. She partied almost nightly and could barely keep track of who she slept with. She did get smart and got the birth control implant in her arm so she wouldn't wind up pregnant again. Unfortunately her parents did not like her lifestyle and forced her to get a job as a waitress to pay rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa never made it into college since she had no money and her parents wouldn't pay for her tuition. She was always broke and never passed up a good party. Eventually she had one party too many and fell into drugs. Addicted and desperate for her next fix, Lisa did anything to get money for her next high. She even stole her parents jewelry before they disowned her. Lisa, now out of shape and malnourished, would spend the rest of her life in and out of jail. While sitting in jail suffering from withdrawals, she would always blame the old Lisa for tricking her out of her life as Tammy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa held little Dawn to her chest as the bundle of joy slept, sated after feeding again. This was going to probably be the last time she got to feed her. She had spent the last few days caring for the cute being she\u2019d brought into the world. It was an experience unlike anything else, somehow even more radical than stepping into someone else\u2019s life! She\u2019d recovered a bit of her strength day after day and when she looked in the mirror she saw much healthier version of Tammy than when she\u2019d looked right after Dawn had been born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it hadn\u2019t really been that long since she\u2019d rented out her body, it felt like a lifetime since all this started. In a way, it had been a lifetime, she\u2019d been Tammy for all of Dawn\u2019s life! The Nexus had been nice enough to send a car to bring her and Dawn over to the make the switch back. It wasn\u2019t ideal to have Dawn out in the open so early, but Lisa figured Tammy would want to see her baby quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was stepping out of the car, thanking the driver for helping her and Dawn out, when she noticed a familiar face. Tammy noticed her too and walked over to them, \u201cI guess that\u2019s the baby?\u201d she asked, not bothering to say hello or anything. Lisa was a bit taken aback by that, but introduced Dawn to Tammy, \u201cYes, this little cutie- pie is Dawn,\u201d she said, moving the baby\u2019s hand as though she was waving hello. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDawn? What kind of name is that?\u201d Tammy asked contemptuously. \u201cExcuse me?!\u201d Lisa replied, trying to keep calm for Dawn\u2019s sake, \u201cYou didn\u2019t exactly leave instructions. I did my best for her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m putting her up for adoption as soon as we switch back, I never wanted her in the first place,\u201d Tammy explained, not even bothering to make eye-contact with Lisa or Dawn. Lisa\u2019s jaw dropped. She was about to fight with Tammy, but it struck her that she wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere like that with someone like Tammy. If she was going to save Dawn from a future like that she was going to have to do something drastic. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t switch back?\u201d Lisa asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Lisa started, trying to think of exactly the sort of stuff that someone like Tammy would respond to. Sure, she could go back to being herself and adopt Dawn that way, but if she stayed as Tammy she would be Dawn\u2019s mother in every possible way.  Saving Dawn was all that mattered to her. \u201cLook, Dawn wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for me. If \u2026\u201d the words tasted like ash in Lisa\u2019s mouth, but she had to convince Tammy for Dawn\u2019s sake, \u201c \u2026 if I hadn\u2019t been such a prude and serviced my man \u2026\u201d she gritted her teeth, \u201c\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have gone behind my back and knocked you up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy was flabbergasted, that was pretty much what she\u2019d been thinking herself in Mexico. That was so weird. She wasn\u2019t going to look a gift horse in the mouth though. Before getting knocked up she\u2019d been way hotter than Lisa, but she didn\u2019t look like that anymore, or at least she wouldn\u2019t if she went back to that life. This was her chance to dump all her mistakes on Lisa and never look back. \u201cHa, if you\u2019re dumb enough to want to be a teenage mother you can keep my life. I certainly don\u2019t want it or that baby!\u201d Tammy declared, pointing at the little baby in a pink blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wanted to say something to defend, poor, innocent Dawn, but thought better of it. It wasn\u2019t worth risking Tammy changing her mind. \u201cI do, and I\u2019ll take care of this baby. We should go tell Nexus.\u201d The two women walking inside and informed the company of their decision. They were informed that a procedure would have to be carried out to transfer some knowledge and to complete the transfer between them so they could carry on with their lives as each other. They signed some paperwork and proceeded to transfer rooms much like the ones they had been in before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It hadn\u2019t been an easy transition, but seeing little Dawn sound asleep in her crib made it all worth it. The Nexus had transferred a lot of memories from Tammy into her so she could live as Tammy without raising any eyebrows. One of the more bizarre things she\u2019d gained from Tammy was the memory of the night Dawn had been conceived. Lisa could basically see herself seducing her boyfriend in her former life. It was strange, but it would be stranger still if she couldn\u2019t remember how her daughter came into being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d also gained a lot of Tammy\u2019s tastes. Lisa didn\u2019t notice it at first, but over time it became obvious that she\u2019d changed since the last procedure at the nexus. She no longer liked broccoli, and had more of a sweet tooth, for example. She also gravitated towards more revealing and tighter clothes than before. It had taken some effort, but she\u2019d managed to get her body in better shape. She wasn\u2019t as svelte or athletic as she\u2019d been back in her old life, but she actually found her new curve sexy and she enjoyed showing them off a lot more than she ever would have in her previous life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a single mom left little time for going out and partying, but when she did go outside she enjoyed getting lustful looks from passerby\u2019s. It was a thrill she hadn\u2019t experienced as Lisa, but that she thoroughly enjoyed as Tammy. She also seemed to have gotten Tammy\u2019s knack for flirting and toying with men. Her taste in men had also changed. As Lisa she\u2019d liked clean cut guys, but she was leaning more towards rough and tumble bad boys now that she was Tammy. She kept having dreams of rough and dirty encounter with strangers in some back alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was disconcerting when she first started noticing those changes, but after a while she came to accept this was part of being Tammy and that was the best way to be Dawn\u2019s mother.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Honestly, we do this sort of thing between parents and children frequently, and with the recommendation of a licensed therapist, we'll even do it for children under eighteen. It's often helpful for parents to spend some time in their child's life to better understand their children, and it can be helpful for the child as well. In this case though, it looks like you just happened to fit your mother's criteria for the life she was looking to rent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were her criteria?\" Lisa asked, trying to understand why her mom would be wanting to rent her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they were pretty basic. Young, pretty, going on an interesting summer vacation. I think she just wants to cut loose a little bit, and maybe relive some of her younger years, which isn't uncommon for women her age. The big thing that you need to remember is that for the next ten days, you're going to be <i>Elizabeth Hale</i> and she's going to be Lisa. Since she's going to be on your class trip for most of that time, you don't need to worry too much about interacting with her, but for the next few days before she leaves, it's important to 'stay in character.' Try not to talk to her like she's your mother... and try not to treat her differently than she treats you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that, I guess,\" Lisa said, very nervous about the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the woman replied, beginning to set up the equipment for the transfer. \"Now, if you'll disrobe and settle into the chair, we can get things under way.\"</span></div></div>",

What it could have caused to happen, nobody knew. Perhaps it was a rival organization who was bend on undoing the Nexus. Perhaps it was a college of Magi, not agreeing with the Nexus use of magic. Or it could have been the stupidest mistake ever made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa or Elizabeth didn't know about any of this, they were connected to the equipment and wouldn't realize a thing that would happen. As far as they were concerned they were far away and wouldn't up soon. However they wouldn't leave undamaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nobody noticed a thing, it was a fairly normal procedure. The employees who handled the equipment didn't realize a thing. What they didn't realize was that the computer program used for the transfer was altered. Not to the eye of a the normal user, only a skilled technician would see that a few alterations were made. Who or what caused it nobody knew. But then the circle was altered as well, one of the symbols. One footstep it took to rub out that tiny detail of the symbol. However, they would find out this much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the employees noticed something went wrong, it was already too late. The equipment increased in temperature, it was sucking up electricity like it was a lollipop. Lights flickered around shortening out a few of the computers. Then the circles in the rooms acted up, they lighted like diamonds. Nobody could look at them without being dazzled by the bright light shining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employees ran around like mice running from a cat. Nobody knew what to do, except for the woman Lisa met before. While everyone was running around trying to protect themselves or the company, only she realized the lives of those two women in the rooms next to them. She ran up to the control panel and hit the emergency button. Normally this would reverse the changes made and shut down the equipment. However the emergency button exploded, knocking the woman backwards against a closet. The woman could only stare through the window in front of her, as a burst of energy was unleashed. The glass windows protected the employees from the burst and they could only stare what happened in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was gone, completely gone. The woman still couldn't believe it as she held up a cup of coffee. Fifteen minutes had passed since \"the accident\" as management called it. The woman couldn't believe the moment she saw the burst of energy suddenly disappearing. She still remembered how the bright light suddenly turned transparent and then completely faded away. It was a mystery how it happened. The woman saw the mages in a corner still arguing how it could have happened. They couldn't explain how it happened, the circle was perfectly fine when they inspected it. They argued it must have been the equipment. The woman looked at the other corner and saw how the scientists were arguing as well. The equipment was fine as well, it must have been the magic circle. Both parties were blaming each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head. Nobody seemed to care about the patients inside the rooms. Except for her. The woman put her coffee cup down and walked over to the entrance to the room. She waited there patiently when a young guy in a hazmat suit came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place is clear madam.\" The guy reported. He was probably referring to the level of magic in the air. When someone like her, a non-mage, would enter the room with too much magic in it, the magic could affect her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the patient inside?\" The woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's clear as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, and how did the transfer went?\" The woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man shook his head. \"Not good, there was way too much energy put through. It almost killed them both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly did happen?\" The woman asked. The young man looked around before he told the woman. The woman looked at the man with her mouth still open in shock as he walked away to report to his superior. The woman then prepared herself as she walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did happen?</span></div></div>",

Her head hurts like someone had pulled out her brain and put it in a blender. She still felt a little dizzy as she closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in there <i>Lisa</i>?\" The young woman asked putting the emphasize on her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. What happened? I feel so dizzy and my head hurts.\" She said with difficult. Her throat was parched. The young woman stood beside Lisa as she looked sad at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I don't know what to say. Let me ask you first: do you remember anything what happened?\" The young woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Lisa shook her head. \"I remember lying here and then everything is a blank. What happened?\" Lisa asked noticing the serious expression on the woman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman didn't know how to say it, as she looked uncomfortable. \"I'm sorry to tell you Lisa, but there has been an accident. We're still trying to figure out what exactly happened and what caused it, but something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what is it?\" Lisa asked getting scared now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's best if you take a look in the mirror.\" The young woman said handing Lisa a handheld mirror. Lisa grabbed it as she tried to look at her reflection. In her reflection she didn't see her own cute young face anymore, but the reflection of her mother. She was amazed to see how good the transfer worked out. It was an exact copy of her mother's face, from the little crow's feet to her faded long brown hair to her small lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, I'm supposed to have my mom's life. What is wrong with my reflection?\" Lisa asked confused as she looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa the Nexus didn't only transfer your lives it also switched your bodies. The reflection you're looking at now is your mom's body which you are currently inside.\" The young woman says gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG so you're saying I'm totally my mother now?\" Lisa asked the woman. She shyly nods to Lisa's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't know what to think, she knew she had to take over her mother's life, but this? This was way too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you've a lot of questions, but I've been asked to take you to the director of the Nexus. She can answer all your questions.\"  Lisa nodded as she carefully took a step on the floor. She felt a little dizzy, but she could handle it. The young woman then handed Lisa a bath robe which she could put on. When Lisa looked down she was amazed to see a whole different body underneath her. Lisa quickly put on the bath robe, there was time for looking at it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman then took Lisa to the director's room. In front of the door she stood still. She knocked on it and opened the door for Lisa. \"I think you know the person inside, Lisa.\" The young woman said with a smile. As Lisa stepped inside she saw the director of the Nexus sitting there with a familiar person. That person was her mother in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Elizabeth react to seeing Liza?</span></div></div>",

She stood up from her chair and ran over to her daughter as she hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG mom is that you?\" Lisa asked almost too afraid to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's me. I'm so glad you're alright dear. When the people here told me that you were still asleep I was beginning to get worried.\" She said letting go off Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised I slept this long, if you don't set your alarm clock during the week you would sleep through half the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean <i>you </i>would sleep through half the day.\" Elizabeth pointed out as she grabbed her daughter's hands or rather her former hands. She was so happy that Lisa had been alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you alright too Lisa. Sit down.\" The other woman said pointing to the other chair. As Lisa sat down the woman shook her hand. \"I'm Emma Nail and I'm the director of the Nexus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see both of you alive and well. After the accident occurred we didn't know what would happen to you, we could only wait until both of you would wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you what caused the accident?\" Elizabeth asked straightening her posture. Emma could clearly see she had the maturity of an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still looking into that. But let me say how sorry we are that this happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know a way to reverse this?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shook her head. \"Our scientists and magicians are still looking for a solution as we speak. Nevertheless even if we could swap you back we wouldn't do it yet. The original contract is still intact between you and your mother. She has your identity and you hers, with each other's bodies of course but that doesn't change a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm stuck like my mom?\" Lisa asked a little whiny which sounded odd coming from a 39 year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, you don't have to say it like it's a bad thing.\" Elizabeth reprimanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that you didn't expect this to happen Lisa, but as compensation we are prepared to double the fee you would receive if you only traded identities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well in that case everything is fine with me.\" Lisa said smiling a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Lisa. One of my staff will come to take you to another room, so they can perform some tests. After that you'll receive each other's file and you'll come back here when Elizabeth or should I say Lisa now, has returned from her trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. I'm Lisa Hale for the next few weeks and you're Elizabeth Hale. This is going to be great <i>mom</i>.\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you don't stay out too long and beware of strange boys.\" Lisa said pretending to be her mom grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG I promise.\" Elizabeth said holding up her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled seeing her mom act like her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lisa followed Emma out of the room, she suddenly became aware of the situation. She was her mom now and her mom was now her. It was just like a freaky Friday movie, except for two things. The first one was that they wouldn't swap back within a week and two was that it wasn't some unexplainable force of events but just a machine that didn't quite work as it should have been. Lisa hoped they could fix the thing, spending a few weeks inside her mother's body was something she could oversee; her entire life was something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa followed Emma into an examination room like in a doctor's office. \"If you'll wait here, one of my staff will come by to take some test and hand you your files. I wish you good luck Mrs. Hale.\" Emma added as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mrs. Hale, I never thought I would be called that this soon.</i> Lisa thought as she looked around. It was the same kind of doctor's office like back home, except for how clean the place was. Lisa could see her reflection in the reflection of the tiles underneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her </i>reflection, she just thought. It wasn't exactly her reflection, it was her mom's reflection. But until her mom would return from her trip to Mexico it was Lisa's reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked over to the mirror in the room. It was odd seeing her mother's reflection looking like that. Lisa walked over to the mirror, amazed by how she looked now. Her mother's face right in front of her, with all it's tiny mistakes. While her own face was spotless, Lisa could see her mother's wrinkles from this up close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh, I told mom to let me buy that wrinkle cream for mother's day, I wish I had.</i> Lisa thought mad as she looked at herself. She then made a series of expression, ranging from shocked to seducing to angry. \"And that is it young lady, you got yourself house arrest.\" Lisa said out loud. She had to laugh from seeing her mother act like that, though that ruined the perfect impression of her mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then felt her long brown hair, her mom kept her hair nice, though she didn't want to dye her hair back to full brown. \"Perhaps I could spruce up her hair a little.\" Lisa mumbled as she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you could do.\" A voice suddenly said. Lisa turned around to find a woman around her thirties had entered the room. \"You don't have to be afraid of me, Jenna Sterling is the name though you can call me Jenna.\" Jenna said shaking Lisa's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Lisa.\" Lisa said still a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard yeah, bummer isn't it? First client you get is your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say it.\" Lisa said feeling at ease with the woman already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Lisa, I'm going to do a few little tests with you, just to make sure what changed. What's your full name? Who's your best friend? And what was the name of the last guy you went out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy. My full name is Lisa Elizabeth Hale, my best friend is Megan and my EX-boyfriend was Tom Anderson.\" Lisa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to know.

It's not something that's your fault. But I have to be frank with you Lisa. My colleague who is with your mother has noticed the same thing happening to your mother. You and your mother only have your own memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that bad?\" Lisa asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good and bad news at the same time Lisa. The good news is that in case we need to swap you back, we don't have to worry about memories that would be stuck inside the two of you. The bad news is that it's going to be harder for both you and your mother to act like the other person. Normally we allow skills to switch as well. In your case however we didn't receive any confirmation that happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible, but how are we going to pull this off then?\" Lisa asked frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry Lisa, you and your mother live in the same house. Surely the two of you know things about each other. As for particular skills, well that is going to be a problem to tell you the truth. However, we are not sure yet if skills aren't buried away deeper in your subconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means that if perhaps by doing those things, they might come back to you. Of course if that happens, we would appreciate it if you could contact us then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, is there anything else I need to do or know?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Jenna said looking some more at her tablet. \"You can get dressed up and after that I give you your file on your mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna handed Lisa her mother's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting outside, just call if you're ready Lisa.\" Jenna said as she headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Jenna asked as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I think that it would be better if you would call me by my mom's name, you know to get used to it.\" Lisa said apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll be waiting outside Elizabeth.\" Jenna said with a smile as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a look in the mirror. She would have to take off the robe to change into her mom's clothes. There was no other way. Lisa hoped this was over soon. Lisa opened her robe and let it fall down on the floor. In her reflection Lisa saw her mother's naked body staring back at her. It wasn't exactly disgusting but it was rather eerie. Lisa saw her mother's D-cup breasts hanging on her chest, with a twang of guilt, Lisa realized she admired them. She wasn't as stacked as her mom and even Megan was bigger than her. Walking around with two cup-sizes larger than her own made her rather proud, even though they were beginning to sag a little and were her mom's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked downwards. Underneath her breasts was her tummy. Lisa could see the effects her mother's exercises had on her. Even though she some little imperfections she still looked good for her age. Lisa then slightly touched her mother's, or now her tummy. It was weird to think that she, her brother and her sister all spend their time in here. Lisa then looked further downwards. Her butt was fatter, but well trained. Seeing her mother's vagina she quickly skipped that part and concentrated on her legs. They were tanned and clearly showed muscles, perhaps a little more fat than her own but still looking good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter inspecting her body like that Lisa was ready to get changed. She first picked up her mother's white bra. Putting it on Lisa noticed it's affect on her. She felt it was much easier to walk around. Then she grabbed her mother's white granny panties and put them on. Lisa then put on her mother's pink blouse. As Lisa was butting up she wondered how far she should go. As Lisa felt good about showing something off. Lisa let a few buttons open to show some off her cleavage. Lisa then pulled up the blue skirt and put on her mother's high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Jenna, I'm ready.\" Lisa said as she looked at herself in the mirror. If Lisa wasn't sure she would really thought her mother was standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, if I weren't sure I would really thought you would be Elizabeth.\" Jenna said amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything more I should do?\" Lisa asked.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes they don't feel like it and in other cases they simply couldn't get a minute alone talking. And besides seeing as the two of you have actually switched bodies, you might want to see how your mother looks before going out.\" Jenna explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa could understand that argument. There was a grain of truth in it, at home they simply might not get the chance. Between the antics of her brother and Stephanie following her (or now her mother) all the time, there simply might not be a right moment to just talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lisa let herself be taken to the examination room where her mother was staying at. Jenna told Lisa when they were finished they could just leave. Inside the file there was an appointment card which showed when they would need to be here. Lisa shook Jenna's hand and then entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa entered the room she expected her mother to sit down or just stand around somewhere. What she didn't expect was her mother doing the split in front of the mirror. Lisa's mother was looking in the mirror, surprised by her own agility. She definitely couldn't do this when she was younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not careful you might break it.\" Lisa said as she walked further inside the room.

It's really amazing.\" Elizabeth said as she stood up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that, I'm glad you like it.\" Lisa said as she sat down on the examination table. It was then that Elizabeth first noticed her daughter's looks. \"Wow, this is really odd, looking at my own body like this.\" She said as she touched her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me, it's like I'm staring at some freaky mirror.\" Lisa said looking at her own body fully dressed in the tank top, skirt and flip flops she was wearing earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then noticed Lisa's cleavage. \"Dear, I don't want to spoil this moment, but you're showing way more cleavage than I ever would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom, but it suits you.\" Lisa said as she stared down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that from here, but please dear try not to show too much.\"  Elizabeth said gently warning her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't ignore her mother's request as she closed some buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even when you're me you still telling me what to do.\" Lisa said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it dear, after all I was and am your mother.\" Elizabeth said hugging her daughter. Lisa hugged Elizabeth back finding it weird that she was hugging herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then talked some things over and finally decided to leave the company. Elizabeth had some catching up to do with Megan and Lisa needed to pick up Stephanie from gymnastics. They gave a final hug at the entrance to the company and then went their separate ways.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa sniffed in the fresh air using her mother's longs, she brushed some hairs behind her ears and walked over to the parking garage. On the way over, she came across a group of young men who were hanging around, probably waiting for a friend of them to show up. When Lisa passed by them she could hear them whistle behind her back. One even called out to her to tell her that she was looking good. He was pretty cute, Lisa noticed. Her first reaction was to walk over to him and introduce herself, but then she realized she was inside her mother's body, her mother's almost forty year old body. Hitting on a younger man would probably raise some eyebrows. So Lisa continued her walk to the parking garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the garage Lisa quickly found the family car, since her mother told her where she had left it. When Lisa stepped inside the car, her first impulse was to move the seat forward, but then realizing that her mother was the last one inside it so she didn't need to move it. Lisa then checked the mirrors. Lisa still felt it was odd looking at her mother's reflection in the rear-view mirror, her expression matching Lisa's. Lisa then quickly focused on driving, she was on a schedule after all. She turned the car keys, put her high heeled feet on the gas pedal and off she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa arrived at the gym, she saw her sister sitting outside on the steps of the building with her bag waiting for Lisa to show up. Lisa parked the car right in front of her and honked the horn. It was only then that Stephanie noticed the car and Lisa inside. Stephanie opened the door and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, what took you so long?\" Stephanie asked Lisa. Lisa was supposed to pick up Stephanie earlier, but thanks to the machine switching their bodies, it took longer than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there was like a huge traffic jam a road block, you know?\" Lisa replied. Stephanie looked at Lisa as if she had said something outrageous. It was only then that Lisa realized her mother didn't talk like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, are you sure you're feeling okay? You sounded just like Lisa there for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine, St-sweetie. Just tried acting like your sister, you know.\" Lisa replied. She almost said Steph which was Lisa's nickname for Stephanie. \"How was gymnastics?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stephanie told her about gymnastics and what they did today, Lisa noticed something about her sister's behavior. Normally Stephanie would be a lot more cheerful, but now she was speaking more bland and she was twiddling with her thumbs like something else was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice to hear sweetie.\" Lisa replied as they just stopped in front of a traffic light. \"But I can see something is bothering you, what is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know mom, it's just that...it's nothing mom.\" Lisa noticed the hesitation in Stephanie's eyes. She wanted to tell something, but something made her decide not to tell her. Lisa didn't expect this of her little sister. Normally she would tell her everything, even the things she didn't want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You can tell me anything.\" Lisa said trying to act just like her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing serious mom, and look the light is green.\" Stephanie pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa quickly looked in front of her and saw the light had indeed turned green. She could hear several cars honking behind her already. Lisa knew something was bothering Stephanie, but this was not the right place or time to talk about it. It would probably come up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the rest of the trip Lisa and Stephanie didn't talk much, each busy with their own thoughts. Lisa looking at the road in front of her and her upcoming schedule and Stephanie with her own deep thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at home, Lisa drove the car into the garage. Before Lisa could say anything, Stephanie quickly grabbed her bag and ran out of the car and into the house. Lisa just shook her shoulders and stepped out of the car, thinking about the next item on her schedule which was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa let her shoulders hang as she thought what the next on her schedule was, cleaning the house. Well not all of it, she didn't have to do all of the bedrooms, only her parent's, or should she say her own bedroom. Lisa couldn't wait to check it out, but first she had to do downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed a scrunchy and tidied up her hair. Lisa first grabbed the vacuum-cleaner and began sucking up the dust. Normally she would be rather fast when she needed to do it, but as her mother she was expected to be quite tidy. And besides she knew her mother would probably check out if Lisa did her work right. So Lisa began to vacuum the entire downstairs, going into every nook and cranny she could find. Trouble was only when she hit her head vacuum cleaning underneath the table. Lisa still wasn't used with her mother's length, and hit her head as she tried to move under it. When she was finally done with vacuum-cleaning, she moved on to the kitchen. Scrubbing the floor Lisa realized how hard this was, no wonder her mother wanted to have a little vacation for herself. If she had to do this every day, she would go crazy. Lisa promised herself that when she would get herself a husband, she would make sure he would do chores in the household too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kitchen was finally done it was sparkling as bright as ever, Lisa wondered how she even do it. She didn't have much experience cleaning, but somehow she knew what she was doing. Were these maybe her mother's skills that resided inside her body? They were quite useful. Content with the downstairs Lisa grabbed the vacuum-cleaner and made her way upstairs; as she needed to vacuum the upstairs too. As she was busy Stephanie suddenly opened her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do you have to take this long? I'm calling someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sweetie, it will only take a minute.\" Lisa told her sister. Stephanie rolled her eyes and quickly went inside her room again. Lisa was curious who she was calling. One of her girlfriends or a potential boyfriend? She knew she had to make Stephanie squeal somehow. Finished vacuum cleaning Lisa began cleaning the bathroom. Lisa scrubbed and cleaned everything from the showerhead to the bath they owned. And last but not least she had to clean the toilets, the one upstairs and the one downstairs. While the one upstairs was relatively quickly finished, Lisa could not help but gag as she saw how dirty it was. They had beans last night and of course her brother was the only one to use the toilet and leave those marks. It took almost half an hour before the toilet was all clean again. Lisa would never allow her brother to eat beans again as long as she had to cook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa was finally done she put all the cleaning supplies back in their place and sat down on the couch, tired of all that working. She could feel the pain in her hands and her legs, she hoped it would fade away soon. Lisa then looked at the clock. It was ...., time to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa was relieved when she looked at the clock in the living room. Four o'clock, thank heaven for that. She was almost afraid she had to go straight to cooking dinner. Lisa lied down on the couch as she felt her tired body aching. This was way too much for her mother, perhaps they should split up the chores? So that everyone could do a part and not let one do it all. It would be way better for their mom at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa still lied on the couch as she was thinking what she could do. Her favorite soaps weren't on yet and probably the only things on TV were cartoons and the news. Boring! Lisa wanted to do something fun, something she could enjoy. Lisa suddenly smiled as she remembered what she could do. She stood up again even though she felt her back hurting and hurried up the stairs. She passed Stephanie's room again, where she could her little sister giggling. Lisa's curiosity was still not satisfied, she still needed to find a way to get Stephanie to tell her what was wrong. Normally she wouldn't bother that much with her sister, after all Stephanie would tell her everything. But now that Stephanie wasn't very forthcoming, it stirred Lisa's curiosity. But that would be for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa entered her mother's bedroom. Or should she say her parent's bedroom, only problem was that her father was away so much that it was weird to think of it as his bedroom too. Lisa looked around; the room was bigger than her own. It contained her parents double bed, a built in wardrobe, a vanity table and mirror, a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a small bookcase containing her mother's favorite books. Lisa grabbed one of them and as she read the title she couldn't believe her mother would read stuff like this. This was one of those trashy romantic novels, where the girl falls in love with the perfect gentleman and they go out and marry and end up happily ever after. Lisa shook her head as she put it back again; perhaps she could read one later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood in front of the bed and let herself fall down on it, feeling how her breasts jiggled inside the bra as she fell. Lisa immediately took a liking to the bed, it was way softer than her own and it had this great lavender smile she always liked. This was definitely one of the perks of being her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then stood up again as she wasn't finished yet. There was one thing she hadn't checked out yet, Lisa walked over to the wardrobe and opened it's doors. Lisa took a look around inside the wardrobe. The inside of it didn't look that bad, Lisa found skirts, dresses, blouses and all kinds of different shoes. But inside the wardrobe was something that caught Lisa's attention even more. On the top plank she saw her mother's jewelry box. The jewelry box always had been something special. Her mother saved her most precious jewelry inside it, the kind Lisa always wanted to wear. Sadly Lisa's mother thought Lisa was too young and too rash to be allowed to wear them. Even though Lisa begged and pleaded with her mom, she wasn't allowed to wear any of it. Until now then at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to momma.\" Lisa smirked at the joke she made. She opened the jewelry box and found herself glowing from content. Inside it were a pearl necklace, some nice bracelets and the most expensive earrings she ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the cutest I've ever seen.\" Lisa said as she held them out. But then one of the earrings slipped out of her hand and rolled underneath the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no mom's going to kill me. Lisa thought. She quickly grabbed for the earrings underneath the bed, when she did she felt something else in her hand. It was something big, treasure chest big. Lisa first grabbed the earring and put it on the nightstand before pulling out whatever she was holding. Lisa was surprised to see a chest coming from underneath the bed, a very old one judging from how the wood looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what she keeps inside. Lisa thought. And with only one way to find out, she opened the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa pulled the box from under her mothers bed. Excited, she opened the lip to find a white dress. Pulling in out she then realized what it was. \"Wow it's mom's old wedding dress, er well I guess my old wedding dress now\" Lisa said to herself, feeling weird think that she was now married to her dad. A look of relief came over her face when she realized her father was on a business trip and wouldn't be home for weeks. Happy she didn't have to deal with that mess she held up the dress to herself in front of the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few sizes to small now, it still looked beautiful. Lisa wanted to try it on but new it wouldn't fit. After putting it back where she found it, Lisa walked into her new closet and admired her new wardrobe. Cleaning the house and being out all day made Lisa want to change into something more comfortable. She unzipped the side of her mothers skirt and slide it down her legs. She unbuttoned her pink blouse and let it fall on the floor, already making her moms room look as messy as her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lisa gazed at herself plain white panties and a white Bra. She ran her hands up and down the curves she now possessed. She felt attractive in this body. \"Ya I might have gained a few years but a girl can get used to these\" Lisa giggled as she cupped her new D cup breasts. Unclipping her bra and kicking off her moms panties, she stood shyly naked. Back in the office she didn't want to see what her mom had going on down stairs but Lisa thought it was the time to deal with what she had now. Slowly looking past her new tummy she saw her new vagina. It had kept her old body shaven but her mother choose the opposite as she felt a brown bush of hair run through her fingers. \"I guess the older you get you stop caring plus mom hasn't had any action lately.\" Lisa said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her fingers ran gently over her mothers clit and her whole body jumped. \"Oh wow mom, your pussy is way more sensitive then mine\" Lisa thought to herself. Her hand slowly made her way back down as she rubbed her vagina turning herself on. Her new pussy got wet instantly invited her fingers to enter as she played with herself. Lisa's figures glided in and our and her other hand generally massaged her tits. She thought about how bad she wanted her boyfriend Tom inside her and thought about what he'd do to her mom's body she now had. Her body tensed up and the feeling of pleasure erupted from her new vagina as she came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If my new body is like this with me just playing with myself, then I can't wait to find out what sex is like\" she said with a smile on her face. After she cleaned up Lisa searched for something to wear. Digging through her mothers underwear drawer she found a pair of black panties and a matching bra. Walking across her moms room to the hallway, she looked both ways making sure her sister wasn't there. Lisa bolted across the hall into her old room to find something to wear that she would feel more comfortable in. Lisa found a pair of black yoga pants that her new ass barely squeezed into and a white tank top that was a size to big for her old body but fit her new body perfectly, showing off her mothers cleavage making Lisa feel sexy. \" Maybe I can invite Tom over tonight and see if he can resist these babies\" Lisa grinned as she grabbed her new tits. </span></div></div>",

As she knocked on the door Stephanie  slowly opened it. She looked her mom's body up and down, surprised in the choice of clothes Lisa was wearing. \"What's up mom?\" Stephanie asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa really wanted to find out what was bugging her and seeing she was now her mother she felt some sort of motherly duty to do so. \"Hey Stehp can I come in and talk?\" Lisa said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom what do you want to talk about? Please tell me it's why you're wearing Lisa's clothes\" Stephanie laughed as she sat on her bed. Lisa at first didn't know what to say but then quickly thought \"Well sweetie all my relaxing clothes were dirty so I borrowed your sisters things\". Realizing now that maybe when she gets dressed tomorrow she should stick to wearing her moms things to work. Lisa made her way to the bed and sat aside her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steph can I ask what's bothering you?\" She said hoping get anything from her. Stephanie looked down at the ground and then back up to her Mother. \"Well mom there is this guy and he asked me out tonight, I know you said you dont want me to have a boyfriend until I'm older but I really like him\" Steph said barely making eye contact with Lisa.  A smile grew on Lisa's face as she grabbed her sisters hands. \"Steph of course you can go out with him!\" Lisa stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie became overly excited \"Really Mom! You're the best.\" She hugged Lisa making Lisa feel amazing. \"What's his name and like where did you meet him\" Lisa said forgetting she was in the body of her own mother and acting alittle to much like a teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well I meet him at the gym and his name is Scott\". Stephanie said. She was a bit confused by her moms new attitude but really enjoyed it. \"Mom I'm not sure what happened to you but you're acting really different\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to think quickly because she didn't want her sister to know about the switch. \"Steph....sweetie I just am glad you found a guy and I guess you can say Lisa's been rubbing off on me lately.\" Her sister got up and hugged her mom. \"Ok mom I'm going to head over to the mall, that's where I'm meeting Scott. Don't worry I won't be out late\" Steph said as she made her way out of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked into the living room and turned on the TV. \"I wonder what moms up to, I know I, well now her, had plans to stay at Meghan's. So it looks like it's just me tonight.\" She thought to herself. Just then the phone rang and Lisa ran across the room, feeling her mothers breasts bounce with each step. \"This is Li...I'm mean Elizabeth, may I ask who is calling?\" She stated trying to recover from her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. Hale, it's Tom, Do you mind if I come over to see Lisa?\" Tom asked. Lisa's heart dropped. She wanted to invited him over but knew what would happen if she did. She thought for a moment and knew what she wanted to say. \"Sure thing Tom.\"  He hung up and Lisa waited nervously for him. After about ten minutes the door bell rang. Lisa opened the door to see her on/off boyfriend and invited him in. After some small talk tom asked  \"So Mrs. Hale is Lisa home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa could tell Tom was peering down her tank top at her mothers breasts. She knew in her old body it drove him crazy, so she couldn't imagine what it was doing to him with Lisa having her moms D cups. \"Well yes and no...\" Lisa answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tom asked </span></div></div>",

With one of his hands he starting rubbing Lisa's vagina through the fabric of her tight yoga pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they teased each other their kissing grew more passionate. Tom grabbed Elizabeth's great ass that Lisa now possesed. He couldn't believe he was about to go all the way with his girlfriends mother. The more they made out the more wet Lisa grew. She struggled to get off the tight yoga pants she squeezed into earlier but her boyfriend assisted her as he took off his clothes.

Lisa wondered if she was starting to develope her mothers traits. Tom shifted Elizabeth's body forcing him to be on top of Lisa now. He ripped off her panties now noticing Elizabeth's unkept pussy. Lisa suddenly realized and felt alittle embarresed. Tom took note and said \" babe I don't mind, now how bad to you want it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed his penis and guided it into her mothers tight pussy. The deeper he drove his rod Into her the more pleasure ran through her body. \"Oh god tom I haven't had sex in months, give it to me\" Lisa moaned uncontrollably.

Lisa grabbed his back and kissed him as he pumped faster and faster. \"Call me Elizabeth!\" Lisa screamed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God Elizabeth you're so tight\" Tom moaned as he felt Lisa's new vagina squeeze against his dick.

The doctor then explained \" the tests we ran showed us the more you act like your old self 'Lisa', your mothers body adjusts to your actions but also her personality tries to take over to guide you back.\" Lisa sat down and listened some more. \"You see Mrs. Hale now that you've had intercourse with your old boyfriend you're body has become used to it but in return you've gained something of hers. You don't feel right being called Lisa do you?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought about it and felt as if her name was really Elizabeth. She new it once was Lisa but it didn't feel right being called anything but Elizabeth. \"You're right. It doesn't feel right. My name is Elizabeth Hale\" Lisa stated feeling 100% that it was the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we suggest that you don't do anything to crazy. If you do you might not know what next you might pick up from your mother. You can still have sex with Tom because the damage has been done there but try to do your best to stay to your mothers routine\" Janice instructed. Lisa agreed and they both discussed a few minor details. \"Check back in with us if anything changes and we'll call you if we get things fixed here\" the doctored stated. After hanging up Lisa cooked herself dinner and went upstairs to her new room. She took off her clothes and slide on her mothers nighty she always wore to bed. Laying down she had more time to think. She tried to force saying her name was Lisa Hale but all that came out of her mothers mouth was \"I'm Elizabeth Hale\" no matter how hard she tried. Rolling over she felt the weight of her mom's breasts and a few aches and pains she wasn't used to. \"Guess this comes with being old\" she sighed. Then it hit her. If acting like her old self affected her then it would do the same to her mother. It was already extremely late so she'd have to wait until her 'daughter' got home in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shined through the window of Elizabeth's room on  Lisa's face. Rolling out of bed age walked over to the woredrobe and slide on her mother's normal  pair of pink granny panties and a pink lace bra. Knowing it was the day her mom vulentreed at the college she thought she'd wear something more proffesional, not wanting to gain anything else just yet of her mothers personality by dressing like her old self. She decided on a black skirt suit with a light pink blouse she'd seen her mom wear before. Sliding on the heels she had on the other day Lisa looked in the mirror. \"You ready for today Elizabeth?\" She asked herself. After pulling her hair up she made her way down stairs into the kitchen where to her surprise she saw her old body at the dinner table eating breakfast. Lisa was half exicited and half scared hoping her mother wasn't changed at all. \"Lisa how are you feeling this morning?\" Lisa asked her mother in her body. </span></div></div>",

Lisa finished her breakfast and started doing the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth seemed a little bothered like something was wrong. \"What's wrong hunny?\" Lisa said looking at her old body. Elizabeth sighed and said \"Like mom does this mean I even have to get dressed like you? It's whatevs but I  mean like your bathing suites are alittle more revieling then I would like to wear\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down at the table Lisa adjusted her moms skirt and grabbed her daughters hand. \"Lisa dear you have to dress as I would or something might happen again. We already are talking like each other. What if we switch sense of style? Do you really want me in your body dressing in tight tank tops and yoga pants? If I keep dressing like my old self then my new body might adjust and then I'll be 37 dressing like an 18 year old and vice versa. \" Lisa asked. Lisa wished she didn't have to dress like her mother but she didn't want to switch back and have her mothers sense of style dressing in skirt suites and blouses once they get back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totes right Mom I guess like I have to dress the part too\" Elizabeth said as she got up and made her way to her daughters room. Once inside she packed a bag of towels and sun screen and drove over to the beach. Once she arrived Elizabeth met up with Megan to go swim suit shopping. \"Hey Lisa let's hurry up and get a bikini so we can like start our tans.\" Megan said. Smiling, Elizabeth was kind of excited to go shopping. She hadn't done something like swimsuit shopping in years. \"Sure things Megs I'll like find something totes fast.\" Elizabeth stated still feeling weird about not being able to control the way she was talking like a teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the store Elizabeth found one she liked and a perfect outfit to match. Getting in the dressing room Elizabeth undressed and say her new body in the mirror. Still getting used to having smaller breasts, she did love how perky they were.

As she admired her choice of clothes, Elizabeth was unaware what was about to happen until it was to late. Lisa had warned her not to stray to far from each other's life in fear of the nexus guiding them back. One moment Elizabeth was very happy with her choice of mature clothes and the next moment a weird feeling ran through her as she inherited Lisa's sense of style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked herself up and down. In her mind she screamed \"oh no what have I done! I can't have the style of a teenager!\" But what came out of her mouth was \"um like what I'm I wearing...a one piece like totally gross\". She made her way back into the store and found a royal blue bikini. Trying it on Elizabeth said \"like so much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time that this happened Lisa pulled up to the college her mother worked at. Thinking to herself as she got out of the car and pulled her mothers blazer on Lisa said \" I wish I didn't have to wear so my layers. And these heels are killing me\". Just then a shiver ran down Lisa's spine. An odd feeling came over her then everything felt normal. \"Oh no mom must have diverted from my life but what did she do?\" Lisa asked herself. She walked into the library lisa set her purse down and was met by her co-worker Julie the Liberian. Julie smiled as she greeted Elizabeth \"Good morning Elizabeth you look very nice today\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost uncontrollably Lisa heard her mothers voice say \"why thank you very much, it's my favorite outfit.\" It was then Lisa knew what her mother had done. She glanced at the wall mirror and Lisa loved what she saw. She felt mature and professional and wondered why she was appossed to dressing like this earlier. Deep in her mind the real Lisa was thinking \"great now if the nexus calls today and says we can switch back today I'll be stuck talking and dressing like my mother....at least I don't have anything else of herself..yet. We need to switch back tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day of working Lisa made her way back home. Kicking off her heels she sat and watched her mothers favorite soaps in fear of watching MTV would change something until her mom got home. Hearing the door open Lisa jumped up and ran to the door, feeling her mothers breasts bounce with each step. Not to her surprise Lisa found her mother wearing short shorts and a tight v neck with a blue bakini underneath. Lisa put her hands on her mothers wider hips and said \" Lisa sweetie we need to talk right now.\"  Elizabeth rolled her eyes and already knew what it was about \"like fine mom whatever.\" Obviously her teenage hormones starting to take a toll. \"No not whatever young lady, first we are forced to talk like each other and now dress like one another. We have to be more careful.\" Lisa said sound more and more motherly. Elizabeth looked at her old body wearing what used to be her favorite light pink blouse and black skirt. \"You're like tots right mom I mean I know I used like love dressing like that but the thought of it like grosses me out\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa started getting alittle frustrated with her now daughter. \"Don't you get it dear if we switch back then you'll be in your old body dressing and talking like me.\" The phone rang and Lisa picked it up. \"This is Elizabeth\". A smile grew on Elizabeth face that Lisa now possessed. It was the Nexus calling. After the call she hung up the phone and looked at her daughter. Elizabeth worried said \"um like whats did they say\". Lisa stated......</span></div></div>",

That's totally unfair.\" Elizabeth wined even surprising herself as she placed her hand on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is dear, but until they have fixed everything we can't risk switching bodies back. I can see myself talking like you, but dressing up as you is going a bit too far.\" Lisa said as she gently smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally right of course.

It's going to be totally awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure yet, but there might be some things.\" Lisa replied. Of course she was thinking about inviting Tom over again. After a day like this, she could use some relieve. On the other hand she could try to do something her mother would do normally. She would need to think it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as it was almost dinner time Lisa had to cook dinner now. Elizabeth would have loved to help her, but seeing as it wasn't part of Lisa's routine she just lay down on the couch as she was watching television and texting with Megan. Lisa however pouted as she was cooking their dinner, not even having the chance to relax. It was hard work but Lisa was surprised how good the casserole came out. Luckily her mother's subconscious memories helped her a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa and Elizabeth sat down they were the only one. Stephanie was staying over at her new boyfriend's house (Lisa making sure to text to come home on time) and Martin was eating with a friend of his.

She saw several dildo's in several shapes and sizes, there were egg shaped vibrators, several string beads and some very suggestive lingerie. She knew her mother was lonely but she never expected her to resort to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was holding a piece of lingerie in her hand when she heard a voice saying: \"I'm home!\". That was her voice or rather her mom's voice now. Lisa quickly shut the chest and pushed it back underneath the bed. She would check it out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then brushed off her skirt and went downstairs where she saw her former body lying on the couch texting someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...<i>Lisa</i>.\" Lisa told her mom. \"So how are things with Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everything is good.\" Elizabeth replied focusing on her texting. Lisa frowned at her mother for doing that. Her mother always told her not to do that, but she was now the one ignoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice to hear.\" Lisa replied. \"Well, I better get down to making dinner. Want to help me...<i>Lisa</i>?\" Lisa asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"I can't help you now mom, I have some important texting to do.\" Elizabeth replied as she stood up and walked upstairs leaving Lisa all alone to fend for herself. No matter, she wouldn't cave in. After all, Lisa should have some of her mom's cooking skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hurried into the kitchen and decided on something easy to prepare such as spaghetti. Lisa prepared the pasta and the sauce at the same time. At moments Lisa was unsure what to do next, but her body seemed to know which steps to take. Forty-five minutes later and Lisa was finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, dinner is ready.\" Lisa shouted to above. At the same time her brother stepped inside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where were you hanging out?\" Lisa asked Martin suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill mom, I was just hanging out at Tony's place.\" Martin told her. Tony was one of Martin's oldest friends, but also one of his perviest friends. When Tony would come over, she caught him several times checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like that boy.\" Lisa told Martin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" Martin asked Lisa confused. Elizabeth loved the boy as he usually paid her compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I don't like it that he keeps you over so long.\" Lisa corrected herself. At that moment Elizabeth and Stephanie entered the kitchen so things were smoothed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was weird to say the least. Lisa still couldn't believe it as she saw her body sitting opposite her, talking and joking like she usually would. It felt like an out of body experience seeing Lisa's body acting so giddy and excited. </span></div></div>",

Good luck Ms. Hale.\" Emma added as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ms. Hale, I haven't been called that a long time ago.</i> Elizabeth thought as she looked around. It resembled the doctor's office back in their hometown, though Elizabeth was positively remarked how clean the place was. She could see her reflection in the reflection of the tiles underneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa's reflection or my reflection for now</i>, she thought. She was only borrowing her daughter's body for the time until she'd get back from Mexico. But until then, it was hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth noticed a giant mirror in the corner of the room and walked over to it. Coming face to face with it was just a shock as when she woke up. Lisa's face instead of her own face with it's wrinkles. But now Elizabeth could touch her face without coming across any wrinkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will get some using to. Elizabeth thought as she looked at herself. She looked at her face from every corner; touching her perfect white sparkling teeth, using her eyelashes to seduce someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth then felt her shoulder length brown hair, her daughter always kept the same hairstyle. \"Perhaps I could spruce it up.\" Elizabeth said to herself hearing her voice had changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you could do.\" A voice suddenly said. Lisa turned around to find a woman around her forties had entered the room. \"You don't have to be afraid of me, Jenna Maya Wallis is the name though you can call me May.\" May said shaking Elizabeth's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.

What's your full name? Who's your best friend? And what was the name of the last guy you went out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's easy. My full name is Elizabeth Stephanie Clark-Hale, my best friend is Maggy and my current husband is Robert Hale.\" Elizabeth told the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know.

She'd known that someone would most likely want to rent her life during the trip, but this was the first time she was directly confronting some of the important parts of her summer vacation she would miss. This would be her last vacation with Megan before college.... and other people would be living it. \"Well, I guess that makes sense. I hope she has a lot of fun in Mexico then. So, how does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's pretty simple,\" the woman said, gesturing for Lisa to proceed into one of the small rooms off the hallway. \"You'll need to change into the robe there, and we'll take your clothing over to Ms. Landal.

At that point, we do all the work to make sure you have all of the skills you'll need to live Ms. Landal's life for the next two weeks, and that people think you are her and vice versa.

After that, you get dressed in the clothing she wore here, drive off in her car, and spend the next two weeks being her while she vacations. There's a packet of information that we've compiled to help you live her life, just like the packet you helped us put together for her to live yours. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You said I shouldn't talk to her about things... is there a reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For the most part, it's because it creates confusion. It brings the client out of their escape, and even while they are living your life, they have to 'be their real self again' to talk to you. It's a bit dissonant, and stressful, and if other people over hear the conversation, it can get very awkward. Our general advice is to keep your interactions minimal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, that makes sense,\" Lisa said, neatly folding her clothes and settling down into the chair. \"I guess I'm ready then.\"</span></div></div>",

A voice suddenly counted down and then the lights went on. Lisa closed her eyes immediately, her eyes were too sensitive to look straight into the bright lamp on top of her. The door suddenly opened and a woman around her mother's age came inside. She looked worried as she looked down on top of Lisa and asked: \"Tell me what is your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, Lisa Hale.\" Lisa answered. The woman looked shocked, and Lisa wondered what was wrong. And why did her voice sound different? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Lisa asked getting scared. She felt herself getting panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I'm Emma Nail director of the Nexus. Now I want you to relax and slowly breath in and out.\" Lisa nodded and breathed slowly in and out. She felt how she got calmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay now?\" Emma asked Lisa. Lisa nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let me tell you Lisa, that we never had a thing like this happen before. Our team is still looking to try and figure out how this could have happened. For now let me say we don't know what caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened?\" Lisa asked getting concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa when you were hooked up with Ms. Landal you were supposed to get each other's life, she yours and you hers. But something went wrong. The machine transferred a lot more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lisa asked her voice getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you would have swapped just lives, you would just keep your own body only when you would look into a reflection of yourself you would see some of the things that were important in that other person's lives. Instead of that, you and Ms. Landal have switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa heard that, she felt like a rock hit her stomach hard. This couldn't be true, this couldn't be happening. Emma grabbed a handheld mirror and held it in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed the mirror and noticing her hand she took a look in the mirror and felt her hart stopping for a second. In the reflection she saw an EXACT copy of Wendy Landal's face. Short black hair, a chubby face and when she smiled she saw the braces Wendy had. Lisa felt around her face and saw in the mirror her reflection doing the same thing. This really confirmed it, she hoped it might be a trick mirror, but when she looked at her hands she knew they were not hers. Her fingers were more chubby and pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thoughts were going everywhere as she didn't know what would happen. What would they do now? How long would it take to fix this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might have a lot of questions, how about we go to my office and talk about it?\" Emma suggested. Lisa nodded a little. She sat up but then she felt a dizzy spell. She relaxed her breathing and slowly stepped down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good Lisa, you don't have to walk fast, just take your time.\" Emma suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Walking felt a bit odd, Wendy's breasts were larger than her own so Lisa had to straighten her back more to not being pushed down by the weight of those. She even felt how her breasts would jiggle with every step she took. Her hips were bigger too. She realized how Wendy must feel when she walked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emma opened the door to her office. \"I think you know this person rather well.\" Lisa walked inside the room and the first thing she noticed was the person that was standing there. She recognized that brown hair, that physique and that face pretty well. It was her old body. Lisa was staring at her old self looking at her expression. Wendy was...</span></div></div>",

Am I stuck like this?\" \"Now Ms. Hale, you did rent your life to Ms. Landal, this is vaguely similar.\" Emma retorted. She paused a moment. \"Now as I was saying, we're not sure how to fix it, but our team have an idea. It would be a risk, but if you're willing to trust them, then we can give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anything.\" Lisa blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually as we're on Ms. Landal's dime here, she gets to make the decision.

Lisa found it weird to see herself standing over there. \"I'm happy you woke up, I told the doctors my mom sometimes complains I'm too lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, It really is you, Wendy.\" Lisa said walking closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am and I'm so sorry about this Lisa. I just wanted to feel like what it is to be one of the popular girls around and have a great time. I didn't think this would happen to us.\" Wendy said as she held out her dainty hands to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect this either.\" Lisa said turning a light shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma noticed the awkward moment between the two teens. \"Let's sit down for now, shall we?\" She asked. As Lisa and Wendy sat down she noticed the differences between the two girls. While Lisa sat down on her chair keeping her back up against the chair, Wendy began to slouch a little. So far the transfer didn't seem to have switched all things...yet. \"We're glad the both of you are okay. We were a little worried that you took longer to wake up then Wendy, but perhaps she was right and is it her sleeping habit. We're looking into it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fix us, right?\" Lisa asked as she moved her tongue against her braces she now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma puts her glasses off as she grabbed a piece of cloth from her pocket. \"To tell you the truth girls, this is the first time this has happened here. Our engineers and sorcerers are still figuring out how it happened and how to reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what to do now\" Wendy asked looking at Emma almost crying. Emma could see Wendy was a shy girl who wasn't strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment we don't plan to do anything with you two. I understand that this is more of an exchange than you had signed up for, but in effect, you'll both have no difficulty fully living each other's lives for the next two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me?\" Lisa asked as she pointed at Wendy's overweight body. \"I didn't sign up for this.. I mean it's cool to be bigger, but... what if we can't change back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, I understand where you're coming from,\" Emma said gently. \"But look at it this way. You're also getting an upgraded experience. And, since we understand that this is a bit more, um, intense than what you signed up for, The Nexus is willing to match Wendy's rental fee, dollar for dollar while you're in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's okay,\" Lisa said, still very unsure about where things were going. \"And in two weeks, you'll be able to swap us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" Emma said. \"We'll need you to both take some tests today, and for the next two weeks, we'll be following up with each of you regularly. Once Wendy's back from your vacation in Mexico, we'll work on getting you two swapped back. Who knows... if we can replicate this, you may be the first of our clients to offer a whole new level of service,\" she said getting excited. \"And believe me, we'd pay you for that, very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess so.,\" Wendy said, standing up slowly as she stretched herself feeling a little loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw Wendy noticed this and stood up from her chair and hugged Wendy. \"It will be alright Wendy. This will all work out, you'll see. And besides you get to stay inside my body, isn't that what you always wanted?\" Lisa asked Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose.\" Wendy said looking away from Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then cheer up, we have to make the best of our times. So enjoy your time and I will do my best to enjoy mine as well.\" Lisa said with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Emma said as she stood. \"In that case, if you'll each follow me, I'll show you to the exam rooms where we have a few tests to run before you each go home.\"</span></div></div>",

She felt really bad. Almost as if someone tried to suffocate her. Breathing was harder. Lifting her arm was harder.<br>\r\n\"I thought there would be no physical alterations..\" she said. <br>\r\n\"I am not supposed to talk about that, Miss Hale, but Miss Fraser will lead the...negotiations from here on if you would now please follow me.\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Lisa asked she got up.<br>\r\n\"Katarina for you\" she said smiling. <br>\r\n\"Katarina, Ok, am I supposed to go in the gown??\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, you could try fitting in your clothes but...that would be a waste of time and since we aren't a clothing store...\" <br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't they fit me any---\" Lisa wanted to ask but midway she has noticed her legs....<br>\r\nBefore toned like those of an athlete their diameter had doubled, even though, by closer observation you could tell that they were still the same length. <br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" she shouted. <br>\r\n\"I was told only skills would be downloaded! Since when is fat a skill?!\" she got louder. <br>\r\n\"You know, I just got a good education and snatched this easy and high payed job, I don't know what those machines or do or what the magic does, which is why I want to bring you Mrs Fraser, she will talk with you and Wendy.\" Katarina said, still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa understood that there was nothing she could change by talking with or cursing at this lackey, so she let herself get lead into a room with a big desk, an important looking chair behind it and two simple/plain chairs infront. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Lisa Hale, good to see you! I am Kalista Fraser\" said the woman in the important looking chair, \"please take a seat besides Mrs. Landal!\" she pointed at the left Chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa did as she was asked. She could now see Wendy clearly. She looked still a bit messy and she was in the gown too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might have noticed that there was a...accident..that happened while you were supposed to switch lives.\" Kalista said, \"as a result of the swap your fat (she looked at Wendy) was transferred to you (now she looked at Lisa)\"<br>\r\n\"So far so obvious\" Lisa mumbled annoyed. <br>\r\n\"This happened because in case of an error the security system takes every string of fate and reattaches them, but fat is not fate, so the security system didn't recognise it as a swapped trait.\" Kalista went on \"But law wise, no renting has occurred yet, and all parties, including you, Miss Landal, my company and you, Miss Hale are bound by contract to make the transaction happen. In other words we will try to swap your lives again.\" <br>\r\nWendy's and Lisa's face showed mixed impressions. <br>\r\n\"We will increase your payment since you are basically providing an extra service you didn't sign up from the beginning, and it won't cost Miss Landal more than it was supposed to from the start.\" Mrs. Fraser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Wendy suddenly started \"If I drop out I will only lose my deposit...and you couldn't make me participate in experiments to reconstruct things the way they were?\" <br>\r\nLisa's eyes widened in fear...would she really?.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", Miss Fraser said, <br>\r\n\"Due to the technology having only been licensed recently there are still lots of holes in the trait-property laws  you wouldn't be obliged to help the company or Miss Hale anymore.\" Mrs. Fraser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Wendy started \"Lisa, you have always treated me............\" </span></div></div>",

She has trained for years to be able to stay the top cheerleader of the school and now? Nearly every part of her body had at least doubled in size!

Then he unfolded it and revealed the size \"XXL\". He didn't have to add another word.<br>\r\n\"If you now please would get dressed, tomorrow will be the actual swap..\" the young man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis female colleague meanwhile had a similar discussion on the other side of the wall, just was the person she talked a lot happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa still wasn't sure if anyone was messing with her, but she had to get dressed now! It scared her how all the gigantic clothes fitted like tight gloves.<br>\r\nShe had come in in skinny jeans but skinny jeans in XXL...that's nothing anyone wants to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she checked her wallet everything was still the same...except for the double chin on her drivers license...<br>\r\n\"I gonna have to find Wendy!\" Lisa thought, and it was all she could do, after all she was the only one who remembered things how they really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Lisa catch Wendy in the Foyer of the Nexus? </span></div></div>",

She mentioned that she thought it would be a great way to spend some time with Megan before she heads off to college in the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa said, letting the information sink in for a moment. She'd known that someone would most likely want to rent her life during the trip, but this was the first time she was directly confronting some of the important parts of her summer vacation she would miss. This would be her last vacation with Megan before college.... and other people would be living it. \"Well, I guess that makes sense. I hope she has a lot of fun in Mexico then. So, how does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple,\" the woman said, gesturing for Lisa to proceed into one of the small rooms off the hallway. \"You'll need to change into the robe there, and we'll take your clothing over to Mrs. Rhodes. Then, lie down on the chair in the center of the room and relax. At that point, we do all the work to make sure you have all of the skills you'll need to live Mrs. Rhodes life for the next two weeks, and that people think you are her and vice versa. During the process, you'll be asleep. When you wake up, for the next two weeks, you will be Mrs. Rhodes, and she'll be Lisa Hale. After that, you get dressed in the clothing she wore here, drive off in her car, and spend the next two weeks being her while she vacations. There's a packet of information that we've compiled to help you live her life, just like the packet you helped us put together for her to live yours. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I shouldn't talk to her about things... is there a reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part, it's because it creates confusion. It brings the client out of their escape, and even while they are living your life, they have to 'be their real self again' to talk to you. It's a bit dissonant, and stressful, and if other people over hear the conversation, it can get very awkward. Our general advice is to keep your interactions minimal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes sense,\" Lisa said, neatly folding her clothes and settling down into the chair. \"I guess I'm ready then.\"</span></div></div>",

She felt herself getting panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I'm Emma Nail director of the Nexus. Now I want you to relax and slowly breath in and out.\" Lisa nodded and breathed slowly in and out. She felt how she got calmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay now?\" Emma asked Lisa. Lisa nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let me tell you Lisa, that we never had a thing like this happen before. Our team is still looking to try and figure out how this could have happened. For now let me say we don't know what caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened?\" Lisa asked getting concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa when you were hooked up with Mrs. Rhodes you were supposed to get each other's life, she yours and you hers. But something went wrong. The machine transferred a lot more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lisa asked her voice getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you would have swapped just lives, you would just keep your own body only when you would look into a reflection of yourself you would see some of the things that were important in that other person's lives. Instead of that, you and Mrs. Rhodes have switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa heard that, she felt like a rock hit her stomach hard. This couldn't be true, this couldn't be happening. Emma grabbed a handheld mirror and held it in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed the mirror and noticing her hand she took a look in the mirror and felt her hart stopping for a second. In the reflection she saw an EXACT copy of Heather Rodes her face. Curly long blond hair, a fake tan from the times she used the sunbed, and the short nose job Heather got on her birthday. Lisa felt around her face and saw in the mirror her reflection doing the same thing. This really confirmed it, she hoped it might be a trick mirror, but when she looked at her hands she knew they were not hers. Her hands were more wrinkled and her long fingernails were covered in red nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thoughts were going everywhere as she didn't know what would happen. What would they do now? How long would it take to fix this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might have a lot of questions, how about we go to my office and talk about it?\" Emma suggested. Lisa nodded a little. She sat up but then she felt a dizzy spell. She relaxed her breathing and slowly stepped down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good Lisa, you don't have to walk fast, just take your time.\" Emma suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking felt a bit odd, Heathers breasts were larger (because of breasts implants) than her own so Lisa had to straighten her back more to not being pushed down by the weight of those. She even felt how her breasts would jiggle with every step she took. Her hips were bigger too, showing the signs of childbearing. The weirdest thing was when she thought how Megan came out of this body. She felt herself smile thinking how their relationship was much deeper now than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma opened the door to her office. \"I think you know this person rather well.\" Lisa walked inside the room and the first thing she noticed was the person that was standing there. She recognized that brown hair, that physique and that face pretty well. It was her old body. Lisa was staring at her old self looking at her expression. Heather was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lisa,\" the real Heather said with a small smile. It looked so strange to Lisa to see someone else speaking with her face, hearing her voice from someone else. \"I'm glad you're okay. They were worried when you didn't wake up as quickly as I did, but I think that's just because I'm a deep sleeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O. M. G.\" Lisa said, staring at Heather across the room as the other woman moved in Lisa's body. \"It really is you isn't it Mrs. Rhodes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" she said with a growing grin. \"And Lisa, let me say how much it means to me that you were willing to let me rent your life in the first place. I feel like Megan and I have been growing apart lately, and I really wanted to spend the time with my little girl before she's gone. But I never thought this,\" she said, gesturing to Lisa's toned young body, \"would happen to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" Emma said, taking a seat in her office behind her large desk. \"Why don't you both sit down and we can discuss this.\" Waiting for the two women to take a seat, Emma watched them closely as they moved. Already it was obvious that Heather was having an easier time in Lisa's body than Lisa was in Heather's... but that could simply be because a younger body was easier to adapt to... or because Heather had woken up nearly twenty minutes before Lisa had. Either way.... \"First off, I'm glad you're both okay. We were very worried Lisa when you didn't wake up immediately and we're still looking into that, but for now, I'll take Heather's suggestion and run with it. There are several other details that we need to discuss though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fix this, right?\" Lisa asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Emma said after a deep breath. \"I think so. But I don't know for sure. Like I said earlier, this has never happened before. We're going to need to take things slowly to make sure we don't cause more problems. Right now, I'd like to start with some very short term plans, and give the engineers and sorcerers some time to get things sorted out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" Heather asked, leaning back in her chair and crossing her legs. Every inch of her eighteen year old body shouted a maturity that Lisa didn't yet possess, from the relaxed posture to the tilt of her head. She radiated a confidence that had to be hard to feel, and was well beyond the years of Lisa's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, I don't want to try doing <i>anything</i> with you two until the term of your rental is up. I understand that this is more of an exchange than you had signed up for, but in effect, you'll both have no difficulty fully living each other's lives for the next two weeks. If anything, Mrs Rhodes is going to enjoy an even more real vacation from her own life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about me?\" Lisa asked, gesturing to Heather's enhanced body with her gleaming red nails. \"I didn't sign up for... this. I mean... it's cool to be older and all Mrs. Rhodes, but.... what if I can't change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I understand where you're coming from,\" Emma said gently. \"But look at it this way. You're also getting an upgraded experience. And, since we understand that this is a bit more, um, intense than what you signed up for, The Nexus is willing to match Heather's rental fee, dollar for dollar while you're in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's okay,\" Lisa said, still very unsure about where things were going. \"And in two weeks, you'll be able to swap us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" Emma said. \"We'll need you to both take some tests today, and for the next two weeks, we'll be following up with each of you regularly. Once Heather is back from her vacation in Mexico, we'll work on getting you two swapped back. Who knows... if we can replicate this, you may be the first of our clients to offer a whole new level of service,\" she said on an excited note. \"And believe me, we'd pay you for that, very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled,\" Heather said, bounding out of her chair in a spurt of youthful enthusiasm that she'd refrained from displaying thus far. \"For the next two weeks, I'm Lisa, and you're my best friend's mom! You're the best,\" she finished, flinging her arms around her former body and giving Lisa a giant hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Lisa melted into the hug, smiling a bit herself. The extra money was nice.... but honestly, she didn't care. Seeing how happy this was making her best friend's mom was worth it. After all, how often could you do something this amazing for someone? \"It's settled. You have a good time now, you hear me young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG,\" Heather said, imitating Lisa's manner from earlier. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Emma said as she stood.  \"In that case, if you'll each follow me, I'll show you to the exam rooms where we have a few tests to run before you each go home.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking both women down the hall and deeper into the building, Emma dropped Lisa off in a room that looked much like the exam rooms at a doctor's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I mean, Mrs. Rhodes,\" Emma said, gesturing to the exam table in the room. \"If you'll have a seat here, one of our staff will be with you shortly. I'll make sure they bring your clothes as well so you can get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lisa said. Taking a seat on the table, she waited only a few moments after the door closed before getting off the table and standing before the full length mirror in the room. The reflection that gazed back at her was a familiar one, she'd seen Megan's mom plenty of times, but it was a completely different experience seeing it from this angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before the mirror, she took a close look at her face. The makeup was superbly well done, applied with a light hand that covered the minor imperfections of her skin without trying to build an artificial layer on top of it. Her lips were lush and full and covered in a deep red lipstick that matched her manicured nails. \"I'm glad they thinned out a bit after she got the injections last year,\" Lisa said, running her new tongue over the lush lips. \"She looked like a pucker fish for days until the swelling went down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Heather's voice when she spoke still felt very strange, but she was glad that Heather had never been a smoker. She could only imagine the kind of voice she'd have if she had been. But Heather took good care of herself. She might have had a little work done, but she hadn't been hard on her body. Her face was aging gracefully, and her tasteful makeup allowed the faintest of wrinkle lines at the corners of her eyes to show. The cute, pert nose was an improvement over the crooked nose that Mrs Rhodes had been born to, and the absence of the slight bump at the bridge of her nose seemed to open up her face and allow for a better look at her deep blue eyes. The roots of her bright blond hair showed a darker, dirty blond, but here to she could see that Heather had only enhanced what nature had given her. She was a natural blond, just not quite as vibrantly so. \"I guess I'll need to touch up the dye job too... that will be something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine there are going to be several new things for you to experience for the next few weeks,\" a soft female voice said from the doorway. \"You must be Lisa,\" the speaker continued as she stepped into the room. \"My name is Cynthia,\" she finished extending a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa, but then, you knew that,\" Lisa said, looking over the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was shorter, and for a moment, Lisa wondered how anyone who was an adult could be that short until she remembered that Heather was 5'10\" and that meant Cynthia was probably only an inch or two shorter than Lisa herself usually was. Cynthia wore her flame red hair in a short pixie cut that suited her diminutive stature and petite frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've already heard it, but we really are sorry about this. I've just got a few questions to ask you, mostly to figure out how extensively the transfer worked, and then I'll help you get dressed and on your way. To start, why don't you tell me your birthday, middle name, and the name of your favorite teacher in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy. I was born May 25th, my middle name is Elizabeth and my favorite teacher in school was Mr. Stein.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good,\" Cynthia said making a few notes. \"When is your electric bill due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually around the 15th of the month,\" Lisa said automatically. \"But I always pay it by the tenth, along with the cell phone and water bills. Wait... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... We were a little worried about that,\" Cynthia said looking over the sheet. \"Remember, part of the program is to give you the skills you'd need to live the life of whoever is renting yours. If Heather had been a mechanic, you'd know how to fix cars. But Heather wasn't a mechanic. She's been a stay at home mom since college. At home, she does most of the cooking, the shopping, manages the finances, volunteers....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying I got her skills? But, it was supposed to do that right? So this is a good thing isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, and no. Remember, this is uncharted territory for us. In some ways, it would be simpler if it was a 100% pure transfer of minds. But now, some of her is tangled up in you, and you're tangled up in her body.... It means we're going to have to be very careful about putting you back into your own lives. We'll know more once we find out if Heather still knows how to do the things you know now how to do. Normally, you'd gain those skills only as long as the spells and enchantments are active and you'd lose them once you're back in your own life... but if she's lost them and you've gained them, that's something else new. We'll just have to see.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cynthia asked several more questions and was able to determine that while Lisa had none of Heather's full blown memories, she had taken on many of her skills. In addition to the skills needed to run the house hold, Lisa was able to demonstrate a knowledge of Yoga that she had never possessed, she knew all of the best boutiques in town to shop at, and her skills in makeup and hair styling had improved significantly. Cynthia was convinced that there might be other skills Lisa had gained, but she had more than enough data to analyze for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, at this point, you can go ahead and get dressed Lisa,\" she said as she put away her clip board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Um, maybe you should start calling me Heather,\" Lisa said hesitantly as she stood up. \"So I can get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Mrs. Rhodes,\" Cynthia said with a smile. \"Here are your things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShedding the robe she had been wearing, Lisa took another moment with the full length mirror to look at her new body before she began getting dressed in Heather's clothes. It had felt so strange to be in someone else's body and she'd been so scared they couldn't fix things that she hadn't taken time to appreciate just how good of a body Heather had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were incredibly long and shapely. They, along with the rest of her body, were nicely bronzed with an even tan that completely lacked tan lines. Lisa knew that in addition to the Yoga, Heather ran in several charity marathons, and it showed in every aspect of her legs from the firm and slender calves to the toned and full thighs. Her hips and waist were another matter. A few faint stretch marks could be seen across her stomach from her pregnancy with Megan and a stubborn layer of belly fat seemed to cling to her mid section and hips giving her a fuller and more womanly figure. Her waist still tapered nicely as it led up towards her ribs, but she found herself surprised that Heather hadn't had any liposuction here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were her breasts. Clearly, they had been enhanced, They were a bit too full, a bit too round to be natural. Still, they had a pleasant sway and jiggle, and they sagged just enough to feel.... almost natural on a woman of her age. She lifted her hands up and cupped them, feeling the weight and the way they moved under her hands. Her large nipples perked up quickly at the attention and Lisa blushed in embarrassment, quickly ending her self inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning at last to the pile of clothes, she began by sliding on the tiny strip of lace fabric that was Heather's preferred thong style of panties. Lisa had always preferred boy shorts, and it felt odd to have the underwear ride so far up her ass. Next was the matching black lace push up bra, and she couldn't help but chuckle when she saw the label. \"36DDD... and it's a 'cleavage enhancer?' These breasts need more enhancing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think it more as a way to put them in the right place than to make them look any bigger. But after all, if you've got it, flaunt it, right?\" Cynthia said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Cynthia turned next to the pair of comfortable black short shorts that Heather had worn, finding them comfortingly familiar  at least to begin with. The size eight shorts were larger than anything she had ever worn, but when she got to her hips she found that she had to tug and shimmy slightly to pull them all the way up. Once she had them on, she could feel them compressing her softer and larger ass into a shape that would stop traffic dead. Not that her ass was all jiggle and jello, but much like her midsection, she was a bit surprised Heather hadn't had any lipo there. Finally, she pulled on a bright pink tank top with a deep scoop neck that showed off her upthrust cleavage and a hint of the black lace bra beneath. A pair of high heeled sandals, a silver ladies watch and a matching white gold and diamond pendant finished her look. \"Well, how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Rhodes, if I wasn't straight, I'd be asking for your number before I let you leave. You look very nice. Here's your purse,\" she said, handing over the designer hand bag. \"Wallet, keys to your convertible, cell phone, it's all there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a few moments to sort through the purse, finding it slightly difficult to handle her wallet with such long nails. The stack of credit cards was impressive, as was the few hundred dollars of loose cash, but what stopped her in her tracks was the driver's license. \"I'm thirty five. No, wait... is that really when her birthday is? Just three weeks away? That's just a month before Megan's birthday. I knew that she was young when she had Megan, but I didn't think she was that young. Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you'll just have to plan her birthday party then, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Thank you Cynthia, is there anything else before I go?\"</span></div></div>",

You two have each other skills, but not memory so if you have something you want to say to her now might be the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded although at the moment she couldn't think of anything she wanted to say to Heather. This was all going real fast. Cynthia led her away from her examination room to another room. Cynthia invited Lisa to get inside, if they were done talking they could find her at the reception.<br>\r\nInside the room Lisa saw Heather looking at herself in the mirror. Lisa felt her stomach flutter when she saw herself dressed in the blue tank top, jeans and flip flops from before. If she didn't knew any better she was looking at a very realistic mirror, only she wasn't inside it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather noticed Lisa had come in. \"Lisa good to see you. Hey you're looking good.\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thanks.\" Lisa answered a bit shy. The girls both sat down next to each other on the examination table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctors thought it would be best if we talked a little bit you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. What do you want to talk about?\" Heather asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, I don't really know. Everything about our lives are probably in the files we made.\" Lisa then thought of something that was bothering her. \"Well there is one thing.\" Heather looked up hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you and your husband, you know sleep with each other?\" Lisa asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked down at the flip flops she was wearing. \"You mean if we're having sex on a regular basis? No, we don't anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt a little blush coming. \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" Inside she felt a little glad though, having sex with someone else their husband didn't seem that attractive to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, you couldn't know. I mean you were probably thinking why else does she have plastic surgery. No, David was and is a great man. He's a good father to Megan. Sometimes too good, if you ask me. Especially when you and Megan get into trouble. He has his job of course, which involves a lot of time. He's a hard worker. When I got pregnant with Megan, he quit his study and began working for us both. He started out as a simple construction worker and through hard work he became the general manager before starting his own construction company. Of course that meant more work and less time for us, and that's why the cosmetic upgrades to enjoy myself with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Lisa said hearing this story. She felt a little sad for Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, you can't do anything about it, it's just the way he is. I still love him and he loves me, but in a different way than usual.\" Heather said hugging Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want you to know that if for some reason he wants to do it, just go for it. Now don't look that surprised. It's after all my body, and since everyone will see us as Lisa and Heather I expect you to act like me. And believe me when we were younger he could do some things you wouldn't say about a man like that.  But if things don't work out and you want to let out that sexual energy, check my file. I have written up some things you can do.\" Heather said with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went immediately red hearing this. Heather began to laugh. \"That's the first time I've seen myself turn red. It surely doesn't suit me. But come on Lisa you're a grown girl, you must understand a girl wants her needs fulfilled sometimes. I have never done some of the things I writ down, but perhaps I will like it too when we return to our own bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stood up from the examination table and said with an air of confidence: \"And don't think I will hold back just because it's your body. I'm going to have some fun myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, but don't get any AIDS or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Heather answered positive. She then looked curious at Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've a question or rather a favor to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if you could pull off your tank top for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked confused. \"Sure but what for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To check myself out of course. I mean I've always been holding those double D's on my chest, I now want to see how they look from this point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought it a bit strange, but maybe looking that good would make you curious like that. She pulled the tank top off as Heather asked for. Lisa could see how Heather stepped up closer looking at them, deep in thought. Lisa was shocked when she saw the look on her old face. It was the same look she had when she was looking at something interesting. Her friends had shown photos when she was doing that. \"This is really weird, she thought, <i>but somehow real kinky when you think about it</i>. What was that? Lisa couldn't think about what just happened when Heather suddenly grabbed her breasts as she weighted them in her hands. \"I never knew I could look this sexy. Thanks Lisa.\" Heather stepped away and Lisa pulled her tank top on. She quickly tried to forget that thought she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go?\" Heather asked Lisa. Lisa nodded and they went out the hall into the reception area where they were being waited for by Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you two. Did you have a nice talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure did.\" Heather answered for them. Cynthia then handed them the information packages they had written before. All the details about their lives was written in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll see you girls back in two weeks, we have your cellphone numbers and we have written ours in the information packages in case something urgent comes up. Enjoy it girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Heather replied with Cynthia leaving them. The girls were now standing there in front of the entrance to the Nexus, while other people went in and outside. When they would walk through that door outside they would have to pretend to be each other. Going back to their homes in their own cars. Heather seemed unsure what to do and to say, but Lisa grabbed Heather and gave her a big hug. This was a private farewell between the two of them. They would see each other at the airport when Heather and Megan would fly off, but this was different. Lisa let out a tear which dropped on Heather's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't cry, it will be alright.\" Heather promised Lisa. \"You just have fun being me, and enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I will try. You too.\" Lisa said sniffing. When she let go, she saw Heather had been crying too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be these teenage hormones.\" She said smiling through her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is.\" Lisa said smiling too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Heather then opened the double doors together and stepped through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa took a deep breath of air as she walked over the parking area, the high heeled sandals clicking on the streets. This was her new life now. Not only did she have Heather Rodes her life, she also had her body. Though it was weird to suddenly be taller than before, being Heather felt like she was wearing a second skin or something like that. And besides if things had gone well she would still end up as Heather. Thinking about her hugging Megan in a motherly way inside her old body, made her smile. Maybe this wasn't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't have to look long for \"her\" car. Though there were a few convertibles, Lisa recognized the shiny white one as Heather's. Megan took her once for a ride in that car. It was also the last time Megan was allowed to drive it. Crashing into a dumpster would do that. Man did she get punished for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stepped inside the car and put her bag and the files on the passenger's seat. She then pulled her seat belt on, carefully making sure that her breasts were not in the way. A look in the back mirror confirmed her new look and trying not to look any further she put the car in her reverse and carefully turned out of her parking space. A last look at the Nexus building and she went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't do anything but smile wide as she drove. She was driving a 174 miles per hour, her hair was getting messed up through the wind. This was amazing. She giggled as she passed an old Fort. This was the real life. This wasn't looking as bad as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Too bad though</i>. Lisa thought as she entered the street where Heather lived. <i>Maybe when I have some time off, I can take a ride again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa drove up the entrance way. She thought that it must be somewhere in her purse, and.. found it. With a push of a button, the garage door opened automatically for her. She drove the car inside the garage and still had her hands on the wheel as the garage door closed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm here, I'm really here now</i>. Lisa thought. Now she had entered the lion's den. Could she pull this off? Would Megan really believe that Lisa was her mom now and her mom her best friend? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothing I can do about it now</i>. Lisa picked up the files and her purse as she stepped outside the car. The garage was spacious, there was room for another car. Lisa carefully opened the door to the hallway. \"Hello somebody home?\" Lisa didn't hear anyone responding. \"Thank god.\" She spoke out loud. She then remembered it. David was surely still at work, and Megan was going to Lisa to go shopping for new bathing suits. Lisa made her way to the living room, put the purse and the files on the sidetable and sat down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The couch is much more softer than before.</i> Lisa thought as she moved a little. She then realized it was her ass that was more softer now. Lisa looked around the room, David and Heather sure had good taste. A few classic paintings were hanging on the wall, some potted plants and the side table was made of glass with an interesting design. Though Lisa missed something, but she couldn't put her finger on it. Maybe she would remember it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm here, I might as well get busy.\" And so Lisa began to...</span></div></div>",

The dining chairs were expensive but comfy, the table was made of a dark wood with an elegant bouquet on the middle of the table. Next to it was the kitchen. Lisa was surprised how clean it looked, it was like nobody used it. Lisa opened the refrigerator and saw it was packed full.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nGuess the kitchen is clean because of Heather's cleaning skills, lucky I have them now</i>. Lisa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had already been into the garage so she decided to go upstairs. Going upstairs Lisa felt how her breasts jiggled with every step she took. It was a bit annoying as she looked down automatically. She hoped Heather had some other clothes to wear as well. Standing in the hallway Lisa was automatically drawn to Megan's room. She hesitated a little as she was about to enter her best friend's room or should she say daughter's. But then it was her daughter now, nothing serious for a mother to look in her daughter's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa held the doorknob in her hand but when she tried to move it, she found it was locked. Megan must have the key with her. Guess she wasn't going to look around in there. Lisa moved on to her and David's bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Was all that Lisa could say when she entered the room. It was huge, and not just that. The walls were painted grey with some white decorations. The double sized bed looked comfier than the one her parents had. Lisa put off her sandals and let herself fall down on the bed. It felt like she was lying on feathers, if she wanted she could sleep immediately. Lying on the bed made her do it almost, but then she looked opposite of her. She immediately stood up as she walked over to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Lisa mumbled out loud. It was a walk-in closet! Lisa could feel her eyes almost bulge out. Tops, dresses, skirts, underwear and the shoes. She could tell there were about twenty pair of shoes, ranging from high heels to boots. Lisa was wondering how she could ever find an outfit to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was here, Lisa could try to change into something else perhaps?</span></div></div>",

There wasn't much to do here now, so Lisa left the bedroom. There was only one room she hadn't entered yet, and that was the bathroom. Opening the door Lisa was once again stunned by the luxury. A huge bubble bath was placed in one corner, while the other corner contained an usual shower cabin. Lisa sat down on the side of the bubble bath. She was now Mrs. Rhodes so nobody would mind if she took a bath in this thing. She always wanted to! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the medicine cabinet, containing the usual things but Lisa also noticed medicines against depression (who would take those?). She quickly closed the cabinet. She had the feeling she wasn't supposed the notice that. She quickly hurried downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had made a round through the house, what should she do now? She still hadn't looked through Heather's file.

You better don't give me a lecture next time I don't go.\" Megan opened the refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know honey, but today was a bit hectic.\" Lisa told Megan. \"Besides you \"forget\" cheerleading practice most of the time.\" Lisa muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say mom?\" Megan asked before she continued drinking her water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, so how was shopping?\" Lisa asked curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did real good, me and Lisa. We both got ourselves new bikinis.\" Megan throws the bottle away and walks over to the main hall. When she returns she has a bag with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada.\" She shouts as she reveals her bikini. The first thing Lisa thought was: Wow. Megan held it in front of herself and Lisa could see how good the bikini would suit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks wonderful, Meg. I mean Megan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom, thanks.\" Megan puts the bikini back in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't sure if she should ask, but she was a bit curious. \"And what did Lisa buy?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan raised her eyebrow about her mom asking about Lisa. Normally her mom wouldn't be that interested in her best friend. She then pulls out her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've got it here somewhere.\" She swipes for five seconds when she finds what she is looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here mom, take a look.\" Megan said holding the phone out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the picture, it showed Lisa or actually Heather inside Lisa smiling at the camera.

Heather was smiling at the camera as she posed in a seductive way, lowering her cleavage to the camera. Lisa usually would wear a normal bikini when going to the beach. She always had, so there was never any reason to try something else. Clearly Heather didn't agree with Lisa. Heather was wearing a bandeau bikini, a pure pink one. Heather must have picked a cup size smaller than Lisa's as the top part allowed a small but beautiful cleavage to be formed. The bottom part however was what surprised Lisa the most, the only thing it covered up was her private part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, I would never expect <i>Lisa </i>to do something as daring as that, but I have to admit it does suit her. Her legs are way better shown than some of the other bikini's she has worn before.\" Megan commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think that <i>Lisa </i>should dress more revealing?\" Lisa asked Megan curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I always tell her not to, but to tell the truth I think she should.\" Megan sat down on the table as she looked at several other pictures she took. \"She's way pretty and most of the guys in school loved the way she looks. But it's so plain, and I think that if she would show off a little more, I know she could get way more popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Lisa said a little shocked about this sudden revelation. Lisa always hanged out with Megan, they were best friends. Megan told Lisa a few times, she should pick something else, something more daring, but Megan never made a point about it. How it turned out different than she thought. <br>\r\nMegan looked at Lisa curious. \"What is it mom? You told me yourself you thought Lisa could be way more attractive if she dressed up more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did? Yeah I think so.\" Lisa didn't feel well, so she sat down on a chair. \"Mom, do you feel alright?\" Megan asked concerned as she approached Lisa. \"No, it's okay, just a headache, I'm sure it will pass away. You just go do your thing, Meg-an.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, but be careful.\" Megan walked out of the kitchen and up to her room, probably to listen music. Lisa was alone in the kitchen, still thinking about Megan's words. Did she really dress that bad? Could she have been way more popular if she dressed different? But that isn't  just who she is, or was in this case. Lisa was a feminine girl, but she didn't dress like girly girl like some other girls she knows.  She didn't like to show off too much, because her parents didn't raise her that way. And the fact that she didn't wear high heels that often was, because she was afraid of hurting her feet. With her cheer leading, dancing, and cross-country the well-being of her feet are way more important than the thought she would look nicer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that was the case, now Lisa Hale's body was inhabited by Heather Rhodes, a woman who showed off way more skin than Lisa did. Lisa felt herself a little nervous about the thought of how Heather would look like her now. Seeing her wearing the bandeau bikini, it was clear that Heather wasn't afraid to show off. <i>It wouldn't be too bad, would it?</i> Lisa thought.</span></div></div>",

She'd spent most of the day shopping with Megan and it had been the most magical time she'd ever spent with her daughter. There hadn't been that strain between them of needing to remain a role model and parent and she'd been able to just cut loose and have fun with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the pile of clothing bags in the corner, she wondered what Lisa would think when they switched back in two weeks. She had wound up using much of Lisa's savings on a marathon shopping trip and wardrobe update, but she figured that the double payment from the Nexus would offset the way she'd splurged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, she'd acquired several mini skirts, and ultra short shorts, along with a few push up bras and tight fitting tops to show off what the bras pushed up. She'd been amazed that Lisa didn't own anything showier when she first looked into her closet. Her fashion sense was all wrong for her body type. Being this short and slightly built, she needed to wear shorter skirts and shorts to make her legs seem longer and push up bras should have been her daily normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of finding what she should have in her closet though, she'd found an assortment of skinny jeans, loose t-shirts, and very basic plain cotton bras and panties. That, however, was a thing of the past. Once they traded back, Lisa would find her closet significantly updated with the sorts of things that a hot young girl her age should be wearing. At least, should be as far as Heather was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, on the bedside table, Lisa's cell phone chirped with a text message.

I'm sorry. Can we talk?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather paused for a long moment, staring at the text. Part of her wanted to tell him to fuck off... he sounded a lot like the worst parts of her own marriage and she didn't need to spend the next two weeks of her vacation dealing with a younger version of David. But... David never, ever, had abs like she saw in Lisa's pictures of Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa: I'm still angry,</i> she typed, figuring it was probably true. <i>What do you want? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tom: I know you're angry babe.

She could feel herself getting wet at the notion of having this strapping young stud wanting to 'make up' with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa: Dinner,</i> she texted back. <i>Somewhere nice,</i> she added. <i>And maybe, if you're really, really sorry...</i> she stopped short and hit send. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed. Then two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tom: If I'm really sorry?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa: If you're really, really sorry, then maybe you can make it up to me at Sherard Point</i> she sent, naming a popular makeout point overlooking the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tom: Okay. Olive Garden? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather tried not to let her head bang off the head board as she slumped back into bed. She'd been thinking Earth, or The Attic or... well, any of a dozen high end restaurants that David had taken her to over the years. Places that had a dress code. But... for eighteen.. Olive Garden was probably a 'nice' dinner... besides, it wasn't like they were old enough to need somewhere with a good wine cellar anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lisa: Okay. Pick me up tomorrow at 6:00,</i> she texted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tom: Awesome! Love you babe. TTYL.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sighed as she put the phone down. Tomorrow, she'd go on a date with a high school foot baller... she'd go out to the local makeout point and she'd find out if Mr Abs and Arms was good enough to put up with as a boyfriend during her vacation. After all... with Lisa's body and her skills to drive it, if he wasn't, she was sure she wouldn't have any trouble finding a replacement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then though, she definitely needed a replacement for tonight. Fumbling in Lisa's night stand drawer she fished out the small, compact vibrator that Lisa's parents didn't know she owned.

A few hours ago she was still reading Heather's file when suddenly David walked inside. He was surprised how she was still dressed like that and that they were having dinner in half an hour. How could she have known that? She only read the general details of Heather's life. Lisa was amazed how much stuff Heather wrote for her. <br>\r\nSo Lisa had to get up dressed real quick. She didn't have much time to choose carefully, so she chose for a classy evening gown with a split and five inch heel pumps. She quickly put on her make-up though she made some finishing touches, she wasn't even aware off until she was finished. Some expensive looking earrings and she was ready. When she came downstairs Megan was already gone, probably to get herself some food. David then drove off with her for the Attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was amazing. Not sloppy burgers and fries like with Tom but caviar and lobsters. It tasted much better than she thought and the wine too. Lisa never drank wine before, but when she took her first sip it was familiar sensation to her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just was engrossed in an article dear. I forgot the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy that you still got it.

Lisa just nodded. David then left the table to answer the call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew, that was close.</i> Lisa couldn't believe how frightened she was there. David looked so serious at her. Those amazing brown eyes pierced right through her. Lisa was almost afraid he knew something was off about his wife. Of course that wouldn't be possible, but you never know. After all it wouldn't be possible to swap physical bodies and here she was in Heather's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked around herself, when....</span></div></div>",

Bye,\" he finished hanging up his phone. \"I'm sorry honey,\" he said, turning back to Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" she said with a smile, trying to pretend that she hadn't been listening to every word. \"It sounded important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't really,\" he said with a sigh. \"Rick shouldn't have panicked when L&amp;I called him... he should be able to handle this while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone?\" Lisa asked gently. There hadn't been anything in the information that Heather had given her to indicate that David was going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's what I wanted to talk to you about at dinner tonight,\" he said. \"Look, lately... we haven't been great as a couple. I feel like we're cohabitating more than we're living together. So, I want to do something about it. I've already talked to the Hale's, and they've agreed to watch Meagan while we're gone. I've booked us at a special resort for the next two weeks. I think... if you're willing to do this, then at the end of two weeks we'll know if we still have a marriage to rebuild... or if we should look at getting a divorce to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in Heather's augmented chest, Lisa felt her heart skip a beat. <i>Divorce?</i> she thought. <i>Is it already that bad between them?</i> Taking a deep breath, she couldn't help but smile a little bit when she saw David's eyes drop instantly to her inflated cleavage before rebounding to her face. <i>It can't be over if he's still looking at her like that,</i> she thought. \"What,\" she started hesitantly. \"What kind of 'special' resort is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\nWhat kind of resort has David booked for them?<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: An intensive two weeks that combines a resort vacation with structured activities and couples therapy to rebuild their marriage and rekindle the lost romance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something akin to the reality show 'Temptation Island' where they'll have opportunities to date other people and see if the grass really is greener or if they value what they've had more. </span></div></div>",

She knew David was a sweetheart and doing this for his wife showed that he really cared about their relationship. Lisa was touched by it, even more than she realized. As David was finished explaining the resort, he looked at her with an intense gaze that she had never seen before in a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask you once again Heather Rhodes, do you want to go through with this?\" David asked holding her hand. Lisa didn't wasted a second with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, David, if this will bring us closer to each other again, I'm willing to go for it.\" Lisa said smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Heather, I know this is all of a sudden, but I don't want to see our relationship going through the drain.\" David said sounding relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, and I'm very glad that you arranged this thing.\" Lisa said smiling as she lowered her cleavage a bit more. Lisa saw how David was taking a peak inside again. She then realized what she was doing. <i>OMG did I just try to flirt with him? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes how about some more wine?\" David asked noticing Lisa caught him staring. The rest of the evening was pleasant, making small talk, talking some more about the resort. Lisa felt at ease with David opposite her, though it might have been due to the wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact she didn't remember a thing about the trip going back home. She was now sitting in the car with David next to her. Lisa stepped outside the car and felt a little wobbly. David asked her if she would like to take his hand, but she refused it. Lisa had never felt better. It was like she could take the whole world. With careful steps she walked over to the front door. There she removed her high heels, glad to be rid of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then made her way upstairs, going directly into the bathroom and removing her make-up. And why would she wear it anyway? She was still hot. \"I'm sexyyy.\" Lisa slurred. She then made her way into the bedroom. David was already lying in bed, dressed in a pair of blue striped pajama's. <i>What hideous colors.</i> Lisa thought. In fact Lisa thought David would look better wearing nothing at all. It was then that she realized she wanted him. She wanted him inside of her. There was only a tiny sliver of doubt remaining. </span></div></div>",

She slowly took off the dress, trying not to show that she was watching David. Lisa felt her crotch slowly getting wet, she felt horny as she thought about how David would be inside of her. It was like her body was dying to being held by David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather are you almost finished?\" David asked curious while he was reading his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost.\" Lisa slurred. She was now standing there in her panties and bra. <i>Not for long though. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then walked as sexy as she could towards David. His eyes were now darting between the book and her.

I think your wife needs her medicine.\" Lisa said with a coy smile. She then reached out for David and kissed him on his mouth as her tongue reached deep inside him. David was confused but most of all excited. How long has it been since they had sex? A few months? But should they continue? Wasn't it more important to restore their relationship first before having sex again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Heather, please, I can't go on with this. Think about it, if we do this now who knows where we'll end up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, your mouth says yes, but your little friend here says something else.\" Lisa said smiling as she reached down inside David's boxers. She then moved the pajama bottom and boxers in one tug down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my big friend. Oh how I've missed him, I'll remind him of who I am.\" Lisa said. She then took David's penis inside his mouth. She had given a blow job once to Tom. This time it was different. It was like her body knew how to pleasure him fully. How her hands began to massage the base of his penis while her tongue moved around like a snake tighten his prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather, you haven't done this since college.\" David said with trembling hands. His mind was divided. He wanted to move Heather's mouth away from his crotch but at the same time he didn't want Heather to move away. As Lisa felt how David's penis began to twitch, Lisa wanted to move away from David but she suddenly felt David's hands holding her down as he blew his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn't believe what he just did. After college he promised himself he would never let his lust take control over him. What had he done? He wanted to apologize to Heather, but then Heather looked at him with a strange expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice. Is there more?\" She asked naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt how his member rose again. He pushed Heather down on the bed and gave her the biggest kiss he had given her yet. Heather didn't seem to mind, instead her hands grabbed his back not wanting to let him go. As he entered her Lisa finally felt her pussy being fulfilled. It was like it missed David's penis as it squeezed down David's penis. \"I love you Heather, I love you.\" David said as he moved inside his wife's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" Lisa told him as she grabbed him again. The night continued on and Lisa and David couldn't let go off one another.

Looking around the room Lisa noticed this wasn't her room, but whose was it? Lisa looked at her right to somehow find Megan's dad lying next behind him, completely naked Lisa saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did she sleep with him? That couldn't be, even though Megan's dad was one of the nicest men she knew, she wouldn't just sleep with the man. He was way older than she was. And what was up with this headache? Lisa rubbed her temples to try and clear this fog inside her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that when she looked down she saw her body had changed. Her skin was more appealing and her breasts were way bigger. Then it all suddenly clicked together inside Lisa her mind. How she and Megan's mom not only swapped lives but also bodies thanks to the Nexus. Then when she came home Megan's dad, now her husband David, took her out to dinner that evening. How he wanted to get them a vacation with counseling, to rekindle their love. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Lisa thought. She stared at the sleeping man next to her. Things were still a little vague but Lisa remembered something about giving a blowjob. What was she thinking at the time? Here David was trying to rebuild his relationship with his wife on a spiritual level and instead of supporting him she acted like a common whore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt a bit queasy inside her stomach. She wasn't sure what caused it, the heavily drinking or her reminding the fact that she sucked off her best friend's dad. She needed to clear her mind. Lisa grabbed a bathrobe from the indoor closet and quietly went downstairs. Perhaps coffee would clear her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen she switched on the coffee machine and a few minutes later she was enjoying her caff\u00e8 latte . Normally she wouldn't like having milk in her coffee, but somehow it tasted better than it usually did. Lisa just stood there and stared out of the window, trying not to think about anything.</span></div></div>",

She really did not want to see him right now. What happened yesterday was all a big mistake, the drinking, the horny feelings. It's like she wasn't in control of herself then. But now she was back in control and she found herself feeling guilty already. What if David didn't want to make it up anymore, thinking his wife was a slut that only wanted sex. Lisa could never forgive herself if Heather and David would get a divorce, it would be terrible for Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally David came inside the kitchen, wearing a bathrobe as well. \"Morning.\" He said as he made his way to the coffee machine. \"Morning.\" Lisa replied still embarrassed. There was an awkward silence as the only sound came from the coffee machine. When it was finished, David took his cup and sat next to Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's cup was almost empty, but she didn't want to walk over and get a refill, so she just stared at the cup. She didn't know what to say, what could she ever say to make David forgive her for her behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you feel?\" David asked finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible. I think I drank a little too much yesterday, and you?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing well myself. I have to say I feel like a different man now.\" David said taking another sip of his cup. \"About yesterday night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know David, I'm sorry about that. I acted like a slut and I know you don't like it and I...\" Before Lisa could muster any other word David put his finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I say something about that as well?\" David asked. Lisa nodded as David removed his finger from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a weird day yesterday, but when I look back on it, I just have to say it was....perfect.\" David said with a smile on his face. Lisa looked at him like she saw water burning. \"I mean it Heather. When I asked you out yesterday, I thought you would have another excuse ready as always, but this time you really went for it. Dressing up like that you know. And then the dinner itself, we haven't spoken like that in months. And then the sex. Heather, I really liked it. I really did.\" Lisa looked shocked hearing this. \"Usually I would be the one that took the initiative, but this time roles were reversed. I know how you like it if I take the lead, but it was a nice distraction for once that you got to be in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You really thought it was okay, and what about the blowjob then? You don't think I was too\" Lisa asked concerned not sure if that was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slutty?\" David asked. \"It surprised me sure, but it made me remind us of when we were younger. In fact..\" David then whispered in Lisa's ear: \"I wouldn't mind doing it again.\" David's hand slowly went underneath her bathrobe, trying to undress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was unsure what to do now. Should she go with it and enjoy herself with David or should she wait and first get her vacation counseling before having any more sex?</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't normally masturbate in the morning but something about being inside Lisa's body made it more exciting.

As she played with the family jewels though, all those worries melted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she was climbing on top of her euphoric husband, feeling the weight of her breasts as she lowered herself onto his stiff member. Lisa felt her sensuous body shiver with anticipation as she moved up and down his shaft. She tightened her grip on him and smiled as he grunted in near drunken stupor. David grabbed hold of her hips and guided her demandingly up and down, pushing her into even greater frenzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in less than a day David filled his wife and he felt like he was on top of the world. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to start our day!\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started, dear\u201d Lisa replied. The two of them spent a good bit of the morning in much the same fashion as they\u2019d spent the previous night.

It wasn't until Angela turned the radio off she was aware what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This keeps on getting better and better.\" Heather smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have enough data for now. You can dress yourself now Mrs. Rhodes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh please, call me Lisa, after all that is my name for the next few weeks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you would like, Lisa.\" Angela handed Heather Lisa's clothes to wear and exited the room to give her privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all the commotion of not only swapping lives but bodies as well, Heather didn't even have the chance to take a good look at Lisa's body. So before putting on all her clothes, Heather unwrapped the robe to take a look at it. And she had to say it looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's legs were perfect examples of what sport could do for your body. Her ankles were firm and slender while her thighs were toned. Her hips and waist sizes were perfect, not too fat and not too skinny. Heather moved her hands on Lisa's tummy or should she say her tummy now; it felt good not to carry any of that baby fat anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather then noticed her breasts, or lack of them. They were b-cups she guessed, not as full as her old ones but they were pretty for Lisa's figure. Heather squeezed them a little to check how sensitive they were and she wasn't disappointed; her vagina was slightly wet. Heather quickly stopped checking herself out for now, Angela might be looking at her right and there would be other times to do it more in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather turned to the pile of clothes Angela left for her. She fished out a pair of boy shorts that were Lisa's favorite. Heather smiled at the thought that she had been wearing a thong this morning. Lisa would be in for a surprise. She put on the boyshorts feeling them covering her entire butt, not that sexy but she could change that. Heather then put up on Lisa's bra, a plain blue one. \"Guess I'll need to go bra-shopping too.\" Heather smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to the tight jeans. They were smaller than her own size, and she was surprised when she slipped into them so easy. She hasn't worn something this tight since high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she put on a white cami. which showed off her skinny figure, and some black falts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it. I'm \"totally\" ready for it.\" Heather said looking at her reflection one more time. If she didn't knew any better, she would say that the real Lisa was in the room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela seemed to have notice that Heather was ready. She gave Heather Lisa's purse which contained a few bills, chewing gum, her driver's license and some scrunchies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm ready for it, time to see the world again. Is there something else?\" Heather asked Angela.</span></div></div>",

All around her, several employees of The Nexus were scurrying around, testing pieces of equipment, and pouring over printouts. No sooner did she begin to sit up than a woman close in age to Lisa's mother stepped over to her and laid a hand on Lisa's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy my dear,\" the woman said, pressing gently on Lisa's shoulder and easing her back into the chair. \"You've been through quite an event, and there's been more strain on your body than you might be realizing just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it like that every time?\" Lisa asked, placing a hand to her aching head. \"My head really hurts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not like that every time. Here, let me get you something for that headache, and we'll speak more in my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you,\" Lisa said, taking a pair of pills and a small glass of water from another of The Nexus employees. The employee helped her from the chair, and then left her in the care of the older woman who took Lisa's hand and began guiding her down the hall. A few turns later and they entered a door with the name \"Emma Nail, Director\" scrawled in neat script on the frosted glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I offer you a drink? Scotch perhaps? I tend to prefer something stiff myself after an intense magical experience,\" Emma said after showing Lisa to a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer gin,\" Lisa said automatically, then placed a hand over her mouth. \"I mean, I'm not old enough to drink... where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what I'm going to explain in a few minutes, but trust me, you'll want the gin,\" Emma said, pouring a stiff portion and dropping a pair of ice cubes into the glass. After pouring a finger of scotch for herself, she took a seat on the other side of an impressive desk from Lisa and began to explain. \"I need you to understand a few things before I get started. First, what happened today has <i>never</i> happened at The Nexus before, and we're still looking into <i>why</i> it happened, but for now, that's a question I can't answer. We're still sorting out all of the <i>what</i> that happened, but I think we have a much firmer grasp of that than we do the <i>why</i>. The second thing I need you to know is that we're here to help you, whatever that takes or whatever that means. Something went wrong, and it's our fault and we'll do whatever we can to make it right. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm scared,\" Lisa said, taking a sip of the gin and relaxing as the familiar flavor soothed ragged nerves. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't tell for sure what started it, and I don't know if it would have happened with or without the procedure, but, in the middle of the process, Heather Rhodes went into cardiac arrest. She died very quickly, and without the reality of her life being connected to her body. Further, your life was not yet connected to her either. At that point, the sum total of her existence, along with the sum total of yours, both became attached to you. Now, some parts of those existences don't settle well with each other, and some parts do. More than that though, some parts seem to be... coexisting in a way that defies logic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly does that mean?\"</span></div></div>",

First off, it means that you are Mrs Lisa Rhodes, recently married to David Rhodes, and step mother to Megan Rhodes. But, things get a little odd here. You are still eighteen years of age, still a friend and class mate of Megan Rhodes, and still the daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Hale. Reality is reconciling you being a wife and mother along with your age and family.... it's creating a new shape of events and one that will have other ripples as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Heather?\" Lisa asked.  \"Do people think she died or went away or did she ever exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a bit less clear. From the records we've been able to pull so far, it looks like Megan may have been fostered or adopted by David Rhodes, and it may well be that there are no records of Heather ever existing. As I said, her existence wasn't connected to her body when she died. But there's more to this. Other parts of Heather's life besides her family are connected to you. As such, despite your age, you will find that people treat you like a woman in her late thirties more often than they treat you like a teenager. The usual stigma that would be attached to a relationship between a teenage girl and a man in his early forties doesn't seem to apply to you. Beyond that, you have received not only the minimal skills required to pass as Heather for a week or two, but the sum total of everything she ever learned has in effect, been downloaded into your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that does sound odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, there are several things we're still putting together,\" Emma said. \"Here within the facility, the staff is largely unaffected by the changes, though we can observe how you will interact with things differently. Much of the real information will come to light when you start interacting with the world outside. One other thing I can tell you though, is that many of Heather's social connections and responsibilities seem to have attached to you as well. She always was something of a trophy wife, a beautiful younger woman who got pregnant young and never had a 'real job' other than being a mother for Megan. Despite that, she was tremendously active in several social circles, and now, you seem to have her place in all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Social circles? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for example, many of her friends are now also your friends. If you take a look at your facebook page, you'll see that in addition to all of the friends you had before, you're also good friends with Mayor Vickar's wife Alexandra, and David's best friend Robert's wife Nicole seems to be another good friend of yours. There is a great deal more, we're pulling together a complete file for you, and I imagine we'll continue to find things as we go. More than anything else though, I really do want you to know that we're here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I really appreciate it,\" Lisa said, setting down the empty glass of gin, and wondering a little bit when she had finished it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you're ready, I'll show you to a changing room, and you can get dressed while we get the rest of your packet together.\"</span></div></div>",

Gone were her faded and torn jeans, replaced by a far more fashionable pair of designer jeans. Also gone was her light summer cami, and instead she found a flowing summer blouse with a far deeper neckline than she was used to wearing. Not that she had much to show for it. Most unusual of all, however, was the presence of the large diamond engagement ring, and the accompanying wedding band. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Lisa Rhodes,\" she read from the drivers license in her purse. \"It really did change who I am. The address is even changed... I guess I live with Megan now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her purse, yet another designer item, and sliding her heals on, Lisa strode out into the waiting area where Emma was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are Mrs. Rhodes,\" Emma said, handing over a thick folder. \"It's everything we have so far. We should have more information in a day or two, and we'll call you back in then. And of course, if we find anything important, I'll make sure to give you a call or send you a message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lisa said, taking the folder, but refraining from glancing through it. Right now, she just wanted to get out of The Nexus and find something normal to touch on. Turning away from Emma and The Nexus, Lisa strode out into the bright afternoon sun, quickly donning a pair of expensive sunglasses and winding her way through the parking lot until she found the car that responded to her key fob. When she did, it was hardly a surprise that the car was Heather's Mercedes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the top down on the convertible, Lisa wasted no time, quickly peeling out of the parking lot and heading....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling into the driveway at the Rhodes residence, Lisa couldn't help but smile at the thrill that the drive home had been. Heather's Mercedes was miles above and beyond her old beater car in terms of creature comforts and several times she'd found herself driving much faster than the legal limit. \"Some mother I'd be if my first day on the job I came home with a ticket,\" she said with a chuckle as she stepped out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the nicely furnished house, she looked around and saw several signs of how much things had changed in the Rhodes house with her as David's wife. Above the fireplace was a large picture of her in an expensive wedding gown standing next to David in a tuxedo. Next to that were photos of her with four women in brides's maids dresses. She recognized Megan and Stephanie instantly, but it took her several moments to figure out who the two older women were. \"Oh, Alexandra and Nicole,\" she said, as recognition dawned on her. They hadn't been kidding when they'd said she'd gained some of Heather's friends as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further contemplation, however, was cut short by the ringing of her iPhone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked, not recognizing the number on the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, I'm glad I caught you Mrs. Rhodes,\" a perky, cheerful woman's voice said on the other end of the line. \"This is Beth from the Westover Hights school district. I was just calling about the upcoming Senior class trip to Cancun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then,\" Lisa said, wondering why the school would be calling about the trip. She couldn't imagine that she wouldn't have already paid the trip fees in this new reality so it had to be something else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First,\" Beth said cheerfully, \"I wanted to say thank you so much for agreeing to chaperon this trip. I don't know what we'd do without good parent volunteers like you to help us out on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" Lisa said, a bit surprised. She was a chaperon? Was this what Emma had meant about people not treating her like a child? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I called is to let you know that the airline had a problem with the flight because of overbooking. So, it took some juggling, but we've managed to get everyone onto the same flight down next week. It does come with two changes in itinerary though... I hope this is okay. Instead of it being a Monday to Sunday trip we've had to shift it to be a Tuesday to Monday trip, so it pushes the date back a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can live with that,\" Lisa said. Heather had been a stay at home mother thanks to David's successful career, and given that Lisa herself had just graduated school, it felt very unlikely that she had a job to schedule around. \"You said there were two things?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Since we've had to make adjustments to everyone's schedule, we wanted to say thank you to parents like you who are volunteering. We've gotten upgrades from the airline so you can fly first class both ways, and an upgrade for you at the hotel as well. You don't mind, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind?\" Lisa said with a giggle. \"That's wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it works for you. I've got a few other parents to call,\" Beth said on the other end of the line. \"We'll get in touch with you in a few days about where to pick up your tickets and to have a chaperon orientation with rules for the trip. And again, from everyone at Westover Heights, thank you so much for volunteering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up the phone, Lisa marveled at how things were changing. She was an eighteen year old girl... but she was going on her senior class trip as a chaperon rather than just another student! What other odd things could she expect from all of this? And what was it going to be like being married to her best friend's dad?</span></div></div>",

She was actually expecting someone she didn't know. That would have made it easier in some way. Staying inside Stacy's life, would mean she had to take the same trip as herself and Megan. That would mean she had to see Stacy in her life, hanging around with Megan. \"Well I guess I said yes before, so how does this work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple,\" the woman said, gesturing for Lisa to proceed into one of the small rooms off the hallway. \"You'll need to change into the robe there, and we'll take your clothing over to Ms. Rodger. Then, lie down on the chair in the center of the room and relax. At that point, we do all the work to make sure you have all of the skills you'll need to live Ms. Rodgers  life for the next two weeks, and that people think you are her and vice versa.

It brings the client out of their escape, and even while they are living your life, they have to 'be their real self again' to talk to you. It's a bit dissonant, and stressful, and if other people over hear the conversation, it can get very awkward. Our general advice is to keep your interactions minimal. Of course with you being in the same class, that might become difficult sometimes, but nothing you can't handle, I would reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes sense,\" Lisa said, neatly folding her clothes and settling down into the chair. \"I guess I'm ready then.\"</span></div></div>",

A voice suddenly counted down and then the lights went on. Lisa closed her eyes immediately, her eyes were too sensitive to look straight into the bright lamp on top of her. The door suddenly opened and Lisa could make out a woman around her mother's age coming inside. She looked worried as she looked down on top of Lisa and asked: \"Tell me what is your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, Lisa Hale.\" Lisa answered. The woman looked shocked, and Lisa wondered what was wrong. And why did her voice sound different? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Lisa asked getting scared. She felt herself getting a panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I'm Emma Nail director of the Nexus. Now I need you to relax and slowly breath in and out.\" Lisa nodded and relaxed her breathing. She felt how she got calmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay now?\" Emma asked Lisa. Lisa nodded, though she was still a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let me tell you Lisa, that we never had a thing like this happen before. Our team is still looking to try and figure out how this could have happened. For now let me say we don't know what caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened?\" Lisa asked getting concerned. She felt odd, it was like something was stuck on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa when you were hooked up with Ms. Rodgers you were supposed to get each other's life, she yours and you hers. But something went wrong. The machine transferred a lot more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lisa asked her voice getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you would have swapped just lives, you would just keep your own body only when you would look into a reflection of yourself you would see some of the things that were important in that other person's lives. Instead of that, you and Ms. Rodgers have switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa heard that, she felt like a rock hit her stomach hard. This couldn't be true, this couldn't be happening. Emma grabbed a handheld mirror and held it in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed the mirror and noticing her more pale looking hand she took a look in the mirror and felt her hart stopping for a second. In the reflection she saw a copy of Stacy Rodgers' face. She could clearly see her eyes were blue now, her hair was dyed red and cut in a pixie style. But Lisa was most surprised of the piercings she had now. She had one in her lower lip, her nose and even one in her tongue. Lisa put her tongue out as she examined the little button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thoughts were going everywhere as she didn't know what would happen. What would they do now? How long would it take to fix this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might have a lot of questions, how about we go to my office and talk about it?\" Emma suggested. Lisa nodded a little. She sat up and slowly stepped down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good Lisa, you don't have to walk fast, just take your time.\" Emma suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa always thought Stacy was taller than her, probably because of the high boots Stacy wore, but when she walked through the doorway she didn't notice any change. Furthermore with each step she took, Lisa could feel her breasts moving as well. They felt bigger than her own, and that was not all. Her nipples felt odd, every time her nipples brushed against the fabric of the robe she felt something else as well. Something cold. Lisa hoped that it wasn't what she thought it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could take a peak Emma opened the door to her office. \"I think you know this person rather well.\" Lisa walked inside the room and the first thing she noticed was the person that was standing there. She recognized that brown hair, that physique and that face pretty well. It was her old body. Lisa was staring at her old self looking at her expression. Stacy was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Lisa.\" The real Stacy said with a smile. Lisa found it weird to see herself standing over there. \"You took a long while to wake up, but I told the doctors not to worry. When I get to sleep even my mom can't wake me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh. It really is you, Stacy.\" Lisa said walking closer to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am and thanks for letting me borrow your body like this. You and probably the entire school know of my crush on Megan. Me and Megan don't hang out much, but being like this we can hang around without it being odd.\" \"Though I didn't expect me having your skinnier body.\" Stacy said as she held out her fingers to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect this either.\" Lisa said turning a light shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma noticed the awkward moment between the two teens. \"Let's sit down for now, shall we?\" She asked. As Lisa and Heather sat down she noticed the differences between the two ladies. While Lisa sat down on her chair keeping her back up against the chair, Heather began to slouch a little. So far the transfer didn't seem to have switched all things...yet. \"We're glad the both of you are okay. We were a little worried that you took longer to wake up then Stacy, but perhaps she was right and is it her sleeping habit. We're looking into it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fix us, right?\" Lisa asked as she moved her tongue against the roof of her mouth feeling the little stud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma puts her glasses off as she grabbed a piece of cloth from her pocket. \"To tell you the truth girls, this is the first time this has happened here. Our engineers and sorcerers are still figuring out how it happened and how to reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you planning to do ?\" Stacy asked looking Emma straight in the eyes. Emma could see Stacy was a confident girl who wasn't taken aback that fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment we don't plan to do anything with you two. I understand that this is more of an exchange than you had signed up for, but in effect, you'll both have no difficulty fully living each other's lives for the next two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me?\" Lisa asked as she pointed at Stacy's well endowed teenage body. \"I didn't sign up for this.. I mean it's cool to be a punk girl, but... what if we can't change back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, I understand where you're coming from,\" Emma said gently. \"But look at it this way. You're also getting an upgraded experience. And, since we understand that this is a bit more, um, intense than what you signed up for, The Nexus is willing to match Stacy's rental fee, dollar for dollar while you're in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's okay,\" Lisa said, still very unsure about where things were going. \"And in two weeks, you'll be able to swap us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" Emma said. \"We'll need you to both take some tests today, and for the next two weeks, we'll be following up with each of you regularly. Once you are both back from your vacation in Mexico, we'll work on getting you two swapped back. Who knows... if we can replicate this, you may be the first of our clients to offer a whole new level of service,\" she said getting excited. \"And believe me, we'd pay you for that, very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me,\" Stacy said, standing up slowly as she stretched herself. \"For the next two weeks, I'm Lisa, and you're my classmate. Come here,\" she finished, flinging her arms around her former body and giving Lisa a giant hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa awkwardly hugged Stacy back as she hanged around her shoulder. The extra money was nice... and better be worth it. Though she was happy that Stacy would be able to hang around with Megan, she hoped Stacy would refrain from doing anything with Megan that would ruin their friendship. She had to hope for the best. And besides maybe being Stacy would have it's rewards. <i>Like this hug. </i> She thought unwittingly.<br>\r\n\"Now just don't get in trouble Lisa.\" Lisa warned Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing your reputation you better watch yourself Stacy.\" Stacy said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Emma said as she stood. \"In that case, if you'll each follow me, I'll show you to the exam rooms where we have a few tests to run before you each go home.\"</span></div></div>",

If she didn't knew better, she would say she was in a doctor's office right then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you wait here Stacy? Someone of our staff will be here soon.\" Emma told Lisa as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Lisa replied as she sat down on the exam table. Lisa then noticed the mirror in the corner room, she jumped off the table, feeling her breasts jiggle, and walked over to the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really me?\" Lisa asked herself as she looked at herself in the mirror. She noticed the husky voice, Stacy obviously being a smoker. It was weird seeing Stacy's face right in front of her. The thing that annoyed Lisa the most were the piercings, there were way too many. Stacy was a pretty girl. She had shiny blue eyes, a pale complexion which suited her, and tiny pointy ears. Her lips were covered in red lipstick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could only remove those piercings, they looked so weird on her. Though Lisa was surprised she didn't feel them anymore. Only when she would touch them, she was reminded of what Stacy had done to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa also noticed her red pixie hair, the roots of her hair were brown though. A dye job apparently. \"Guess I'll have to do a dye job too, not what I'm used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there are many things you are not used to.\" A female voice said. Lisa turned around to see a young woman walking inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about Lisa's height, begin thirties, long brown hair which she would pull behind her ear every now and then, a bit overweight but not that much it would be concerning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry for startling you. I'm Erica.\" She held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa, though I think you know that.\" Lisa shook her hand as Erica motioned her to sit down on the exam table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my supervisor already said before, we're terrible sorry for what happened here. Now I've just got a few questions to ask you, mostly to figure out in what way the transfer affected you, then you can get dressed and go your way. To start, why don't you tell me your birthday, middle name, and the name of your favorite teacher in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy. I was born May 25th, my middle name is Elizabeth and my favorite teacher in school was Mr. Stein.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good,\" Erica said making a few notes. \" How would I play an A chord on a guitar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy\", Lisa said automatically,\"you would use the second fret, then put your ring finger on the fourth string, your point finger on the third string and your middle finger on the second string. Wait.. I don't even know how to play the guitar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... That's a problem,\" Emma said putting her hair behind her ear again. \"You would usually get the skills of the one renting your life with a normal procedure.  If Stacy had been a drummer , you'd know how to play the drums. But Stacy wasn't a drummer. She has played the guitar since she was ten years old. She's just a high school student like you, plays in a band, has a job as a waitress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't it usual that we get the skills of the person who rented our lives? I mean how else could we pretend to be them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"True, but in this case it's different. It would be easier if you would have kept your skills of only Lisa Hale. The problem lies in you two switching back. We have to make sure that none of the skills you have as Stacy transfers with you into your old body and vice versa. The damage could be permanent.\"</span></div></div>",

Emma had enough data for now to take back into analysis and she was sure there were some other skills as well which Lisa might not be aware off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can now dress yourself Lisa.\" Emma said finishing her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I think you better call me Stacy now. Have to get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Stacy, here are your things.\" Emma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa removed her robe leaving it on the floor as she walked over to the full body mirror. It was so odd staring at a different face, Lisa forgot that underneath it was an entirely different body as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy wasn't much a sun worshiper as she was, Stacy's body had a pale complexion from the lack of sun. Lisa noticed a few cuts on her arms and legs. Lisa wondered if it happened on accident or purpose.<br>\r\nHer tummy wasn't in such a shape as her own, Stacy was flat but not as worked out as her own tummy. Even more surprised, was the piercing in her belly button. Lisa never knew Stacy had one there, nor would she have known. Lisa's gaze then went to linger on her breasts. They were bigger than her own, C-cup or almost a D-cup she would guess. They would be pretty if not for the piercings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ruin your body with these things?\" Lisa wondered. Lisa pulled one of her nipple piercings, and almost immediately she felt an electric shock going through her body. Lisa didn't knew they were that sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then turned her attention to the pile of clothes lying on the ground. She picked up the thong, that was Stacy's favorite pair of underwear. Lisa found them rather uncomfortable, instead of the snug feeling of her boy shorts, it felt like she was standing there naked. Lisa then put on Stacy's skimpy looking bra, showing off the top of her breasts, making a rather revealing cleavage. She then picked up the pair of pantyhose and carefully stuck her feet in them as she pulled them on. Then Stacy's favorite skirt passed her hands as she put it on. For a moment she hesitated putting on the top, the top gave a stinky odor. Clearly Stacy didn't wash it that much. But seeing as she didn't have any other clothes with her, she decided to wear it anyway. Then she only needed to put on Stacy's high heeled boots and she was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I look?\" She asked Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, if I wasn't straight I would seriously consider asking you out. You look exactly like how Stacy came in. Here is the rest of her stuff.\" Emma handed Lisa Stacy's purse. Smelling the same stench from the shirt, Lisa kept her purse shut, in case there might be something in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something else I need to do?\" Lisa asked Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma looked through her documents and told Lisa...</span></div></div>",

Stacy was just a classmate of her, she never hanged around with her or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's okay, but you might be curious how your old body looks like.\" Emma said pushing Lisa out of the door and grabbed her hand as she walked with her to the room where Stacy had her exam. \"Now just go inside and talk a little.\" Emma opened the door and pushed Lisa inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could turn around Emma closed the door behind her. No way going back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumped here?\" Lisa heard a voice asking. Lisa turned around and saw Stacy standing there. Or better said she saw herself standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I would put it like that, but yeah.\" Lisa said walking towards Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, happened to me too. This chick that examined me said we might talk a little.\" Stacy said nonchalant. She hopped onto the examination table and nodded Lisa to sit next to her. It was weird for Lisa seeing her own body like this, looking this different. Stacy wore the flip flops, jeans and tank top she wore this morning, but something different was about it. Perhaps it was the way Stacy moved around, or the fact that her long brown hair was now resting on one shoulder blade instead of her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to talk about anything?\" Stacy asked staring in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Can't think of anything.\" Lisa answered staring in front of her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Not even the reason why I wanted this?\" Stacy asked looking at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you don't want to talk about it.\" Lisa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, Megan, she really is someone I like. Apart from her hot body.  I mean Megan is always nice to people like us, even if we aren't preppy cheerleaders she treats us the same like anyone else. I just want to spend some time together with her to know her better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why you want to do this?\" Lisa asked Stacy curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded. \"Yeah and spending some time away from my crazy family.\" Megan mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I know something?\" Lisa felt herself feeling warmer all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just shook her head. \"No, nothing you aren't going to find out on yourself. Just make sure you read the file.\" Megan told her. Megan then looked at the clock in the room. \"I think we've wasted enough time here. Let's go.\" Megan said jumping off the table. Lisa followed her as they walked to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there's something.\" Lisa said all of a sudden. Megan turned around and then felt herself being hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? You're scared I don't come back with your body?\" Megan asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just a hug. A friend's hug. You will need to give a lot of these, including to Megan.\" Lisa told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't mind then.\" Megan said sounding a little relieved. With a shaking hand she hugged Lisa back. She then let Lisa go. \"Alright that's enough of it.\" Megan told Lisa as she pushed her gently away. Lisa nodded as well. She just felt a sudden urge to hug Stacy, but that feeling had passed now. Both of them a little more happy they left the room together to take the first few steps in each other's lives.</span></div></div>",

Odd that when she was still in her old body, Lisa didn't feel any urge to go. Perhaps it were her nerves, Lisa thought, or she might be doing something else in there. Well Lisa couldn't care, after all for the next few weeks it was Stacy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa made her way through the reception area, she noticed the subtle changes. How she walked, how she didn't feel her piercings anymore, the way her breasts moved inside her bra. But then there was something else too, something all together different from the rest. It was about the way she looked. Lisa noticed the stripper from before was still standing there, waiting for her turn with the Nexus. She looked at her reflection in the compact mirror .When Lisa looked at her, it felt like she was looking at her with another pair of eyes. The way she looked now was somehow different. When she noticed the woman earlier, she felt disdained looking at her. What woman would want to look like that? But now that she looked at her, she didn't feel anything like that at all. She rather felt an attraction to the woman in front of her. The platform shoes brought out her beautiful tanned legs, the micro miniskirt showed off her great thighs and her cleavage was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then realized what she was thinking. She was actually attracted to another woman. Lisa felt her hart pumping faster, her breathing faster, her legs getting wobbly. She needed to sit down for a moment. Lisa sought out a chair to sit on and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa Hale, I'm Lisa Hale. I'm not attracted to boys. No, that's not right I'm attracted to boys not to girls.\" Lisa thought. \"Oh why did I sign up for this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, are you alright?\" A female voice suddenly woke her up. As Lisa opened her eyes, she felt her poor hart getting a shock. The woman asking her, was the stripper from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes.\" Lisa said quickly. She tried not to look right in front of her. Lisa was too scared that her gaze would linger on anything except the woman's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look very fell dear, your face is all flustered.\" The stripper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just the excitement you know.\" Lisa just wanted to get away from the woman, but she was  standing right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it all too well. First time \"volunteer\",right?\" The stripper asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, huh. You too?\"  Lisa asked curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Lyzette is the name, though you can call me Lyz.\" Lyzette told Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Lyz. My name is Li-Stacy.\" Lisa corrected herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear you already must have joined a \"project\" already.\" Lyzette said with a smile. \"Mind if I sit next to you?\" Lyzette just sat next to her, an uncomfortable silence between the two women. Lisa was too afraid to look directly at Lyzette, she didn't want her eyes to be drawn to Lyzette's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt a bit better, now that she had sat down. It was better if she moved on. </span></div></div>",

Lisa stood up and walked to the female washrooms. The washrooms looked empty, but she checked underneath the stalls to make sure they weren't spied on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell me now what's troubling you?\" Lyzette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay it's like this. Me and Stacy would swap lives for a few weeks you know. She has a crush on a friend of mine and she wanted to know her better. But something went wrong with the machine and instead of swapping lives we also switched bodies. She has mine and I have hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought her story sounded ridiculous, who would ever believe something like that? But when she looked at Lyzette she knew Lyzette believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So instead of switching lives you also switched bodies, what's the big difference?\" Lyzette asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first of all my memories are somewhat different. I can remember things that are important like her favorite food or skills she has, but I also know some things I don't need to, like her favorite pornstars. Second I have her preferences and instead of boys she likes girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that explains it girl. That explains it all. You know when I first saw you I thought you were a goth chick just checking me out. But when you sat down and I talked with you a little, I noticed your behavior was off. You were trying not to look. It just didn't made sense that you were checking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's pretty much it.\" Lisa told Lyzette feeling embarrassed after hearing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyzette looked at her interested. \"But it must be very interesting you know girl, just looking down and actually seeing a pair of tits that match your reflection. I know I would like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know, I haven't checked myself out like that.\" Lisa said turning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl like you? You must be crazy. I do it all the time. When I have the first moment I can be alone, I usually check myself out. You know for fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you do something like that?\" Lisa asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, I can see you haven't been here around, if you did you wouldn't ask something like that. These people that rent our lives, they may look like nice people, but when you get your body back you don't know what you will get back. For instance check this out.\" With that Lyzette suddenly dropped her skirt, showing off Lyzette's bubbly butt inside a thong. \"You see this tattoo here.\" Lyzette pointed to a tattoo right in the middle of her right ass. It showed off a little rose. \"This one was actually placed by a forty year old woman who was married and had five kids. Lyzette then lifted up her top showing off her belly button. \"A guy in his twenties studying to become a doctor did this this one .\" Lyzette pointed at her belly button piercing. \"And you don't even know about the time a nun rented my life and slept with ten men at the same time. That story still turns me on when I hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so you actually do it because clients do what they want with your life and so you treat them the same?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly girl.

Especially by just playing with her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Lisa realizing it, Lyzette slowly began to move backwards to one of the stalls. Lyzette made sure the door was locked before she pushed Lisa down on the toilet seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I wouldn't do this with the first girl I come across but for you I'm willing to make an exception.\" Lyzette said smiling wide. She then suddenly began kissing Lisa, putting her tongue inside her mouth. Lisa was confused by all of this. She could only feel herself getting hotter inside. She needed to get out of here. Lisa tried to push Lyzette away from her, but Lisa felt her hands resting on Lyzette's breast. Without a second notice Lisa's hand began to touch Lyzette's breasts through her top. Playing with them as she tried to flicker Lyzette her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy you naughty girl, I didn't knew you were that interested.\" Lyzette said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not me. I swear.\" Lisa said surprised as well. It wasn't like she asked for it. Her hands were doing it on her own, like they knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, your body is it?\" Lyzette asked naughty. She then slipped her hands underneath Lisa her skirt and thong. \"Well if I'm not mistaken your body is quite wet from it. If you wouldn't like it, then you wouldn't be like his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't say anything more, her mind was still straight but her body was loving the attention it got from such a beautiful woman. Lisa couldn't help herself but to begin moaning. Before she could become too loud, Lyzette quickly kissed Lisa again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was like a switch went on inside Lisa's head. What if she kissed with a woman? This wasn't her life and even not her own body. Slowly Lisa began to tongue wrestle with Lyzette who became very interested in Lisa. Lyzette began to touch Lisa's vagina and quickly rubbing it, made Lisa have an orgasm. The sensation was incredible and Lisa was blown away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Lisa knows, Lyzette stands up, straightening her skirt and pulling down her top. She then...</span></div></div>",

That's my girl.\" Lyzette said as she grabbed Lisa by her shoulder. Together they walked out of the bathroom and once again stood in the reception area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I need to go now.\" Lisa said with sadness in her voice. Even though she wouldn't normally hang out with someone like Lyzette, she liked the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, you don't have to go.\" Lyzette said. \"Look I'll need to swap identities in a few minutes. Why don't you just wait for me here, and we can hangout some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Lisa then frowned. \"Won't you get in trouble for telling me your real identity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. They don't care about that, as long as we don't tell everyone we meet, they don't care. As long as the client is satisfied, they are too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll wait then. Good luck.\" She wished Lyzette. Lyzette then wandered off to a door where a young woman apparently waited for Lyzette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then sat down on a chair as she waited around for Lyzette to come back. There wasn't much to do but look at people. Lisa found it interesting as she saw how different people walked in and outside the doors.  There were clearly a few women who were men before, as they were having trouble wearing the high heels, while some men had something of a female walk.

This was just some gossip magazine, and it wasn't even the latest issue of it. Half of the rumors in it were already proved false. Lisa then noticed an ad for lingerie, her eye kept lingering on it. She was never before interested in it, as her figure didn't allow it, but with Stacy's figure. Lisa took a peek down as she saw her C-cup or D-cup breasts hanging in her bra, it would look great on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps when I go shopping I can go check it out.</i> Lisa thought remembering the store where the lingerie could be bought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Lisa noticed the door opening again, her eyes would quickly glare at the person and then return back to the magazine, but this time they kept staring at the door.

Everything was going so fast she didn't even got the chance to find out where Stacy lived. She grabbed Stacy's file and hurriedly went to the summary page where it explained where she lived. Looking at the bus information Lisa thought she should have fifteen minutes before she was home, or at least her temporary home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went through the file Stacy made up. As Lisa continued reading there were parts that sounded fun like the fact that she was in a band but there were also some rivalry with her mother's boyfriend. It made the situation tense between Stacy and her mom. Combined with the fact that her younger stepsister, Clarissa, never got out and was considered a mute by Stacy Lisa could understand why Stacy wanted some time away from her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa barely noticed that she was already at the right bus stop and quickly pushed the stop button so she could leave. Lisa heard the driver saying something not very friendly but she was too far away to hear it right. Lisa then continued her walk to Stacy's home. She knew the streets a little, it was considered the poor district of town. When Lisa stopped in front of the house she got a little shock. It looked like it was abandoned. The chairs standing there were covered by grass, the mailbox had a dent in it and Lisa could smell the lingering odor of cigarettes being lit. This place was a mess. And she was supposed to stay here for now? Lisa got the urge to run away back to her old home, to her mom and dad. Looking down at herself she knew that wouldn't be possible. Who could ever see her like Lisa looking as she did now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm Stacy, I'm Stacy. I'm Stacy.</i> Lisa repeated to herself as she took a deep breath in and out. Lisa walked over to the house having the notion that somebody would suddenly call her out that she didn't live there. But sadly nobody called out. The front door looked like it could use a paint job and Lisa barely touched it as she found it was unlocked. Stepping inside the house Lisa could smell the odor of cigarettes stronger than before. She hated  the smell but then realized that as Stacy she smoked. Something she had to get used to it as well. Lisa found the place deserted. Inside the living room a note was attached to the wall, telling that Stacy's mother and her boyfriend were gone to see a doctor with Clarissa. It explained why the place was abandoned. Seeing as she didn't have anything else to do, she decided to go upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing upstairs she could see the place was as run down as she thought. The walls were yellow because of the smoke and she could see some of the wallpaper letting loose. Lisa would pray for the day that she could return to her own home again. She found Stacy's room quickly, seeing as it was the only one dark purple a color that she herself hated. It had a dark atmosphere. She could see a guitar at the other end of the room with an amplifier next to it. Above it was a poster of the band Stacy was in. The dark harbingers, the title said in dark red blood.<i> Look like a cheerful bunch.</i> Lisa thought as she looked at the band members some of which she recognized from school. Lisa then let herself fall down on the bed with the folder with information next to her as she looked up at the ceiling. This was her place for the coming weeks. She wondered how this would end?</span></div></div>",

They're much more... colder, heartless, however you want to describe them.\"  She then took a look up at the camera in the far corner of the room and began speaking loudly again. \"We'll have to continue this exam another time Ms Hale, something else has come up.\" Erica said in a clear voice, as she gestured to the door with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing was starting to get Lisa really scared, a shiver ran down her new spine as she got to her feet. \"Where's Stacey?\" she inquired, worried about what might be happening to her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I wasn't assigned to her, I got you.\" was Erica's honest response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I need to know where my body is.\" Lisa protested as Erica gently took hold of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be worried about yourself as you are, not as you were. Be prepared for the fact that you may not be getting your body back Lisa, I'm sorry.\" Erica whispered, as we began walking through the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lisa could think was that this had all gone to shit real fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They weren't just any clothes, they were Stacey's clothes. Lisa recognized the boots in the pile as the ones that Stacey usually wore around school. Erica set the pile of clothing down next to Lisa on the examination bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to get dressed quickly so I can get you outside before they come and take you.\" Erica told Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa became worried as reality set in. All she wanted to do was make a little bit of money so she could afford to start college in the fall. Now she was in a body that wasn't her own and being told that she might not ever be herself again. Feeling uncomfortable with another person standing there next to her, Lisa stood up and pulled the gown she was wearing off. The first thing she noticed were the  giant silver studs sticking out of her unfamiliar nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh. No wonder why my breasts felt weird.\" Lisa muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika chimed in \"You can gawk at your body later. We need to get out of here now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa quickly grabbed Stacey's panties and slid them up her legs until they were snug around her now wider hips. She then picked up the larger bra and put it on. But before Lisa could get dressed any further, the door opened and an older man came in with several security guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked like he was in his early fifties, he was lean and bald with short white hair on the sides. Although he didn't look menacing, Lisa knew that his presence wasn't good for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika, Erika, Erika. Did you really think I wouldn't notice what you were doing?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika's face went pale with fear as he spoke to her. Lisa didn't know what to do. She wasn't dressed and several other men stood in the doorway. She couldn't run and Stacey's body wouldn't be able to do much if she tried fighting them. All she could think of was to move into the corner and hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic. This is not what the Nexus was built for! We never were supposed to use this technology for nefarious ends!\" Erika said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nefarious? I got us our biggest client. The federal government is paying use handsomely for our proprietary 'services'.\" Dominic countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Erika still looked pale and scared, Lisa could tell that she found enough backbone to stand up to this obviously evil man. \"I won't let you experiment on..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Erika could finish speaking, Dominic pulled out gun and shot Erika several times until she fell onto the floor. Lisa screamed as Erika's body was laying on the floor as a large growing pool of blood kept expanding around her. With Erika 'out of the way', Dominic turned his attention to Lisa curled up in the corner. Lisa never felt terror like this in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring her to chamber 4A undamaged.\" Dominic told one of the guards that was with him before stepping out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo guards stepped into the room and grabbed Lisa. She tried kick and screaming, but they were too strong for her to get away. They carried her down the hallway and back into one of the transference rooms. Lisa wasn't even sure if it was the same one she had used earlier or not. It didn't matter though because whatever they were going to do to her, it wasn't good.</span></div></div>",

This one looked almost the same as the one she had been in earlier except it had restraints on it to keep someone in place. She resisted as much as she could in Stacey's underwear clad body, but it just merely slowed the guards down. After struggling and becoming completely tired, the guards managed to get Lisa all the way into the chair and strap her limbs in place so she couldn't move. They even tied something over her mouth so she couldn't scream. Once they finished double checking their work, they left Lisa alone in the dimly lit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure how it had been, but after some time, Dominic came in to greet her. \"Ah Ms. Hale or should I say Ms. Rodgers? No matter, neither of those names will apply to you in a couple minutes. You see, the accident that you and well the 'old' you been through doesn't look like it is reversible. I cannot afford to have either of you suing and affecting my bottom line. I also have the government needing 'expendable' bodies at a rate I cannot keep up with. So I'm solving one problem with another. I do hope you enjoy your new life since this one will be your last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to scream, but the gag over her mouth only let out a muffle of what she wanted. She tried again to wiggle and slip out of her restraints but they were on tight. Dominic turned around and left the room. After being alone again for a few moments, Lisa heard the chair begin to hum as it powered up. She knew what was coming, but Stacey's body was too tired to keep trying to escape. As the machine began working, Lisa fought her hardest to try and stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs seconds progressed, Lisa found it harder and harder to not pass out. Eventually, her eyes forced themselves shut and Lisa dozed off. She eventually opened her eyes and saw that she was in another room like the one she had been in, but she was wearing...</span></div></div>",

Her hands and feet were still restrained and she didn't have anything covering her mouth anymore, but she could tell that she was still a woman by the the breasts that rose up on her chest. The room was dimly lit so she couldn't see much else about whoever she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her mind slowly woke up, the lights came on and Dominic came into the room with four guards. These ones looked different. They wore masked helmets and black armor. They looked like some kind of futuristic soldier that belonged on the battlefield of a science fiction movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you awake Ms. Hale... or should I say Fatima Hadid now?\" Dominic said with a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the lights now on, Lisa was able to look around and see more. Past her larger breasts that were encased in orange linen, she could see her hands that stuck out past the cuffs that held her wrists in place. They still looked like her hands or rather Stacey's hands. \"You won't get away with this.\" Lisa said in Stacey's voice. The the words that came out of her mouth were still new to her and sounded like an unconfident Stacey that got called on to answer a question in class. Dominic laughed. She still hated hearing her voice. She didn't want to live out the rest of her life hearing it every time she spoke, if she managed to even live past today that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now Fatima Hadid. A 31 year old wife to the terrorist named Muhammad Hadid. He was killed while trying to blow up a football stadium two years ago in Dallas, Texas. YOU were convicted of being an accomplice that helped make the explosives and will be serving the next 50 years in federal prison until you are deported back to Iraq. The old 'Fatima' cut a deal with the government to rat out an entire terrorist cell in the country if they let her walk. So the feds wanted to give her a new body without having to explain to the public why they were releasing a convicted terrorist. You're the lucky one. Ms. Rodgers was exchanged with the escaped aunt of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. She will be 'returned' back to her nephew as a diplomatic gesture. I doubt you want to be the one executed by flak cannons and fed to dogs like she will probably be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa started crying. None of this was supposed to happen. Now not only was her life stolen from her, but Stacey was probably going to be tortured and killed. Stacey was never considered a friend and Lisa could barely think of all the times she ever spoke to her on one hand, but she didn't deserve to die. As she cried, the guards undid the restraints that held her in the transference chair and replaced them with handcuffs and leg shackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had her restrained again, Dominic said \"My men here are to escort you to the federal agents that are waiting for you outside. I suggest you behave. Escaping terrorists tend to be shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith guards flanking her on each side, Lisa was led down the hallway and out the back of the building where a van and several men in suits were waiting for her...</span></div></div>",

She had only assumed that the Nexus were forcing her to exchange her body back with Lisa. While she was in one of the examination rooms with a woman named Joanna, a couple mall cop looking security goons came in and grabbed her. She was still wearing the robe she had worn during the first transference as she was dragged back into another transference room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t tell if it was the same one she had been in, the hallways and doors looked all alike. Upset with the thought that her vacation with Megan was about to be cancelled, Stacey protested but didn\u2019t resist too hard as the security guards secured her back into the transference chair and cuffed her wrists and feet so she couldn\u2019t get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they left, Stacey sat there thinking about what legal action she might take since her vacation plans were probably ruined thanks to the Nexus\u2019 screwup. It didn\u2019t take long though for her to hear the machine power up. Resigned to the fact that all of this was probably about to be reversed, Stacey leaned her head back and closed her eyes as she suddenly felt extremely sleepy. She slowly drifted off to sleep yet again\u2026<br>\r\nHowever, when she woke up and felt a lack of energy that she didn\u2019t have after the first time she used the machine. Something was still wrong. Looking around, Stacey noticed that the room looked basically the same, except for the chair she was now in didn\u2019t have any restraints holding her in place. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing different. She now had on clothes instead of the hospital gown that she had been wearing what felt like minutes earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly sitting up, Stacey realized that she still appeared to be in Lisa\u2019s more athletic body despite feeling like she hadn\u2019t eaten in days and just finished a marathon. Her joints were stiff and her or rather Lisa\u2019s body felt pain in many places as she stood up and began walking around. Her clothes were cheap looking and felt really loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned forward to inspect what she was wearing, Stacey felt a horrible pain in her lower back. Once she recovered, she noticed that she was wearing some cheap black flats that looked like they were purchased from the Goodwill along with the grey slacks that looked like they were meant for someone much taller than her but were poorly cut and hemmed to fit her. Her shirt was an Asian looking long sleeved shirt that was yellow and pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting the crink in her neck, Stacey went over to the nearby mirror on the wall in the back corner of the room. Once she there, she was unexpectedly shocked. The reflection in the mirror wasn\u2019t her nor was it Lisa. The woman staring back at her was an older Asian woman that looked like someone\u2019s grandma with the same shocked expression Stacey had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do or say anything, the door opened and Dominic stepped in with some menacing looking security guards. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re up and about Kim Ju-Hui.\u201d Dominic said as he entered the room with his guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey didn\u2019t know who this man was, but he looked important by the way he was dressed and carried himself. \u201cLook Mister, I\u2019m not this Kim lady\u2026 my name is Stacey Rodgers and I\u2019m supposed to be vacationing as Lisa Hale\u2026\u201d Stacey tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic interrupted her \u201cI know who you are or were rather. For all intents and purposes, you\u2019re now Kim Ju-Hui, the escaped aunt of the feared North Korean Dictator and she is now Lisa Hale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I paid for. I\u2019ll sue you and this company for everything you have.\u201d Stacey angrily retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic began laughing and was quite dismissive of Stacey\u2019s threat. \u201cYou see dear, the government will be returning \u2018Kim Ju-Hui\u2019 back to North Korea for diplomatic reasons. With how they deal with people who escape their country, I doubt you will live long enough to tell anybody. But just in case, you\u2019re going to suffer a \u2018stroke\u2019 that keeps you from talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic pulled out what looked to be some kind of needle and pulled the cap off. Stacey wanted to punch him in the face and stick that needle where the sun didn\u2019t shine, but the old lady body she was currently in had a hard-enough time moving let alone fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold her down\u201d Dominic instructed to his guards as they rushed forward and pinned Stacey in place against the wall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Originally she was upset since she thought that she had been double crossed by the infidels but now she was confused. Everything looked more or less the same except now she was almost naked with the exception of a black bra and some tight panties that she couldn't see because she was still fastened down to the chair and her breasts obstructed her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled and tried to free her hands from their restraints to no avail. Before she could make any progress, the door opened and someone came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new life Ms. Hadid.\" Dominic said as he entered the room with what looked like a couple of futuristic looking henchmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatima had been raised as a strict fundamentalist growing up back in the holy land and being forced to expose herself in the presence of these men made her angry. These unbelievers weren't worthy to look upon the flesh of a daughter of Islam. \"Infidels! You'll die by the fire of a thousand suns for defiling me like this!.\" Fatima angrily ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infidel?!?\" Dominic asked before breaking out in a bemused laugh. \"My dear Fatima... or should I say Stacy Rodgers, You are just as much an infidel as I am. The government kept their word as promised. You are now an 18 year old American girl named Stacy Rodgers. To the entire world outside of this room, you were born and raised in this city. Your very own people will see you now as the infidel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe henchmen flanked both sides of Fatima and unlocked her restraints from a keypad. As soon as she was free, she got out of the chair and moved up against the wall on the other side of the room in attempt to get some distance from these disgusting swine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's totally unnecessary Fati... I mean Stacy. Your new clothes will be here any second. Pay no mind if there is any blood splatter on them...\" Dominic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't more than a few moments when a woman wearing a lab coat came into the room and set down a purse, a pair of boots and a small pile of clothes on a nearby chair and promptly turned around and walked out without even acknowledging her or this creepy old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not wearing those clothes. Do you think I'm some kind of slut old man?\" Fatima venomously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just turn around and look in the mirror. You'll get your own answer.\" Dominic said as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatima turned her head over her shoulder and spotted what looked like a large rectangular shaped vanity mirror mounted on the wall just a few feet behind her. Curious to what this man meant, she turned all the way around to get a good looked at herself and was completely unprepared for what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection wasn't right. Instead of seeing her normal self, she saw an average looking white woman with short hair that was poorly dyed red. She had blue eyes and rounded face. Fatima brought a hand up to her head and felt her now short hair as the woman in the mirror mimicked her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always find it amusing when people who switch are too stupid to catch on. But as much as I would like to stick around, I do have more important things to do. This is your 'fresh start' that the government promised you. You are the new Stacy Rodgers. You're 12 years younger now. Whatever you do with your new life is not my concern. However, you have 10 minutes to get dressed before my men come back and escort you out.\" explained Dominic as he set a timer on his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the reflection of the young woman in the mirror, Fatima tried to process what was going on. She didn't know what to think. Part of her thought that this was a worse fate than death but another part of her saw this as an opportunity to get things right that she got wrong before. She always wanted a large family but her late husband had been too preoccupied with the holy war to give her more than one child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many questions and possibilities going through Fatima's mind. She saw behind \"her\" in the mirror the creepy looking man turn around and start walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. If I'm now this Stacy woman, then where is she? Is she me?\" Fatima asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody needs to be somebody...\" Dominic said. \"...and somebody needs to be Fatima Hadid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatima thought about what Dominic said as he left the room with his guards. She had no idea who Stacy Rodgers was but she was about to be a whole new person now. She looked back at her new reflection in the mirror before smiling at the thought of this infidel woman being trapped in prison or worse in her place. Allah definitely rewards his most loyal followers she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she needed to get dressed before she was kicked out onto the street, Fatima began to pick up Stacy's clothes. They didn't look like they would fit her much larger frame but she decided to take a leap of faith and try to put them on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dominic needed to hurry. He had been forced to make the first move in his master plan once some technicians accidentally placed two clients in the transference rooms he had secretly been modifying behind Dr. Nail's back. After the two girls had completely exchanged bodies and essences, Dominic knew it was only a matter of time before Dr. Nail traced everything back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the 'accident' with the two female clients, a board meeting was called to discuss the problem. Dominic's quick thinking and secret contacts enabled him to sweep the evidence away long enough pull off the first part of his plan off. Despite investing a significant amount of capital and research into making The Nexus into a for profit business, he had little control over the direction of the company. Dr. Emma Nail was director and had the master control over all of the systems with a board that provided oversight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leadership that gave The Nexus direction had been hand chosen by investors and vetted by the government to ensure the company would be both profitable and \"safe\". But everyone was so short sighted in Dominic's opinion. With him at the helm, The Nexus could eventually rule the world in the shadows without the ignorant masses ever knowing. And the first step needed to be gaining complete control of The Nexus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the conference room, Dominic saw the other 4 board members that were waiting for Dr. Nail to show up for their emergency meeting. Luckily for Dominic, his loyal followers were able to delay her long enough for him to get there before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic. We're about to have a meeting here, you'll have to bring up your grievances another time...\" Kenneth Olm said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenneth was an older man whom Dominic had known for the last couple decades. All of the board members went back at least 20 or so years with Dominic. He knew they didn't like him. But it was his expertise that integrated the magical crystals into the technology that the transference chairs used. Without him, there would be no Nexus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to inform all of you that I'm assuming control of the company and your services are no longer required.\" Dominic said smugly before pulling out a pistol from his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone insane!?! You'll never get away with this Dominic!\" Patricia Amal countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't make it out of this room alive, let alone control this facility!\" Kenneth exclaimed before hitting a panic button on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately alarms began going off with an automated voice calling \"Code 31\" over the building's intercom system. So far everything was going accordingly to plan for Dominic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the alarm going off, Dominic quickly executed the board members before they could run or try to fight back. It was extremely satisfying for Dominic to kill these people that he loathed all these years. Once he walked around the conference table and ensured all of the members were dead, Dominic then used the remaining rounds in his pistol to shoot the security cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Dr. Nail to arrive with a well armed security team. One of the technicians came to her office to try to explain how the transference chairs had been altered when she was about to meet with the board. This information seemed important enough to keep them waiting, but she kept an eye on the room from her computer and saw Dominic's murderous crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic! I knew you were a scheming snake but this is a new low. You're never going to get away with this!\" Emma Nail yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic began laughing. \"I already have Emma. You just don't know it yet.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've revoked your credentials and I'm taking you into custody until I figure out which filthy prison you'll rot in.\" Emma angrily stated. \"Guards! Take him away!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked security guards however just stood there. \"As Director, I'm ordering you to take this traitor into custody!\" Emma demanded as she looked towards the guards that had stood behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards, take the director to room 4B.\" Dominic instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards turned on Emma and grabbed her. \"What are you doing!?! I'm the director...\" Emma frantically demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long.\" Dominic said. \"Soon I will be the new director and you will be rotting in a filthy prison of MY choosing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma tried fighting back and breaking free to no avail as several security guards dragged her into an elevator. Dominic just laughed. Everything was going according to plan...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emma was carted off and forced into one of the company's transference chairs. She knew the 4A and 4B chairs were the ones that had been altered. When The Nexus was set up, the entire facility was tuned to her essence as a safeguard against something like this. Normally, a set of chairs would not function if she was in one as a security measure to prevent anyone from seizing control of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was strapped into the chair and restrained, the guards left the room. With nothing she could do, Emma began to worry. It wasn't just about what would happen to her or The Nexus itself but whoever else that could fall victim to Dominic's powerplay. With complete control over The Nexus, Dominic could cause serious problems for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair began to hum and Emma began to feel disoriented and sleepy. She knew what was happening. She did her best to resist the urge to close her eyes, but it was futile as her eyelids betrayed her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma slowly woke up again and found that she was still in a chair and still restrained. But the first thing she noticed was that she was no longer wearing her clothes. Instead of her blouse and business skirt, she was wearing a men's dress shirt and slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Dominic.\" she heard a familiar voice say. Turning her head as far as she could, Emma saw Dominic standing in front of the entrance of the transference room. It was a ridiculous sight seeing a balding man in his mid fifties wearing what looked like her clothes. He was even wearing her earrings that she put on this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic!\" Emma exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No my dear. I'm Dr. Emma Nail now and director of this company. You're Dominic, the scheming scientist who was recorded on camera murdering the board of directors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic walked over to Emma and approached her with a small hand mirror. \"Let me show you.\" he said as he brought the mirror before Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at her was the puzzled look of Dominic. Normally she always saw his face with a scowl or a malicious grin but this was probably the first time she saw his face with a look of fear on it. Emma couldn't believe it. Somehow Dominic managed find a way around the transference safeguards and steal her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Emma muttered in disbelieve as Dominic's reflection mimicked her words perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My associates in the government are already outside and are ready to take you away.\" Dominic said. \"And as director, I'm suspending all services at the Nexus until an overhaul of security protocols are made. This tragedy will not happen again.\" he sarcastically continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic turned around and walked out of the room. As soon as he left, several security guards came in and began unfastening Emma's restraints. She didn't know what to do. She began crying as the guards rough handled her and handcuffed her. Everything she had worked for was now gone. To the world, she was now an old man that was on his way to prison for a crime she didn't commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing she could do. Dominic covered his tracks well. </span></div></div>",

Even when she tried to slow down, the guards hit her in the back and forced her to pick up the pace. It felt like an embarrassing walk of shame to be escorted down the halls and paraded in front of her employees who now thought she was Dominic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out the back door, she was turned over to three men that looked like federal agents that were waiting with a plain looking grey van at the loading dock. One of the men opened the back of the van and Emma saw one of the clients from earlier already sitting inside handcuffed. However, she was wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and a burka was covering her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic's murderous power play was bad enough, but it felt that much worse for Emma knowing that an innocent young woman already fell victim to whatever nefarious plot he had. She had underestimated Dominic and now people were dead and lives were displaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emma climbed into the back of the van she heard what sounded like muffled gunshots. The agent that was behind her let out a grunt and fell onto the ground. Emma turned her head to look around when she heard several more muffled gunshots. Lisa heard them as well, but she couldn't see what was going on as the leg irons she wore were chained to the floor of the van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emma could figure out what to do, a brown haired woman in her late twenties wearing scrubs came around the van to meet her with a silenced pistol in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina...?\" Emma asked while completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time to explain. We have to move before Dominic sends security out after us.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Emma started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in the van now!\" Tina barked with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma reluctantly listened and climbed into the back of the van and closed the doors. Tina hopped into the driver seat and quickly sped off as armed Nexus security came running out of the building.  </span></div></div>",

Tina had drove for what had to be at least 45 minutes. But judging by the way she drove, they were probably at least an hour away from the Nexus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the van had stopped and the engine was cut off, Tina came around the back and opened the doors. Emma climbed out and stretched her legs while Tina uncuffed a teary eyed Lisa. Emma's joints felt unusually stiff; especially her knees and lower back. Dominic's older body was not as young or healthy as hers normally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Lisa asked as Tina finished uncuffing her leg irons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma heard Lisa and turned around so she could hear whom she had thought was one of her new technicians had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name really is Tina. I'm an undercover agent that was sent to spy on the Nexus.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma couldn't believe it. She and the board had to go through so many hoops to get government approval to set up the Nexus and they still spied on her. It wasn't that she wasn't grateful that it worked out in her favor but Emma had always been weary of the government being involved with the Nexus. They were worse than that snake Dominic or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dominic wasn't as subtle as he thought he was.\" Tina said \"He bought out enough influence to keep any official from being taken against him, but there are some of us who see him as a serious threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean? Can you get agents to storm and retake the facility before he causes more damage?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me? I want my body and life back!\" Lisa demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are probably going to have to stay as you are for the foreseeable future Lisa. Ms. Ju-Hui was already taken to the airport in your body and I don't know where she went or how to find her.\" Tina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just supposed to rent my life out of a couple of weeks to make some money for college and now I'm trapped in one of my classmate's body with people thinking I'm this criminal woman.\" Lisa said as she looked at her hands and began crying again. \"I wanna go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you can see but you're actually in the body of Fatima Hadid. She is a radical middle eastern terrorist. A terrorist with the blood of several people on her hands and now she is free again. I know your predicament is terrible, but countless people are now at risk\" Emma tried explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Dominic up to?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what we can tell, Dominic plans on using the Nexus to control governments through proxies and be some kind of shadow emperor... or empress now.\" Tina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Emma even more angry. It wasn't enough that Dominic stole her body and very identity but now he was going to be a tyrant while using hers. \"We have to stop him quickly before its too late.\" Emma said as she clenched her fists in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now you're the only man that has the knowledge to stop him.\" said Tina<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma knew Tina was right. If Dominic covered his tracks, she or rather he now was the last person alive that would know how to stop him and shut the Nexus down before it was too late. With the reality of the situation sinking in however, the idea of being anatomically male -specifically Dominic was repulsive. When she looked down she saw her real body despite the rest of the world seeing her as a fifty something year old man. She had no idea how this was all going to work. Especially showering and using the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

Really? I might have heard her name before...\" Lisa mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a two week rental, it ends almost a week after she returns from your senior class trip. She mentioned that she wanted to experience what it was like to be a caucasian woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Lisa answered. Lisa was surprised. She wasn't a racist, but she clearly didn't expect to switch lives with someone who was black. It would have been less unsettling if she didn't switch races. Staying inside this Latisha's life, would mean she probably would celebrate graduation differently while Latisha would take her trip to Mexico with Megan. That would mean she had to deal with Latisha enjoying her life and hanging out with Megan instead of her. \"Well I guess I said yes before, so how does this work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple,\" the woman said, gesturing for Lisa to proceed into one of the small rooms off the hallway. \"You'll need to change into the robe there, and we'll take your clothing over to Ms. Brown. Then, lie down on the chair in the center of the room and relax. At that point, we do all the work to make sure you have all of the information you'll need to live Ms. Brown's life for the next two weeks, and that people think you are her and vice versa. During the process, you'll be asleep. When you wake up, for the next two weeks, you will be Ms. Brown, and she'll be Lisa Hale. After that, you get dressed in the clothing she wore here, take the bus to her home, and spend the next two weeks being her while she vacations as you. There's a packet of information that we've compiled to help you live her life, just like the packet you helped us put together for her to live yours. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I shouldn't talk to her about things... is there a reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part, it's because it creates confusion. Also if other people over hear the conversation, it can get very awkward. Especially with your varying social backgrounds. Our general advice is to keep your interactions minimal. Of course with her taking your vacation, it shouldn't very difficult. Definitely something you should easily handle, I would reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes sense,\" Lisa said, neatly folding her clothes and settling down into the chair. \"I guess I'm ready then.\"</span></div></div>",

I remember things looker a little bigger than they are now \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Tina said as she helped Lisa out of the chair \"You're now just a bit taller as Latisha, the room hasn't changed at all, but, part of the magic affecting you has made it so you're sees yourself at Ms. Brown's height from your perspective. This is so there aren't any problems while you inhabit her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Lisa said, pulling her hands out in front of her and inspecting them. \"I thought you said she was black. How come I can see my hands and arms instead of hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're looking at your soul inhabiting her body. A mirror will show you what you actually look like.\" Tina said, handing over the clothes that Latisha had worn to The Nexus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the Latisha's panties with a moment of hesitation, feeling slightly odd about wearing another woman's underwear, but deciding not to dwell on it over much. She did however, stop when she picked up the bra. Finding it to be substantially different in design from the lighter bras she was used to wearing. \"38DD?\" Lisa read off the label. \"Um, this won't come close to fitting me, I'm nowhere near that big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just slip it on when you get dressed dear, you'll find it fits you just as well as it did for her. And believe me, even though you aren't that big, if you try going braless; not only will you feel the effects as if she went braless and everyone else would only see her braless. And trust me, there's a reason why women as busty as Latisha, or should I say you, don't go without support!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is a packet with information about Latisha's life. You can look it over when you're ready to leave. Now if you don't have any more questions, I'll leave you to get dressed\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I think I'm fine for now.\" Lisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tina left and closed the door, Lisa disrobed and inspected the clothes she was given. The panties looked a little larger than hers and were bright pink paired with a bra that was black. She also had some jeans that looked too big around the butt for her, a white cardigan and grey hoodless sweater with a zipper. Her shoes were a pair black and pink nikes. Lisa thought these clothes would look ill fitting on her when she remembered that she couldn't see how she actually looked. Spotting a nearby mirror in the corner, Lisa decided to checkout her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a difference her reflection showed. Latisha had a dark chocolate skin tone and was curvier than Lisa. Her hair sat loose around her shoulders like she had it now but looked wirey and unstraitened while her hairline faded into her forehead. \"Ugh. I hate this hair already.\" She said to herself. Examining her face, she felt her forehead was a little too big and her eyebrows too bushy. Her nose was rounder and looked less feminine. In fact, her whole face looked rounder with the exception of her thin and pointy chin. The only thing she liked about her face was the plumper lips. \"It's not like Tom would ever kiss me looking like this anyways.\" Lisa thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatisha's body was better than her face Lisa thought. She had bigger breasts, and larger, puffier nipples. They just happened to be the wrong color. Latisha's body wasn't fat, but she clearly didn't have as nice of a sculpted body as Lisa. Her hips were much wider and her butt rivaled that of a Kardashian. Turning around, Lisa admired her borrowed ass before inspecting the rest of her body. Her legs looked decent, definitely had more curves to them than hers. She didn't know what to think about her vagina. It was almost completely black and had short coily hair growing around it instead of normal public hair. Lisa thought that was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing in Latisha's clothes, she quickly read the highlights of her life before heading to her new address.</span></div></div>",

Latisha lived with her mom in an apartment that was in a rougher neighborhood than Lisa was comfortable with. As she stepped into the apartment lobby, she felt vulnerable until she realized that she blended in real well. Pulling out a key ring, Lisa figured out which key opens the front door by trial and error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing and locking the door Lisa called out \"Momma, I'm home\". Lisa read up on Latisha's file on her bus ride and knew that Latisha called her mom \"momma\". With nobody answering, she decided to find her room. The apartment was fairly small and only had two tiny bedrooms. The first one was clearly her temporary mother's room as nurse scrubs hung out of the laundry bin and the bed was king sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving onto the next room, Lisa saw what would be her temporary room. It had a twin bed with a cheetah patterned bed spread, several sports trophies on a dresser and few boy band posters on the walls. Lisa went inside and closed the door. Looking around, she found an old laptop and a spotted a small closet with the door half closed. Sitting down on the bed, Lisa thought about what she should do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the nightstand, Lisa noticed a picture frame. One side had a school photo of her boyfriend, Tom Anderson and the other side had an older photo of Latisha and Tom next to each other in school jerseys from when they played basketball together. Lisa realized why Latisha wanted to rent her life for a few weeks. She had a thing for Tom and with her life, she would be Tom's girlfriend while vacationing in Mexico! Lisa was a little upset. It seemed obvious to her that Latisha only rented her life to try and hook up with Tom and live out her fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to not dwell on what was out of her control, Lisa began to think about what she should do now to occupy her time. She could read more of Latisha's dossier that she had or she could check out Latisha's form. So far, aside from feeling a bit heavier and being taller, she didn't get to explore much of the differences at the Nexus. Lisa decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt different and the alien reflection she saw in the mirror at the transfer room in the Nexus had her fascinated. It's not every day a person gets to inhabit a different body, especially one that's built differently or a different race. Lisa took off her clothes and stood there in her bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching a small wall mirror, Lisa took in her new reflection. Latisha was sexy in a different way. Unlike her usual lean athletic body, Latisha had the curves and breasts that many women wished they had. Even Lisa sometimes wished she was built this way. Her hips and thighs were thick and curvy while her breasts were massive. Latisha had a round and plump ass that was often considered a black stereotype. Her skin was dark as chocolate and her normally straight brown hair was black and textured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa unbuckled the clasp on her bra and dropped it on the floor. Her breasts were huge with large almost black nipples. Cupping her brown breasts, her nipples started to become erect. They stuck out like pencil erasers. Feeling aroused, Lisa slipped a hand into her panties and began rubbing her vagina. Normally, she hardly ever masterbated. But when she did, she never felt anything like this. Latisha's libido was way more sensitive than hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her wet panties, Lisa moved back over onto the bed. Over the next several minutes, Lisa played with her borrowed vagina until she was hit with a blissful orgasm. \"If that felt this good, I can't wait to try real sex.\" Lisa thought. After all, if Latisha was going to use her body for sex, it's only fair Lisa got to experience sex in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from her orgasm, Lisa walked back over to the mirror and looked at her new form again. \"I could get used to the skin color, but that hair on this vagina has to go\" Lisa thought. She studied her face and thought about how she was going to deal with this messy hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lisa heard the apartment door open. Figuring that Latisha's mom just got home, she quickly opened the dresser drawers and searched for something to wear. Finding some grey sweat pants and and a white tank top, Lisa quickly put them on so she could greet Rhonda, who would be her temporary mother.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing hospital scrubs with a brown wool coat over top. \"Since when do you offer to help around here Tisha?\" Rhonda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gathered that Latisha must not often help mother with things around the house. \"You look tired and I figured you could use a hand.\" Lisa responded. Rhonda looked at Lisa and said \"I don't know who you are or what you did wit my daughter, but you're welcome to stay\". Lisa briefly worried that this woman saw that she was an imposter but was relieved when Rhonda started chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa spent the next couple hours helping Rhonda put away the groceries, cook and even washed the dishes while chatting with her. Lisa thought Rhonda was a really nice lady and that Latisha was lucky to have her. After Rhonda took a shower and headed to her bedroom, Lisa decided to shower herself. Going through the cabinet under the sink, she found an old package of razors and some shaving cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, Lisa took her time shaving her new vagina. When she looked down, she saw short straight brown hair as if she hadn't shaved in a while. Once the hair was off of her, it looked black and coily. Finding some bottles of hair straightening products on a shelf, Lisa thoroughly washed her hair and climbed out of the shower. With help of a hair dryer, Lisa managed to get Latisha's hair to be straight like she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa admired her naked form once again. Running her hands over her now smooth but blackened vagina. She spent another hour masterbating before heading to bed. Her first day as a different person was an interesting experience.</span></div></div>",

When she woke up, she was briefly confused about where she was until she remembered the events yesterday and temporarily becoming Latisha. Lisa got out of bed and decided to go to her gym. After searching through all of her drawers, Lisa got dressed. She dressed in a thong, some black yoga pants, a neon purple sports bra and grey sports tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Lisa almost an hour on 2 different buses to get to her usual gym as it was in another area of town as Latisha didn't own a car. Once inside and after paying for a pass, Lisa locked her bag in the locker room before hitting the weights. Latisha was much more solidly built than her, so Lisa enjoyed the ability to lift more weight. After about half an hour, she decided to move onto squats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile squatting, Lisa noticed all the guys in the gym. Several were hot, but one stood out. Sean Clark, one of Tom's friends was there benching. Lisa continued working on squats while watching him bench. He was 6'2\", with sandy brown hair and blue eyes. Lisa thought he was cute and seemed nicer than Tom was. Lisa began feeling aroused while watching Sean. Eventually Sean took a break and went to get water. Lisa decided to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sean. Getting that workout this morning \" Lisa said. Sean looked over and saw who he believed to be Latisha. \"Yeah I'm trying to stay in shape and stay occupied since I couldn't afford that trip to Mexico that everyone is going to.\" Sean said. Lisa felt butterflies in her stomach. \"Yeah I'm in the same boat too\" Lisa responded. Lisa hesitated for a moment but then asked \"do you have any plans for the next few weeks?\"</span></div></div>",

It made Lisa feel depressed, she had never experienced something like that in her life. She took a look around and started feeling like some of the looks from some of the people around weren't that welcoming.  She suddenly started feeling very out of place, which was strange since she'd gone to that same  gym for ages and never noticed any issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got cleaned up, picked up her stuff and headed out of the gym,  but not before noticing some of the contemptuous looks from some of the older ladies in the locker room.

The normally tall and curvy black woman admired the petite and athletic caucasian girl she saw in the mirror. Her face was gorgeous in an athletic way. She looked beautiful with her shoulder length brown hair and her neatly trimmed eyebrows. Her nose was a bit shorter and much skinnier. Latisha hated her nose, she felt it made her look too thuggish. Despite being black, Latisha was only attracted to white guys and they generally weren't into thuggish looking black women like her. \"But that's not who I look like with this face\" Latisha said smiling. Noting how her reflection copied her smile, Latisha got curious about what she was packing under her robe. Before she could examine herself any further, a red headed woman stepped inside her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see that you're already up and about Ms. Brown\" Tina told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Latisha told Tina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It quite is.\" Tina said before continuing \"I hope you enjoy your two week vacation from yourself. For the next couple weeks, you are Lisa Hale. She's the on/off again girlfriend of your school's quarterback that you have a crush on. And you and said crush both happen to be going to Mexico at the same time to celebrate your graduations from high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'm Tom's girlfriend? Like Tom Anderson? Like O.M.G!\" Latisha said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I hope these two weeks are magical ones for you Ms. Brown. Here is Lisa's file and her clothing. I'll let you get dressed if you don't have any questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be fine. Thank you.\" Latisha said as she stared at Lisa's pretty face in the mirror. As soon as the door closed behind Tina, Latisha threw off her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body is so sexy. No wonder why Tom went out with her.\" Latisha said as she marveled at her naked form. Lisa was everything she was not. Lisa was several inches shorter compared to her lumbering 5'11 form that generally intimated most men, especially white men. Lisa was also more petite and feminine looking than her. Cupping her breasts and feeling her nipples get erect, Latisha watched Lisa in the mirror do the same with her smaller and perkier breasts. Looking further down, Latisha admired her smaller hips and slenderer legs. But her vagina really caught her eye. It was shaven smooth and pink, totally different than the black Brillo pad she normally had between her legs. \"I'm so getting laid by Tom Anderson with this body.\" Latisha said before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her new clothing, Latisha put on a light blue bra that looked great on Lisa's body and some matching lacy panties. Throwing over the lovely blue sun dress and sliding on the pumps, Latisha was dressed as Lisa had been when she walked into the Nexus building a couple hours prior. \"I think it's time I went home and called MY boyfriend\" Latisha said before giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, although she did have to pack, she also had plans for the evening and they involved some alone time with Tom Anderson. Tom seemed slightly surprised when Latisha called him over, but as far as he knew his girlfriend Lisa was just in a good mood and he wasn\u2019t about to question it too much. <br>\r\nLatisha marveled at the contrast between her crummy apartment with her momma and Lisa's home. It wasn\u2019t a mansion by any means, but it a far cry from what she was used to and in a much better neighborhood. Tom had agreed to be  there in about an hour so Latisha started getting ready. She loved how silky smooth her new hair was, getting it styled took no effort at all compared to her original, coarse hair. Looking in the mirror she couldn\u2019t help but be in awe of whatever magic or technology that had made all this possible. She stared at Lisa's reflection and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her borrowed closet she was disappointed that Lisa didn\u2019t seem to have all that many sexy things, but if always being strapped for cash had taught her anything it was to improvise.  She wanted Tom's jaw to drop when he saw her, so she set about transforming a cute, red dress into a slutty, red dress. By the time she was done her time was almost up, \u201cHe'll be here any minute now!\u201d she exclaimed, looking at the time. She rushed to apply her make up and jewelry, throwing on the sexiest heels she could find, \u2018I'm definitely going to need to go shopping for sexier stuff for this trip,\u2019 she thought, as she checked her reflection one last time, \u2018but this will do for now.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and she put on her best, sultry smile as she opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tina continued talking to Lisa, explaining why they asked her to come in today. \"We called you in because we finished reviewing your application to rent out your life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean someone asked to rent out my life this summer?\" Lisa asked excitedly. She really needed money to pay for her college that she hoped to start this fall and thought that renting her life out would pay enough to last until next summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes in a matter of speaking... plenty of clients either expressed interest in renting your life, but all of them wanted a 90 day rental or longer...\" Tina told Lisa as she led her into her office and closed the door. \"...and some expressed interest in buying out your life entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"90 days? Do you guys even do rentals that long? Lisa asked. She had originally hoped to rent out only 2-4 weeks max. 90 days was way longer than she has hoped, but she imagined one of those rentals would probably cover all of her college tuition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We actually have quite a bit of rental plans. Some of them can last as long as 3 years. We wished to discuss potential earnings you could get for sales and also discuss a new program that we thought we would ask if you might be interested in.\" Tina said as she pulled out a couple folders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about sales... I have so much planned for my future that it would probably be unlikely I would want to sell. Money doesn't always buy us happiness.\" Lisa said to Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Most sales tend to not focus on currency, but status or achievement. You're young and seen as a blank slate and that's very valuable to many clients. For example, you're about to start college to become a teacher. A teacher could buyout your life and that person would become Lisa. They would then lead their life as Lisa as they wished, while you could skip college and become that teacher complete with their college degree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" Lisa said while sounding somewhat interested. She might look at that at some point. \"And what is this new program you want me to hear about?\" Lisa asked with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called our surrogate mothers program. About every so often, depending on the woman's pregnancy, you would keep switching into different woman and give birth to their children in their stead. Meanwhile, your body would be housed in a vacation resort with that woman inside relaxing until you gave birth, repeating the process. The trial contracts for that program is for one year and you would receive 1 million USD plus 50 grand per child that you deliver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa learned in school and from hearing other people's stories that child birth was generally unpleasant and painful. But if she did this for even just one year, she could pay her entire way through college and still be a millionaire afterwards. She just winced at all the pregnancy and child bearing she would have to endure. That money made the offer still sound somewhat attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa needed to pick something now or else she wouldn't be able to make the first payment needed to start school. Lisa decided to go with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I don't get to find out about the person who's renting my life until after it's done?\" Lisa asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll be perfectly honest, we've found that it creates problems. We had too many people back out when they found that the life they would be living wasn't appealing to them. In general, our clients lead nice lives, and can afford our services, but they all have reasons to want to be someone else for a little while. We've found that by setting your requirements for rental rate, and availability, in advance, we're able to find a client who can meet those requirements and execute the agreement. After all, they are the client, if you wanted to vacation in someone else's life of your choosing, then you would be the client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Lisa said, as Tina steps out of the the room. Despite what Tina had said, she found it hard to not look at the futuristic couch in the center of the room, or at the circle of strange and arcane symbols that were carved into the tile floor around the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after getting dressed in the simple white hospital gown, Tina took her clothing away and helped her into the softly padded couch. A clear shield was lowered in place over her eyes and lights began to dance across her face as Tina began to work her magic. A strange pulling sensation enveloped Lisa from the bottom of her toes to the top of her head, and the flashing lights before her eyes began to blur together as magic pulled her identity from her. Moments later, she drifted into a deep sleep while a new identity was laid over her body, and skills were downloaded from the client and mapped into her own brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa open's her eyes to see two big breasts as she has a sigh of relief that she is still a female and from the looks of it, this body seems to be a little older as she sits up and hear Tina's voice. \"The transaction is complete Lisa Hale....well now Amanda Roberts.

You are now the new commercial relationship manager at the bank downtown. Its funny that \"I\" am the relationship manager considering I've never been good with them. Growing up  I was always a geeky loner so I have no childhood friends, and between work and studying I made no college friends either. Now as a manager I am expected to be a \"Boss\" not a friend to my colleagues.  I rented your life to get the experience of being popular and having friends. Hopefully your life will allow me gain the experience necessary to make my own friends, until then enjoy my life and work. It really isn't that bad, just lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove the former Amanda Roberts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa put down the note and looked at the rest of the dossier. No siblings, aging parents, no one to notice Amanda.  It took Lisa a moment to realize, even though her body was similar she really was going to be living someone else's life and lifestyle.</span></div></div>",

If she could just skip college and all the headaches revolving around paying for it, she might be able to enjoy life again, even if it wasn't originally hers. \"So if I wanted to just sell my life right now, who would be interested in buying it?\" Lisa asked Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a file about you, she typed something into her computer and said \"We have quite a few people interested in becoming the new you. I have business women, heiresses and a variety of other men and women interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men...?\" Lisa asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes men too. Some are successful gay men, some are interested in becoming mothers and some just want to live life on the other side of the gender fence. Do you want to see what men are interested in buying your life?\" Tina asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about women?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them? We have a 31 year old nurse with no children, a 43 year old heiress worth over 50 million dollars, a 37 year old banking executive and the list goes on. It would take us a couple days to individually go through each female client interested in buying your life.\" Tina said while trying not to sound frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any female teachers?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina typed on her computer. \"There are 3 female teachers interested in you if you count college professors. The first is a 44 year old high school teacher, the second is a 33 year old kindergarten teacher and third is a 53 year old college professor.\" Tina read from the first query.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought if she was going to sell her life, she wanted to not be really old. She did want to enjoy some youth and find someone herself to start a family with. \"Ok, I think I have an idea of what I'm looking for. I want a woman, under 26, single, with no children and has the means to pay for an entire bachelors degree.\" Lisa said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina began a more specific query and typed away. \"I got 2 returns. 24 year old Mariana Cruz and 25 year old Kaitlin O'Connell. I'm printing out their summary file for you now.\" Tina said as she pulled out a few sheets of paper from her printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa could see the summaries had similar photos on them like the ones she had to take for her application. She began to look them over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>***</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana Josephine Cruz, 24 years old, 5'4 and 105 lbs. - Mariana Cruz was an attractive hispanic naval veteran who lost her left leg above the knee in an accident out at sea a year ago.

Her perfectly proportioned cheek bones tapered past her pouty lips to a cute chin. Her entire face framed by her flowing platinum blonde hair. She was the most beautiful woman Lisa had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Knights claims to have made some poor life choices and wishes for a clean slate. Her body comes with a mansion on the southside of town,a hefty bank account, steady employment, and a brand new porche 911. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is sitting in one of our back offices and needs to swap immediately.

Lisa quickly threw on the robe as Tina entered the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. Hale, here are Ms. knights things. I'm setting them on the table for you after we've finished the transference. Now come sit down in this chair in the middle of the room and we can begin...\" Tina instructed to Lisa. Lisa got up and moved over to the weird chair and laid back in it. Tina folded out a clear, glass looking satellite dish that sat about about 10 inches above Lisa's head and pointed straight at her. \"Ok I'll start up the machine. It's quite painless, but you'll fall asleep while we do our work.\" Tina reassured Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina left the room after she activated the machine, and Lisa began feeling sleepy. Lisa eventually passed out before waking up and seeing Tina standing over her. \"There you go. Try to sit up slowly Ms. Hale, or I should say Ms. Knights now. The transference was a success.\" Tina reassured a disoriented Lisa. Lisa sat up as the dizziness subsided and felt different. Looking at her hands, Lisa knew that the transference had been a success.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow that you've woken up, I'll give you some privacy to get acquainted with your new body. If you have any questions, feel free to ring this button and I come try to clear up any confusion. Tina left the room leaving Lisa with the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing her robe and letting it fall to the ground, Lisa came face to face with her new breasts.  Despite her shorter and petite frame Ms. Knights breasts were more than 6 times larger than Lisa's old pair. Lisa walked to the full length mirror to get a better look at her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to their size, Lisa assumed that her new breasts must be fake. But the quality of the surgeons work left no scar to be found. Moving past her new bussom Lisa admired her narrow waist and flat stomach. Widening out to her womanly hips. Lisa turned to her side to check out her perfectly toned ass. Lisa glanced over her shapely legs before turning back to her front for a good look at her new pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lick of hair to be found. Ms. Knights was as cleanly shaven as possible, giving Lisa a perfect view. She ran one her new slender fingers across her abdomen down to her new slit. Just brushing across her overly sensitive clit caused a shiver to run up her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to save the rest for later, Lisa grabbed her new clothes and began to get dressed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa reached for the pile of clothes that Tina had set off to the side. On the very top was a neatly folded pink G-String. Lisa had owned one pair of panties that could barely be called a thong let alone a full on G-String. She held the thin fabric in front of her face wondering if it could even be called underwear. Lisa smiled at the size 0 printed on the label. Lisa had always kept her body in shape but could never drop below a size 2. Despite Amber's hour glass figure, she wore a smaller size. A size that Lisa was thrilled she could now fit in to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slid the delicate panties gently up her legs until it wedged between her cheeks. The small V shape satin covered her new vagina perfectly without any excess fabric to spare. The string nestled in her new behind. Despite Lisa's innocence in her former body, the panties alone increased her confidence. They felt comfortable hugging her new sex as any pair she'd ever owned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the matching lace bra, Lisa again smiled at the 36GG cup size on the label. Making a fist with her dainty hands, Lisa found that the cups themselves were twice the size of her smaller hand. At only a 32B before the swap, she didn't realize how a larger rack could increase her looks and confidence.  She buckled the clasp and let the small cups hug her breasts giving them just enough of a lift to put them on full display. Lisa noticed how the lace barely covered her tiny nipples, still sheer enough to see through if you managed to catch a glimpse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slid Amber's leggings on one leg at a time until the fabric hugged her curves. Same with her Lycra work out shirt. Her outfit left very little to the imagination and Lisa wouldn't have it any other way. She'd begun to clasp her matching pink 6 inch heals when Tina returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to let you know that everything went well on Ms. Knights, excuse me, Ms. Hale's end, Tina stated. I must reiterate that per your contract you are not allowed to contact Ms. Hale under any circumstances. She wished to leave her old body and life behind giving you this opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was barely listening as she attempted to stand in her new heels. She didn't even own a pair this tall and was worried about walking in them. Tina continued to talk as Lisa stood up and walked to the mirror. Walking without a hitch, the clicking of her heels drowned out whatever it was Tina was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lisa realized that Amber's muscle memory made walking in her heels as easy as pie. She modeled in the mirror admiring the way Amber's push up bra and stripper heels accentuated her womanly curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again, if you try to contact Ms.Hale, we WILL take that body from you and give it to a more eager client. The last part snapped Lisa out of her trance. Checking Amber's purse and pulling out the keys to her new porche, Lisa thanked Tina for the opportunity and walked out the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery eye in the lobby locked onto her body as she clicked her way to the parking lot. Lisa had never been the center of attention and blushed knowing that every man was looking at her, not as a person, but as a piece of meat. </span></div></div>",

The plush leather hugged her new ass and rich wood trim filled the inside of the car. Not yet aware of Amber's profession, Lisa could have never have been able to afford this luxury car given her previous career aspirations. Lisa fired up the engine, brought up her new address using the satellite navigation, and sped out of the parking lot still smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes from home Lisa spotted a Star Bucks. She'd never felt the urge to drink coffee before but knew she just had to stop now. Lisa was greeted with the very first parking spot much to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out and adjusting her v cut shirt to show just the right amount of cleavage and exposed midriff, Lisa locked her car and noticed two extremely tall women walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to remember that at barely 5 feet tall, Amber was almost a foot shorter than she used to be. Not even her heels could make up the difference. Lisa was thrilled to realize that it was her mother Elizabeth Hale and her best friend Heather Rhodes. Waving frantically, the two women looked at Lisa with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" Elizabeth sneered as Lisa's heels continued to click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going out in public dressed like that. You should have a little modesty for yourself.\" Heather added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily my daughter wouldn't even think of buying clothes like that let alone leave the house dressed like you.\" Elizabeth yelled as they quickly walked past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had known Heather for as long as she could remember and was taken aback by their rudeness. There was no way she could reveal her real identity. What would they think of her? Luckily for Lisa, a young man held the door open for her allowing for her to escape the awkward situation. The young man was cheesing from ear to ear and stumbled over his words as she quickly thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa studied the menu and reached the front of the line having decided on a vanilla latte. \"I'll take a Venti Iced skinny sugar free caramel macchiato with unsweetened almond milk please!\" Where did that come from? Lisa had no idea what she ordered but her body must have craved it. \"The name for the order is Amber K...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute barista blushed while he interrupted her, \"I already know your name Ms. Knights. And the gentleman at the end of the bar offered to pay for your drink. We'll have it right up!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo many thoughts ran through Lisa's head. <i>How did the barista know my name? Did Amber come here often? The way the barista blushed made it seem like he knew more than just my name. The generous man at the end of the bar does seem nice. Maybe I should thank him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to where the older gentleman was sitting, Lisa smiled and stretched out her hand. \"Thank you for being so kind\" She'd also instinctively leaned forward just enough to give him a good look at the ample cleavage through her v cut shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure. My name is Robert Gould and I couldn't resist spoiling a woman as beautiful as yourself.\" Robert grabbed her hand and kissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the seat next to him, Lisa and Robert made small talk until her drink was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't help but laugh at the nervous barista when he walked shaking uncontrollably and handed Lisa her drink. \"Thank you for stopping by today Ms. Knights. Have a wonderful evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert slipped Lisa his cell phone number as she took a sip of her macchiato. It was the most delicious drink she'd ever tasted! \"If you're ever in need of a gentleman to show you a night on the town, please don't hesitate to give me a call...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa left the Star Bucks as confident as ever having just received a rich man's number with out even trying. She couldn't wait to arrive at her new house to see what her Amber's body had in store for her!</span></div></div>",

Tina pulled out another red folder from her desk and handed it to Lisa.<br>\r\nTina began telling Lisa about the other special client. \u201cMs. Victoria Anderson is a 23 year old woman who is in phenomenal shape. She was quite athletic in college. She is just shy of being 6 feet tall\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was even more impressed with this woman\u2019s photos than the last one. She had golden blond hair like her friend Megan had and beautiful bright blue doe eyes that would turn any man into puddy. Her face was very feminine and delicate. Looking at her body photos in a bikini, she was fit and toned. Her tight abs revealed a faint six pack and her legs looked like they were built for running. Her breasts looked to at least a size or two bigger than her own. Somehow, Lisa felt as if she knew this woman from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina got Lisa\u2019s attention back and continued to give her more details about this special client. \u201cMs. Beaumont recently graduated from Paddington University, which is considered the best college in the state. She graduated with a degree in sociology and minoring in business. She was a star volleyball player at her school where she was ranked as one of the top 10 female volleyball players in the country.\u201d Lisa thought about Paddington University, it was an elite school that she would have loved to attended if she ever stood a chance at getting admitted.<br>\r\n\u201cHer family is quite wealthy. Her father is partner at Beaumont and Stryde, the national investment firm. Her mother is the director of the city\u2019s parks and recreation department. She has one sibling, an 18 year old brother named Tom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s where Lisa recognized this woman from. She was her ex-boyfriend\u2019s older sister that she never met. Lisa vaguely remembered seeing a couple pictures of this woman the one time she was over at Tom\u2019s house. Lisa was curious to why she wanted out of her life. \u201cSo why does she want a new life all of a sudden? She sounds like she has a perfect life.\u201d Lisa asked Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina had to tread carefully. She wasn\u2019t allowed to lie or mislead clients, but she needed to close this sale soon. \u201cMs. Anderson does indeed have a seemingly \u2018perfect\u2019 life. However, one thing that she doesn\u2019t like about her life is her sexuality. She is a lesbian that has lived in the closet her whole life. What she wants the most is to have a normal life with a husband and children without needing a secret girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought about that, she could literally become the epitome of beautiful, instantly gain a degree from a college that she had no chance of ever getting into and be part of a rich family. All she had to give up was her attraction to men. Lisa had never felt attracted to other women before. Envy maybe, but nothing that turned her on. It probably only felt weird to her now since she was a heterosexual woman. Lisa personally thought the worst part about having Victoria\u2019s life would be having to deal with her asshole ex-boyfriend as a brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina could tell Lisa was considering the switch. She could see it in her face, like the hundreds of clients she pitched to before her. Her company foolishly accepted a slew of clients with contracts that guaranteed a buyer for their lives within a month. Ms. Knights and Ms. Anderson were the last two left since she closed the deal on the life of Ms. Anderson\u2019s girlfriend yesterday afternoon. The company would never again put a 1 month guarantee on a contract again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The company had a backup plan where she would switch with the last client in order to avoid any lawsuits. With Ms. Cooper\u2019s life having just been sold, Tina would get to become Amber Knights.

Tina could care less what she did with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lisa finished signing all the blocks on the user agreement, Tina handed her another stack of papers that included a contract. Lisa briefly looked over it before signing it. <br>\r\nTina began looking at the scheduler for the Nexus. \u201cI can get you in first thing tomorrow morning. We\u2019re quite booked, but special clients have the first priority.\u201d Tina said as she started typing and reserving a transference room on the company\u2019s scheduling software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was happy and excited. Tomorrow morning, she would get most of what she wanted in life handed to her. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she would be able to go to sleep. \u201cI can\u2019t wait\u201d Lisa told Tina while barely containing her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa walked out of the office and towards the waiting room, Tina also grinned as she no longer had to hide her own enthusiasm. Getting out of her chair, she walked over to a vanity mirror in the corner of her office and examined herself. She had her dark red hair in a professional bun while wearing a peach blouse and a black skirt under a white lab coat. Taking the lab coat off, Tina began turning different angles to examine the form she wouldn\u2019t have for much longer. At 31, Tina was in great shape and could often be mistaken for someone who was still in their mid-twenties. She wasn\u2019t fat or ugly, men usually passed her over as she looked average. Tomorrow, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about sleeping in an empty bed again.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though the facility had only been open for 10 minutes before she arrived, it still had plenty of people in the waiting room. She checked in with the receptionist and took a seat before deciding to browse one of the nearby magazines. While flipping through the pages of some home decoration magazine, Lisa heard a familiar voice call her name. Looking up, Lisa saw her best friend Megan. She had on some jeans, her school t-shirt and some sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I would find you here Lise.\" Megan said as she took a seat next to Lisa. Lisa was glad to spend her moments with her best friend before starting her new life. \"I'm going to be moving up in the world. How about you Meg?\" Lisa asked. Megan didn't seemed surprised or caught off guard. \"I'm trading my life in too. Hopefully my plans will work out. So who are you trading with?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could answer, Tina had came out to the waiting room and called her over. \"It's gonna be a surprise.\" Lisa told Megan as she went to Tina. Smiling and waving to Megan, Lisa went behind the door to the office. Lisa noticed Tina had her hair down and was wearing a white jumpsuit with the Nexus logo on the back of it instead of office clothes like she had worn yesterday. She seemed very cheerful today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa followed Tina down the hallway and passed her office. The two went up a flight of stairs before entering another long hallway that seemed as if it shouldn't fit in the medium sized building that the Nexus was located in. While walking down the second hallway, Lisa tried starting some small talk with Tina. Surprisingly, Tina told her that she managed to someone for each of her clients and that she was going to get a bonus. Lisa really didn't think too much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Tina led Lisa into a room with a weird looking dentist chair in the middle. She noticed it was very sparse and only had a couple things in it besides the weird chair. Tina opened a panel on one of the walls and pulled out a light blue hospital gown. \"Okay Ms. Hale, I need you to get changed into this gown while I go get your new clothes and items. I'll be right back in a couple minutes.\" Tina told Lisa before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down her purse began to get undressed. She wore sweats, sneakers and a hoodie. So it didn't take long to change into the gown Tina provided her. Lisa walked over to the mirror on the wall and examined herself for the last time as Lisa Hale. She thought she was still pretty, hopefully Victoria will think so too. Tina did indeed arrive after a couple minutes like she said. Folded up underneath her arm were some jeans, underwear and a red shirt. Tina set the clothes on the side table next to Lisa's clothes. \"Those are Ms. Anderson's clothes. Once were done, they will be yours. Now I need you to sit down in our transference chair over there.\" Tina said to Lisa as she pointed at the weird chair in the room. Once Lisa was seated, Tina folded out a glass looking satellite dish from behind the chair and centered it about a foot above Lisa's face. \"Now the whole process is painless Ms. Hale. I'm going to go into the control room and turn on the machine and you'll just fall asleep. Once you wake up, you will be Victoria Anderson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded to Tina to let her know she understood. Tina briefly smiled at her before walking out of the room. Lisa sat in the chair for a few minutes feeling nothing until she heard a faint hum above her face before passing out...</span></div></div>",

Before trying to stand up, Lisa saw her friend Megan come into the room wearing the same blue gown she had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Hale, are you alright? It's me Tina.\" she asked Lisa. Lisa was feeling much better but confused with what she heard verse what she was seeing. \"Megan?\" Lisa asked. Tina noticed that Lisa seemed to know the who was the body she occupied now. \"Ms. Hale, there has been an accident and we need to leave the building.\" Tina told Lisa. Lisa had a million questions she wanted to ask, but figured that she could be in danger and decided that they could wait. Getting out of the chair, Lisa felt as if her balance was off and the room looked slightly bigger. She went over to her clothes and managed to at least slide her sweatpants on under her gown before grabbing her purse following what looked like her best friend Megan out the door into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was dark and only had the emergency lights on. After going down what might have been the flight of stairs she had originally came from, she was led into what looked like a smaller waiting room with other women wearing the same blue gowns she had on. It was very barren and only had a few chairs in it. The woman who appeared to be Megan told her to wait here before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down and tried to get her bearings back. She still felt tired and disoriented. Looking around she noticed that the other women seemed to also be in the same boat as her. She saw Victoria, the woman she was supposed to become, Tina (who is in a blue gown instead of the jumpsuit she wore earlier), a very busty blonde that looked like that Amber woman she had been offered to become, and several others. One looked like she was about 7 or 8 months pregnant while another one looked like she was at least 300 pounds. Lisa eventually closed her eyes and fell into a light sleep.</span></div></div>",

It's designed to protect both of you. Violations can create legal problems and allow one party to seek damages against the other.\" Tina explained to Lisa before she got out of her chair. \"For example, the government might pull your new pension or GI Bill if they knew you were not the actual Ms. Cruz who earned those benefits. Likewise, your parents could disown Ms. Cruz and deteriorate the quality of your life that she purchased from you. Aside from you two and the Nexus, nobody can be privy to this sale.\" Tina said while sounding like a lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds harsh, but I understand.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa arrived Wednesday morning wearing some yoga pants and a long sleeved t-shirt wearing open toed sandals. She checked in and sat down in the waiting room with her purse on her lap. After about 10 minutes, Tina came out and greeted her. \"Come on back in Lisa, Ms. Cruz is already in one of the transference rooms and we've got yours set up. Lisa nervously got up and followed Tina down the hallway and even a flight of stairs before coming to a hallway that had doors labeled as \"transference rooms\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very sparse and had metallic looking floors and walls. There was a weird white reclined chair that looked similar to a dentist chair, but with cables and glass dishes all over it. There was a simple table and chair against the wall and a large wall mirror nearby. Tina opened a panel on one of the walls and handed Lisa a robe that looked similar to a hospital gown. \"Get undressed and put this robe on, I'll return shortly before we start the transference.\" Tina told Lisa before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down in the plastic chair and began disrobing, staring at her creamy breasts and perky pink nipples, Lisa thought about how she would miss her cheerleader body, her friends and her family. Deciding it's now or never, Lisa put the robe on and sat back down and waited for Tina to return. It felt like forever, but was probably closer to 60 seconds later when Tina arrived with some clothing under her arm, a purse overher shoulder and a prosthetic leg in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. Hale, here are Ms. Cruz's things. I'm setting them on the table for you after we've finished the transference. Now come sit down in this chair in the middle of the room and we can begin...\" Tina instructed to Lisa. Lisa got up and moved over to the weird chair and laid back in it. Tina folded out a clear, glass looking satellite dish that sat about about 10 inches above Lisa's head and pointed straight at her. \"Ok I'll start up the machine. It's quite painless, but you'll fall asleep while we do our work.\" Tina reassured Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tina left the room again and conveniently taking Lisa's purse and clothing, Lisa began feeling sleepy. Lisa eventually passed out before waking up and seeing Tina standing over her. \"There you go. Try to sit up slowly Ms. Hale, or I should say Ms. Cruz now. The transference was a success.\" Tina reassured a disoriented Lisa. Lisa sat up as the dizziness subsided and felt different. Looking at her hands, Lisa thought they looked exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel different. Like I'm smaller.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because Ms. Cruz was several inches shorter than you were. Our magicktechs had to tweak your soul so it would fit with Ms. Cruz's body without causing too many issues.\" Tina explained to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa pulled her hair around to look at her familiar brown locks before patting down her face and chest. Looking farther down she noticed an emptiness in her robe where her left leg was. Lifting up her legs, she only saw her normal right foot. She felt around her left thigh before discovering a fleshy nub. \"Other than missing my leg, I still look the same.\" Lisa told Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina grabbed the prosthetic leg and put Lisa's nub into it before tightening down a suction seal. \"Your mind can only see yourself based on how your soul looks. Your soul will always be that of Lisa Hale, so that's how you'll look to your own naked eye. We can do some minor modifications to it like shrinking you or removing a leg to avoid any cognitive dissonance. But the soul is generally hard to change based on magical limitations.\" Tina tried to explain to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to everyone else including being in any photos, I will look like Mariana Cruz\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're inside Mariana's body. Only to yourself you appear as Lisa. Let me show you.\" Tina said as she helped Lisa out of the chair and onto her feet. Lisa's first few steps were hard with a prosthetic leg. She had to lean on Tina for support as Tina led her to the mirror on the wall. Lisa couldn't believe it, staring back at her was the reflection of a latina woman with black hair and tanned skin. It was Mariana Cruz!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood in front of the mirror and touched her face, her chest and lifted up her rob to see the prosthetic leg she wore, while Mariana's reflection copied her perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to get dressed so I can wake up Ms. Cruz... I mean Ms. Hale. Do you have any questions?\" Tina asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Lisa answered as she watched Mariana's lips move in the mirror. Tina turned around and left the room. As soon as the door was shut, Lisa removed her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana had quite a body, minus her left leg. Lisa examined her new form in the mirror. Mariana had a cute face with a stoic jaw and shoulder length black hair. She didn't have any highlights like Lisa did. Her shoulders looked slightly broad and had athletically sculpted arms since she worked out a lot since leaving the navy. Her breasts were massive on her frame and and large brown puffy areolas. Her waist was rail thin and had washboard abs that led to wide hips. Lisa examined the tribal sleeve on her right arm and the Asian dragon that stretched from her left hip onto her stomach. Lisa turned around to look at her trademark hispanic bubble butt. Before examining some scars and birthmarks on her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking farther down in the mirror, she saw Mariana had a rugged landing strip above her brown vagina. Her vagina was different than Lisa's. Lisa had a smooth vagina that would pinch around her underwear and leave a crevasse that someone could see, Mariana had a larger vulva that stuck out and made a large camel toe. Lisa examined her legs in the mirror. Mariana had thick and shapely thighs and her right leg was short and curvy. Her prosthetic leg had some kind of black plastic cup wrapped around her nub that led to some metallic rod with a mechanical knee. It was about as thin as a leg to a yard chair and had a black piece of plastic shaped like a foot on the bottom. Luckily a neon green and pink tennis shoe was already on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned around and picked up Mariana's purple thong and tried to slide it on. Having trouble, she opted to sit in the plastic chair from before and put the bottom half of her clothing while seated. After putting on her jean shorts and trying her other shoe, Lisa stood up with a little difficulty and picked up the bra. Reading the tag, she saw that Mariana...well herself was now proud owners of the 38G club. Lisa put on her bra black spaghetti tank top with little effort before returning to the mirror to straighten her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to take some to get used to this.\" Lisa said to her reflection, while picking her thong out of her butt. Sitting down again, she went through her new purse to find her cellphone and wallet. Distracted with her new things, Lisa waited to be escorted to Tina's office so she could finish signing paperwork and leave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting upright, she saw Tina smiling at her before inspecting her hands and seeing what seemed to still be herself. \"Did it work?\" Mariana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the transference was a success. Congratulations Ms. Hale.\" Tina said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana looked down at her hands and then at her legs. They looked there. She tried lifting her feet up and saw two brown feet before her. She was so happy that she started crying. She was glad to be whole again, even if she was still herself. \"I'm so happy to have my leg back that I don't care if I'm still in my body.\" Mariana said while still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear, you're inside the body of Lisa Hale. You just look like yourself to your naked eye. Let me show you.\" Tina offered as she helped Mariana out of the transference chair. Mariana walked easily on her own up to the mirror where Tina guided her, but saw a stranger's reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dios, Madre\" Mariana said as she saw a teary eyed Lisa Hale mimick her lips in the mirror. Turning towards Tina, Mariana asked \"I'm Tina now? Like in her body with her life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are a young and healthy 18 year old girl named Lisa Hale that recently graduated high school. The world is once again at your fingertips.\" Tina assured Mariana. \"Now if you don't have any questions, I'll let you get dressed before we head to my office and sign some paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good for now. Let me get dressed and I'll be ready to sign whatever is left.\" Mariana said to Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tina took her cue and left, Mariana stared at the young gringa woman she had become in the mirror. Taking off her robe, Mariana admired her younger and leaner reflection. She had smaller and perkier breasts in the mirror but her large ones when she looked at her chest. \"I'm not going to say anything if this is how I get back into the navy.\" Mariana said to herself. While still nude, she practiced a quick salute before resuming her inspection. \"This girl is much slimmer than me, I'll probably save 10 seconds on the swim with just these smaller tits alone\" Mariana thought to herself while smirking. She really loved the long legs she now had and couldn't wait to wrap them around some guys. The thought of sex made her wet. She hadn't gotten laid since three days before her accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that exploration could wait until she got to her new home, Mariana got dressed in Lisa's clothes and sat down and played with her leg while waiting for Tina to return.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lisa was limping out towards the entrance she saw her friend Megan waiting in the lobby. Deciding that she needed to say hi to her best friend, Lisa changed her course towards Megan. Mariana didn't notice Lisa stopping to talk to someone and went outside before returning to look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Megan. I didn't know you knew about this place.\" Lisa greeted her BFF that didn't recognize her. \"I'm sorry, do I know you from somewhere?\" Megan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had forgot that people wouldn't be able to see her as Lisa. \"I'm Mariana Cruz. I used to be your BFF Lisa until an hour ago.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISA!?! Holy shit. You rented your life out to a one legged woman?\" Megan asked. \"Nope. I actually sold it to her so I could pay for college and allow her to rejoin the military.\" Lisa said confidently. Megan had always been the more vain of the two. \"I was going to try the rental thing out so I could afford to move into an apartment. But I guess they aren't in much demand if you ended up selling your life. Are there any rich people buying lives?\" Megan asked while staring at Lisa's prosthetic leg. \"Depends on how old you want to go.\" Lisa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana came back in and saw Lisa talking to some blonde woman. \"Mariana. I pulled \"your\" car up front. Let's take you home.\". Mariana walked up to Lisa and the blonde woman greeted her. \"Hey bestie, what brings you here?\" Mariana paused before realizing that this woman was talking to her. \"I'm here helping a friend.\" Mariana lied. \"Oh new Lisa, you're just as bad at lying as the old one.\" Megan said humorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa introduced Mariana to Megan and explained how she was her BFF. Mariana didn't really care since she would probably never see this woman again. \"Lisa... I mean Mariana... we need to go. You two can catch up later.\" Mariana said while sounding frustrated. \"Megan, call me when you're done. We can be new BFFs. My number is uh...\" Lisa said while fumbling through her new purse for her phone. \"...6345289279\" Mariana said to Megan for Lisa. \"Cool. Nice to meet you 'Mary Annie'. I'll call you after I leave here. I might be a new person too.\" Megan said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hobbled outside with Mariana following behind her. Once the two got inside Mariana's car, Mariana broke her silence. \"Look, I don't care if you want to keep up with your friends. But we just signed a non disclosure and you broke it before even leaving the building.\" Mariana said. Lisa knew where she was coming from. \"The non disclosure didn't say anything about other clients. Besides, I lost all my friends today. I need to keep something.\" Lisa responded. Mariana turned the ignition switch and looked at her face in the mirror before pulling out onto the street. \"Just be more discreet about it.\" Mariana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was quiet and awkward. Lisa barely knew anything about this woman and now wore her body and face. The two didn't speak until Mariana pulled into a parking lot of a apartment complex. Parking in a handicapped spot, Mariana broke the silence. \"Okay. This is your home, it has an indoor pool and that gym across the street knows you as a regular.\" Lisa looked at the gym and then at the door of the apartment. \"Seems nice.\" Lisa said while Mariana could hear uncertainty in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana helped Lisa out of the car and the two went inside and took the elevator to the second floor. Mariana pulled the keys out of her old purse and let the two of them in. Once the door was closed and locked behind them, Mariana welcomed Lisa to her new apartment. Lisa hobbled around taking it all in. Mariana had quite an apartment. Modern furniture, big leather couch, large flatscreen tv. Mariana went into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of water and pulled out a bottle of Heineken for Lisa. \"I always crack open a beer at the end of the day.\" Mariana said before handing the bottle to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hobbled to the couch and sat down. \"This is a nice place you got here.\" Lisa said. \"No, this is a nice place YOU have here Mariana.\" Mariana corrected her. Lisa apologized \"I'm sorry, all of this will take some getting used to.\". Marina looked at the brown haired gringa sitting on the couch wearing her clothes and old prosthetic leg. \"I know, I'm going to help you as best as I can. You're a young girl that gave me the one thing I've really wanted most. I want to help you get your new life on track. Monday, we'll set up your VA paperwork so you can go to that school you wanted. Tonight I'm going to show you how to take off and put on your new leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent an hour practicing taking off and putting Lisa's prosthetic leg back on. Lisa would still fumble with it, but was slowly getting the hang of it. The two began talking about key details of their lives when they heard a cellphone ring. Lisa pulled a Samsung S7 from her new purse and saw a number she didn't recognize. Answering it, Lisa heard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I followed your lead and sold my life too.\" Megan said on the other end. \"Wow Megan. You sold your life really fast. I hope you're happy with your new one.\" Lisa told Megan. Lisa knew Megan tended to be impulsive and almost never thought about anything in the long term. Hopefully she didn't make a poor choice just to be like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Rentals weren't paying enough money and so I sold my life off. My new life isn't what I originally wanted, but I have my OWN car and house that's paid off.\" Megan told Lisa cheerfully. Lisa wasn't surprised. Megan probably just picked something that sounded good because she always had to do what Lisa did. \"Well, I hope you're happy. Mariana is teaching me how to use my prosthetic leg right now.\" Lisa said while trying to change the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'm just left the Nexus. Wanna hangout?\" Megan teased Lisa. Lisa always had fun with Megan despite almost always ending up in trouble. \"Sure let me text you my address. I'll see you soon.\" Lisa said before saying goodbye and hanging up. Mariana heard Lisa's conversation and picked up her old phone to type the address to that Megan girl. Mariana didn't understand her, but was glad she wouldn't have to deal with her anymore as Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana spent about 15 more minutes helping Lisa with standing and sitting down before calling it a night. \"Okay MARIANA, I need to get home. I'll stop by tomorrow after I go to the naval recruitment office and do something fun hopefully.\" Mariana said to Lisa. \"Um, can we go shopping? I want to get some different clothes and maybe get my own look.\" Lisa said nervously. She didn't want to offend Mariana. \"Sure, I'll probably need some new things as well.\" Mariana said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood up and Mariana gave her a hug before leaving the front door. Lisa used her cain and limped over to the kitchen to get another beer before settling on the couch and watching tv. About 20 minutes later, Lisa heard someone knock on her door. Getting up slowly, she hobbled over to see who it was.</span></div></div>",

After giving her friend a hug, Lisa noticed that Megan was several inches taller than her and she wasn't wearing any heels! \"Your new place looks so nicd Lisa.\" Megan said as she sat down on the couch in the living room. Megan was never a girl to wear a dress that looked like that. It didn't show anything off. \"So what's with the dress? It looks like something my mom would wear to an event?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughed. \"Well, I'm now Cynthia Brooks, a 32 year old widowed woman and former mother of 4. She lost her husband and children a few months back in an accident on the freeway. She was depressed and wanted to start her life over again. So now I'm her.\" Megan said as she got up and showed off her new dress. \"So why can I still see you as you?\" Lisa asked. \"I asked for a change when I did the transference to be able to see other transferees as their original selves.\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I never expected you to pick someone so much older, I only lost a few years.\" Lisa said to Megan. \"Yeah, I didn't plan on going this old, but now I don't have to worry about buying a house or getting a job. I'm well off after she got the life insurance from her husband. And I'm still young enough to find me a cute guy if I can whip this body into shape.\" Megan said to Lisa. \"Wanna see what I look like?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was too curious and got up and limped toward her new bedroom to show Megan the mirror. Megan looked around the bedroom and took in Lisa's bedroom. \"I hope my house looks this nice.\" She said as she spotted the mirror. Megan stood in front of Lisa's wall mirror near her dresser and began trying out poses. Lisa caught up to her and saw her reflection. She was now a brunette that somewhat overweight. Her breasts were massive and sagged quite a bit. Her face was a bit gaunt and her nose was long and thin. \"I think I can make the new me prettier.\" Megan said. \"But these stretch marks really suck. I didn't see them until after we switched.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan lifted up her blouse and Lisa saw a pale flabby belly covered in stretch marks and some blue veins. \"Well, your body did pop out several children.\" Lisa told her. \"Yeah, I'll hit up the gym next week and get into shape.\" Megan said back to Lisa. Lowering her blouse, Megan and Lisa sat down on the end of her bed. The two chatted for a while before Megan...</span></div></div>",

Losing her leg had finally hit her and she was beginning to realize how difficult her life might be. She wanted to ask Mariana how she managed, but since she really didn't know her, she couldn't figure out how to strike a conversation with her. Lisa ended up letting Mariana drive since she Didn't feel comfortable driving one leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariana could sense Lisa's uneasiness, she knew exactly what she was going through after she had lost her leg. It took her almost 3 months before she could walk without a cain and she still had been learning how to do things with only one leg. At least until she bought Lisa's life and became her. She felt as if it was her duty to help Lisa adapt to becoming her, she deserved that much. Besides, it would be a few months before she would ship out to naval basic training and she needed something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's where is my... I mean your apartment is.\" Mariana said to Lisa. Parking her former car in the handicap parking spot near the entrance, they took the elevator up to the second floor. Fishing out her old keys from Lisa's new purse, Mariana unlocked the door and let Lisa in before following her inside. Lisa limped over to the couch in the living room with her cain and sat down. \"So for a couple hours today, I'm going to show you how to use that new prosthetic leg of yours, so you can actually walk.\" Mariana told Lisa who seemed somewhat cheered up by the concept. Mariana kneeled down and grabbed her leg. \"Let's start by showing you how to put it on and take it off...\" Mariana said warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple hours, Mariana showed Lisa how to care for her leg and practiced walking and moving a bit. While they were doing that, both women bonded while sharing some details about their old lives. Lisa learned how Mariana hadn't been with a man since her accident and Mariana learned who Lisa's on/off again boyfriend Tom was. Lisa told Mariana to call Tom up if she wanted some casual sex. It's what she used to do for her urges. While Mariana explained how she used to be bisexual that preferred men to women. Mariana showed Lisa where she kept all her toys that she used. Some of those toys and videos caused Lisa to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it was late in the afternoon, Mariana needed to go. She needed to see a navy recruiter before they went home for the day to start her paperwork for enlistment. She called a cab and told Lisa she would be by in a couple days to help her adjust. Hobbling away from the door, Lisa decided to shower and change into something more comfortable.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After drying off and fidgeting with her prosthetic leg, Lisa walked out of the shower and into her new bedroom. Mariana had a completely different taste in clothes than Lisa. Changing out her wardrobe would be on her to do list. Disliking Mariana's like for thongs, Lisa settled with just some sweatpants and a well worn men's shirt, Lisa sat on her bed to get changed when she saw her reflection again in the mirror hanging on the wall across the room from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her curiosity piqued again, Lisa sat up slowly without using her cain and limped over to the mirror. Mariana stood in the mirror completely nude once again. Lisa examined her backside before cupping her breasts. Watching her reflection mimick her exploration made Lisa horny. Lisa began pinching and pulling on her larger and thicker nipples until they became erect. Lisa then managed to get one of her nipples to her mouth where she licked and sucked on it. Normally Lisa was more conservative and unadventurous about sex, but somehow doing this seemed to turn her on now that she was Mariana. Lisa watched her reflection as one of her hands made it way toward her nether regions and parted her new vagina. She began to probe for her clit when she remembered all of the sex toys Mariana had. Fishing out a vibrator, Lisa turned it on and rubbed her newer and larger clit with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa spent a better part of two hours pleasuring her new body before remembering to get dressed. She watched some more of one of her tv shows before deciding to go to bed. Tonight had been an interesting night for Lisa.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa woke up suddenly from an unfamiliar phone ringing. Startled and briefly confused, Lisa looked over to plain wooden night stand with a different phone on it. Without thinking, Lisa picked it up and answered it. \u201cHello?\u201d Lisa asked unsurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa... I mean Mariana. It\u2019s me... well you. I wanted to call you and remind you about your physical therapy appointment at 10:30 this morning at the VA clinic. If you want, I can take you this time.\u201d Mariana said over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly yesterday all came back to Lisa. Looking down, she saw the oversized mens t-shirt she wore to be. Slowly looking up toward the end of the bed she saw the unfamiliar crumpled comforter covering her. Sliding the blankets off of her, she saw her light grey sweatpants she wore to bed. Looking at her legs, she noticed the flatness of the sweats where one of her legs should be. Stareing at her legs, she was brought back to reality from the phone at her ear. \u201cHello... Lisa... are you okay?\u201d. After a long pause Lisa finally responded \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just woke up. I\u2019d appreciate it if you took me. At least so I know where the place is and who I need to see.\u201d Mariana said \u201cI can borrow the folks\u2019 car and be there in a bit. Get dressed and I\u2019ll swing by.\u201d Lisa thanked her and ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Lisa tried to find her prosthetic leg. She initially couldn\u2019t find it until she stuck her head over the side of the bed and saw it laying on the floor against the side of the bed. She swung herself over to the bedside and slid off her sweatpants. Spending a few moments, Lisa used her hands to feel the nub where her left leg was supposed to be for a few moments before sliding on her prosthetic legs. After securing the mechanical device, Lisa stood up and took off her oversized shirt; leaving her in the nude. Lisa hobbled over to the mirror on the wall and looked once again at her foreign reflection. Mariana\u2019s body was very different from hers. She cupped her perky breasts and then looked in the mirror. Her reflection\u2019s hands basically covered her giant brown nipples and failed to contain her massive mammaries. Moving her hands to her stomach, she watched her reflection\u2019s hands in the mirror trace the Asian dragon tattoo that covered part of her stomach. Although she didn\u2019t care for the tattoo, it was hers to deal with for the rest of her life now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reached for her cane and used it to get across the room towards her new dresser with more ease. Looking through the underwear drawer, she managed to find a light blue pair of french cut panties. Sitting down on the side of the bed, she slid them on and got up to look for a bra. She settled on a white Nike sports bra after deciding it would probably be a good idea to wear with what she was packing. Judging by her bra drawer, it looked like Mariana wore sports bras most of the time anyways. Lisa finally settled on some teal shorts that was a bit more modest than the jean shorts she wore yesterday and a grey t-shirt that looked like some navy logo was on it. Lisa initially didn\u2019t want to wear the shirt since she really had nothing to do with Mariana\u2019s naval service, but it had the modesty Lisa was used to and she didn\u2019t have a lot of time before Mariana would be here to pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she managed to tie the shoe on her only foot, she heard a knock on her front door. Lisa got up and used her cane to traverse her new apartment. Opening the door, she saw Mariana wearing her favorite shirt and some skinny jeans that she used to wear on occasion to tease her ex-boyfriend Tom. \u201cThanks for helping me getting started with your life Mariana. Being you is so... different. Especially when the world thinks I\u2019ve been an adult and lived on my own for a few years.\u201d Lisa told Mariana after letting her in and closing the door. Mariana looked Lisa over and smiled. She knew Lisa was still young and inexperienced in the real world. She was also grateful for Lisa giving up her body so she could resume the life she enjoyed. It would be a few months before she would be in the Navy, helping Lisa getting her bearings was the least she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed her newly inherited purse and the two headed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She usually didn\u2019t get to drive her parents car and was curious on how Mariana convinced them to let her borrow it. After a couple minutes, Mariana broke the silence. \u201cSo this appointment is only about an hour long. I normally did one of these a week. Afterwards, I figured we could hangout and go over each other\u2019s lives a bit.\u201d Lisa thought about it and said \u201cyeah that would be great. I really wanted to get some new clothes and maybe get my hair done. You know, make your body more me.\u201d Lisa was worried that Mariana might take offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lisa\u2019s relief, Mariana didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cSure, we could do that. You\u2019re now me Lisa. My life is now yours and your life is mine. You should live it the way you want to. I know I\u2019m going to live my new life my way.\u201d Lisa still felt conflicted. On one hand, she wanted to go to college and become a teacher. She now could do that, but Lisa Hale was probably never going to go to college. \u201cI think I just need some time... your life and everything is so different from mine.\u201d Mariana looked at her and said \u201cLisa, I know you\u2019re legally an adult, but really you\u2019re still just a kid new to the world. Only now you have the body and life of a 24 year old amputee. I\u2019m going to help you as best as I can before I enlist and ship out... again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt more comfortable knowing someone was going to be there for her... at least a for a little while. Mariana pulled up to the hospital and parked up front in one of the reserved handicapped parking spots. \u201cLisa, in the side pocket of your purse is my handicap placard. Can you pass it to me?\u201d Mariana asked. Lisa unzipped the side and pulled out a blue placard that Mariana hung on the rear view mirror. As Mariana hung the placard, she briefly stared at her alien reflection. She was still getting used to seeing herself as a petite white girl that would barely be considered an adult. Mariana pushed those thoughts aside as the pair got out and headed inside the hospital. Lisa barely made the appointment on time since her walking speed with a cane was much slower than a normal person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for about 20 minutes in a waiting room, a Asian man in his early forties came out to greet her as if he knew her. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again Mariana. Are you ready for another round today?\u201d Dr. Wong asked Lisa. Lisa got up and smiled as she walked to one of the back rooms with Dr. Wong. It took a minute but Dr. Wong seemed to be patient. Once inside, she sat down and Dr. Wong examined how her prosthetic leg seemed to be seated on her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was interesting looking at another woman\u2019s profile and imagining herself in the photos. Ultimately it didn\u2019t matter since Mariana would be leaving behind whatever social life or friendships Lisa had behind soon. Mariana eventually needed to pee. Picking up her purse and phone, she headed to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding one of the single unit unisex bathrooms, she went inside and locked the door. Mariana shimmied out of her tight jeans and sat down on the toilet conducted her business. Once she was done, she pulled up her plain panties and managed to shimmy her pants back on. As Mariana washed her hands, she looked up confronted the unfamiliar reflection in the mirror. Growing up, Mariana had been raised by one of her aunts after her parents died at the age of 4. Her aunt never really liked her and Mariana spent as much time away from home as possible. One of the few things she had been proud of was her hispanic heritage. Now she was just some gringa girl who could speak Spanish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining her face, she admired her soft features, her pale skin and blue eyes. Mariana had to admit, Lisa was a cutie. Now that she had two legs again, she would have no issues getting laid. With Lisa\u2019s body and her experience, she would be one hell of a fuck buddy. Mariana turned sideways and examined her new body\u2019s bust. Despite when she looked down and still saw her old tits, they still felt different, lighter even. It was almost as if her boobs had the weight of Lisa\u2019s perky B cups. Mariana made a few faces in the mirror before realizing that she should head back to the waiting room. Picking up her purse, Mariana returned to waiting on Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long hour, Lisa and Dr. Wong emerged. Lisa seemed a little tired but in good spirits. After scheduling another appointment, Lisa returned to Mariana. \u201cThank you for taking me today. I think I\u2019ll eventually be able to eventually walk much easier without a cane.\u201d Lisa said smiling. The two headed out of the hospital without saying much. Lisa still struggled to walk but seemed a little more refined with her balance.<br>\r\nOnce the two were in the car Mariana spoke up \u201cOkay, where to next?\u201d. Lisa already knew where she wanted to go. \u201cThe mall. I need some new clothes that are more me. Especially underwear, I can\u2019t wear thongs\u201d. Mariana laughed. \u201cI\u2019m always wearing thongs, especially since I had the ass for it.\u201d Mariana said as she turned on the ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later Mariana pulled up into the mall parking lot. Parking in one of the handicap parking spots in the front, the pair got out and headed inside the mall. Only a few minutes into their shopping trip, Lisa and Mariana ran into...</span></div></div>",

Likewise, your parents could disown Ms. O'Connell and deteriorate the quality of your life that she purchased from you. Aside from you two and the Nexus, nobody can be privy to this sale.\" Tina said while sounding like a lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't feel like going through all that trouble.\" Lisa said to Tina before walking out of Tina's office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa returned back to the Nexus 5 days later after being called that the other 'participant' was available. Lisa showed up late in the morning. Being in a hurry, she wore some grey yoga pants and a white long sleeved t-shirt with some comfortable open toed sandals. She checked in and sat down in the waiting room with her purse on her lap. After about 10 minutes, Tina came out and greeted her. \"Come on back in Lisa, Ms. O'Connell is already settled in one of the transference rooms and we've got yours set up. Lisa nervously got up and followed Tina down the hallway and even a flight of stairs before coming to another hallway that had doors labeled as \"transference rooms\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very sparse and had metallic looking floors and walls. There was a weird white reclined chair that looked similar to a dentist chair, but with cables and glass dishes all over it. There was a simple table and chair against the wall and a large wall mirror nearby. Tina opened a panel on one of the walls and handed Lisa a robe that looked similar to a hospital gown. \"Get undressed and put this robe on, I'll return shortly before we start the transference.\" Tina instructed Lisa before closing the panel back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down in the plastic chair and waited for Tina to leave before disrobing. Once she was down to just her panties, she stared at her perky breasts and pointy nipples, Lisa thought about how she would miss her cheerleader body, her friends and her family. Figuring it was too late to go back, she decided that \"it was now or never\". Lisa put the robe on and sat back down and waited for Tina to return. It was really weird, within seconds of getting redressed in the robe, Tina came back in with a folded up dress and a pair of boots under her arm. She also had a large purse over her shoulder..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. Hale, these here are Ms. O'Connell's things. I'm setting them on the table for you after we've finished the transference. Now I need you to sit down in this chair in the middle of the room so we can begin...\" Tina instructed to Lisa. Lisa got up and moved over to the weird chair and laid back in it. Tina folded out a clear, glass looking satellite dish that sat about about 10 inches above Lisa's head and pointed straight at her. \"I'm starting up the machine in a few moments Ms. Hale. It's quite painless, but you'll fall asleep while we do our work.\" Tina reassured Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina left the room again and took Lisa's purse and clothing. Lisa began feeling sleepy moments later. Lisa suddenly passed out before waking up and feeling groggy. The first thing she when she woke up was Tina standing over her. \"The procedure was completed without any complications. Try to sit up slowly Ms. Hale, or I should say Ms. O'Connell now. \"The transference was a success?\" Lisa asked while still not fully awake. Tina reassured a disoriented Lisa while helping her sit up. As Lisa sat up as the dizziness subsided and she felt different, thought looking at her hands, Lisa thought they looked exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel different. Like I'm bloated.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're feeling how Ms. O'Connell was feeling before the transference. Our magicktechs had to merge your soul with Ms. O'Connell's body, You're going to feel exactly what she feels.\" Tina explained to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa examined her arm before pulling a lock of her hair around to see her familiar brown hair before patting down her face and chest. \"Besides feeling bloated, I still look the same. You sure it worked?\" Lisa asked Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mind can only see yourself based on your soul. Your soul will always look that of Lisa Hale because it was your original body. That's how you'll look to your own naked eye. We can do some minor modifications to it like shrinking you or removing a limb to avoid any cognitive dissonance, but the soul is generally hard to change based on magical limitations.\" Tina tried to explain to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to everyone else including being in any photos, I will look like Kaitlin O'Connell\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're inside Kaitlin's body. Only to yourself you appear as Lisa. Let me show you.\" Tina said as she helped Lisa out of the chair and onto her feet. Lisa's first few steps felt weird, like her center of gravity felt off. As Tina led her to the mirror on the wall, Lisa couldn't believe it. Staring back at her was the reflection of a chubby red headed woman with bright green eyes and pale skin. It was Kaitlin O'Connell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood in front of the mirror and touched her face, before poking her chest and examining her hands, while Kaitlin's reflection did the exact same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing Tina's awkwardness, Lisa stopped and turned her head towards Tina. \"I'll leave you to get dressed so I can wake up Ms. O'Connell... I mean Ms. Hale. Do you have any more questions?\" Tina asked Lisa. \"No.\" Lisa answered as she turned her head towards the mirror watched Kaitlin's lips move in the mirror. Tina turned around and left the room. As soon as the door was shut, Lisa removed her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin didn't have what Lisa would consider a great body.  Lisa examined her new form in the mirror while her hands squeezed her bulging muffin top. Kaitlin had a cute face with a button nose and luscious red hair that went past her shoulders. Her hair had volume and looked well maintained. Her face had some faint freckles while her shoulders and chest seemed to have much more. Unlike her normal tight and athletic body, Kaitlin's was pudgy and flabby. Her freckled breasts were massive, but looked in place on her plump frame. Her giant pink nipples could barely be covered by her hand. Her waist was wide and had pooch hanging out where her abs normally would have been. her wide hips gave her body a pear shaped appearance. Lisa turned around to look at her butt and it looked horrible. She definitely needed to lose weight and tone up this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking farther down in the mirror, she saw Kaitlin had a full, untamed red bush above and around her vagina. All the hair made it impossible for Lisa to clearly see. Lisa had a smooth vagina that would pinch around her underwear and leave a crevasse that someone could see. She could tell that Kaitlin had a large vulva that stuck out and made quite a camel toe. Lisa examined her legs in the mirror. Kaitlin had thick thighs that looked as if they would touch each other if she stood normally. Looking farther down, she noticed her feet seemed larger and less feminine than her feet normally did, while her chipped toenails were painted an ugly turquoise color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was not thrilled with how she now looked to the world. Deciding that getting dressed and getting out of here before she had a meltdown, she turned around and picked up Kaitlin's large pink thong and slide it on. Having balance trouble, she ended up sitting in the nearby chair from before and put on her socks while seated. Lisa stood up with a little difficulty and picked up the plain bra with wide straps. Reading the tag, she saw that Kaitlin...well herself was now part of the 42EE club. Lisa easily put on her bra before sliding the white dress over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned to the mirror, Lisa tried straightening her hair. \"It's going to take some to get used to this.\" Lisa said to her reflection, while picking her thong out of her butt. Lisa hated wearing thongs. Sitting down again, she started going through her new purse to find her cellphone and wallet. However, before she could get very far, Tina came back to escort her to the office to finalize some paperwork.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaitlin suddenly woke up with Tina standing over her. \"Welcome back sleepy head. Try not to move too fast as the transference can be disorienting.\" She heard Tina tell her. Kaitlin was able to recover fairly quickly. Although she felt as if she just got off of some crazy roller coaster, she wasn't nearly as dizzy when she first woke up. Sitting up slowly, she managed to sit upright while using her arms to support herself. The first thing she noticed aside from seeing Tina with a cheeky smile staring at her. Inspecting her hands she noticed that she seemed to still be herself. \"Did it work?\" Mariana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the transference was a success. Without any complications might I add. Congratulations Ms. Hale.\" Tina said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin looked down at her slightly pudgy hands and then at plump legs sticking out under the gown she was wearing. Lifting up her feet, she saw the same two feet that she had seen for her entire life. \"I don't get it. I feel more energized, but I look the same. Are you sure this procedure worked?\" Kaitlin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely worked. You're inside the body of Lisa Hale, the 18 year old recent high school grad and former cheerleader that you agreed to exchange with. You just look like yourself to your naked eye. It is complicated to explain, just let me show you.\" Tina offered Kaitlin her hand as she helped her out of the weird transference chair. Kaitlin walked ease on her own up to the mirror where Tina guided her, but was lost for words when she saw a stranger's reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me?\" Kaitlin as she saw a blue eyed Lisa Hale mimic her lips in the mirror when she spoke. Turning towards Tina, Kaitlin asked \"So I'm this Lisa girl now? Like in her body with her life?\" Kaitlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, for all intents and purposes, you're now Lisa Hale. You have her body, which includes her DNA and all physical properties such as her dimensions and weight. Now if you don't have any questions that can't wait, I'll let you get dressed while I head to my office and sign some paperwork with the former Ms. Hale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine for now. This is so much to take in.\" Kaitlin said to Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tina took her cue and left, Kaitlin stared at the young fit woman she had become in the mirror. Taking off her robe, Mariana admired her younger and leaner reflection. She had smaller and perkier breasts in the mirror but her large ones when she looked down at her chest. \"If the boys see what I see in the mirror, I'll be able to have my pick \" Kaitlin said to herself while giggling. While still nude, she turned different angle to inspect every inch of her new flesh. \"This girl is much slimmer than me, I'd never would have gotten this thin on a diet\" Kaitlin thought to herself while smirking. Looking at her reflection, her smirk on Lisa's face made her look like a stuck up bitch. She really didn't mind however, thinking that with her new body, she had every right to be one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to look down she loved her flat and tight stomach. She now had a toned ass that firm. Even her vagina was different. aside from being completely shaven, it was darker than her old pink one and completely smooth as her labia didn't stick out. Examining farther down, Kaitlin marveled at the long athletic legs she now had and couldn't wait to wrap them around some guys. The thought of sex made her wet as she saw moisture forming on her vagina in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin hadn't been laid for a couple years. After gaining some weight in her early twenties, she became too self-conscious about her body image. After a bad date, she never partook the dating field and opted to have a cat as a companion. She would miss her Angela, but figured this Lisa woman would take care of her now. Deciding that she really needed to get dressed. Kaitlin picked up the tiny blue panties that looked way too small for her. Looking at the mirror once again, she saw that they looked fine for her reflection. Deciding to try and put them on, she was amazed how they seemed to magically warp to fit her perfectly. \"Interesting.\" Kaitlin said aloud, examining her new reflection clad in only panties before trying on the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, Kaitlin was fully dressed in the clothes that Lisa wore to the Nexus. She straightened her hair in the mirror before returning to examining her body once again. \"I can't believe this girl is me now. I can't wait to see what outfits she... or rather I have now.\" After being dressed for a few minutes, Tina returned to escort Kaitlin to her office. As they headed back down the stairs into another hallway, Kaitlin saw someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was walking away towards the lobby. She had brown hair and wore the same kind of dress and boots she wore to this appointment. \"Is that her?\" Kaitlin asked Tina as they went into her office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa felt tired and upset as she walked towards the exit to the lobby. All she wanted was to find a way to make some money so she could afford to go to college. In her fixation of getting the money she needed, she didn't realize the cost right away. Once she finished signing all the forms in Tina's office, it hit her like a brick. Although she now has enough money to attend school, she lost her family, her friends, her body and literally her identity. Now she was 7 years older, somewhat overweight and couldn't go back to cheer leading or dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Lisa was able to find the red Toyota Prius that Kaitlin owned. It wasn't terrible looking, but it definitely looked as if it was several years old. Getting inside and placing her new purse on the passenger seat, Lisa unlocked the Kaitlin's or rather her phone with her thumbprint. She quickly asked for directions for \"Home\" and the phone made a route for her. Looking into the rear view mirror, she saw green eyes stare back at her. She cried for what she just lost as she drove to some new home, knowing her old one wasn't \"hers\" anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Lisa almost 45 minutes to get where the GPS told her to go. Traffic had been bad on the freeway, though Lisa was able to compose herself more by the time she made it to the apartment complex that she now lived in. Her new place didn't look terrible, The apartments were only 3 units high and some kind of grounds keeping maintained the tiny grass lawn and bushes in the front of the buildings. Pulling up to her building, Lisa noticed of the 3 floors possible, she now lived on the 3rd floor. The walk up to her door took more energy out of her than she expected. Normally Lisa was very athletic and never really thought much about going up 3 flights of stairs. However, she now felt as if she had just finished doing a 20 minute cheer routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she was greeted by a black and white cat. Setting her purse and keys down on the dining room table, Lisa sat down and opened a folder that had been waiting for her. Unlike herself who had to fill out pages of information about her life at the Nexus, Kaitlin left most of that information about her life at home for her. It had her passwords, banking information, work information and health information. Lisa spent the next hour going over it. While Kaitlin wasn't really poor, she only had enough money for Lisa live off of for several years. Which meant that Lisa had to still work. Moving on to the work section, she was now a secretary at some computer software company and her boss was named Matt Landry. Kaitlin was nice enough to have taken tomorrow off, giving Lisa a longer weekend before starting work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin seemed fairly healthy without any major medical issues, but before she could finish going through the rest of the file, Kaitlin's cat jumped on the table and began bothering her. Lisa figured she was probably hungry. It didn't take long to find the cat food on top of the refrigerator and put it in the bowl on the floor. Still the cat didn't seemed impressed. Lisa decided that she herself should probably eat something before showering and going to bed. She heated up some premade frozen dinner and helped herself to some wine. Lisa wasn't old enough to drink alcohol, but now it was one of the few perks she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating, Lisa found the bathroom and began undressing. With the shower warming up and down to just her panties, she looked at her topless reflection in the sink mirror. The pudgy torso of Kaitlin O'Connell stared back at her. She hated how fat she now was as she placed her hands over her new muffin top. Looking down and cupping her perky and youthful breasts, Lisa looked up to see Kaitlin's reflection struggle with the massive breasts she now truly had. Deciding on not crying again, Lisa stepped into the shower and began washing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm water was relaxing for Lisa, more so than normal. Lisa looked for the shampoo when she noticed a black vibrator next to the conditioner. She decided to ignore the object and lather herself up with the loofah. At first it felt weird to use another woman's loofah, but she rationalized that it belonged to her body now. As she lathered her body, Lisa began feeling warmth in her loins and tingling in her nipples. Lisa normally never felt horny like this. But then again, she had Tom to scratch her itches. deciding to give it a try, Lisa picked up the vibrator and turned it on. She slowly stuck it inside of her and her knees began to feel weak. She wanted to use one of her hands to give attention to her nipples, but she needed her free hand to help her balance. Deciding that the shower wasn't the best place for her, Lisa quickly rinsed off her hair and wrapped herself in a towel before heading to the bedroom...</span></div></div>",

Figuring that sarting college at 19 wouldn't be so bad if she had enough money to give her an advantage with college and her life. \"I'd like to enroll in the surrogate mother program\" Lisa told Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's excellent. We've had a shortage of volunteers, so you will be kept busy.\" Tina told Lisa as she started printing out a contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa knew the next 12 months were going to be rough, but she tried to picture the money that she would make. \"Women have been giving birth since the beginning of time, I'm sure I'll find a way to manage.\" Lisa thought to herself to bolster her confidence. After signing all the paperwork, she asked \"So when do I start and who will I be a surrogate for first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immediately. I notified our first client while you were signing the paperwork. She should be here in a couple hours. In the meantime, I'll take you to your transference room where you can watch a company video about the program. All clients are anonymously drawn for you on a first come, first serve basis.\" Tina told Lisa as she got up and ushered her to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa followed Tina down a hallway and flight of stairs until she ended up in a room with metallic looking walls. It was sparsely decorated with minimal furniture that included a simple white table, plastic chair and a wall mirrror. There also was something tall in the corner that was covered up with a sheet. Lisa sat down in the chair while Tina used a remote to summon a projector out of a wall panel. \"The video should be close to being over when the client arrives.\" Tina told Lisa before handing her a simple cotton robe. \"You can get changed into this while you're waiting too, the client will need your clothes to travel to our resort.\" She explained. Walking over to the object in the corner, Tina pulled off the cover and revealed a white egg shaped pod with a glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our new transference pod that uses remote transference technology. From here on out, your body at the resort will be near one of these so we can seamlessly transfer you to our next client without too many delays.\" Tina said proudly. \"If you don't have any questions, I'll leave you to get undressed and watch our video.\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Lisa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina walked out the door and Lisa began getting undressed while watching the video. It seemed like Lisa waited forever, and the informational video was really boring. She was slowly falling asleep when the video suddenly cut off and Tina came back in with a bag. \"Okay Lisa. Our client arrives and is ready to start, let's get you into the pod to begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked over to the pod, where the door opened and revealed a ergonomic seat to sit on. Once inside, Tina closed the door and spoke to her through an intercom system. \"Lisa, the transference is relatively painless. You'll fall asleep and wake up about 40 minutes later with your soul residing in the client's body. To yourself, you'll still appear as you. But everyone else and including anything to see yourself other than your own naked eye, you will be the client and vice versa. In this program you will reside at a luxury hotel furnished by us until the client's due date or if you go into labor early. About 4-7 days after giving birth depending on complications and being released from the hospital with a clean bill of health, you will be brought back here to the Nexus to transfer over to the next customer. I need a verbal acknowledgement that you understand.\" Tina read off the non disclaimer to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand and I'm ready to get started.\" Lisa responded back. Hearing a faint hum around her, Lisa leaned back in the chair and fell quickly asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa slowly but groggily woke up. The first thing she noticed was that she was now in a different room than when she fell asleep in the transference pod and she how different she felt. The room she was now in looked more like an x-ray room in a hospital. There were several medical looking devices in the room with diagrams of various parts of the human body hanging on the wall. Lisa struggled to sit up, but managed to do it slowly. Before she could get to her feet, another woman dressed similarly to how Tina was dressed walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Hale.. I mean Mrs. Chan, I need you to wait while I check your vitals.\" she said to Lisa. The woman looked to be older than Tina was, probably in her mid forties. Unsure of what to do, Lisa meekly said \"Okay\" as the woman rolled a small machine over to where she was sitting and began checking her vitals. While the woman was busy strapping the cuff of the blood pressure machine to Lisa's arm, Lisa thought about how different she felt. Currently, she felt like she ate too much and felt bloated. Yet she was extremely hungry. Like she hadn't eaten anything in over a day. Her feet felt swollen and her vagina felt worse than it usually did when she was getting ready to start a bad period. Overall, she felt like she could handle this as long as she didn't have to run or do cheerleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the lady who Lisa still didn't even know the name of finished all her tests. Lisa's blood pressure, pulse, temperature and breathing were all \"normal\" according to the woman. Once she finished putting away the blood pressure machine and other medical devices, she helped Lisa onto her feet. Lisa was glad for the help since her legs felt like Jello. The woman finally opened up to Lisa and introduced herself. \"I'm sorry Lisa. I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Eleanor and I work for the Nexus as an obstetrician  in the Surrogate Mother Program. I don't know if Tina told you about who I was, but I will be with you for the next several months for when you go into labor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down at herself, noting that she was wearing a different hospital gown that had small pink patterns on it and placed her hand over her flat stomach and said \"I don't think I'll be going into labor anytime soon. I don't even look pregnant.\" Eleanor chuckled and said \"Oh, you're quite pregnant Lisa. Mrs. Chan or rather you are 37 weeks along. When I checked her this morning, she was already beginning to dilate which means the baby could come any day now.\" Lisa did at first think that this woman was wrong, but how her stomach and vagina felt, she did have to waddle like a pregnant woman would down the hallway. Luckily, Lisa didn't have to travel very far as the room she was to be staying in was nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor showed her into her temporary room, which looked pretty much like how Lisa would expect a single bed hospital room would look like when people paid extra money for the privacy. \"This room and others like it will be where you'll be staying while you're in this program. There is a call button beside the bed over there if you need anything or feel as if you're going into labor. I'll leave you to get settled in and stop by later with some food for you.\" Eleanor said before walking out of the room and down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a quick look around the room. The floor was white with large waxed tiles like hospital rooms normally were and the room had only basic furniture. There was a large TV mounted on the wall and a desk in the corner with a computer on it. The bed was your basic run of the mill hospital bed that could recline and had wheels to be carted out if need be. The mattress looked thin and not very comfortable looking. Still, Lisa didn't think this was going to be that bad. She was getting paid quite a bit of money to lounge around, eat food and probably binge watch television. In fact, she wanted to see what shows were available to watch after she used the bathroom. Right now she needed to pee since without warning, her bladder felt strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa waddled into the en suite bathroom and closed the door behind her. She was at least glad the bathroom wasn't super tiny like most were in a typical hospital. This one even had a full sized bathtub with water jets in it like a Jacuzzi. As Lisa stared at it for a moment, she realized that it was a Jacuzzi bathtub. She thought about trying it out later tonight before going to bed. But as she waddled towards the toilet, something in her peripheral vision caught her attention. As she turned her head she saw herself in the mirror... except it wasn't her in the mirror. It was an Asian woman! a very pregnant Asian woman wearing the exact same hospital gown she was wearing! As she faced the mirror, the Asian woman mimicked her movements perfectly. She even had a similar worried face as Lisa probably had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Lisa remembered the briefing and reflections. It all made more sense now after she seen it with her own eyes. She was now inhabiting this Asian woman's body while waiting to give birth in her stead. Lisa wanted to check out her reflection more, but her bladder was about to burst. Not wanting to pee herself or onto the floor, Lisa waddled over to the toilet, sat down and peed. As soon as she was finished, Lisa struggled to stand back up before waddling back over to the mirror. She still couldn't get over her reflection. To the rest of the world, this is how everyone else saw her. As an Asian woman with plain short hair. She looked to be a few inches shorter than Lisa was and her face looked nothing like Lisa's did. Still, Lisa find it amusing to make faces and gestures and see the Asian woman in the mirror copy her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lisa got more curious about her body and the woman in the mirror. Between her large swollen belly and the baggy hospital gown she wore,  Lisa couldn't compare the differences in their bodies. Looking over towards the door and making sure it was closed, Lisa looked back into the mirror and saw the Asian woman make a cheeky grin before she pulled the gown off and dropped it onto the floor by her feet. The woman in the mirror now stood completely naked before Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the obvious beach ball sized belly she had, her body was quite different than Lisa's was. Her skin looked to be a shade or two darker than Lisa's skin was and her limbs were skinnier. Lisa had to guess that the woman had similar sized breasts as she did, but they currently looked as swollen as how her breasts currently felt. Lisa looked down and gently cupped one of her breasts when milk came oozing out of her nipple and began dripping onto the floor. Looking back into the mirror, she saw the pregnant Asian woman cupping her breasts like Lisa was with a perplexed expression on her face. Not wanting to make a large mess, Lisa let her breast hang free and looked back into the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's belly was definitely large and her belly button was sticking out. Below it, Lisa could make out a mane of black hair covering her vagina. Bringing her hand down, Lisa gently touched her own shaven vagina as she watched the Asian woman in the mirror copy her movements. Since her vagina was quite sore and irritated, Lisa refrained from checking out her vagina. Having her curiosity sated for the time being, Lisa decided that it would be best if she put the hospital gown back on and went back into her temporary room. However, she cursed herself for throwing the gown onto the floor and not hanging it on a towel rack or one of the hooks on the wall. It took her a couple minutes and several tries to bend over far enough to pick it up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce fully dressed, Lisa went back into the room and rolled herself onto the bed and turned on the TV....</span></div></div>",

Tina looked through her computer quietly for a few moments before mentioning a couple more programs. \"We have other options that we typically don't advertise because they tend to not be popular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is the foreign exchange program where someone with a green card buys your life to obtain your citizenship. A second program that we have is our medical relief program.

She was young and unsure of what she wanted to do with her life. Perhaps someone else would be better of being Lisa Hale. As much as she loved her family, she didn't want to disappoint them by not aspiring to something great.

She speaks almost no English and her work bounces around between stocking shelves at a local produce market and cleaning houses on the side to make end met. Her dream is to go to college and become a software programmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was Maria Lopez, a 31 year old Mexican immigrant who entered the US illegally several years ago.

A nonprofit is helping her get her green card.

Although she loves her family, she regrets the direction she took her life.

She was a few inches shorter and barely weighed over a hundred pounds. She face seemed very plain and her hair was about the same length as Lisa's. Browsing further, she noticed Jinghua had a severe allergy to strawberries and bee stings. Lisa realized that she would no longer get to enjoy strawberries during the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter continuing to read Jinghua's dossier for several more minutes, Lisa placed it down on the desk and asked \"She will do.

She quickly started printing out the paperwork for Lisa to fill out and sign. \"While you fill all this out, I'm going to get a hold of Jinghua and see when we can schedule both of you to come in.\" Lisa acknowledged and continued to fill out the paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 45 minutes, Tina came back into the room and said \"Okay.

Sure she was agreeing to switch lives with this Jinghua Zhao but she also expected to at least spend a night or two with her own family before giving them over to a complete stranger. Still, it was now or never. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina could see some hesitation coming from Lisa's face. Worried that Lisa might back out, Tina moved quickly to put her at ease and get her to sign the necessary paperwork before she changed her mind. \"I know this is kinda sudden and unexpected Ms. Hale. But from all the swaps that I've overseen, people who do switch the soonest when they make up their minds tend to be the happiest. I think it's the dread that comes along with saying goodbye to your old life.\" she told Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa kinda understood where Tina was coming from even though it was a completely made up story that Tina used to try and keep the sale. \"Okay Tina, what do I need to do?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina typed away on her keyboard for a minute and then Lisa heard the printer next to Tina's computer start printing. She pulled out a few sheets of paper and looked them over before handing them over to Lisa. Lisa was curious about what the documents were when Tina told her as she started to read them. \"This is your basic contract with The Nexus authorizing us to perform a life swap between you and a third party. In this case as you can see here it is Jinghua Zhao and here is her client id that matches the dossier that you picked out. All I need you to do is sign on these three pages.\" Tina told her in a business like manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating for a moment, Lisa gave into the pressure and signed the contract without reading most of it. She at least verified that she was indeed switching lives with Jinghua Zhao and it included some other stuff on the addendum that she didn't bother reading. As soon as Lisa finished, Tina took the contract back and filed it into a manila folder. She then told Lisa \"Excellent. Now let's head over to the transference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa followed Tina out of the office and down a couple flights of stairs before finding herself in a weird futuristic looking room. It was immaculately white and nearly empty with the exception of a couple pieces of furniture. What stuck out the most was the giant chair in the middle of the room that resembled some kind of dentist chair with a clear looking dish folded off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. Hale, the first thing I need you to do is get undressed when I leave and put this on.\" Tina told Lisa. She opened a compartment on the wall and pulled out a gown that looked like it came from a hospital. Lisa took the gown and placed it down on the chair. \"Once you're in the gown, have a seat in the chair. I'll come back to give you Ms. Zhao's belongings and take yours over to her. Everything from here on out is both automated and painless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis relieved Lisa. For a moment after seeing the hospital gown, she thought that this might be complicated or painful. Even though she was still not sure about going through with this, it at least helped to know that it wouldn't hurt. \"Okay. How long do I have until this happens?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked at her watch and said \"Ms. Zhao should have arrived a couple minutes ago. As soon as both of you are in your chairs, we'll get this procedure underway. Do you have any other questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Lisa said. Tina quickly hurried out of the room and closed the door. As soon as she was alone, Lisa began to undress. She was really nervous. Before today, nobody could have convinced her that she was about to basically become a Chinese woman. As Lisa pulled off her clothes, she thought about the pictures of Jinghua. Although she didn't look like a model, Lisa thought she was reasonably pretty. Completely naked, Lisa placed all of her belongings on the chair by the door and put on the gown. Tying the back up, Lisa thought \"Hopefully being Jinghua will be exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gown on, Lisa climbed into the chair. She waited for a couple minutes for whatever that was supposed to happen to happen. The room was somewhat chilly and she felt a slight draft blow under her thin gown from the air conditioning. She was about to get up and go look for Tina when she heard the chair start to hum and the clear dish unfolded and pointed right at her face. Then she heard Tina though an intercom system \"Okay Ms. Hale, the transference will commence in 10...9...8...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laid back and closed her eyes. Once she heard Tina finish the countdown, she became dizzy and lost consciousness....</span></div></div>",

Opening her eyes, she saw Tina standing over her holding a voice recorder. Lisa asked \"Did it work?\" but saw Tina looking confused. Tina said something to her but it sounded like it was Chinese. She then started playing the recorder for Lisa to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recorder's message began saying \"Ms. Hale or should I say Zhao Jinghua now, the transference was a success. Along with your new life, we made the appropriate changes which included exchanging your language comprehension as well. You now speak fluent Chinese and Ms. Zhao speaks English. Whenever someone speaks in English to you, it will sound Chinese and when they speak Chinese, it will sound like English to you. This was necessary to make both of your transitions feasible. Your new things are on the chair by the door. I'm sorry but there is no Chinese translator in the building at the moment, so you will have to wait a couple days if you have any follow up questions.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not was Lisa expected. Lisa looked down and examined her hands and the rest of her body. It looked exactly the same. Tina said something again that sounded like Chinese and helped her out of the chair and over to a nearby mirror on the wall in the corner. Her first glimpse of her reflection was not what she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror was a thin Asian woman that looked to be a couple inches shorter than Lisa. She was able to tell because the reflection was shorter than she was. Her hair was jet black and hung down in the same style Lisa currently wore her hair. Quickly looking over her body, this woman also looked much more petite than Lisa and had a couple of tattoos in suggestive areas. Judging by her appearance, she had to have weighed maybe 100 pounds if lucky. Her breasts were also about a size smaller than Lisa and they were pierced. Looking at her face in detail, Lisa saw that her face was more angular with higher cheekbones, a smaller nose and angles brown eyes that looked nothing like her blue ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa brought up her hand and watched as the woman in the mirror matched her movements perfectly. This woman in the mirror was her. Turning around, she saw that Tina had already left and that there was some clothing on the chair where her old stuff used to be. Seeing that she was now alone, Lisa untied the gown and let it drop to the floor. Matching her completely, the woman in the mirror did the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's reflection was nothing like her body. Jinghua's naked body was leaner and had fewer curves than Lisa. While Lisa was trim and athletic, Jinghua was plain skinny. She had no real muscle tone and her belly looked soft. It was reasonably flat though. Lisa thought that it would take a while to get this body into shape. Jinghua's skin was maybe a shade darker than than Lisa, but otherwise negligible. Her breasts were another story. They were definitely a size smaller and had smaller, pierced brown nipples instead of Lisa's pink ones. Lisa had to admit, they were perkier than any other pair of breasts than she had ever seen at school. But then again, they didn't have much weight pulling them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking farther down, Lisa examined her thin legs and completely shaven vagina. It was a darker overall than hers and looked different. Lisa pulled her hand down to her vagina and felt her labia folds, where Jinghua's hand brushed up against a completely smooth crevice. Lisa then turned to her side to get a better look at her ass. Her new ass looked to be about the same size, but now she had some kind of tattoo on her right ass cheek that she could only see in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough inspecting her new reflection, Lisa walked over to the clothing that now belonged to her. She picked up a red sleeveless dress that looked like it would stop a couple inches above her knees. There also was a black g-string and matching bra. The bra looked like it would be too small for Lisa, but she didn't want to go braless. There were also a pair of platform heels and a small purse that looked cheap and made of vinyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa quickly put the clothes on and was surprised to feel that the bra wasn't too tight. It felt like it fit her perfectly. Looking down at her breasts, the bra seemed to have grown just enough to cover her breasts. Continuing to put the rest of her new clothing on, it all fit fine. However, she didn't like the g-string riding completely up her ass crack. Slipping on the platform heels, Lisa walked back over to the mirror and got a good look at her new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinghua stared back in the mirror and was fulled dressed in what she wore to The Nexus. Her dress was tighter and much more revealing than anything Lisa would have ever worn in public. Hopefully, where ever Lisa would call home would have something to wear that wasn't as slutty looking.</span></div></div>",

Tina pulled out a file and handed it to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's file gave Lisa insight on Maria. They were both almost the same height, but that is where the similarities end. Maria in her photo appeared to have wider hips and a gigantic ass. She seemed chunky or somewhat overweight. Lisa was used to being fit and attractive.

Barely skimming through the rest of Maria's file, Lisa just read the medical summary to make sure Maria was healthy and free of any diseases or illnesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still holding Maria's file, Lisa asked \"So when can I switch with Maria?

Although still much curvier than Lisa, Maria wasn't badly overweight like her picture; perhaps the camera had added a few pounds. She was only slightly shorter than Lisa and although she was 13 years older than Lisa she was still very pretty. Maria was wearing what looked like old, blue, mechanic's overalls that somehow  still strained to contain her curves. Lisa had always wondered what being that curvy would be like, but had always stuck to her athletic build. Now she would have curves for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1T\u00fa debes ser Lisa, no se como agradecerte por lo que est\u00e1s haciendo por mi!\u201d Maria said excitedly as she walked over to embrace Lisa.

Lisa understood that she was trying to say she was grateful and smiled as the two of them hugged again.  A translator soon came in and made things easier. The conversation was rather hurried since Maria (or rather Lisa in Maria's body) had to go back to her job soon. Maria explained that she had just started working at a factory close  by. Since she had only just started it wouldn\u2019t look out of place if the new Maria didn\u2019t know the job very well. She had sat down with the nonprofit when they had first spoken of this program and they had a file they would hand to Lisa once the transfer was done with details on her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt bad that the paperwork she filled out didn\u2019t go into much detail about her life, but she figured the new Lisa would have an easier time navigating things anyways. Maria thank her several more times in her thick accent and each time it made Lisa's stomach twirl. She was scared of all that she was about to lose, her whole life in fact, but she could tell how much this would mean for Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Maria was guided out of the room and Lisa was instructed to undress and sit in what looked like a dentist's chair as electrodes were attached to her.

Lisa was used to being fit and attractive. Priya looked like she could be much more attractive if she would start using make-up.

It's designed to protect both of you. Violations can create legal problems and allow one party to seek damages against the other.\" Tina explained to Lisa before she got out of her chair. \"Just imagine how your family would react if they knew Priya became their \"daughter\" or if Priya's husband, Rajiv found out she abandoned their family?. Your parents could disown Priya or your new husband could kick you out onto the street. Aside from you two and the Nexus, nobody can be privy to this sale.\" Tina said while sounding like a lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds harsh, but I understand. I want both of us to be successful...\" Lisa started to say before she was cut off by Tina's phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina picked up the phone and answered it \"This is Tina, I'm with a client right now.\" she told whoever had called her.

A voice suddenly counted down and then the lights went on. Lisa closed her eyes immediately, her eyes were too sensitive to look straight into the bright lamp on top of her. The door suddenly opened and a woman around her mother's age came inside. She looked worried as she looked down on top of Lisa and asked: \"Tell me what is your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, Lisa Hale.\" Lisa answered. The woman looked shocked, and Lisa wondered what was wrong. And why did her voice sound different? She noticed some sort of heavy accent, but she couldn't really place it, as her mind was so foggy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened ?\" Lisa was getting more and more scared. The fact that english word seemed to be hard to come by was also unnverving, even though she couldn't really tell whether it was because she was so tired or for some sort of other reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, I'm Emma Nail director of the Nexus.

For now let me say we don't know what caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What happened?\" Lisa asked getting concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa when you were hooked up with for your transference you were supposed to get each other's life, she yours and you hers. But something went wrong. The machine transferred a lot more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lisa asked her voice getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you would have swapped just lives, you would just keep your own body only when you would look into a reflection of yourself you would see some of the things that were important in that other person's lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We usually do that to ease one's transfer, even in the more...let's say permanent cases like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked...uncertain ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of the normal outcome, you and Mrs.Bhatia seem to have completely switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa heard that, she felt like a rock hit her stomach hard. She was already somewhat uncertain about the swap. She knew<br>\r\nshe was doing a great deed, which made her feel better, but she kinda held on to the fact she was, somewhat, holding on to her  original body. This revelation hit her particularly hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma grabbed a handheld mirror and held it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grabbed the mirror and noticing her hand she took a look in the mirror and she almost fainted. In the reflection she saw an EXACT copy of Priya Bhatia's face. No make-up to speak of, a MUCH rounder and older face whoch sported a double chin and with graying hair neatly tied in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt around her face and saw in the mirror her reflection doing the same thing. This really confirmed it, she hoped it might be a trick of some sort, but when she looked at her hands she knew they were not the ones she had known. Those were far chubbier than her own and dirty, unkempt fingernails were unmistakably different from those she had just a few minutes (or was it hours ?) ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's head was spinning as she didn't know what would happen. What would they do now? How long would it take to fix this?<br>\r\nWould they even try, as the original transfer was supposedly permanent ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might have a lot of questions, how about we go to my office and talk about it?\" Emma suggested. Lisa nodded a little. She sat up but then she felt another dizzy spell. She clumsily got up and slowly started walking, her new (and very large) love handles reinforcing the feeling of a body as foreign as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good Lisa, you don't have to walk fast, just take your time.\" Emma suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking felt extremely odd, Priya's breasts being much larger (and her body generally chubbier, presumably from the lack of exercise and her three pregnancies) than her own so Lisa had to straighten her back more to not being pushed down by the weight of those. Her hips were bigger too, showing the signs of childbearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma opened the door to her office. \"I think you know this person rather well.\" Lisa walked inside the room and the first thing she noticed was the person that was standing there. She recognized that brown hair, that physique and that face pretty well. It was her old body. Lisa was staring at her old self looking at her expression. Priya was...</span></div></div>",

Lisa looked at her old face, the face she\u2019d seen in the mirror all her life, but which was now animated by a completely different person. It was quite possibly the eeriest experience she had had. She took the seat next to her old body and which only brought to the fore the stark differences between her former physique and her current form. The original Priya seemed happy with the development, but there was also concern in her eyes. \u201cFirst of all, ladies, let me extend to you our sincere apologies for this unexpected development,\u201d Emma started, \u201cWe will of course monitor you both for a time to ensure that there are no unforeseen complication, but \u2026\u201d Emma continued, but Lisa had to stop her, \u201cunforeseen complications?\u201d she asked, struggling to pronounce the word. Part of her felt she should know the meaning of the words, but she was struggling to keep up with what Emma was saying as it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe means that there could be problems later,\u201d the former Priya offered in explanation with a kind smile. Lisa felt embarrassed but she smiled back in thanks. \u201cYes, exactly. Well, from our readings, and as you can see the rest of the exchange did go as planned. You now have each other\u2019s language skills. There are other skills and knowledge as well that were transferred to make living your new lives easier,\u201d Emma explained, giving each woman the practiced smile of a businesswoman. Priya seemed more at ease after hearing that the rest of the exchange had gone as planned. Lisa squirmed in her seat, wondering what parts of her mind she might have traded along with her body. As she shifted in her seat she could feel her love handles brushing against the sides of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma continued, \u201cWith our usual temporary swaps this might be a bigger complication, but given that your exchange is permanent I would consider this an enhancement.\u201d The original Lisa gave a weak smile while the other woman practically beamed. \u201cYes, this will make acclimating to my new life a lot easier,\u201d Priya offered. The two women looked at Lisa, expecting her to comment, but the former young lady felt too embarrassed that she now had such a thick accent to say much, so she just gave a week smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we usually don\u2019t recommend much contact between the subjects, but given the exceptional circumstances, I think you both might benefit from at least some contact in the beginning until you get settled into your new selves,\u201d Emma suggested, \u201cThat being said, remember that you,\u201d she said pointing at Lisa\u2019s original body, \u201care Lisa Hale, and you\u201d she said pointing at Lisa\u2019s current body, \u201care Priya Bhatia.\u201d Both women nodded. \u201cYou have each signed the paperwork and are legally the owners of your current bodies and lives. Do with them as you see fit and be mindful of the non-disclosure agreement you have both signed,\u201d Emma continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women looked at each other, the new Lisa beaming with youthful excitement and the new Priya doing her best to control the feeling that she had made a terrible mistake. The two of them then received packages with information about their new lives. They were told that some of it was already part of the transfer, but reading it would reinforce the knowledge. They were warned not to share the files with anyone to avoid any issues with their non-disclosure agreements. It wasn\u2019t much later that \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After various formalities, Emma stood up and smiled at both of you, \"I'll leave you two alone to chat\", she said leaving the room. Lisa sat opposite of former self, still not fully coming to terms with what she had ultimately done. Looking at her old body, with her young, pretty face and toned, athletic body beaming back at her, it was evident that she got worse end of this deal. She again felt her all-round thicker frame and accompanying love handles jiggling and brushing the sides of her chair, feeling incredibly foreign, and completely different to her former cheerleading body.<br>\r\nIt comforted her however, as she continued to look into the beaming reflection of her former self, that she had truly made Priyas' dreams come true. She now has a fresh start, and the slim, attractive body that she'd clearly always wanted. Priya popped up in a gleaming tone as she stood up to look in the mirror, looking ecstatic as she felt her youthful face and rubbed her new athletic frame.. \"this is me now\" she says, \"my body, I'm Lisa Hale\", She hears her new fluent voice and she laughs with glee. \"Oh Lisa, I can't thank you enough, this is the best thing to ever happen to me\"..\"I guess I should call you Priya now given that is who you are now\". Being called Priya really hit Lisa hard, as a lump began to form in her throat, thinking to herself of the years of life she had lost..the friends in family she'd never see again..it finally hit her, she was 39 year old wife, and mother of three Priya Bhatia, and the 18 year old girl standing there was Lisa Hale...a part of her badly wanted to reverse the situation knowing deep down she'd made a terrible and life-changing mistake. She stood up and went to the mirror, further feeling the jiggling of her new love handles, standing next to her former body, the differences were clear as day as she felt her new face. Being much older, with wrinkles and bags under the eyes and a double chin to boot, she then looked at her body, her new larger breasts sagging on her chest, giving them a feel over her clothes confirming the differences in firmness, but the bigger size at least being a consolation, making her feel more like the older, bigger woman she now was. She felt her backside and hips, formerly firm it now just felt like fat, with no definition whatsoever. Priya saw the concern on Lisa's face and almost looked disappointed at her former self, she was still confused as to why such a beautiful girl who was just about to go to college would give up her life like this. Deciding to quiz her on this, she piped up and asked \"although I am obviously incredibly grateful for what you have given me... may I ask why a girl would give up a 20 years of her life\"? Lisa spoke for the first time since Emma left the room in her new thick accent finally as she said \"I wanted to give you the life you deserved but I did not think I would be trading my athletic body for your older one\" she said in a disappointed tone, she found herself struggling to get the words out as her new language skills became evident, this still coming as a great shock. Priyas sympathetic tone became more stern now as she heard how badly Lisa was taking this. \"Well Priya\" she said \"you offered me this opportunity, meaning that the athletic body you are talking about is all mine and that older body you are talking about is yours, as hard as that may be to take, the quicker you accept it the quicker you are going to accustom yourself into your new life\" Lisa was confused, she didn't understand what Priya was saying to her to a full extent, this further hitting home at how different your new life truly was. Priya noticed this and explained again \"your life will be easier if you accept your body as your own\" Lisa, as much as she didn't want to believe it, agreed with Priya, looking in the mirror again trying to tell herself that this is her body and always had been. \"you will enjoy your new life Priya\" Pryia said reassuringly\"..\"it may take some getting used to but over time but I'm sure you will grow to love your husband and be a rewarding mother to your children..we will obviously keep in touch to see how we both are as this situation is new so I think we should jump into our new lives fully\". Priya saying this to further encourage Lisa to jump into her new life. \"Okay Lisa\" she said to Priya, knowing deep down she was right, she was now Priya and needed to act like it. \"I suppose I better go home to my new life now\" Priya said \"here's my number so we can keep in touch with further updates on how to fully intergrate ourselves into our new lives\". As she said that, you began the plans to head home to your new life as Priya Bhatia.</span></div></div>",

The small kitchen was right next to the entrance and there was a note on the fridge. The not was in Priya\u2019s native script, not English, but Lisa read it with easy. It scared her a bit since all through her drive in Priya\u2019s minivan she\u2019d struggled reading anything more complex than road signage. She could do it, it was just more difficult. However, she instantly understood the flowing letters on the note, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you feel better, dear. Don\u2019t worry about anything today, Arjun is helping me at the gas station today. Reyansh took Karima to the library. You can rest today. <br>\r\nAdit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked around the house. It wasn\u2019t as nice as what she was used to, but she could tell her new family worked hard at making the house look nice. It was so quite the only sound was the jingle of the bracelets and jewelry that had come with her new body. She\u2019d thought of taking them off, unused to the sound, but she\u2019d been petrified at the thought that something bad could happen to her children if she did. There were pictures of her new family all around the house. In many the original Priya was dressed in Western clothes, but she seemed to prefer more traditional, Indian Sarees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the clothes her new body had come with and saw why the original Priya would prefer to wear a Saree, it was much more colouful and it suited her better. Lisa picked up a picture of Priya\u2019s husband embracing his wife. He wasn\u2019t particularly handsome by Lisa\u2019s standards. The man was paunchy, with only wisps of hair left on top, and a thick beard. His skin was a bit darker than her own and he was about half a head taller. For some reason Lisa felt a pull towards the man in the picture, he wasn\u2019t her type at all, she liked guys like Tony Petters, the captain of the team Lisa cheered for, yet there was something about him that the new Priya found deeply attractive.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought back to her conversation with the new owner of her original body. She was Priya Bhatia now, that was her husband, this was her house and this was her life now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was on her way to making it into the Olympics before she suffered burns on nearly 60 percent of her body. She's healing slowly, but she is not likely to be able to return to gymnastics for many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one was Melinda Rogers, a 36 year old mother of 3 that is battling ovarian and breast cancer. Melinda worked as a weather meteorologist for a local news station before her cancer began making her too ill to work. Her husband, Michael died a few years back leaving her to raise her children alone. With a new lease on life, she could try to find a way to keep a roof over her former children's' heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one was Alison Schultz, a 29 year old nurse that became paralyzed from the waist down after a skiing accident on vacation. Being confined to a wheelchair has made it difficult to effectively treat patients at the hospital where she works. With a new life, she could become a great nurse again and possibly save more lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought that all these women could make a great Lisa Hale.

I understand this is your first time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Angelina said, a little nervous as she followed the woman back into the complex. She hadn't known what to expect, but once she got over the jitters, she couldn't help but feel that it was a little disappointing. The hallways felt more like the back area of a clinic than a strange or mystic realm that would transform her life. \"The brochure said that the process was painless, but that it could be disorienting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both are absolutely true,\" Tina said, stopping at a door. \"It's really difficult to explain until you've gone through it once, but I have done it myself and I assure you it's really quite painless. I'm going to let you into the room here, and once you get in, if you would change out of your clothes and into the gown provided, we'll get things under way. Just take a seat on the stool, we'll worry about the fancy chair once you've changed. I'll be taking your clothes and your purse once you're out of them, and handing those to the person who's taking your life. Once we're finished, I'll bring their items to you so that you can get dressed. After that, we'll go over the specifics of the person who's life you'll be living while they rent yours, and give you a little time to settle into it before you leave. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I don't get to find out about the person who's renting my life until after it's done?\" Angelina asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll be perfectly honest, we've found that it creates problems. We had too many people back out when they found that the life they would be living wasn't appealing to them. In general, our clients lead nice lives, and can afford our services, but they all have reasons to want to be someone else for a little while. We've found that by setting your requirements for rental rate, and availability, in advance, we're able to find a client who can meet those requirements and execute the agreement. After all, they are the client, if you wanted to vacation in someone else's life of your choosing, then you would be the client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Angelina said, stepping into the room. Despite what Tina had said, she found it hard to not look at the futuristic couch in the center of the room, or at the circle of strange and arcane symbols that were carved into the tile floor around the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after getting dressed in the simple white hospital gown, Tina took her clothing away and helped her into the softly padded couch. A clear shield was lowered in place over her eyes and lights began to dance across her face as Tina began to work her magic. A strange pulling sensation enveloped Lisa from the bottom of her toes to the top of her head, and the flashing lights before her eyes began to blur together as magic pulled her identity from her. Moments later, she drifted into a deep sleep while a new identity was laid over her body, and skills were downloaded from the client and mapped into her own brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Angelina woke, it was with a different identity, but who's?</span></div></div>",

Moments later re-emerging, sometimes with a new awkwardness and others with a sense of confidence and renewed vitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Hale was excited to experience a new life, even if it was for a short time. \u201cI need a vacation\u201d he thought to himself as he sat on the waiting room chair.<br>\r\n \u201c It was awesome of the company to offer me this vacation and to pay for everything.  What an ingenious way for a vacation, who knew there was a clinic that actually allowed you to swap lives. Who would have thought when my boss came to me asking if I would like a vacation that he would smile when I told him I couldn't I was still behind in our project. I expected him to be mad but he just said, \u201cthat's okay Robert, you've been on the job for weeks. We have partnered with a company to help rest our employees and potentially recruit new hires all at once.\u201d  I was lost, I thought he was telling me he was going to replace me, until he explained the Nexus and their life swapping technology. Then my boss told me about the contest our company ran to help recruit incoming college freshman. Those who entered the contest were considering pursing software engineering and our company offered the winner a few weeks of on the job experience as well as a fast-track in the hiring program if they did well and wished to pursue the field.   Our company would have a team leader switch with the contest winner for a few weeks so the leader could rest and relax while the winner received valuable experience. A win-win.  I wonder who I'll become. The boss wasn't very clear on who the winner was when he told me to visit the clinic, he just said that I would be a recent High school graduate getting ready to leave on the last vacation before college.\u201d Robert thought as his mind wandered while waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA women in scrubs appeared, holding a clipboard, walked out the side door. \u201cWe are ready for you now, Mr Hale. If you would please come this way\u201d she said. Getting up out of the waiting-room chair Robert followed the women through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Tina.\u201d the women in scrubs said as she held open the side door. \u201cWe will be heading down the hall and... oops.\u201d Tina said as she suddenly stopped in front of Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201dRobert said as he barely stopped in time to avoid running into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh everything is okay, I just forgot to grab the full file. I grabbed the switch list but forgot the full personal file for you and your rental. I'll meet you in the room. Go down the hall, follow it around the corner, continue down the hall and you are the last door to the right. It will take me 30 seconds, go ahead I'll be right there.\u201d Tina said as she turned to go back out the doorway to nurse desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert continued down the hall and around the corner all the way to the end of the hall where he came across two rooms. Does he remember to enter the correct room on the right?</span></div></div>",

And we will give you a free rental voucher that you may redeem anytime after your vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat's...

All I said was she doesn't need to worry about money, or paying for college, because she wont need to go to college. I'll take care of it all. She can stay home and raise our future kids.

A nurse called. \u201cWe are ready for you now Mr. Anderson, If you would please come this way.\u201d  The nurse standing by the double doors in the back of the lobby area said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cMy name is Tina,\u201d Tina said  as Tom got up from his seat and walked towards her. \u201cright this way,\u201d she gestured down a hall way. \u201cIs this your first time using our facility\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cYes\u201d Tom answered, suddenly nervous, all his self posturing forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Tina smiled as she asked \u201c I see you wish to rent a life?\u201d Knowing full well Tom was here to rent a life, but asking the question never hurt and small talk helped narrow down what kind of life her clients were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cum, Yes. My girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend for the moment, says I don't understand her and she doesn't like the kind of life I told her she could have. I'm not sure if a experiencing  someone else's life would help me but I thought... maybe... I could understand her position or something. Or I could see what she was talking about and she what she is so afraid of. I could convince her from experience. I don't know, I'm nervous and anxious being here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe's a bit of an ass, but there has been much worse people who have come thru here and it does look like he is trying. Maybe a rough home-life? Ah, yes a super macho father figure, that explains it\u201d Tina thought as she opened her portfolio of Tom.  \u201cWe have quite a selection in our catalog. Are there any parameters you want to search by? We can search, gender, race, age, lifestyles..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you search based around proximity to someone life? Tom interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cit is a little unusual but what do you have in mind?\u201d Tina answered, smiling as she thought she knew what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I search based around Lisa Hale's life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I knew it\u201d Tina smugly grinned to herself. \u201cOrdinary no we can't just search people of the street and see if they have anyone close to them that is apart of the nexus, But as Miss Hale is in our system already we can narrow parameters down to people she is relatively close to, who are also apart of the nexus. Please have a seat in this waiting room and I will go grab the profile folders of those close to Miss Hale and are currently renting out their lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTom entered the little waiting room, \u201cIt looks more like an Interrogation room\u201d Thought Tom with it's four chairs placed on either side of a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I really go through with this?\u201d Tom thought, \u201c I mean renting someones life, that's pretty radical. It is also so very expensive.  I guess I can afford it though, all the money I saved for my first year at college will be sucked dry but with my football scholarship I don't need it. And if it will help me win back Lisa I think its worth it.  She is so hot, much hotter than the other cheerleaders i've been with. And she is smart, and funny. Actually has a personality and has a bright future. I just want her future to include me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The door to the waiting room opened and Tom jumped in his seat. Tina came in smiling. \u201cShe has a pretty smile.\u201d Tom thought as she lay several folders onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou're in luck Tom,\u201d Tina said. \u201c There are several options available to you, here,\u201d she handed you several folders. \u201cWould you like to take a look?</span></div></div>",

He was doing this for his and Lisas relationship and it would definitely not help if he was stuck on a family vacation in another state or something like that. No, he wanted to get closer to Lisa again and with his budget he could only afford a week, therefore he had to be near Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked at the one folder with the name \"Megan Rhodes\" written on it. The two were close friends and he would probably get to know even the darkest of secrets but again he could not be sure if she was in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the remaining folders and was surprised that almost Lisas whole family was registered at the Nexus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not her father though...\", thought Tom. \"Well, he probably is too busy with his work to do something like this.

He was always getting her in trouble and she could not take that anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the possibility of renting Stephanie Hales life. He saw Stephanie quite a lot when he was over to Lisas place. She was annoyingly clingy towards Lisa and almost always interrupted the two when they got down to business. With her life he could probably get really close to Lisa but does he really want to be a 14-year-old girl? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least there was the folder of Elizabeth Hale, Lisas mother. Lisa mentioned something about her mother living the life he wanted for her. He could not understand what Lisa meant when she said her mother struggled through this life. It seemed impossible for him that there would be any kind of trouble for Lisas mother. She had a loving husband who works so hard for her and her family!

For Lisa and me...\", he said to himself every time these thoughts came up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tina was arranging everything, Tom was brought to the lobby where he had to wait for further instructions. If the timing was bad he had to come back tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking around the room, trying to forget his doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really just throw away a lot of money to rent the life of my girlfriends, well ex-girlfriends, mother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a woman around the age of 40 walking towards the back end. She was slightly overweight and was wearing a red sweater, gray yoga pants and black flat shoes. She had her dirty blond hair in a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a different door than the one I went in... So, she probably is letting her life be rented. I wonder why someone would choose her?\", thought Tom. \"I certainly wouldn't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity where Tom looked at all the people in the lobby and thought about who's life he would or would not rent, Tina returned to him with some good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that you had to wait so long. We had a bit of trouble and... Never mind, you don't want to hear this stuff. Anyways, I contacted Mrs. Hale right after we departed and she said she would be here in an hour, so she should be here any minute now.\", explained Tina. \"So please follow me. You can get ready so we can start the procedure as soon as possible. Because today is almost over I managed to arrange that you won't be charged for today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I guess... That's very kind of you.\", replied Tom. He suddenly felt dizzy because everything was happening so fast now after the long waiting time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\", she smiled. \"I know you're on a tight budget. Also, I hope you might enjoy this so much that you might consider offering your life for rental in the future. Your life as a running-back with a scholarship might interest quite a few people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll er... think about it...\", replied Tom hesitantly. He really did not want his life to be lived by other people. Well, technically Elisabeth would be living his life for a week but this was a necessary evil. Also, now he could choose who would live his life, if he agreed to this he could not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded. \"We'll talk about this after your 'vacation'. But remember, this 'job' is paid very well, especially for someone like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went silent for the rest of the walk into a cold room with a futuristic looking couch in the middle surrounded by strange symbols on the ground. Tom really began to get cold feet. Was this really the right decision? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Lisa and me... I do this for our future...\", he said slowly while taking a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take off your clothes and put this hospital gown on.\", said Tina and handed him over a white gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Tom began to take off his clothes and fortunately Tina turned around and made some notes on her clipboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... This is one of these wonderful hospital gowns that don't cover your behind\", sighed Tim when he finished getting dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only temporary. Now please lay down on the couch. We can't start right now, we still have to wait for Mrs. Hale to get ready but I think you prefer laying down on this comfortable couch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded and did as he was told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as soon as I get the go, I will lower this clear shield and the magic will take place. It will be a bit disorientating but don't worry it won't hurt a bit. When everything is done, I'll be back with the belonging of Mrs. Hale and we will get over the final details.\", explained Tina and started to look at her smartphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do this for Lisa and me... I do this for Lisa and me...\", mumbled Tom over and over again in order to refrain him from just getting up and walking away. He would not have thought that this would freak him out so much. But then again, he would have preferred not to swap with a woman but considering Lisas relationship with her brother it did not seem like a good solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just nervous because I am going to be a woman for a week... Lisas mother to be precise... But this will be for the best. I can get back with Lisa\", he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Tina finally received the message that they could start and lowered the clear shield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It starts now. When you wake up, everything will be over\", said Tina and left the room. As soon as the door had closed lights began flashing before Toms eyes and soon he was drifting into a deep sleep. </span></div></div>",

But I just laid down a moment ago!\", Tom said as the clear shield that was over him retreated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you actually were lying here for about an hour. During the transfer you are asleep and your conscious is, let's say, shut off. The download of the necessary skills and the identity transfer combined with all the reality altering stuff would be too much for your mind. You don't want to know what would happen to you if you were wide awake during the transfer\", explained Tina calmly and put some clothes besides Tom. \"These are your clothes for the time being by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, who had just sat up when Tina put the clothes down, looked around. \"My chest feels kinda... heavy...\", he said slowly and patted his chest but could not find anything that might cause this feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is a side effect. You see, you have all the skills that come with the life you rented. There also come some things that you would feel that the original owner of that life would feel. For example this heavy feeling on your chest is caused by your breasts. You can't see them but they are there. It's because of some complicated magical stuff I don't want to bore you but basically you can only see Mrs. Hales body when you look in reflections\", continued Tina. \"And I think it would be the best if you start to dress in your clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Tom reached towards the clothes and grabbed the white bra that was sitting on top of them. \"I have to wear this now...\", he mumbled and turned around the foreign object in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as you do. You are Elisabeth Hale for the world now. Even though I know you are really not her, it is all I can see right now. Well, this is not completely true as Mrs. Hale will see you as you see yourself right now and vice versa. We are not sure why this is but my best guess is because you are connected through the transfer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded but did not really listen to her after she said that he had to wear a bra now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it really the right thing to do?\", he thought. \"It's too late now anyways, I have to get through this now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina noticed how he stared helplessly at the bra. \"Don't worry it will be no problem for you to put it on. As I said you have all the necessary skills required for your rented life. No memories mind you, so you will not be able to recall anything related to this life. But don't worry, I have a folder here with everything you'll need to know or at least what Mrs. Hale thinks you need to know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded again slowly, stood up and took off his hospital gown. This time he did not really care if Tina was looking or not, all the different feeling he got right now where too much for him. When he put the gown on the couch and grabbed the bra he looked over to Tina and felt as if something was different than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina noticed his look and explained with a smile: \"Ah yes, another modification. You are now the same height as Mrs. Hale.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", he nodded and began putting on the bra. It was surprisingly easy! \"This feels like I have done this for years, no decades!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do. Remember you are Elisabeth Hale now. Should I address you with Elisabeth or Mrs. Hale by the way?\", Tina asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer Tom\", he answered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\", frowned Tina. \"You are Elisabeth Hale now and therefore people will call you that. You have to get used to that, at least until you transfer back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed deeply while grabbing the white granny panties next. \"Then I guess Elisabeth should do... Mrs. Hale just sounds even more surreal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded and went back to her previous smile. \"Okay Elisabeth. Your shoes are standing right beside you, I hung your purse at the door knob. I leave you to yourself for now. Get dressed and look into the folder I just gave you. There is everything the original Mrs. Hale thinks you need to know. Don't worry you can take it with you, we don't expect you to memorize everything in it in just this short time. When you are finished just press the button next to the door and I'll get you and walk you out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left the room. Tom was now standing in the room with just panties and a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is done...\", he said to himself and sighed. \"What have I brought on myself? Well, there is no turning back now and I really hope this helps me win back Lisa and hopefully win her back once and for all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued dressing by putting on the pink blouse. Normally he would not be caught dead in something like this. \"But nobody will notice, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was so surreal for Tom and a small part of him believed that all this was just some kind of elaborate prank to shoot photos of him in women's clothing. \"But the heavy feeling on my chest got reduced when I put on the bra. Just as if 'my breasts' got support. Would it be really possible to fake something like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging his doubts off, he continued dressing by stepping into the blue skirt and last but not least put on the black pumps. \"I hope she is really right with this skills stuff... Otherwise I will possibly sprain my ankle.\", he thought still doubting that any of this was real. After a few steps his fears had disappeared. Just like with the bra it felt as if he had been walking in heels for years! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom then looked at the folder Tina gave him and skimmed through it. \"I read this more thoroughly when I am gone from here. This room really creeps me out somehow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to the door, grabbed the hanging purse and slung it over his should and then pressed the button. A few moments later the door was opened again by Tina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Elisabeth.\", she smiled at him. Tom cringed slightly when he heard that name. It would be really hard to get used to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made some arrangements and I have to say that we normally don't do this. I've kind of taken a liking to you.\", she winked at him. \"Anyways, if you want you can meet the original Mrs. Hale. No long talk or anything. Usually we forbid the contact but I pulled some strings for you. Of course, you don't have to accept my offer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom thought about it for a moment and decided to... </span></div></div>",

I'll guide you to your car.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them walked silently side by side to the garage. The click clacks of Toms heels echoed through the corridor, his skirt was swishing back and forth on his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two arrived in the underground parking garage. He immediately walked over to where he parked his car earlier this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going Elisabeth?\", asked Tina slightly amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my car? I parked it over there\", Tom explained to her confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, TOM parked his car over there. YOUR car is over here ELISABETH\", replied Tina and emphasized the names purposely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... You're right...\", he sighed and followed Tina to the family car of the Hales. He had never driven it himself before but the original Elisabeth drove him and Lisa this one time when his old car did not want to start. \"And now this is my car... At least for the next week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't have any more questions, then that's it. I'll see you again in a week to swap back. If you might encounter any problems you can of course come back here and we can help. It is very important for us to provide the best service for our customers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank you.\", he replied and got into the car. He was surprised that the seat was already in the correct position as well as the mirrors but then he remembered the height change. \"Even without it, there would probably be some kind of magic something for that.\", he thought as he rummaged through his purse to get the keys. The engine started and it felt like he had driven this car before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive safely.\", waved Tina goodbye as he drove out of the garage. </span></div></div>",

His gaze went to the rearview mirror when he jumped shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Hale?\", he asked in surprise and turned around but no one was sitting behind him. He looked back in the mirror and again saw Elisabeth Hale in it. She had the same confused expression that he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\", he mumbled and saw that Elisabeths lips were forming the same words he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina did not tell me about this.

Throwing the purse on the couch he sat himself beside it and got the folder Tina gave him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should read some things about my current life before I embarrass myself with some minor details I don't know\", he thought. He guessed normally clients of the Nexus would insepct the house but he had been here a dozen times so no need for that and since he was alone he did not have anything else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the folder he began to read the first page but was interrupted before finishing the first paragraph.</span></div></div>",

And I'm sure before long you'll be an old pro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little comforted Matthew expressed his most immediate fear \"Oh I'm sure I'll be worried about that closer to the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">bir</span> time but right now I'm worried about seeing my body. All the brochures said we continue to see our own bodies for our mental wellbeing and the thing that drew me to maternity was that this is the exception.  But being here I'm a little scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be ok. You're not going to be in one body long enough for that to manifest. They're probably be some disorientation but thats it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, can you help me up?\" Matthew said finally allowing himself to concentrate on his body. He somehow felt both lighter and heavier at the same time, his crotch felt off and his back was hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey helped him out of the tune and onto a standard hospital bed, as Matthew realized he was only wearing a hospital gown. Still not ready to look down he waited as Stacey ran a number of tests including clipping a blood pressure sensor to his finger and attaching electrodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Stacey called an orderly to help move Matthew down the hall to his room. Once there Stacey said she'd get him something to drink and left with the orderly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew finally looked down at himself and was mildly surprised to see pink polkadots covering his chest which went out way to far, unable to make out much past the large pink polkadot bump that was his stomach he lifted his leg to find it shaved and a matching shade of pink on his toes, he ran his hands down his body next first finding his hair went to mid back  then amazed by how sensitive not just his breasts were but his skin in general, the void he felt between his legs was an odd sensation and he felt over stuffed just thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey came back in with some water and showed Matthew srond the room. A tablet was provided that could be used to call the nurses, control the giant tv, order food and much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a pressure on his bladder, Matthew gets Stacey to show him the bathroom which was a large ensuite. Looking in the mirror he was relieved to see his own face even if the rest of his body was unfamiliar in everything but skin tone \"good thing all the rules seem to be reversed for maternity\" he thought as he carefully sat down to pee, lifting his gown up in the process. After overthinking it for a while his body reached its breaking point and pee began to dribble out, now feeling what was used he pushed the rest out before struggling to wipe himself dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so hard\" he thought as he struggled to get up. Retuning to his bed after he washed his hands</span></div></div>",

After 7 years working at a dead-end job and whole lifetime of being just about average he had figured renting out his body might jumpstart his life a bit.  The shorter term options sounded interesting, but he hadn\u2019t known that leaving his life behind might be on the table too. \u201cWell, I must caution you that this is a very significant decision. A life purchase means you will assume the buyer\u2019s life in it\u2019s entirety, their responsibilities, families, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d try to talk me into it, not out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Nexus routinely carries out rentals on a daily basis, we pride ourselves on our transparency and good business practices,\u201d the Nexus representative informed Matthew. \u201cIn other words you\u2019d rather not get sued?\u201d he asked, seeing through the corporate talk that he\u2019d become so used to at his last job. The lady simply returned a noncommittal smile. Matthew knew her type, they were polished to a fault and would stick to the script no matter what. \u201cIf you ultimately decide to go ahead with the Life Purchase the Nexus will make sure to transfer enough of each participant\u2019s skills, mannerisms, and so on in order for both to function in your new lives. You will both sign a legally binding contract through which you both agree to take on the other\u2019s life and body and to relinquish all claims on your original ones. Do you understand, Mr. Monet?\u201d she asked, her smile never wavering for a moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Matthew nodded. \u201cGood, I have a few interested buyers for you to review,\u201d she handed him a set of folders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tAllison McNair: 58 year old, Caucasian female. An aging socialite who made millions from a series of divorces to powerful men. She had been stunning in her youth, but had resorted to significant plastic surgery in order to cling to her fading beauty. She had impressively enhanced breasts and butt, with the characteristic signs of cosmetic surgery all over her face. If Matthew sold his life to her he would inherit her fortune minus a few million she would transfer to her new life in order to experience life a powerful man like her husbands had been. <br>\r\n2.\tPatricia \u201cPatty\u201d Williams: 64 year old, female of African descent. The matriarch of a sprawling family. She lost her husband when her 5 children were little and raised them on her own. She\u2019s a singer in her church choir and very devoted to her church, her children and grandchildren. After a lifetime of keeping her family together she feels she feels she would like another shot at life, but wants to have someone continue to watch over her family. <br>\r\n3.\tREDACTED: The buyer prefers to stay anonymous until the seller agrees and signs a separate confidentiality agreement. The are a famous music star at the peak of their fame. They have money, fame and hordes of adoring fans. However, they have a heavy addiction problem and want to leave that life behind without having to deal with any of the consequences or the withdrawal. Matthew would have to deal with the addiction. <br>\r\nThere are a few more folders to review and Matthew decides to \u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sighing Matthew follows her down a hall and up a flight of stairs. He's lead to a private room that looks like half a hospital room half mission control center with a futuristic coffin with a glass top instead of a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's presented with some extra paper work related to permanent selling of a life before stripping out of his cloths, laying in the coffin, covering himself with a thin green sheet and pressing a button so the door to the coffin closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm then comes from the coffin signaling that the transfer team can enter. He watches as they swarm around the room some on the computers some around the coffin. It only goes on for about 5 minutes before Matthew drifts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<pre>An unknown amount of time later</pre>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew wakes up in seemingly the same room, the only thing perceptibly different is the sheet covering him is red. The coffin opens and Matthew steps out, theres supposed to be a mirror in the corner but from the rules explained when he signed up he's not allowed to look yet. He cautiously looks around and finds the Nexus provided pajamas he'll be wearing if he doesn't want to go around naked for the time being. Feeling a little wobbly from a different mass he slowly puts one leg in then the other before pulling the pants up, and following it with the tshirt. He then pressed the call button and a different woman entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Monet how are you feeling? \" she said with a kind voice and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little unsteady I'll admit\" Matthew felt at ease with the woman as he continued \"I know you're going to ease me into my new identity but I'd like to know something besides the fact I'm apparently a famous musician and have a big problem with addiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that it's your body I can tell you something. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;sorry for the basic options I don't follow celebrities enough to know what are good options&gt;</span></div></div>",

You mean, as in Thalia Luna? The one who took her top off at that award ceremony a couple of weeks ago?\u201d you asked incredulously. \u201cYup, the one and only. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t let my daughter see that show, but Luna\u2019s music is pretty good, I have to say. Now, would you like me to help you get dressed before your driver comes to pick you up, Ms. Luna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod silently, too shocked at the realization of who you\u2019d become to say anything. Luna had been in the spotlight since she was in her early teens. You hadn\u2019t been an avid fan, but pretty much everyone had heard her music at some point. She used to have a TV show in one of the kids\u2019 networks, but had tried really hard to shed her squeaky clean image over the last couple of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, because of the nature of your new life Nexus is providing you with a small mirror that will show you what you look like to the rest of the world. Like I said, it\u2019ll take some time before what you see reflected in most mirrors is what others see,\u201d she said, pointing at the mirror you had first seen your new self in. \u201cThis one,\u201d she handed you a compact mirror, the sort that women used for makeup, \u201c will show you what others see right away, since your image is important to your new life Nexus is giving you a way to work around the acclimating process. Don\u2019t lose it though, it\u2019s very special.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded again, taking a peak at your reflection in the handheld mirror. The woman staring back at you was gorgeous. She had a youthful look, but it was obvious she was well on her way to becoming a stunning beauty. It was hard to believe you were the one animating that face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Expecting something very feminine, to help drive the point home he was a woman now, he was actually dissapointed at the cloths. Boyshorts, thay admittedly seemed way too small, went on with ease. A sports bra came next that Kara helped adjust, they were feminine but not overly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I look at myself in the mirror?\" Matthew abruptly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be fine\" was Kara's response leading the way to the mirror. Matthew didn't know what he was expecting, but he just saw himself in a sports bra and panties that felt surprisingly comfortable. Shaking his head he asked for the next item, black sweat pants another thing that looked too small but stepping into them infront of the mirror he saw them strech in a way that didn't seem right. A solid red tshirt came next that seemed the most feminine of all the cloths, and had low neckline. A grey hoodie came next, and after it was zipped up Kara used a provided hairband to pull back unseen locks into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be a problem if I can't see my hair.\" Matthew pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have oversimplified before, hair is the exception to the acclimatization process, you should see it before the end of the day.

She was the girlfriend of a rich and powerful businessman (actually a  mafia boss, but that wasn\u2019t in the file).

Even with the television playing a local knock off of the Maury show and plenty of piles of magazines, almost any observant person could tell that everyone waiting were either anxious or nervous. Once they went into the back, they would reemerge about an hour or so later. Usually walking out with a new awkwardness or with a renewed sense of confidence and vitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina, an employee in her early thirties wearing scrubs came out the door into the waiting room with a clipboard in her hands. \"Ms. _______, we're ready for you if you would come with me into the back\" she said.  ______ got up out of a chair followed Tina as others watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanika Jones: Age 23, She has lived a very troubled life that led to crime and prison very early in her life.

Kilimanjaro. At her age, she was taking notice of her lengthening recovery time. This was one of the many reasons that she was seeking out a body that could undertake the adventures she loved. Just like renting a car, she needed a body designed for her vacation. \"Right here, Ms. Larsen\", Tina said, snapping Kirsten out of her head and leading her into a room resembling a place that a doctor would see a patient.<br>\r\n    Kirsten's flats cracked as she entered the room. Even without heels, she was a very tall woman sporting a lean, sleek frame. Her black slacks swished with every step that she took, that tail of her black jacket trailing a bit behind her white blouse. Her long hair was a couple shades darker than blonde, making it more of a gold. As she sat down, her hazel eyes observed Tina pulling up a number of files on the computer adjacent to her seat. Kirsten certainly looked her age, but rather than looking old and dumpy, time a weathered her features into a mature profile that simultaneously conveyed curiosity and understanding. However, she still retained a reckless smile when spotting something exciting.<br>\r\n    \"So, we've narrowed the pool down to two candidates who most closely matched your request\", Tina reported.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\", Kirsten asked, amused.<br>\r\n\"The first is <b>Yu Yan Xia</b>\", Tina continued, pulling up a picture of a petite Asian woman in a leotard. She look very young, had a round, porcelain face and shorter black hair. \"She is 18 years old, five feet tall and weighs 100lbs. Yu Yan was an Olympic Gymnast for the People's Republic of China, meaning that after the procedure, you would have her knowledge in that field. With a smaller body, you would need less food, oxygen and water. You would also gain her expert agility and balance\".<br>\r\n   Kirsten scratched her chin, \"Interesting. You said she's from China, though. Would I lose my ability to speak English by switching with her?\".<br>\r\n   Tina shook her head, \" Not necessarily. If you request, we can leave your linguistic skills unchanged\". Tina then proceeded to pull up another profile, \"The next candidate is <b>Athena Parker</b>\". The next picture was of a black woman in shorts and a track jersey. She had long, black hair, coffee colored skin and full lips. Her quads and glutes were large and thick. \"Athena is 25 years old, 5'8 and weighs 140 lbs. She's a former sprinter but still keeps her body in top shape. Athena would be the better option if you're looking to max out your speed and endurance\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich woman did Kirsten pick?</span></div></div>",

Kirsten thought it would be liberating to power through obstacles in Athena's muscular body.<br>\r\n\"Excellent\", Tina replied, finalizing the choice on her computer screen, \"Go ahead and put on the gown on the table and lie down for me. We'll alert Athena in the next room that you have selected her. Then We'll activate the Nexus and perform the trade\".<br>\r\n   After Tina exited the room, Kirsten swiftly undressed and adorned herself in the hospital gown and played down on the table. She was almost shaking with nervousness and excitement. After she awakened, she'd have another woman's life. Kirsten had experienced a lot, but nothing quite like this. Tina rendered the room with a tank and mask, \"Ms. Larsen, if you could just inhale deeply for me\", she said, fitting Kirsten with the mask and loosening the nozzle on the tank. Kirsten did as she was instructed and drowsiness began to set in. \"When you wake up, you'll be a whole new woman\", these were the last words Kirsten heard before blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we go from here?</span></div></div>",

Her blurry vision slowly began to clarify, turning splotchy colors into a woman in a lab coat in front of her. Glancing over, she abruptly snapped her attention in Kirsten's direction,\" Oh good, you're awake\", she commented, \"What is your first and last name?\".<br>\r\n\"Kirsten Larsen\", she responded, perplexed at the sound coming from her throat.<br>\r\n\"What is your birthday?\".<br>\r\n\"February 12th\", she answered, becoming much more coherent and concerned about the sound of her voice.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Larsen, my name is Emma Nail\", the woman continued,\" First I would like to say that your the Nexus accomplished its task. You now have the life of Miss Athena Parker\".<br>\r\nKirsten slowly nodded, wondering why she was stating the obvious.<br>\r\n\"That being said, it switched more than was planned\", Emma added.<br>\r\nKirsten's mind was racing. What could this mean!?<br>\r\n\"Though everyone would see you as Miss Parker, you would have retained your body. We don't know the cause, but you now possess Miss Paper's body as well\".<br>\r\nKirsten's eyes bulged. Emma cautiously handed her a hand mirror. Kirsten began to reach for it, already seeing the dark skin that covered her hand and wrist. Sure enough, she was greeted by the reflection of a terrified black woman. The face would have been very pretty, but at the moment it was contorted into a shocked expression.<br>\r\n\"I know this must be a lot to take in and we are investigating the cause right now. That being said, you will have to inhabit Athena's body for the time being, possibly for the duration of the swap. We will make this right, Ms. Larsen, we promise\". Kirsten remained silent, still taking it all in. \"Miss Parker's clothes are on the counter for you to change into. Take all the time you need\", with that Emma left the room.<br>\r\n    Kirsten slowly got up, and noticed a full length mirror beside her. She timidly crept over, see Athena's full image in a hospital gown. As she approached the reflection, she reached back, untying the gown and letting it drop to the floor. She took in the glory of Athena's dark, defined body, \"Certainly not what I'm used to, but I can work with it\". Kirsten put her hands on the defined abs, then feeling her thick, rock solid Thighes. She smirked a bit, looking between her legs, \"Thank God she shaves\". She then made her way back up, feeling her new boobs put of curiosity. They were much smaller and more compact than her own. She flicked one of thesmall, circular nipples, intrigued as it instantly hardened. However, as she looked back, she became enthralled with Athena's physique. Out of curiosity, she flexed her right bicept like Rosie the Riveter, \"God, this girl is ripped!\", she exclaimed, pulling off poses. After a few frontal flexes, she spun around to show off her back definition. Although her back was quite impressive, that's not what caught her eye. Breaking her pose, Kirsten reached back, making a wax-on-wax-off motion on her left ass check,\" Oh my\", she muttered. It looked big in the picture, but Athena's bulbous behind was absolutely massive in person. Kirsten reached back with her other hand and gave them a squeeze,\" Solid muscle. There's no flab on this booty\". Kirsten then looked over at the pile of clothes,\" I suppose I have a whole trip with this body. Time to suit up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Kirsten do next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In a world known to very few, a small company has merged Magic with Technology to offer the ultimate escape from the day to day tedium of life. The opportunity to live someone else's life. The company is known as The Nexus, and the fees they charge for their services are substantial. Half of those fees are paid to carefully recruited volunteers who 'rent' their lives to the company's clients. Those clients range from the very wealthy who can indulge in a guilty pleasure vacation in someone else's life, to the very desperate who would do anything to escape their own life, even if just for a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa Hale: Our main character. Age: 18, height 5'7\", she is physically fit with B-cup breasts and shoulder length brown hair. She is considered pretty by most, in a very 'active girl' kind of way. In high school, she was involved in cheer leading and dance, as well as cross country. Her family is fairly normal, upper middle class, and Lisa has been a fairly successful student through school. Having just graduated, she is preparing for her last summer vacation before starting college in the fall. She has decided, however, to rent her life out to The Nexus for the summer, as a way to pay for school in the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin Hale: Age 16, Lisa's younger brother. He's a 5'10\" soccer player and all around party kind of guy. Many of his friends have been seen pining after Lisa, but most consider her to be 'out of their league.' Martin has a tendency to get others in trouble, and Lisa has made it a point to distance herself from him in recent years. <br>\r\nStephanie Hale: Age 14, Lisa's younger sister, she's 5'3, A-cup, and very much idolizes her older sister. Lisa has put up with it, mostly because she would rather Stephanie follow her example than follow Martin's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Hale: Age 46, is Lisa's father. He works hard as a software engineer and keeps the family in a comfortable standard of living. His work requires him to travel frequently, overseeing projects around the globe, and in recent years, he's only been home 1-2 weeks a month.<br>\r\nElizabeth Hale: Age 39, is Lisa's mother. She stands 5\"9, and expects that Lisa will likely grow another few inches to match her own height, if not taller. Her long brown hair has started to fade in recent years, and her full D-cup breasts are starting to fell the pull of gravity, still, she has kept active and maintains a fit figure. She has been a stay at home mom since finishing college, having given birth to Lisa in her senior year, and is very active in the community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom Anderson: Age 18, is Lisa's on again / off again boyfriend. Currently off after Tom told her she shouldn't worry about getting the money to pay for college because there's no point of her going to school if she's going to stay home and take care of the kids. Tom will be attending the same college as Lisa plans to, but is attending on a foot ball scholarship. He stands 6'3\", well muscled and is handsome in a 'rugged' kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan Rhodes: Age 17, is Lisa's best friend from child hood. She is a 5'5\" blond, bubbly cheer leader with full C-cups. Megan is the one who encouraged Lisa to become a cheerleader. While she's generally a good girl, she's fallen into the trap of her own success and become something of a social butterfly. She goes to all the right parties, and hangs out with all the most popular people, which on occasion gets her (and Lisa) into trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers? Feel free to create your own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>RULES:</b><br>\r\n1) The Nexus does 2 things when it conducts a trade between the client, and the renter. First, reality itself is bent so that people will treat the client as Lisa, and will treat Lisa like the client. For all intents and purposes, they trade identities. Second, The Nexus will download <i>skills</i> from the client that will be necessary for Lisa to fill in their life while the client vacations in her life. Only skills are copied, no other memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Anything that would physically change the body, stays with the life it was done in. IE: If someone decides to dye their hair blond while living Lisa's life, Lisa's hair will become blond when she comes back to her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Clients can choose how long they want to live Lisa's life, it just costs more to stay as her longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, keep it reasonable. The story is rated 18+, sex is fine. Feel free to leave unexpected consequences for Lisa to return to when she returns to her life between rentals. You can either follow Lisa, or follow the person living her life, or flip back and forth, just make it clear who's POV you're writing from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may edit for grammar / spelling, and chapters that are particularly poorly written may be deleted. If you wish to reserve an option to continue writing a story line, please place &lt;LOCKED&gt; in the name of the branch. </td>",
