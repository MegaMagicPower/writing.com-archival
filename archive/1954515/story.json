You went out to dinner and then saw a movie afterwards. You have been together for a few years now, but until today it had been a while since you went on a date. You are currently walking her to the train station so she can head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've really missed this.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. It's been so long.\" You agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at her arm. She has a bruise on her elbow. She hit it off of a door the day before and it appears to be a little swollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your elbow?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still a bit sore, but not as bad as yesterday.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the train station and wait with her for about 5 minutes. As the train pulls up, she turns to you and gives you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" You tell her. You both then lean in for a kiss. As you are kissing her goodbye, you notice an old man in a trench coat staring at the two of you. You think nothing of it and just let it slide. Your girlfriend then boards the train and you watch as it leaves the station. Once it is gone, you start walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very gifted.\" You hear a deep, rough voice say behind you. You turn around to see the same old man staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You ask him, not sure of what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you are very gifted, young man.\" He repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see that you are not aware yet, but you, my boy, have a very special power.\" He tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power? Have you been drinking, sir?\" You ask, since he wasn't making any sense to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. I understand your confusion. I shall explain. You have a rare power that can let you heal people. Did you not notice the bruise on your lady friend's arm vanish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe this man. He noticed the bruise on your girlfriend's arm and claims that it vanished. You did not notice that it was gone, but you plan on calling her later to confirm what the old man is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. If I have some special healing super power, then how come I have never noticed it before now?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho! Such a power is note acquired so easily. It lays dormant inside of you for many years and then take years to develop, but you appear to be developing rather quickly.\" He informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you know so much about this? Do you have this power?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So many questions, my boy. No, unfortunately, I do not have this gift, but I have old friends that do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you have had enough of this conversation and decide to move on. As you walk home, you consider the possibility that the old man was insane, but you doubted that for some reason. Was he speaking the truth? When you get home, you lay on your bed for a while, thinking the whole thing over. If it is true, you will need to prove it somehow.</span></div></div>",

You went downstairs to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife from one of the drawers. You then take it back up to your room and sit on your bed. You think for a few minutes about what you are going to do. You didn't want to do anything to serious just in case it doesn't work. <br>\r\nYou decide that you will start off with something small first and if it works, you can always try something bigger later on. With the knife in one hand, you hold up your other hand at ready the blade next to one of your fingers. Once you are ready, you run the sharp edge of the knife along the tip of your finger. It hurt much more than what you were expecting. You sit the knife down and inspect your finger. The cut was pretty deep and blood was seeping out of it. You then put your supposed power to the test. You kiss your finger and then wait to see if anything happens. <br>\r\nAs you finished kissing your finger, you noticed that the pain was slowly fading away. You wiped away some of the blood on your finger and watched as the cut sealed itself up, not leaving a scar or any trace that there was ever a cut there. You lean back against your wall, still staring in amazement at your now healed finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! It worked!\" You tell yourself. You couldn't believe that the old man was telling the truth. You thought of all the possibilities of this power, but first you needed to test your limits. The old man also stated that the power will develop over time. You thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Something, that if it works, will open up a whole load of possibilities to you. after thinking for a while, one idea sticks in your head throughout. \"What if I was able to heal myself after chopping my head off?\" you thought to yourself. You liked the idea, but it wasn't going to be easy. You would have to carefully plan it out so that it would work. You didn't like the idea of getting anyone else involved at this point, so you'd have to find a way to chop your head off by yourself while keeping your head within healing distance of your body.<br>\r\nYou make your way to the shed in the back garden. You know that there'll be tools and materials in there that you can use. Nobody ever goes in there anyway, so you won't be disturbed easily. You open it up and have a look around. You find various tools; Saws, hammers and so on. There's also plenty of wood and scrap metal laying around. \"Perfect.\" You say. You then start making a plan to build a make-shift guillotine. <br>\r\nOver the next few nights, you sneak out to the shed once everyone is asleep to work on your plan. Realising that your head would role too far from your body with a traditional guillotine, you start building a contraption that will hold your head in place, sort of like a vice and then swing around towards your body shortly after the blade has been released. As the building process goes on, you test out the device, substituting yourself with fruit. You would make several adjustment, until your guillotine was finally ready.<br>\r\nThe moment of truth finally arrives. You feel terrified, but also really excited. Your body shakes as the adrenaline starts pumping. You lay down and shove your head through the stocks. You then position your head into the vice to prevent it from rolling away. The blade has already been raised. All that's left to do is to release the rope tying it up. You reach your hand over and unhook the rope, grasping onto it. You hesitate for a moment as you brace yourself for what may or may not be your last moments. You take a deep breath and then let go of the rope. As soon as you do so, you hear the blade rushing towards you at high speed. It slices cleanly through your neck like warm butter. You feel a rush of pain, your neck burning, then you feel nothing at all. All connection to your body is gone. The vice then quickly spins around so that your head is closer to your body. You see your arms dangling on either side of the guillotine as your body lets out spasms. Feeling yourself getting weaker, you have no time to lose. You press your lips against your body and pray for the best.</span></div></div>",

What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" You slowly feel yourself coming back. \"Stop... shaking me. You're giving me... shakin head syndrome.\" You blink a couple of times and refocus on the other you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, what just happened?\" The other you asked. He was obviously alarmed, and you felt strangely confronted by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know.\" You close your eyes for a second. \"I think I was dying... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... but I healed you?\" Rick Clone says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't have a body... I don't have any lungs.\" You look down, at your missing body. You were terrified. \"Please don't let go of me. I think you're still healing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rick Clone looked up for a second to think, something you tended to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmed down enough to begin thinking of solutions. \"I think this close call gave us a little insight into our powers. Kissing a wound isn't the only way to activate our healing ability, and we can apparently do more than just heal minor wounds because you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but why haven't I been able to heal you a new body?\" Rick clone asked. \"Not that we know how much time passed, but I don't think it took long for you to heal your body and generate me. And that was only one kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows why a new body isn't growing, maybe your or our power is too weak right now. Like it needs time to recharge.\" You said. You really wished that you could rub your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it can't recharge if that is case. I'm still using it to keep you alive apparently, and who knows how long that is going to last.\" Rick clone looked scared for you. \"I can't let you just die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you don't have to...\" You looked up for a second, and then back at the other you. \"Maybe we can share my body, the one your using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share it?\" He looked at you with the same curious look you use. \"I see where your going... That will be weird sharing it though.\" He then lifts up your head further and places your neck directly next to his. \"Instead of being twins, we'd be conjoined twins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would probably be weirder for me than you.\" You say. \"You are already connected after all. I'm pretty sure that I would be just like a second pair of eyes.\" You could feel a warmth spread over you, you could actually feel the healing power flow into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its working!\" you both say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird. I can feel your neck attaching beside mine.\" Rick clone comments. \"I shouldn't be too long now.\" He continued to hold your head steady beside his as the healing power fuses your head back on.</span></div></div>",

I can't move that hand anymore, just the left.\" Rick Clone said, mirroring Rick Prime's movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both turn their heads to look at their dicephalic reflection. \"I can only feel my side!\" Both Ricks said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was wrong.

Its better than you staying as a dead, disembodied head.\" Rick Clone shrugged their left shoulder. \"And it was your body to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now its our body.\" Rick Prime looked at their reflection again and touched their right shoulder. It was odd how broad his chest and shoulders had become to accommodate both of them. His head sat displaced, slightly to the right while his twin's protruded from the left. Their two faces quizzically studied their appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you control the right, and I control the left...\" Rick Clone finally said, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about that too. We're going to have to figure how to move our body.\" Rick Prime gave his twin a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't be too hard, right?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick Prime nodded worriedly, not sharing his twin's positive attitude. \"I guess.\" Rick Prime looked down at their single body. An odd sense of vertigo washed over him. He had no sensation on the whole left half of what used to be his own body. Simply standing in place was strange. It was like an invisible wall supported him from falling sideways. Rick Prime back up to his twin, trying to ignore the dizzying sensation. \"Okay, lets practice then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ricks quickly discussed the not so simple action of walking to the shed's door and back to the mirror. Rick Clone carefully raised his left leg while they both shifted their shared weight to Rick Prime's leg. Rick Clone planted his foot on the ground in front of them. The Ricks then continued with the same set of actions for Rick Prime's right leg. Each step required them to carefully announce the next move to each other, and the process was slow. The normally five second trip turned into three minutes. But when they successfully made it to the door and back, Rick Prime and Rick Clone both could not help but gleefully smile at each other for the small success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to carefully, slowly move around the shed, practicing the complex choreograph of walking. The time began to fly by as the Ricks began gaining a sense of balance and committing the muscle actions to memory. After a half an hour or so, they were able to walk at an almost normal pace, so long as both knew the destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had just found out the consequence of failing to communicate with each other, having stumbled and fallen hard to the rough shed floor. The Ricks carefully picked themselves off the ground. \"Well, we were mostly successful.\" Rick Clone frowned as he looked at the scrapes on the palm of his hand. They had tried to catch their fall with outstretched hands but were not completely successful. He looked at his brother's hand, which was also covered in cuts and scratches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll heal yours if you heal mine.\" Rick Prime playfully smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Rick Clone nodded. They awkwardly grasped each other's hand, lacing their fingers together. If they were only one person, it would have looked like they were putting their hands together to pray. Rick Clone watched as his Rick Prime closed his eyes to concentrate. The stinging in his hand began to subside. Rick Clone then closed his eyes and began to heal Rick Prime's hand. When they finished, both Ricks unlaced their fingers and held their hands in front of themselves. \"It worked. No more cuts.\" Rick Clone said. A shiver then ran down his side of the body. Goosebumps were starting to form on his skin from the cool night air. They had been in the shed a long time. \"We should probably go inside the house before we catch a cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Prime nodded in agreement, before a sudden realization hit him. \"We can't go inside, not like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you... Oh... Mom and Dad and....\" Rick Clone sighed, remembering that their family had no clue what had been happening in the shed. Neither of them had thought that far ahead, not until now. \"What are we going to do?\" Both Ricks asked each other at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Prime frowned, \"Great, there are two of us, and we have zero ideas.\" He ran his fingers through his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could...\" Rick Clone began to say as he looked towards the dismantled guillotine. Rick Prime followed his twin's gaze. They both hastily shook their heads, almost smacking each other. They had both come to the same conclusion that trying anything that drastic again would not end well. Neither wanted to take the risk of both of them or one of them dying permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began bouncing ideas off each other, but that did not last long. The brainstorming turned to arguing, which then turned blaming. Voices were raised, and choice words were said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard!\" a voice called somewhere in the backyard. Both Ricks immediately stopped arguing and stared at each other with identical panicked looks. \"Richard!\" The voice of their mother called again. \"What are you doing in the shed?\" Their mother was nearing the shed door. \"Are you arguing with someone?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They glared at each other from the corner of their eyes for a moment. \"Great, now she knows that there are two people in here.\" Rick Prime whispered to his other half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he spoke, their mother loudly asked from the other side of the door, \"Who's in there with you, Richard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth quickly covered each other's mouth to keep them from answering, but that did not help their situation. \"Richard?\" Their mother was jiggling the door handle, attempting to push the door open. The shed was old, and the hinges often got stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hide.\" Rick Clone whispered, \"at least... one of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Rick Prime asked. A moment later, they each tried moving in opposite directions, getting nowhere. The little time they had to hide, quickly evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard!\" Their mom yelled through the door, clearly annoyed. She then pushed open the door and stepped inside. At first, she did not seem to notice. \"Richard, who were...\" The words died in her mouth as she gazed upon her son Rick, and other other son, Rick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom.\" Both Ricks answered, sheepishly. \"I can explain.\" Their mom's eyes fell back into their skull. Her legs went limp underneath her, and she fell to the shed floor. \"Mom!\" Both Ricks exclaimed as they rushed to her, nearly falling themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling beside her, Rick Clone reach out with his hand shook his mother's shoulder. \"Mom, mom, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Prime turned to his other half, \"We have to get Dad, we won't be able to carry her to the house.\" Rick Clone nodded in agreement. They carefully stepped around their collapsed parent and briskly walked to the house. Opening the backyard door, they both called, \"Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father quickly appeared from another room. \"Rick?\" He abruptly stopped in the hallway when he saw both of his sons. He had to place a hand on the wall to support his buckling knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can explain later Dad.\" Rick Clone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need your help to get Mom inside.\" Rick Prime then followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ricks then turned and walked back to the shed. Their father, gaining control of himself followed his boys outside. It took a couple minutes for their dad to move their mother inside. The Ricks helped, but it was difficult for them to remain coordinated while carrying their mother's weight. With her carefully lying on the sofa, their dad simply state, \"Dinning Room.\" He abruptly turned and lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Prime and Rick Clone sat themselves directly across from their father, on the square table. Their dad looked pale, almost like he'd seen a ghost. The three of them sat in silence for a few moments. His gaze shifted back and forth between the two Ricks. He finally closed his eyes and took a moment to collect himself. \"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ricks started from beginning, taking turns speaking about the events that happened. They began with the events at the train station with the creepy old man. Rick Prime then skipped to this evening, retelling about the home-made guillotine and how he used it to remove his head. They explained how the wound healed and formed an identical head. Rick Clone the explained how he healed Rick Prime but that it was only temporary. The boys recalled how the best answer they could think of included attaching Rick Prime's head onto the same body, hoping that it would work. Rick Clone finished, \"Mom then came in to check the shed and saw us. That's how she fainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father had said nothing through the entire summary of the events. He was so quiet, both Ricks were not sure how to react. Their father finally answered, \"So, you're a healer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're what?\" Both Ricks asked, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored their question and frowned at his sons, \"You could have killed yourselves with that head chopping stunt. Your ground Rick... uh, both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ricks' jaws dropped in shock. \"Wh-what?\" Rick Prime stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a lot we need to talk about, but not tonight. You both clearly need rest, and I need to make sure your mother is okay. Now go upstairs.\" Their father firmly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ricks knew better than to question their father, no matter how confused they were. They carefully walked upstairs to their room, without another word to their parents. Closing their bedroom door behind them, both Ricks turned to look at each other. \"What just happened?\"</span></div></div>",

The brief conversation with their father just left them with more questions. \"What's a healer?\" Rick Clone asked, though more rhetorically. That term clearly described what their power was, regeneration. But, their father referred to it more as a title or designation, rather than a simple definition of an ability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Prime just shrugged his shoulder. \"I don't know what dad meant by it.\" He said, following his other half's train of thought. \"We'll learn more about this tomorrow.\" Exhaustion was finally starting to set in. Their father had been right; both desperately needed rest. The events of the evening were taking their toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick Clone yawned loudly, \"I guess.\" With that, they dropped the discussion for now, agreeing instead to get ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wobbled toward the bed and stopped just at the foot of it. Slowly, they stripped down to their boxers. Coordinating undressing was harder then it seemed, and taking off their shirt was especially a challenge. There was only one neck-hole. Pulling it over both of their heads was rather difficult, as they had to press their faces painfully together tug it off. The pants were far easier; it just took some extra cooperation to undo the belt and button. Leaving their clothes on the ground, The Ricks turned and headed to bathroom directly across from the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping in, Rick Clone blindly reached for the light switch before flipping it on. They paused to look at their reflection again. It was the same body that each remembered having this morning, mostly. But neither of them could help but marvel at it. They still had the same lean waist and stomach, with little muscle definition. Their torso was obviously stockier, wider as it neared the shoulders. \"Lets turn around real quick to see our backside.\" Rick Prime said. They then turned around and looked backwards towards the mirror. Two, separate spines trailed down from their necks to their shared pelvis, resembling the top of a Y. \"We actually grew a whole separate spine!\" Rick Prime exclaimed as he gazed into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ricks, having seen enough, turned back around. On the sink was a single toothbrush, which both reached for. Two hands hovered over it. \"Uh, should we take turns?\" Rick Clone questioned, knowing that they did not have a spare handy. Rick Prime begrudgingly agreed. It took them several minutes to each brush their teeth, with the one brush. \"Toilet next?\" Rick Clone questioned as his face turned slightly red. He was referring to the pressure of a full bladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Rick Prime responded, equally as embarrassed. In front of the toilet, they both grabbed one side of their boxers and slowly pulled them down and then let them fall around their ankles. A single, unchanged penis hung between their thighs. Rick Prime sheepishly smiled. \"Well, its a good thing we're practically the same person, or this would be awkward having to share one.\" Both Ricks then hesitantly touched their penis causing both boys to shudder at the sensation, answering the unspoken question about who had control. It took a few moments longer for them to realize just how much they shared as simply peeing required both of them to concentrate on the task simultaneously. They did finally relieve themselves and quickly washed their hands afterwards at the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, they went back to their room and slipped into bed. They resigned to sleeping on their backs, finding sleeping on their sides too uncomfortable as their faces would be pressed together. After resting their heads onto one pillow both fell asleep within moments of each other. </span></div></div>",

He tried to turn over, to get away from the sun\u2019s rays, but a weight to his right kept him pinned. Rotating his head to see what was obstructing him, he saw another head. A brief moment of panic welled up inside of him before he remembered last night\u2019s events. He shifted his head closer to his other half, just enough to get out of the sunlight. He then wiped the sleep from his eyes. He did not have to wait much longer before Rick Prime also awoke. A brief morning greeting was shared between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly lifted their torso from the bed. Rick Prime braced his hand against the bed mattress to support their weight. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take awhile before I get used to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHopefully we won\u2019t have to get used to this.\u201d Rick Clone replied. \u201cDad and mom are probably up; I can smell the coffee. Lets see if they are ready to talk with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ricks then shifted their body so that their two feet dangled off the edge. They then pushed themselves the rest of the way off, landing lightly on the carpet floor. It took a moment for them to find their balance, swaying from side to side slightly. \u201cGet Dressed?\u201d Rick Prime asked, and his other half agreed. The Ricks went to the foot of their bed and began the struggle of putting on the jeans they had taken off last night. They stumbled about and finally fell onto the floor. They pulled the pants up the rest of the way while on the ground. Rick Clone then reached for the nearest shirt, but the quickly agreed that the single-hole was uncomfortable. Instead, they walked to their closet to grab a buttoned shirt. Not only was it easier to put on, but also it fit much better as they did not button it up all the way. The only challenge was actually coordinating the buttons. Finally dressed, the Ricks headed downstairs. Their parents were waiting for them in the living room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother was grasping both hands around her coffee mug, taking small sips. Heir hair was in a loose ponytail. Their father was leaned forward, elbows on his knees with his hands supporting his head. Neither of the Ricks could make out what they had been talking about, and their parents abruptly stopped when their sons came into the room. \u201cHave a seat\u2026 boys.\u201d Their father said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting down, their mother gave them her best smile. \u201cSorry about what happened last night. You\u2026 both gave quite a scare. \u201c She spoke slowly and tried to look at each other Ricks in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Ricks gave her an uncomfortable smile. They shared a glance before Rick Prime said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re sorry. Uh\u2026 we didn\u2019t mean for you to find us like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck, we didn\u2019t even mean to end up like this.\u201d Rick Clone piped in. An uncomfortable silence fell upon the four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir father let out a deep sigh. \u201cWe all have questions that we need answered. Let\u2019s try and talk this out and see what we can share and learn.\u201d He scratched his chin, appearing to think about how best to begin. \u201cUm\u2026 last night, I left you guys saying you were healers. Let\u2019s start there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you mean by that? We thought it was like some kind of title or something.\u201d Rick Clone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not far from the truth.\u201d Their father looked towards his wife. \u201cLook, your mother and I were not planning on having this conversation with you. All through your childhood, you never displayed any abilities. We thought you hadn\u2019t inherited the gift, but obviously we were wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother finally spoke again. \u201cYou come from a long line of healers, generations of individuals with the ability to regenerate tissue and more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ricks were speechless for a moment. \u201cWait, so your both\u2026 these healers too?\u201d Rick Clone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d Their mother spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour power comes from my side of the family.\u201d Their father explained.  \u201cI\u2019m not nearly as strong as some from our family. I can barely heal a small paper cut.  But your uncle Desmond, he is quite powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Desmond, the crazy test pilot, car guy.\u201d Rick Prime tried to remember exactly what their uncle did. He tested a lot of state of the art vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Desmond is a healer.\u201d Their father replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just saw him in the hospital 2 months ago.\u201d Rick Prime exclaimed. \u201cHe can\u2019t be a healer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think he could have survived all of those crashes?\u201d Their father questioned, but neither Rick replied. \u201cHe uses his powers carefully. Sometimes he\u2019ll heal himself almost completely, saying that is was dumb luck he came out unscathed. Other times like his most recent crash, he will only regenerate himself enough so he will not die. It does take a lot to kill a healer, but they can die. Decapitation is typically the most sure way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ricks gulped loudly. Their mother reached a comforting hand and grasped the Ricks\u2019 closet hand, Rick Prime\u2019s hand. She then grabbed Rick Clone\u2019s hand as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you did was foolish? You could have died.\u201d Their father began again. \u201cBut somehow, you\u2019re still alive. And, now there are two of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly\u2026\u201d Rick Clone said. \u201cWe only have the one body.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s also what we want to speak with you about.\u201d Their mother gently said. \u201cHealers, are notoriously hard to kill. In history, they did not just act as shamans or medics. Many were warriors or soldiers because the stronger ones could heal wounds quickly so they may continue fighting. However, there are a few sure means of killing a healer. Decapitation being one, like your father said. Even the strongest aren\u2019t powerful enough to recover from such major injuries, not alone at least.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rick Prime raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo one else was there.\u201d </span></div></div>",

There is something else we should tell you; it is most surely related.\u201d Their mother frowned. \u201cWhen I was pregnant, the doctors told me that I was having twins.\u201d The Ricks leaned forward, their mother having their undivided attention \u201cBut at some point during the pregnancy, we lost one of the babies.\u201d She looked to her husband. He grabbed one of her hands and stroked it reassuringly. \u201cWe were devastated.\u201d Turning back to the Ricks, she continued, \u201cThe doctors thought that one was absorbed by the other and called it \u2018vanishing twin\u2019 syndrome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I was a twin?\u201d Both Ricks asked in unison. They then turned and looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe think that you ARE twins.\u201d Their father said. \u201cThat would explain why you were able to survive such an injury due to the compounding effect of being two healers in one.\u201d He turned to Rick Prime. \u201cYou must have absorbed your would-be twin in the womb, taking his power as well.\u201d He then turned to Rick Clone. \u201cWhen Rick, healed his\u2026 neck, he really healed his vanished twin, you.\u201d He smiled brightly at his other son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so I\u2019m not a\u2026 clone or something.\u201d Rick Clone stuttered, astonishment and disbelief were clear in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m Rick\u2019s twin?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe think so, dear.\u201d Their mother gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cDespite the unusual circumstance of how it happened\u2026 your father and I are incredibly blessed to have you back, to have the both of you now.\u201d She smiled to herself. \u201cBefore we lost you, we had names picked out. We were going to name you Richard and\u2026 Charles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick clone, or Charles, was quiet for a long moment. He finally pointed towards Rick, \u201cBut I have all his memories.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is true, then we\u2019ve been like one person since the womb. Maybe you were not dead or anything, just not conscious, or present. Maybe like in a coma. You just experienced everything that I did.\u201d Rick offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Charles let out a small sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother left her seat, and spontaneously hugged her sons, placing her head between both of theirs. \u201cWe know this is a lot for both of you to take in.\u201d She said as she stepped away. \u201cIt is a lot for us to take in too.\u201d She sat back down beside her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that explains some things.\u201d Rick spoke up again. \u201cBut, why are we still\u2026 stuck in one body? How do we get, apart? How are we going to go to school?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s handle one problem at a time.\u201d Their father said. \u201cGoing to school is obviously out of the question for now. I\u2019ll call them later to let them know you are sick, and I\u2019ll pick up any homework you need for the next week or so.\u201d Rick and Charles did not look too thrilled about the homework part, but they nodded in agreement. \u201cSeparating the two of you\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother might know some people who can help.\u201d Their mother chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I can give Desmond a call too. See if he still has any contacts with other healers in the area.\u201d Their father sighed heavily. \u201cFor now boys, you\u2019ll just have to remain as you are. It\u2019s too dangerous for you to try anything reckless again on your own. But I do have some things that you might find interesting.\u201d He reached down beside him, grabbing a pile of books that neither Rick or Charles noticed before. \u201cHere is a little bit of reading. These contain a more accurate account of history, including the accomplishment of several healers. They will also contain some of the biology and mechanics of your regeneration powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wrote one of the books myself.\u201d Their mother commented.  \u201cMost of that work I could never publish, but I did complete a few studies in my lab over the years. I provided that information to the underground groups of healers and... other groups of power.\u201d She was a well-known physiologist in the science community. It was not all that surprising that she would study the regeneration factor of healers, considering she was married to one. Rick and Charles were curious about what their mother meant about 'other groups,' but they did not get a chance to ask at that moment. Their parents suddenly stood, and their mother kissed both of her sons on the forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you have some time to process all of this.\u201d With that, their parents left the twins alone. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days had passed since the ground-breaking family meeting. Rick and Charlie, as Charles preferred to be called since learning he was Richard\u2019s twin, had used much of the time adjusting to their current situation. Discovering that they were twins was an amazing answer to a juvenile desire that Rick had. Ever since he was young, he always wanted a twin, and secretly felt that his double would turn up someday. Now that Charlie was discovered to be his long lost twin, Rick and him were ecstatic about having a brother. However, they were still stuck sharing a body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth retained memories of being individuals, which made things more challenging. The co-ordination practice that they had in the workshop the night before had helped, but it was still painstakingly difficulty to move their shared body as a single, normal person would. Every impulse or action needed to be consulted and shared. The twins had to ask each other permission, or first discuss, about simple movements like crossing their legs or arms, leaning forward, or simply shifting in a chair. They had to co-ordinate their hands in deceptively complex tasks like making a sandwich and texting. Even using the restroom was challenging. As they learned the night they had first begun sharing a body, the muscular contractions used to defecate were divided between them. Brief arguments about who would wipe their butt afterwards would also occur. On the bright side, walking was easier but required them to verbalize steps every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick figured that if he and Charlie were born as conjoined twins, a condition they had recently learned from a google search, then the little things would have been more manageable and less frustrating. But, he was thankful that it was not the case. For as annoying as sharing a body was, being born attached to his brother would have brought all sorts of other challenges, even for healers like them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins spent many hours in their room learning more about their abilities and history from the books their parents provided. As they could not go outside or hang out in person with friends, reading the surprisingly large amount of secret texts was the only way to pass time. \u201cDude, listen to this.\u201d Charlie pointed to a paragraph in the book in front of him. They had decided days before to read different books and share what they learned with each other. Besides splitting the load in half, reading was now one of the few activities they could do independently. \u201cThe Healer Bloom\u2026\u201d He read aloud, \u201cis a far more common phenomenon in recent years when healers first discover their gifts. Due to the advancements in medicine and fewer dangers from advancements in civilization, most healers can go many, many years without even realizing they have powers. Over the course of their life, the healing factor is stored within their cells, ever growing. This power will continue to build up and typically will not activate unless the body receives a severe injury. The healer\u2019s powers will be released and can sometimes regenerate even fatal wounds.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegenerate even fatal wounds\u2026\u201d Rick repeated. \u201cWounds like decapitation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost healers probably would not survive that, but we\u2019re different.\u201d Charlie pointed between them. \u201cSince we only have one body, our combined power could have been double or more the strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo our bloom was at least strong enough to regenerate your own head and heal me. Too bad it wasn\u2019t enough to give us our own bodies.\u201d Rick frowned as he looked at his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie shrugged his shoulder. It was an odd sensation for both of them, because the muscles between their necks also tightened, allowing Rick to feel his brother shrugging. \"Uncle Desmond will be here later tonight. It sounded like he could help. We'll each have our own bodies in no time; and then we can be normal twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that brings up all sorts of other problems. No one knows about you and I being twins. Everyone including me and our family thought I was an only child. How are we going to explain that?\" Rick dropped his head into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One problem at a time dude.\" Charlie said, being the optimist of the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the doorbell range and their uncle Desmond's loud, friendly voice could be heard.</span></div></div>",

What do you mean?\" Rick Clone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you...\" He stops himself, realising that he was talking to Rick Clone, not Rick Prime. \"The ORIGINAL you built the device so that it would be able to move his head closer to the body after he chopped it off.

We shouldn't be dwelling on what has already happened.

The knife slices right through and her head falls to the ground. You watch for a second as blood spurts from her neck stump and her body slumps down onto its knees before falling forwards. You then drop the knife and kneel down to quickly pick up your girlfriend's severed head. She has an expression on pain on her face and she appears to be still conscious. She tries to mouth something to you, but you can't make it out. Without hesitating any longer, you bring your lips to hers and kiss her. After kissing her a few times, she starts to kiss you back. You think that is a good sign, but you kept kissing just to make sure it works. After about 30 seconds, you think that it has worked.

Rarely did the two of you get into sexual activity that was risque enough to warrant the usage of your safe word, but the two of you always had the same one just in case.

Grabbing handfuls of fabric you rip away Sarah's bra, the strap snapping as you forcefully pulled it away from her chest without undoing it.  While certainly not a dollar store article of clothing Sarah's far too busy panting at your assertiveness to chastise you about mistreating her clothes.  You briefly pause to ram your face between her chest, motor boating her gleefully as she was normally too ticklish there to let you do that.  You had to content yourself with light massaging or the occasional brief lick for months.  After that momentary yet forceful plunge into her cleavage in which you nearly break your nose on her sternum you pull back and direct your attention southward.

You weren't here to please your toy you were here to please yourself.  That being said despite its relative brevity you'd managed to do a real number on Sarah's limp form.  Your fingers had dug into her shoulders to the point of bruising them, you'd ground her butt into the forrest floor with enough force to draw long scratch marks across it, and while you'd been thrusting you'd chewed on the periphery of her neck stump drawing some blood to the surface.  All in all you're covered in enough sweat to bath a hippo and turning to Sarah you see she's the shade of a tomato from your show.  \"Holy hell, I didn't know you could even be so rough!  Me likey!\"<br>\r\nYou attempt to stand but fall to your knees as your over exerted legs buckle beneath you causing both you and Sarah to laugh.  \"Neither did I, but seeing as how this was an opportunity for me to let loose I took that opportunity in full.\"  You crawl over to her and lift her by the hair making her wince and giggle simultaneously.  You bring her in for a good long kiss before asking  \"So, is there anything else you'd like to try my absolute headcase?\"<br>\r\n\"Rick!\"  She said with a huff of annoyance, though it was more aimed at your terrible pun than at the fact that you called her crazy.  \"As a matter of fact I do!\"  She then suggested that...</span></div></div>",

Sarah's head, who's been watching all of this in intent silence up until now, suddenly begins screaming \"Fuck yea! Screw that headless bitch, screw her good!

Watching myself having sex like this is <i>such</i> a turn on! If I had a pussy right now, I think I might have orgasmed just from watching the two of you! Which brings me to my next idea.

They began having a sort of fight, fondling, rubbing, and squeezing every last inch of each others body playfully.  By the time they had covered every last spot they had grown extremely wet in more ways than one and were having trouble catching there breath.  \"Great, now I'm all hot and bothered.

The girls agree and sit down at the dinner table, idly conversing with one another in an incredibly casual manner considering the circumstances.  After another ten minutes you finished and the two/three of you quickly ate.  It was alright, the best that could be made from the sparse ingredients at hand, but not terrible or amazing.  What was amazing was watching the two Sarah's eat.  Sarah 1 scooped forkfuls of food into her twins mouth, her twin responding in kind with almost clockwork perfection in timing.  They cleaned one another's chins and mouth's, and even to your own amusement reenacted <u>Lady and the Tramp</u>, slurping down a single strand of spaghetti until there lips met and the two kissed shortly before began laughing uproariously.  When the three of you were done you set the dishes in the sink and made your way to the garage as quickly as possible, not wanting any one to see the naked two headed girl gleefully wielding a machete for fear of being interrupted at an inopportune moment.  When you finally arrived at the luckily nearly vacant garage you set to work setting a tarp up on the ground so as not to splatter blood everywhere.  You snagged the machete from there hands and explained.  \"Alright, I know this is going to hurt by I have to ask the two of you to refrain from screaming.  Don't want anyone coming in here.\"<br>\r\nBoth Sarahs agree and they lie there conjoined body onto the tarp, bracing for impact as they slowed there breathing.  HACK!  squish.  HACK!  squish.

In five powerful blows and one minute the two girls were split in twain, all manner of fluids spilling out as there lower half twitching and fidgeting as it lost connection to there brains.  The girls had managed not to scream but were crying rather openly in pain, silently begging you to work faster despite how quickly you had been going.  You pulled the lower half away a bit so as to keep it separate before kissing the least ghastly section of the wound.  There cries softened as the wound shut, healing itself and repairing the hole.  Before long the two of them were poking and prodding the smooth skin under them, having gotten over the pain quickly enough.  You kiss the lower half and it heals too, now just a brainless pair of sexy legs.<br>\r\n\"So, which one of you is going on the legs?\"  You ask, looking over at the two girls.<br>\r\nThey look at each other, seemingly talking using only nonverbal cues.

Eye sockets began to take shape next, followed shortly by a forehead and then rounding off at the top. The scalp suddenly sprouted long brown hair to finish it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!

You wonder what this new idea is. You are excited to hear what Sarah has come up with. You get ready for bed and find a place to put the hands, so that they won't wander off in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Sarah comes over to your place. You lead her up to the bedroom and sit down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was your idea?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to take things a step further. Rather than chopping of a finger, or even a hand, I want you to chop my arms off.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You do realise that it'll be much more painful than your finger, right?\" You ask Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously, but I think it could be really cool. Once you heal me, my arms should grow back, and then we have two spare arms to ply around with.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's not actually a bad idea. Lets do it!\" You say. You then lead Sarah to the bathroom and get her to step into the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gonna be lots of blood, so this will be much easier to clean up.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah strips down to her bra and underwear and hands her clothes to you, so that they don't get stained with the blood. You then go and grab a knife from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing that there's nobody else here. This is going to be loud. Are you ready?\" You say. Sarah gives you a silent nod as she braises herself for the pain to come. You line up the knife with her shoulder and then begin sawing into her arm. Sarah lets out an ear piercing scream as the knife goes deeper. after about a minute, Sarah's arm drops to the floor. Seeing that Sarah has now been reduced to tears, you waste no time in healing her. You give her a big kiss on the lips and she begins to calm down as the pain fades and her arm grows back. As you end the kiss, you wipe away her tears and look her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm fine now. That was so much worse than I thought it would be.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still want me to chop the other one off?\" You ask her, not sure if she could go through with it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We might as well, since we've done the first one.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ready the knife again. You look at Sarah and see that she looks a bit more scared than the first time. You bear down the knife on her arm and hear her scream. She doesn't scream as badly this time though, since she knew what to expect this time. Once again, the arm drops down and you heal her immediately to prevent her from going through any more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. It's all over now.\" You say as you give her a hug. The two of you then look down at the two severed arms in the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do with them?\" You ask.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Damn it Shawn, she doesn't even know how to find her way home in the daytime anymore\", your Mom fires back. They then come into the kitchen.

You do a double take. The mystery girl in your bed looks alot like grandma does in the picture, maybe even younger. \"No way\", you mumble. You run up the stairs and back to your room.

You start feeling sick in your stomach. \"Oh my gawd, I had sex with my grandma\", you shout. She gets a concerned look on her face and says, \"Oh baby, if it makes you feel any better you were really good at it. Even better than your grandpa the first time\". \"Oh crap\", you mutter and race to the bathroom. You nearly throwup your cereal and then jump in the shower trying to wash off the dirty feeling.</span></div></div>",

I raised your Mother as if she was my own child. We never thought it was important that we tell her the truth. So you see we're not really related, by blood anyway\". You stand there stunned and mutter, \"You were a French whore\"? She rolls her eyes and says, \"Well not just in France. I turned tricks here for a few years until we could get the house paid off and then a few times when we needed extra cash. I made alot more money here than I ever did off the GI's back home. It helps if you like to fuck the way I do. It's a shame your grandfather couldn't keep up, but he did try God bless him. He died after taking too much Viagra\".

It's not a question you ever plan on asking. \"I've been thinking of that. We'll just pack some of my things. I'll leave a note saying that I'm going to check myself into a nursing home. They've been wanting to put me in one anyway. I'll tell them I'll be in touch\", Gianna states. You pack some of her things as she writes the note. She doesn't seem to concerned about what you pack. She tells you that she's going to throw most of her old shit away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You finish up just as you hear your parents pulling into the driveway. You rush Gianna out the back door. \"I'll call you when I get to my place\", she says with a smile. \"Your place\", you question? She smiles and says, \"I kept a condo in the city for work. It's all paid for and under another name\". Confused and state, \"Work, you don't mean prostituting? (she nods) When did you stop doing that\"? She giggles, gives you a passionant kiss, and whispers, \"I never did\". She then runs off through the back yard. \"Man, this morning has started of really wierd\", you mumble and go to see your parents with the letter you \"found\".</span></div></div>",

You'd had two girlfriends, both coincidentally named Sarah but apart from their shared first name they were nearly nothing alike.  While your current girlfriend, Sarah Millers, was kind, trusting, funny, and just about the best girlfriend you could ever ask for your previous girlfriend, Sarah Reese, was pretty much the exact opposite.  Stuck up, suspicious, cold, and generally just a bitch, you honestly can't remember how your relationship started nor how it managed to survive a whole three months before the two of you exploded at one another at a dinner date.  The scene got you both banned from that restaurant for life and ended your relationship immediately.  It didn't end the drama, though.  Sarah Reese had spent her time since your breakup starting rumors and making passive aggressive remarks whenever she crossed your path, causing you no shortage of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you didn't consider yourself a particularly vindictive person, but learning that you now had the power to heal people's injuries suddenly filled your head with a lot of awful ideas.  You effectively had a get out of jail free card in your lips, you could hurt her in any way you'd like without causing any permanent damage and without leaving any evidence behind.  You could call her up right now and lay a trap for when she arrives, a prank that you could easily undo with a single kiss.  You'd have your revenge cake and eat it too!  Assuming the old man was right, of course.  If it was just the crazy ramblings of a deranged geezer then you really didn't want to get yourself in trouble by intentionally hurting someone as a joke then being unable to fix it.  Besides, if current Sarah ever found out about you taking petty revenge on an ex she may think less of you.  You consider your options, and decide to...</span></div></div>",
