He felt a heavy sense of grogginess clouding him, his muscles screaming in protest, as he slowly forced his eyes open, wincing as the sunlight beat down upon with more ferocity than he\u2019d ever seen it. He certainly hadn\u2019t drunk any alcohol as of late, but this sure felt like a hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the throbbing headache yelled at him, he tried to think back, not quite sure what was going on. Only yesterday he\u2019d been sailing the waters between Florida and the Caribbean islands in his motorboat, looking forward to a long vacation. He hadn\u2019t really bothered to tell anyone he was leaving, but he hadn\u2019t really felt like being pestered by anyone. Of course, that also meant that no one knew where he was or where he had been going when the storm struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came out of nowhere, massive booms of thunder that he could barely hear over the vicious waves pounding and smashing against his boat. His attempts at steering did little to help as the boat was batted back and forth like the ocean\u2019s little plaything. The last thing he\u2019d remembered from then was a massive wave hitting him and washing him overboard, knocking him out in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been early morning when he woke up on a white sandy beach. Coughing, he\u2019d stood and looked around for any sign of his boat. Nothing but the vibrant blue-green water and the softly swaying trees and ferns. Had he been less concerned about his predicament, he might have enjoyed the tropical view he\u2019d only really seen in pictures and movies. After some time wandering the beach, he\u2019d walked into the jungle, hoping to find something, anything... And he\u2019d found something all right. He walked right into a clearing and found himself face to face with several men, barely clothed and powerfully painted with energetic reds and chalky whites that stood out against their dark skin. One of them shot him with a dart of some kind and he\u2019d gone right back to sleep\u2019s warm embrace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around as his eyes adjusted to the light. His arms were being held by two tall men, each only wearing a tight loincloth but both rippling with muscle. He tried to struggle, but between the muscle difference and whatever drug or poison they\u2019d put in him sapping his strength, he might as well have been fighting against a wall. He screamed, fighting them still as he was dragged up a tall set of stairs. To his right, the wall they were climbing the side of rose up. It must have been fifty or sixty feet. Looking to his left, he could see the beach, so far away now, and realized he was hopelessly caught with little chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the stairs ended, and the two men dragged him towards a large platform that reached out over the far side of the wall; they bound him with thick rope in a spread eagle formation, and he realized for the first time that they\u2019d taken off all his clothes, leaving him naked and exposed. He desperately wished he could move his hands to cover himself as he looked to either side, seeing dozens if not hundreds of other savages on top of the wall. They were all stomping their feet on the wood and chanting something. \u201cKON-GA! KON-GA!\u201d Konga? What was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud thud drew his attention forward. Before him, on the other side of the wall, a grassy field extended several hundred feet. Beyond that, trees that must have been close to a hundred feet tall towered over him and the wall. He could see the trees start to shake as something got closer. Something BIG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could have compared him for what emerged. A man, as dark-skinned as the natives and as bare as him, but with one notable difference. He was taller than the wall, close to seventy feet! He squirmed, trying to free himself from his restraints again as the titanic man drew closer. The giant was chiseled with powerful muscle, and between his legs, his flaccid cock hung, incredibly large even for his huge stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Konga. The enormous man stood before the wall, eyeing the tiny white man before him. Even though he was dozens of feet away, he could smell the thick musk of the other man: a mixture of sweat, testosterone, and dirt and grime that reeked of masculinity and power. A hand as big as he was came down and wrapped around him, pulling him up and away from the platform; the restraints fell away, apparently designed to break under force from such an angle. He looked down at the captive in his hand, a thoughtful expression on his face.</span></div></div>",

He was so groggy, he could barely move a muscle. Those darts he shot at him as he swam onto the beach must have been laced with some sort of poison.<br>\r\nThis had not been his best week. He had seen his ship go down because of some undetected coral reef. It went down quickly, but half the crew got onto an inflatable raft. After about two days on the water, the raft sprung a leak. Some of the crew were lost because they couldn't swim, while others were lost because of sharks. However, he saw the island and started swimming with complete disregard of his own life. He escaped the ship and the sharks, but not the darts of the natives.<br>\r\nAt this point, he deduced that he was going to be sacrificed to some island god ritual and wished the sharks had gotten him. At this point, the gates opened, revealing some sort of stage with restraints. Now, he blacked out.<br>\r\nNext thing he knew, he was already tied to the restraints. He heard the natives shouting something that sounded like \"KONGA!\" over and over. It was interrupted on occasion by the sound of a gong. What he saw next would bring him out of his stupor.<br>\r\nFirst, he felt the ground shake, then the trees fell, then a deafening roar. Through the trees in front of him, he saw the form of a giant nude woman. She was about as dark as the natives with a good figure and thick thighs. Actually, she was quite attractive. Now, he noticed that he was naked and sprouted an erection.<br>\r\nThen, Konga reached out and grabbed him, pulling out of his restraints.</span></div></div>",

He quickly figured this out and tried to resist it, but her grip was still too tight. He was some strange combination of angry, scared, and horny. This continued for what seemed like forever but was actually ten minutes.<br>\r\nFinally, she appeared to slow down. He looked up to see what appeared to be her lair. It looked very primitive. He also saw a lot of skeletons all around the lair. It was at this point that she opened her palm and saw that he was closer than ever to climax.

He tried to pull it out, but she kept pushing him back in. Needless to say, the willpower in his brain was more durable than that of his penis. With those kinds of motions, it didn't take him long to cum.<br>\r\nOut of the anger of this orgasm, he bit her nose while he was still that close. This caused her to let out a deafening roar. She then proceeded to shove him up her ass. He figured this as punishment, given how much shit and smell was up there. This combination caused him to vomit within three minutes. (The aforementioned willpower made sure it wasn't sooner.) Konga must have felt this, given that she pulled him right out, figuring he learned his lesson.<br>\r\nThe ebony giantess liked what she saw when she put him up to eye level. To her, the shit stains must have been an aphrodisiac, because she lowered him down to her already wet vagina and plunged him headlong. He barely had time to react before the plunge, but started flailing after. This must have made her hotter, given that her pants and roars became harder and longer and she started to smell more. He was also so hard, he wound up at orgasm again, this time without assistance. She happened to go at the same time, given that her fluids flooded past and onto him.<br>\r\nWhen she took him out, she looked at him again.

She wanted to keep him alive, but also clean him up. Most fluids and solids that were previously on him were wiped clean. Of course, this left him full of her saliva. <br>\r\nAfter a while, she opened her mouth and pulled him out, being careful to avoid her teeth. It was at this point that he noticed that the teeth were more like that of a gorilla- long canines and sharp incisors. He was careful not to squirm when passing these mammoth ivories. He was relieved when he got safely out of her mouth but got nervous when he saw just how far he was from the ground.<br>\r\nShe examined him from head to toe to check if he was cleaned sufficiently. He was relieved quickly when he saw her smiling. However, he quickly wound up sticking halfway out of her mouth. Clearly, she noticed his again-hardened penis, for her tongue lashed vigorously at his unit, balls and all. She kept him pinned down with her teeth, careful not to press too hard. Somewhere between the dripping saliva, the fear of the teeth, and the bruising lapping of the tongue, he managed to let out another orgasm. This brought on another round of sucking of fluids.<br>\r\nOnce this was done, he was finally taken out of her mouth. She looked upon him once more and smiled again. Clearly, all of the excitement of the day made her tired. She went into a dark corner of the lair and lay on the flat rock. Before drifting off, she made sure to pin him in her cleavage, holding her breasts together like a pushup bra.<br>\r\nWhen she fell asleep, he found himself with a dilemma: make a run for it or wait it out and break when a better opportunity came.</span></div></div>",

Looking down onto the main path, she saw three warriors- two men, one woman- throwing spears at her. At them, she let out a deafening roar at them, knocking them down, their ears in agony. She took advantage of this and picked up one of them. She licked her lips, shoved him in her mouth and swallowed him whole. She then took her right hand and flattened the other man. With the woman, she picked her up and shoved her up her vagina. The motions the warrior was making- similar to the ones Konga's victim made earlier- made the goddess scream in ecstacy, cumming almost instantly. After this, the warrior dropped limp from her. Whether it was all the cum or the crushing force of the pussy, no one can tell.<br>\r\nThe man kept watching up to this point, biding his time until he felt the time was right to run again. He knew it was right as Konga was in the middle of her climax. Without a second thought, he turned and ran toward the sea.<br>\r\nAt this point, Konga... </span></div></div>",

She grabbed the nearest hut- with a family still inside- and threw it toward them. The hut was thrown with such force it disintegrated both the hut and platform on impact, killing all involved. Next, she saw a young child screaming. After walking through another hut and stepping on the family inside, she grabbed the child and just squeezed it to death within her fist. She would then throw the limp body toward another warrior, killing it. Next, she saw another female warrior trying to stab her. All Konga did to her was grab her, shoved the warrior up her ass, and closed as hard as she could. Such force literally broke her in half. She then shit her out onto the nearest hut, killing all but one inside. The one that did survive that was immediately grabbed by her and swallowed whole.<br>\r\nUpon seeing that their defenses were futile, what was left of the natives started to bow down to their goddess.

So on she walked.<br>\r\nAll was going well until there was heard a different, nearby roar. He knew this sounded nothing like her roar, so he figured this was not another giant human, but it was a giant something. He wound up shitting in Konga's hand when he saw that it was a T-Rex.

While swallowing the chunk of meat she bit out, the dinosaur gushed blood in a geyser that would make Old Faithful look like a school's water fountain. In no time, the beast bled out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Keith Ostrander came back to consciousness gradually over the course of about 15 minutes. The first thing he registered was cold water being splashed in his face. He shook his head a bit and immediately regretted it; the large welt on the back of his head made its presence very much felt. His ears were ringing, his vision was murky, and it took him a few moments to realize that he was being held up by the arms by a pair of Island Natives, both of whom were smaller than him. Keith was built like a brickhouse, 6ft 3, 235lbs, 8% body fat. He had just graduated high school two weeks ago and two weeks from now he was supposed to report to the University Of Georgia to start summer camps. Even as an incoming freshman, many expected Keith to be the Bulldogs starting linebacker in the fall. He and a couple of rich friends wanted to go on one last adventure before they went their separate ways for the time being. They went on a cruise through the South Pacific, got caught up in a tropical storm, and shipwrecked on this island. Keith had no idea where his friends were and very little memory of meeting the natives before one of them had splashed his face with water. Based on his head injury, one of them had probably bashed him with a rock. It would've been hard for them to subdue him any other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Keith fully came to, he was standing in a clearing. Well, sort of standing. His hands were bound together, tied to a large rope attached to a 10 foot tall pole. If he leaned too far forward or backward, the rope caught him. It looked pretty flimsy, but it has been holding 235 pounds of dead weight for who knows how long. Keith leaned downward, trying out different leverage points, but it was no use. This particular tribe was wildly advanced when it came to knots. This particular style could take hours to undo if you don't know the right technique, and applying pressure sometimes made it worse. He would have to get creative if he was going to get out of this thing. Even with his head relatively cleared, he still couldn't remember what happened after the shipwreck or how long he had been out here. He looked behind him and saw a massive wall, a deep trench in front of it, and a flimsy wooden bridge across the pit. Atop the wall, there was a line of torches and Keith could faintly make out a collection of natives beating drums and letting out an aggressive chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"KON-GA! KON-GA! KON-GA!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set. They had been at this for several hours at this point.There was clearly some kind of ritual going on and Keith wasn't a big fan of his positioning. After a few more minutes, Keith managed to bite through part of the knot labyrinth that . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great,</i> he thought, <i>only about a hundred more of those.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming Keith got out, he wasn't sure how the natives would react, or where he would run. He didn't have a ton of time to dwell on those thoughts. He heard a rumbling in the forest just beyond the clearing. Then he felt the rumbling. Keith froze in place as the trees shook hundreds of yards in front of him. And then came the last thing he expected to emerge from the forest: a pair of legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on your line of work or recreation or just the general context of the situation, maybe 50 feet doesn't seem that tall. No really, if we're talking about a building or a roller coaster or real estate, 50 feet might seem pretty run of the mill. When you're looking up at a 50 foot tall woman from toe-height, it's the most insane sight one could ever see. Her legs reminded Keith of his ex-girlfriend's, who was an all-county volleyball player. Her legs, butt, and belly were all incredibly toned. With dark hair, a tan swimmer's body, and a grass skirt, she looked like one of those Hawaiian hula girls. On a novelty bobble head, it's cute; on a normal sized girl, it's hot; on a girl the size of a building, it doesn't make her any less terrifying. Part of Keith hoped that she wouldn't notice him. It was a stupid thought considering the chanting and the row of torches clearly brought her here, but between his rock-induced concussion and seeing a towering hula girl block out the setting sun, he lost a good chunk of his rational thought. As she got closer and closer, Keith just put his back to the pole, put his head down, and closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real,\" he told himself aloud. \"Wake up. Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was one final *boom* and then the rumbling stopped. </span></div></div>",

A sharp, painful tug at his wrists prompts him to open his eyes and he realizes that's the rope he's been struggling with all afternoon snapping like a piece of twine. The knot around his hands untangles and falls away. He'd be in a great mood if he weren't 20 feet off the ground and ascending, drawing closer and closer to the huge face of the giant woman effortlessly lifting him off the ground. Her face is every bit as stunning as the rest of her body. Keith assumes she's his age, maybe a year or two older, but her mesmerizing amber eyes give her an immortal look. When he's finally within about 10 feet of her face, she stops lifting him. With upward momentum stopping, Keith is suddenly very aware of his legs dangling freely. He wouldn't exactly call her grip loose and he definitely didn't want to be here, but the fear of falling has him instinctively wrap his arms around the nearest free object for safety. Her thumb is his only option. The beginnings of a smile join her analyzing gaze. Konga finds him cute and her next actions make her intentions unambitious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers him slightly and her grip tilts back until Keith is laying horizontally, her thump pinning him against her open palm. The large pointer finger on her free hand then begins to explore. A terrified, but curious Keith demands to know what's going on as she strokes his muscular arms. Keith then feels a cold breeze as she lifts up the bottom of his tank top and gently runs her finger along his abs. And then, a noise that could be construed as a giggle if she were much smaller slips out of the massive woman. Keith feels the large finger run along his leg and up his shorts. It came to rest on the bulge in his pants. He tried to think of other thoughts to quell the situation, but it was too late. The large finger began to rhythmically back and forth along his shorts. Keith tried not to make eye contact with Konga as she continued to study him, an unmistakable grin growing along her face. Try as he might, Keith was unable to conceal the pleasure that Konga was shooting into his body. </span></div></div>",

The rope was longer than he had initially realized. He was suddenly lifted off the ground as the girl pulled the other end of the rope and he was dragged along her firm yet silky smooth leg on the way up. Then he hung there, dangling by nothing by the rope entangled around his hands, for about 10-20 feet before he hit off of her boob and found himself hovering above both of them. She appeared to be wearing some kind of bikini top, although Keith couldn't imagine where she got the material, let alone how she was so much more technologically advanced that the natives. The other end of the rope disappeared behind the back of her neck and that's when Keith realized what she had done. Konga released the slack on the rope, Keith fell between her boobs, and Konga had a brand new necklace. She patted the tiny prisoner between her breasts and giggled before making her way back into the forest. </span></div></div>",

He shakily looked up and opened his eyes, coming face-to-massive-face with the girl he was being sacrificed to. Her eyes caught him off guard; they were an intense shade of amber. It clashed with the kind, mischievous expression on her face. She was laying down, arms folded, head close to the ground, like she was watching a ladybug in the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought made Keith feel even smaller than he was. This whole exchange made him uncomfortable. He was like a doll to her. He knew it; she knew it.

They must have passed to close to another, bigger island. They passed through a chain of jagged rocks, unseen until one crashed through the bottom of it. They were still in view of that island, but not all of them knew how to swim. In fact, only her and a male were able to swim to the island. <br>\r\nThe trouble, however, was far from over. They did pass out on the beach, but when they woke up, she saw the natives standing over them. She looked over toward her companion to see a spear sticking out of him. As if that wasn't enough, they started to drag her toward their village. Once there, they stood her up and stripped her naked. Never in her life had she felt so scared. <br>\r\nHer ordeal was still far from done. The natives then grabbed her arms and legs and carried her toward a big gate. She figured it would be some sort of sacrifice and started to sob uncontrollably. She saw the gates open to reveal a stage with restraints. She was cognizant the whole time as they brought her onto the stage and restrained her. She noticed that everyone was on the wall behind her banging a gong and shouting \"KONGA!\" If she thought that was frightening, what came next would be a nightmare.<br>\r\nShe felt the ground shake, saw the trees move, and heard a loud roar. What she saw was the form of a giant. Unlike the natives, he was white and naked. His chest was chiseled, his penis halfway down his thigh but erecting quickly. He reached toward her and pulled her away the restraints. </span></div></div>",

She figured that a few days of solitude would be just the thing to ease her nerves. Little did she anticipate the nightmare coming her way.<br>\r\nHaving disconnected her radio, she did not know of the impending tsunami until she saw it on the horizon. When she snapped out of her shock, she decided to abandon ship. Being a strong swimmer, she figured her best chance- whatever little that may have been- was to leave the boat and take a chance in the waves. If she got lucky, she would wash up on dry land and revive her. She then jumped overboard and started to swim against the tsunami. The last thing she remembered was the wave taking the yacht with it.<br>\r\nShe did wake up on dry land, but not anywhere civilized. Through her groggy eyes, she saw the outlines of island natives standing over her. She soon noticed that she was scooped up and taken to their village. Once there, she was stripped of what little clothes she had and was led toward a gate barely bigger than the natives.<br>\r\nWhen the gates were opened, she saw a platform about as high as the wall that came with the gate. She figured that this was some sort of sacrificial altar, so she started to resist. However, she didn't have the strength to put up a real fight. When they brought her to the top of the altar, she stopped fighting long enough for them to tie her arms to the pillars on either side of her. Once tied, the natives fell back and closed the gate. At this point, she heard a gong and the natives chanting \"Konga!\" Yeah, this was a sacrifice. If she only knew.<br>\r\nFirst, she heard some dull thumps. Then, she heard a series of deafening roars. Next, the trees in front of her started to fall. The next sight sent her into a complete frenzy. Before her stood two giant people, a male and a female. The female was as dark as the natives, but much taller with a figure to die for. The male, however, was white, but was chiseled and had a penis that hung almost down to his knee but getting erect quickly.<br>\r\nThe two giants grabbed their tiny prize at the same time, breaking the restraints.

Emily has long bleach blond hair, blue eyes, smooth fair skin, and a slender body with curvy hips. She has perky DD size breast, which are all natural, and she has a nice, firm round ass. She is wearing a skimpy white bikini. Her husband of 14 years has short lit-brown hair, baby blue eyes, and he is clean-shaven, with lightly tanned skin. He has a lean, well-defined body, a nearly hairless chest, and he is well hung, with a nice ass too. He is dressed in a dark blue swimsuit. The Caucasian couple was on board a medium size luxury boat for a couple\u2019s retreat. Hundreds of couples from the Seattle Washington area were board the ship having a good time, when all the sudden the ship sank quickly for some unknown reason. The next thing they knew they both floated a shore here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When they finally awaken, they wonder if anyone else made it off the ship in time. As they stand up on the sand, they have a look around, and are amazed by what they saw. They see hug trees that are as big as skyscrapers all around them, and a huge cloudy mist that surrounded the island. The next thing that happens is a group of dark brown skin natives running out of the jungle and pointing spears at them. The couple is then grabbed and taken to their village, which is surrounded by a huge wall. The couple is taken out of the village, put on a huge rock; there are four strong trees next to them. The natives then use long green vines, and they tie the couple\u2019s arms to the trees, only leaving their legs free. With the couple secure, the natives gently rip Emily\u2019s bikini off her lovely body, and they yank Jason\u2019s swimsuit off him by his legs. The now completely naked white couple helplessly looks on as the natives sound a loud horn, and dance in the safety of their village yelling \"Konga, Konga, Konga.\" The couple knows that they are about to be sacrificed to something, but what? The couple hears a loud growl and the trees being moved around. They cringe with terror, shame, and modesty when they see a giant naked black woman charging them. She must have been well over 70 feet tall, maybe even taller. Konga reaches out, gently unties them, and grabs the both of them. Konga is holding the naked couple together in one hand.

As the ship gets closer, the only two people on board are twenty-year-old David and nineteen-year-old Amber, whom are both on the deck dancing together to some music in their skimpy swimsuits.  Amber is dressed in a skimpy white bikini, while David is dressed in a speed-o like, blue swimsuit. One romantic gesture leads to another, and the young Caucasian couple begins to passionately kiss each other. As they kiss, we see that the young couple has blonde hair of various shades. David has short, bleach blond hair, while Amber has long, curly, strawberry blond hair. David is a clean-shaven, and extremely handsome young man, who still has a youthful looking face. Amber is a gorgeous young woman, who also has a youthful look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they kiss each other, and move their hands slowly over each others smooth, lightly tanned skin, David slowly unties Amber\u2019s bikini top. Amber\u2019s top slowly falls to the floor, exposing her soft, natural, but perky large D cup breasts to the world. David then unties her bikini bottoms, and they slowly fall to the deck near her bare feet, revealing her neatly trimmed blond bush, and her fantastic, round yet firm ass to the world as well. David eagerly looks over Amber\u2019s now completely naked body with his baby blue eyes, with great fascination. As she stands there seductively, he looks over her slender, 5\u20199 body and he loves what he sees. He especially loves her curvy hips, and her well-toned body. A minute later, Amber seductively, yet slowly kisses, and rolls her tong over David\u2019s hairless, well-toned chest, while yanking his swimsuit down to his bare feet. She loves how he smells, as he steps out of them revealing to the world his well-hung cock and balls, as well as his nice firm ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tossing their swimsuits aside, the completely nude, young white couple lies down on the forward deck, and begins to passionately kiss each other, while masturbating each other at the same time. After a few minutes of that, the young couple eagerly 69 each other for a few minutes more. A few minutes later they both stop, and David sits down on a soft, armless chair, with his long, thick, rock hard, wet cock standing up in the moist air. Amber smiles, stands up, and she seductively gets on top of him. As she sits on his crotch, and they romantically kiss each other, they could feel David\u2019s rock hard cock invading Amber\u2019s wet hungry pussy. As Amber rides David like a cowgirl in heat, their ship passing right by Skull Island, and close to land. They are also going through a thick, white fog, which has only made the young naked couple even more sexually aroused. As they continue to have sex on their ship, in the fog, something huge, something bisexual is now eagerly watching them both.</span></div></div>",
