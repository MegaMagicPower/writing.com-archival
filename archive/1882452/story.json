Tiana and Naveen had heard from the fat, trumpet playing alligator named Louis that she was the one that could help them become humans again. He was also the only one who knew where she lived. At first he didn't want to help them get there because it was scary, but after Naveen said too him that if he got transformed into a human as well he decided to lead them to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis felt a bit stupid not figuring out this himself. He loved playing jazz and wanted to be able to play it for the humans. They had always been scared for him (being that he was an alligator.), and never really letting him show them what he could do. He knew that if he only was human they would love him. He also knew that Mama Odie had all kind of magical abilities. So he couldn't get why he hadn't visited her himself before? 'Anyway' he thought, 'Now it's my time. I'm going to become a human and fulfil my dream.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached Mama Odie's home (that was the wreck of a boat in a tree.) Mama Odie told Tiana and Naveen how they must 'dig a little deeper' and look for 'what they need instead of what they want.' She also sang it in a big song number with gospel singing birds. After that it was Louis turn to talk to Mama and tell her what he needed help with. He told her he to needed to be human so he could 'play with the big boys'. But all Mama Odie said was that he to needed to 'dig a little deeper' and he would find everything he needs. He wanted to ask her some more but he saw that she had sat down in her chair and fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis didn't really get what she had said to him, and thought about something different. During the time he had spent here at Mama Odie's home he had seen that she has a big stick that worked like a magic wand. In the musical number he saw her use it to turn her pet snake Juju into a dog, pig, cow and goat. He had also seen that she had a bathtub that was filled with gumbo. He had seen that it to had magical powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you coming with us Louis?' Tiana and Naveen asked Louis. 'We need to get back to New Orleans before midnight if we are going to break the curse.' 'Yes I'm coming soon.' Louis replayed. 'I just need to do a quick thing. You can go first. I reach up with you quickly.' 'Okay.' The frogs said and they leaved the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least one of those things should be nice shortcut for me to reach my goal of becoming a human.' Louis though for himself. 'All I need to do is to be quick and stealthy while she's asleep.' Louis thought looking at Mama Odie sleeping in her chair. 'But what magical item should I choose?</span></div></div>",

But if I want to take it without Mama Odie noticing it I have to be <i>quick and stealthy</i>'. But being an almost obese alligator made it pretty hard for Louis to be stealthy. For every step he took the floor would made cracking sounds, and he could also feel the whole boat house tilting a little because of his movements. But still he could see how Mama Odie just sat there snoring. 'Must be a really hard sleeper.' Louis thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many careful but noisy steps Louis was finally in reach for the stick. He saw how Mama Odie was holding it in a tight grip while sleeping. He leaned forward trying to reach it. But just as he was close enough to grab it, Mama Odie pulled it away from his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis looked up to her face and saw'</span></div></div>",

Try to steal something from someone that he had clearly seen had the ability to control magic didn't sound like such a great plan anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sweating and shivering by fear of what was going to happen to him now. Louis didn't do anything else but breathing heavily, Hoping that by standing still Mama Odie wouldn't be able to see where he was standing. But his hope was quickly crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So you tried to steal from me?' Mama Odie said. 'And now you think that by just standing still I wouldn't know you where still standing there. I can clearly <u>hear</u> that you're still here.' Louis made a nervous gulp in respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can hear you're a big fellow too,' Mama Odie continued. 'By how big sounds you're breathing makes, and by how your fat belly touches the ground every time you breathe out.' Louis stop breathing and looked down too see how close to the floor his stomach really was. He took and pulled it in a bit just too try to prove her wrong. (Even thought Mama Odie wouldn't be able to see any difference.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's too late to be silent now Mr. gator, I know where you stand and I will teach you lesson too make sure that you and you're fat greedy fingers never even thinks about stealing again!' Mama Odie yelled and throw a magical spell right against Louis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could now was to hope that for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell hits him and a big smoke cloud surrounds him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke disappears Louis is' </span></div></div>",

Did I hit you?' Mama Odie asked out to the silence. Louis thought of this as his way to escape from her, and started to act like if he had been hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, ooooooooh, ooooooooooooooooh!' Louis cried out in pain and rolled on the ground, holding his stomach like if he had been shot there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mama Odie could have seen now she would have died of laugh of Louise's bad overacting. He made so much effort in looking like he was hurt (forgetting that the woman he was doing it for was blind) that his screaming didn't sound so serious all the times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was faking his injuries Louis started to back toward the exit of the boat. Finally he reached to a part of the boat where the hull was missing. 'The swamp is just down there.' Louis thought. 'All I need to do now is to make a nice final, and then I can escape her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouis made sure to really act like this was the end for him, and finished by falling of the boat with a scream of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big splash everything went silent afterwards. Underwater Louis decided that the best thing to do now was swim back to the frog, and act like nothing happened when he was left with Mama Odie. He also decided to stay underwater while swimming for as long as he could hold his breath, just to stay hidden while near the boathouse. 'Even though she can't see I don't want to take any more risks with her.' Louis thought and started swimming away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her chair that she had been sitting the whole time Mama Odie could hear the big alligator swim away. When she couldn't hear him anymore, she let out a big laughter for herself. 'Ha, ha, ha. Oh my. I haven't heard such bad acting in all my life!

Looking up with his eyes Louis could see that all the noise of him trying to break free from the cursed thing had woken Mama Odie up from her sleep. \"Help!Iamstuckinthisthing!\" Louis tried to shout with his mouth being stuffed and force-feed by the gooey gumbo. \"I can hear that you couldn't let my gumbo be alone, you just had to take a small sip didn't you?\" She asked, sounding like she was expecting this exact thing to happen. Even thought Louis knew that she was blind he still gave a very limited nod in response. \"You are probably wondering what will happen to you now my fat friend?\" She asked, poking his gumbo filled belly, making him moan in pain a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one of two scenarios going on here.\" She said, with Louis listening carefully. \"Either I broke you free from this curse now and leave you with all this extra weight that you got, or I will let you eat it all and let you consume the magic that it contains and make you it's new <i>host</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Mama Odie let happen to Louis?</span></div></div>",

They jutted far out to the sides, further accentuating his pear shape. He watched with his own eyes (although his vision was a bit hindered by his huge, chubby cheeks) how his chest ballooned out into two round man boobs, each one as big as his head. His tail was a useless, fat triangle, sitting heavily on top of his monstrous rear end. His short, thick legs weren't long enough to lift his rotund, rounded rump, which in turn, dragged on the floor. His legs were spread far open to accommodate for the huge wrecking ball that was his belly, the thighs underneath, although unseen, were plump and blubbery. He couldn't take one step without having his thighs and belly rub together intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slow and steady, but his temporary weight gain had ceased...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say your body fits that greedy mentality now,\" Mama Odie commented on his new sheer size, \"It looks like you'll gain weight in small segments like that.

Taking a very wide step with one of its legs Bagheera caught a glimse of the big sagging belly that the creature spotted. It was so big and round that Bagheera almost got mesmerized by staring at it.

That was something Bagheera hadn't notice before but when he first saw Shere Khan earlier he had been taller then him. The fat had been hiding it some what but now he saw it clearly. The pounds started to pile on as Shere Khan's chins became thicker, his belly more hanging, and his butt wider. His legs started also become taller, and so did his waist. When he was done he looked like he had added another 100 pounds on his frame. His added muscles in legs and back helped him making moving the body so much more easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walked of Bagheera waited until he was absolutely sure he could get down wihtout being notice.

It was much more deeper then it looked like, since he had sank down at least two meters and still hadn't hit the bottom, and the second, much more important thing, was that you didn't need to drink the water for it to have effect. You only needed to be in contact with it, and that was something Bagheera was now experiencing first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was floating around he could feel his whole body starting to change.

They looked strong enough to be able to hold his weight. \"I guess not only animals gets bigger by this water.\" Bagheera thought as tried to get himself up, which prooved to be much harder then he thought concidering his new weight. After putting all four legs in place Bagheera counted to three and managed to lift himself up.

The branch was about as thick as his own legs, and surpristingly it held his weight. Not wasting any time Bagheera took and climbed branch after branch, until he reached the one that was going to be his ticket out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made himself ready to carefully walk out on it he heard the sound of Shere Khan almost being there, so not having much time to think Bagheera took of and tried to run across the branch.

Just as he jumped the branch gave away by his weight and feel to the ground. In midair Bagheera tired to make himself as long as possible to be able to reach for the edge, and luckily for him he did it. He only got half his body on it, but thanks to his belly holding so much weight it helped to keep him on the ground while dragging the rest of his body up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting up he turned around and saw Shere Khan entering the place once again, this time looking more furoius and terrifying by the fact that someone might have found his secret place and use it on themselfs.

Bahgeera found it harder to jump or even to run at all, he knew he was fat, but he knew he wasn't out of shape. Sometimes Bahgeera would get stuck in a log he thought he could fit into, so Baloo would have to break the log in half to let him free, this happened TWICE. Stones and tall plants were harder to doge as well for the panther, his now tubby paws would narrowly miss landing on the plant or rock, and would often end in a face plant or stubbed toe. <br>\r\nAfter thirty minutes of trecking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD, THUD, THUD.

He could become larger than the jungle, plains, AND desert for all we know!\" He took a second to calm himself down, \"You stay here, unless he finds you of course, but till then, DO NOT MOVE.\" <br>\r\nThen the panther, forgetting about his extra weight, tried to climb a tree next to the pair, making the tree snap in two and fall over, creating a loud BOOM, that Shere Kahn was destined to hear. <br>\r\nBahgeera eyed the tree with disgust, \"Oh come on Baloo, it WAS a small tree...\" Then,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD, THUD, THUD, THUD-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaloo looked at Bahgeera with worry in his eyes, then grabbed the big kitty with all his might and started to run.

Then after a while of tumbling through the forest-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD, THUD, THUD, \"I SEE YOU BALOO!\" A voice boomed from all the way across the forest, Baloo froze, he looked around and saw no orange, black, or white. <br>\r\n\"He must of gained more!\" Bahgeera exhaled, \"Yeah, about 500 extra!\" Baloo shouted, then he took foot again, running faster with the large panther in his arms. \"I can run you know!\" Bahgeera scolded, \"Just because I'm fat, doesn't mean I'm immobile!\" Baloo let Bahgeera down. \"Yeah, and it doesn't mean Kahn is either!\" <br>\r\nThe two dashed far until they didn't hear any roars or 'thuds'. The two were hot, sweaty, and exhausted. They walked for at least another half mile until-<br>\r\n\"Baggy, do you see what I see?!\" Baloo exclaimed excitedly.<br>\r\n\"What Baloo?! I'm not interested in another fern just so you know.\" Bahgeera cranking replied. <br>\r\n\"It's none of that, it's WATER!\" Baloo shouted as he cannonballed into the small pool. <br>\r\nBahgeera was splashed by the playful bear. <br>\r\n\"Wow, it's surprisingly deep in here, but it's very narrow. It could fit like, two animals at the maximum!\" Baloo took a big gulp of the water, and another, and another. \"Water has never tasted so good!\" The bear rejoiced.<br>\r\n\"Yes Baloo, it's water, now the more important thing we have to look out for his food! While you're lazing away, I'll be looking for some fresh fruit or meat or SOMETHING!\" Bahgeera, was not very happy at all with the bear's sudden laziness, he began to walk away in the other direction. He looked behind him to see the sloth-like bear. \"Is it just me, or has Baloo gained 50 pounds himself?!\" Bahgeera mumbled to no one in particular, \"Oh well, that's nothing some nice fruit can fix.

His only chance to get away would be to dive into the water, swim across the bottom of the pond, and hide behind some trees on the far side of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any more time, the black panther quickly held his breath and dove into the lake, which was just as deep as he had expected.

Where there were relatively straight lines on his haunches, some folds had developed - they weren't quite twice as thick, but they were noticeably fatter. The same went for his belly, as his small waist had expanded outward an easy six inches. Walking back to the pond, the big cat noticed just how big he had become - it was noticeable from the small of his back to his very cheeks. Bagheera was nowhere near the size of Shere Khan - the tiger naturally had a hundred pounds on him, and even with his new gain making up that ground, Bagheera still paled in comparison.

Looking to his right he saw a huge pile of banana peels from what was once whole bananas. And finally he looked straight down to confirm his guesses. He had been eating them all, and they where all in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been known for being a very well rounded orangutan before, but it was nothing compared to the belly he was sporting now. All of that eating and not moving had been a very good way for him to pack the pounds. Looking at it he could see that it looked to be at least three times the size it was before, and even when sitting down he could see it hanging down half a foot from his waist. To further confirm that it was his eyes playing him a trick he took and felt it with his one of his hands. Touching it felt soft and jiggly meaning that it wasn't even digested food anymore, but a part of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't move or say anything, he just sat there and marveled over the fact that it was his body. He hadn't even been thinking for how long he had been just sitting and eating, but it must a been a very long time considering he had never once before stopped and thought about it. Looking up he saw his loyal servants staring at him. He wondered what they thought of him right now. Did they still see him as their great leader, or was he now just a big slob taking up their space? Maybe he should just walk away from them, find a nice place to be lonely, and start consuming other fruits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" he thought. He had been doing this for too long already, and just moving to another place wasn't going to help it. And what about his servants? Would he just abandon them after all this time they had been loyal for him? He had learned to become great friends with almost all of them, and from what he saw from looking up earlier proved that they too where still his friends. They could have just leaved long ago and let him sit on his busted throne eating bananas, but from what he saw they where all still there. They where still there because they <i>cared</i>, and he was lucky to have such great and supporting friends. He had been depressed a long time now, but not any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants where wondering if something had hit the king inside since he was now just sitting there looking down, when all of a sudden he started to move again. Everyone became silent and watched as their king took and raised his head again. Looking out on his smaller army the king was silent at first, before first giving a smile, and then laughing. At first the monkeys thought that something was wrong with their king, but then they remembered that it was the same laugher that their king would give when he wanted to have fun. He was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king looked at his servants and then at his belly, and then started to play with for them. He was jiggling it with his hands, used it as a big drum to play on, and even got of his throne to do a little belly dance with it, and the servants loved it. This was the Louie they had been missing for a long time. The one that would solve all his problems by making jokes and throw parties. He was still very much fatter then his usual self, but they didn't care, they had missed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the monkeys to get into the old groove that they used to have, with King Louie being the center of it. They played music, ate fruit, and was overall having a great time. But for the King things wasn't over that easy. He had been in his sad state for a reason, and for him there was only one way for him to get it all behind him and move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that thing was...</span></div></div>",

In fact, they thought it was great. The lip loved to chow down like them, and more importantly, a more sated lion was a less dangerous lion. While Pumbaa was sure Simba would be their friend for life, Timon was still just the slightest bit paranoid. He wasn't exactly going to act on it, just keep an extra eye on the lion here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from a nap one day, Simba opened his eyes to find Timon and Pumbaa standing in front of him with giant grins on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys... what's up?\", the lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, Simba... we just found a mother lode of bugs!\", Pumbaa proudly exclaimed. \"Ya hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat,\" Simba said sheepishly, not wanting to admit he was sleeping off a mid-day snack beforehand. As he got up, the lion followed the meerkat and the warthog, who had already eagerly started wandering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took just a few minutes before Simba saw what they were talking about, and they weren't kidding. In front of them were three massive grubs, easily two feet long and just as wide. \"Can you believe these were just lying here?!\", Pumbaa said. \"Let's dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Timon replied. \"Let's make this more interesting! There are three grubs. If any of us can finish the whole thing before the others, they get an entire day of meals brought to them by the others!\" Pumbaa and Simba both felt that was fair, and the added challenge would make things more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach walked to their respective grub. \"Three, two, one, go!\" Timon yelled, and it was off to the races for the three, each tearing into their massive meals. Though they each had plenty of experience gorging themselves on grubs, these were a little different, very thick and fatty. Every bite was full of flavor, but took up plenty of room once swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes for Timon to tap out, the tiny meerkat hesitant to keep eating once he'd gotten about a third of the way through his grub. Meanwhile, Simba and Pumbaa were still going and going fierce. The warthog had the size, but Simba had the speed. His recent extra meals had taught him how to gulp a meal down fast, and even as he started feeling full past the halfway point, he knew he could keep eating until it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pumbaa, slightly bloated and uncomfortable, started to say something to Simba as he neared the end of the grub, he was surprised to hear the lion say \"done!\" Looking over, he had indeed finished the whole massive grub. His stomach was noticeably bloated, jutting out under him, and the young cat looked more than uncomfortable, but he managed to gloat just for a few minutes before the food coma set in. \"I'll take those meals tomorrow,\" he said, before he laid down with an oof. Full to bursting but with a satisfied smile on his face, he managed to add, \"I'll take a few of those for breakfast.\"</span></div></div>",

But before the two lionesses completely left the Pridelands, they stopped by the baobab <br>\r\ntree to see the shawman Rafiki. He gave them each a gourd to drink, like much of his potions, he said it would help <br>\r\nthem on their journey.<br>\r\nAs soon as they finished drinking the liquid, Sarafina and Nala thanked the baboon and left to continue on their <br>\r\nway. Rafiki had told them to head west and south to seek help in that direction but the help they find might not be <br>\r\nwhat they would expect. Mother and cub lionesses continued on their way for what seemed like three days, <br>\r\neating things here and there when they could find food, and they didn't notice right away until the third day that <br>\r\nthey're bodies were putting on weight despite the traveling they were doing. And they seemed to gain more <br>\r\nthan they ate. But they weren't shocked or afraid but rather found enjoyment and pleasure in the weight they <br>\r\nhad gained. Sarafina was now as big as a water buffalo but not yet as big as a hippo while Nala now was <br>\r\nas big as a baby hippo. They thought it was perhaps the potions that Rafiki had given them was the cause of <br>\r\ntheir surprising weight gain of body fat. And it wasn't just centered in one area of their body but all over their <br>\r\nlioness and lioness cub bodies, even their heads, faces, backs, legs, paws, necks, rumps, tails, torsos and <br>\r\nbellies. All over them was jiggly fat rolls and wobbly thick bulges of flab. And it seemed that they didn't have <br>\r\nno health related problems and didn't effect their walking mobility just yet. Likely not until their bellies did <br>\r\nfirmly press against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the third day, they found a small settlement with two man-made buildings. One looked like a <br>\r\nhuman dwelling and the other was likely for storing something. It was a surprise when a young human male <br>\r\nchild came up to them and motioned the two lionesses to follow. They hesitated at first then decided to follow <br>\r\nthe human child. He led them to the front of the storage building which was closed for now. Since it was <br>\r\nin the summer with both hot and rainy days, they were now at least under cover of human made shelter. <br>\r\nThere Sarafina and Nala spent the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next day, the human male child came out with his young adult father. And they didn't have dark <br>\r\nbrown skin color like the African tribes but a creamy tanned white color. The father unlocked the storage <br>\r\nbuilding and allowed both lioness and lioness cub inside. Once inside, both father and son began feeding <br>\r\nthe two fat lionesses slabs of herbivore prey meat and most of it was thick but the lionesses were hungry <br>\r\nagain and ate the slabs of meat anyway. The young adult human male introduced his name as Lionel then <br>\r\nintroduced his son's name as Leo. Feeding the two hungry lionesses lasted all day, with their bellies bloated <br>\r\nand filled with the slabs of meat. But Lionel and Leo stayed out there with Sarafina and young Nala in the <br>\r\nfood storage building to keep them company. Strangely enough, it was Leo that seemed to hear and <br>\r\nunderstand animal language and would hear what Sarafina and Nala said. So Lionel slept with Sarafina <br>\r\nand Leo slept with young Nala while the lionesses bloated stomachs digested the food they had eaten. All <br>\r\nfour of them hoped that this would last forever. There's no way of knowing what kind of result this feeding <br>\r\nwill have on both of Sarafina and Nala's fat bodies.</span></div></div>",

The <br>\r\nlionesses rumps also bulged and looked like mounds of piled sacks of doughy flab that wobbled and <br>\r\njiggled at the slighest touch. The tails of both lionesses had thickened even past the point of being <br>\r\nable to move, thick with rolls and stuck out of their bloated rumps and as thick as hippos. Their rumps <br>\r\nso fat anyway that the rumps firmly lay on the ground and pooled out some feet. Nala and Sarafina's <br>\r\nfat bodies were like giant blobs of pudding and just as wobbly as jello gelitan. The necks of both <br>\r\nlionesses had formed into ringing cascading rolls of flab that encircled around their heads and almost <br>\r\nabout to engulf their heads that are starting to sink back into the masses of their neck rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lionesses' heads, fat and bloated so much their heads also have rolls and bulges. Their face cheeks <br>\r\nhad bloated out round to the same round size as their fat heads are. Even their ears are fat. From their <br>\r\nchin pour down dozens of many flabby chin rolls that cascade down from their heads, down the middle <br>\r\nof their lower neck rolls, down their fat bloated front chests and spilling out onto the ground and pooling <br>\r\noutwards widely like flowing liquid lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, like yesterday, the two humans Lionel and Leo feed the lionesses the thick fatty hippo <br>\r\nmeat slabs, stuffing them and letting the lionesses feast on the hippo meat slabs more and more and <br>\r\nif one was to watch, they would visibly see Sarafina and Nala's bellies bulging out and up as they <br>\r\nwere being fed with more fatty hippo meat. Lionel and Leo soon got tired at midday and Lionel introduced <br>\r\ntwo conveyor belts, one for either lioness. All Lionel and Leo had to do was to keep the slabs of fatty <br>\r\nhippo meat loaded on them and the conveyor belts would deliver the each meat to both Nala and <br>\r\nSarafina's awaiting fat flabby maws. To the two humans surprise, Sarafina and Nala took each slab of <br>\r\nhippo meat in and swallowed them down whole. This was faster, so by the end of the day both Sarafina <br>\r\nand Nala were both each the bloated size of the round parts of a fully inflated hot air balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this went on for weeks, each time the lionesses got bigger and fatter, Lionel had to adjust the height <br>\r\nof the conveyor belts to each lioness. The lionesses simply continued to eat and eat, feeding and <br>\r\ngetting fatter and fatter.</span></div></div>",

Bring me another.\" he commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas once again obeyed instantly, bringing him another plump carcass, this time a zebra.

Let's start out from the beginning before Simba was born. Sarabi was pregnent with Simba and Mufasa has happy about it. It ment that he would have someone to be the future king when he was gone. Scar, was not too happy about. He felt that he didn't get anything that he wanted and his brother got had everything. This left Scar to eating his pain away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he he would go out hunting, he hunted for more they just one thing. He would ofter hunt for three things and eat them BY HIMSELF. Antelope, zebra, even a hippo once. All those animals evenually gone to his hips and his belly. Basically, Scar was now just a big bloated lion with a belly touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a reference on what he looks like. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/10843702/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/10843702...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Mufasa and Scar decided to walk and talk a bit.

Look like you gained quite a few pounds.\" Mufasa said patting his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little.\" Scar replied.<br>\r\n\"Ha. Look a you. You're close to a hippo.\" Mufasa said.<br>\r\n\"Watch it, brother.\" Scar said. \"So what did you wanted to talk about.<br>\r\n\"As you know, Sarabi is close to giving birth to my cub.\" Mufasa said.<br>\r\n\"When he grow up, I want him to be the future king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Scar's ears drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Future......king?\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. But only when he's older and my time is passed. I was hoping you would help with making him a good king as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was still in deep thought. In reality, HE wanted to be the next king to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a bit ahead of yourself? I mean, the cub isn't even born yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Still, I want him be one the greatest kings of this land. Great like father.\"<br>\r\n\"Father........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar decided to walk out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar.....where are you going?\"<br>\r\n\"I.....just need to get some \"me time\" for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar felt down about not being sad and angry at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Scar belly would continue to spread wider and bigger. It was actually getting a bit harder for him to walk now. Most of the time, all he would do is eat.

Your belly looks like it could fit a hippo.\" Mufasa protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar had some problems getting off his back. But he got up. Then he took a long look at himself.

I don't even think he does anymore.\" The older lion mumbled<br>\r\n\"No birthday?\" Simba seemed sorry for Scar. \"Poor Uncle Scar, I'm gonna go say happy birthday!\" From sorrowful to excited the young cub took off, but was stopped by his father. <br>\r\n\"No, you must NEVER visit Scar, especially on his birthday. He would get really mad at you Simba, and I don't think we would like that.\" Mufasa nobly trotted past his son to Zazu who was patiently waiting for him during half of the conversation.<br>\r\n\"What about Scar, Sire?\" Zazu yelped<br>\r\n\"Now what's the morning report for today, Zazu?\" Mufasa ignored.<br>\r\n\"Well there has been a flatulence contest between the elephants and hippos, eventually it even scared some warthogs away, the cheetahs are in a spot, of course the meerkats are below it all, the termites keep biting back at the rhinos, but the rhinos have a point, oh long story short, THERE'S BEEN A HYENA SIGHTING! Near the hippo-elephant gaining grounds, Sire!\" The small bird sat on Mufasa's head.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Simba, we'll talk later. Until then, your mother will watch you.\" Mufasa then charged off with Zazu.<br>\r\nSimba frowned. \"But I wanna-\"<br>\r\n\"Simba Honey,\" Sarabi's voice was heard in the main den of Pride rock near Simba. <br>\r\nWith no hesitation, Simba began to head North, in the direction of Scar's kingdom. Or at least his dad had once explained to him in fables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of traveling, Simba stood in awe as he saw a giant shadowy den before him, it must of been bigger than ten elephants stacked on top of one another. <br>\r\nSimba stepped inside \"H-hello?\" He whispered <br>\r\nJust then three eyes cornered Simba, \"WeMre gonna be eating tonight!\" a female voice laughed as it eyed the young lion. <br>\r\n\"You look like your a little bit...lost...\" A male voice chuckled. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, HAHAHA!\" Another male voice hysterically cackled. Then hundreds more laughs were heard, then thousands, then millions. The eyes surrounded Simba, glowing in absolute hunger. One nipped at his ear, the little lion clawed back but to no avail of finding the biter. <br>\r\nSomething knocked the wind out of him, pinning him to the floor, it's eyes glimmered in the dark of the cave. And Simba was face-to-face with a hideous, slobbering, disgusting hyena. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, get him Tofauti!\" A voice snarled in glee. The female hyena who was pinning Simba down was a young one, about his age, she had golden eyes and a blacker pelt than the rest of the beasts she was surrounded with, and did Simba see a hint of-beauty in her face? No. Couldn't be. All hyenas were monstrous. <br>\r\nJust then- <br>\r\n\"QUIIIIIEET!\" Shouted a voice. All hyenas stood clear. Tofauti turned to look at the sound which gave Simba an open window to escape, but he didn't. <br>\r\n\"NO ONE SHALL TOUCH THE PRIDE-WALKER. HE IS MINE!\" It yelled again.<br>\r\n\"Aww, nice try Tofauti, better luck next time, you'll kill one someday.\" The same hyena who had introduced her, chimed. Tofauti stepped off Simba and started to walk away with her seemingly older sibling, she looked back and smiled at him. Or maybe it was a snarl. Either way Simba felt a bit charmed. All other hyenas fled to their 'positions'. Some lit flint to create fire, others picked up fanning leaves, some just went home. But no one prepared him for who they were working for, as soon as all the torches went up, he saw something that resembled an orange-black seven story blob. <br>\r\nThe young lion was greeted with an orange ball of fur that seemed to be a HUMONGOUS swollen stomach. It was bigger than five elephants. It scraped stone the walls and all, Simba must of only been 1/87 of the belly itself. Simba poked it, it didn't ripple like his own belly did when he poked it, it seemed, stuck.<br>\r\nThe small lion tried to see what was past the round ball of fur that was the huge stomach, but all he saw was another two bubbles sticking up out of the back of the monstrous gut. It was too far to see what they were, but from what Simba saw, they're was a tiny line sticking out of both of them. It was a tail. It was so small, Simba had to squint to even guess it was one anyways. There were two tree trunks on either side of the blob, something was underneath them but Simba didn't know what, then the blob roared loudly (or burped he didn't know) at least fifty hyenas lifted (with a bunch of struggle) the orange tree trunk. Underneath was the tiniest paw Simba has ever seen. Simba gasped. <br>\r\n\"What are you?!\" The lion yelled so the blob could hear him. \"Are you an elephant?!\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\" The blob's voice bellowed. \"I WISH I WAS, IF I WAS AN ELEPHANT I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE AT BECOMING THE WORLD'S BIGGEST KING, I WOULD BE BIGGER THAN PRIDE ROCK, AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE LARGEST THING IS A PLACE OF ROYALTY AND POWER! AND TODAY IS THE ELEPHANT-HIPPO GAINING WAR! I COULD BECOME HUGEEEEE!\" The blob shook.<br>\r\n\"But, what are you?!\" Simba asked again.<br>\r\n\"I, AM A LION! JUST LIKE YOU SIMBA!\" <br>\r\nSimba gasped, he tried to speak but-<br>\r\n\"I KNOW YOUR FATHER, THAT'S HOW I KNOW YOU! WHY ARE YOU HERE?!\" <br>\r\n\"Um, I wanted to tell my Uncle Scar-\"<br>\r\n\"I AM YOUR UNCLE SCAR! WHAT DO YOU WISH TO ASK ME?!\" <br>\r\n\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!\" Simba joyfully yelled to his much bigger uncle.<br>\r\nScar stood still for a moment then-<br>\r\n\"NOW SIMBA,\" he slowly spoke again. \"IF YOU WANT ME TO REALLY HAVE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PLEASE, I WOULD LOVE MY NEPHEW HERE TO CELEBRATE WITH, BUT TO COME TO THE PARTY, YOU NEED AN INVATATION BUT I DONT SEE ONE ON YOU!\"<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Simba screeched. \"Uncle Scar, I can take you to the hippo-elephant gaining war! Just follow me!\" Simba spun around to look at the WAY PAST immobile ocean of fat his uncle had transformed into. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, I have an idea...\" Simba said thoughtfully. <br>\r\nAfter hours of building a rock to budge Scar out of his place, it finally worked, and the lion-whale started to roll down a slope, Simba moved out of the way just in time, and Scar began to roll.<br>\r\nWhile his blimp-sized relative was tumbling down slopes the hyenas built, he saw better views of him. Like Simba saw those two massive bubbles he saw earlier were his buttcheeks, each one jiggled every time it moved. He also saw his uncle's sunken in head once or twice, though it took a keen eye to even see the small indent on his body that indicated he even had a head. Scar's eyes were closed due to the amount of fat that flowed in through his face and the rest of his body, two gargantuan cheeks blocked Scar from seeing ever again, they sloshed as he tumbled, making Simba see glimpses of the face Scar apparently had. <br>\r\nA greasy black mane dripped down from Scar's small head to his buttcheeks and tiny worm-sized tail that followed the elephant of his rear. The black fur around his head looked like it hadn't been groomed in years, it surrounded the tan-lion's face in a massive cluster, bursting out in the biggest hair ball the Simba had ever seen. It created a thick line leading into the lion's gluttony-caused buttocks. Simba hadn't noticed, but most of Scar's mane had grown out of control and was swallowing the fattest lion's body, all except for his bursting belly which was 80% of him, the other 20% was his fur-covered butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the duo approached the hundreds of morbidly obese hippos and elephants ahead, Scar began to panic. <br>\r\n\"SIMBA, IF ONE OF THOSE CREATURES SEES ME, I'LL BE BANISHED TO THE JUNGLE FOR LIFE, YOU MUST MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN ELEPHANT, SINCE MY GIRTH IS CLOSER TO MATCHING ONE OF THOSE PLANETARY PACHYDERMS!\" Thankfully Scar hit a rock and stopped, butt in the air, and balancing on his circular yet blobby gut. <br>\r\n\"I MUST LOOK LIKE ONE OF THEM!\" <br>\r\nNearby Simba saw a patch of gray-muddied water, and a few white plants he could carve into tusks, large flower petals were nearby as well. <br>\r\nSimba knew he was gonna use those, Simba realized Scar was too round for an elephant. Simba gathered the petals and white tusk-plants, but he was concerned about his uncle's shape. <br>\r\n\"Uncle Scar, you hafta get blobbier, they won't suspect you as much if your blobby! They're all stuck on their backs, hopefully we can still roll you after this...\"<br>\r\n\"BUT SIMBA, THEY WILL SUSPECT YOU AS WELL, WE MUST GROW, TOGETHER!\" <br>\r\nReluctantly Simba accepted, it was for his beloved uncle after all. <br>\r\nThen, Scar's gut sounded louder. <br>\r\n\"Uncle Scar are you hungry?!\" Simba questioned as he jumped on many rocks above him to jump on the blob's large rump which was much closer than his stomach.<br>\r\n\"OH SIMBA, IM ALWAYS HUNGRY, BUT THIS IS HOW I CALL MY FATTEST HYENAS!\" The large stomach growl carried throughout the land.<br>\r\nAfter a while Simba peered over the hill to see many obese hyenas slowly trotting down to greet their big master.<br>\r\n\"Master, what may we do for you?!\" The largest hyena spoke. <br>\r\n\"FETA, FEED ME TILL I BECOME A BLOB TO JOIN THE ELEPHANT-HIPPOS OVER THERE, PAINT ME LIKE ONE AS WELL, AND MAKE MY NEPHEW HERE LIKE A HIPPO, BY LOOKS AND BY FAT!\" <br>\r\nScar demanded. <br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Feta replied and then some hyenas began to enter Scar's open mouth, they squeezed through just barely. Scar let out many gluttonous noises as they entered his maw. Scar creaked forward as he was slowly becoming more blobby. <br>\r\nSimba on the other hand was force-fed dead zebras, dead antelope, and even a hippo. <br>\r\nThen Simba felt some swelling himself. <br>\r\nAnd by the looks of it, both Scar and Simba would pass as elephants or hippos in a heartbeat. </span></div></div>",

Scar had become so blobby and so large that his stomach erupted with fat across the ground. It almost touched the elephant-hippo gaining grounds. Scar's face was coated with his dirty fur and fat. His face cheeks swallowed his face to the point of him not seeing anything ever again. Somewhere, Scar's face was present, but sadly, no one would see it again. That lead the glutton of a lion to never speak again, his cheeks were too fat to do so, he let out massive burps and loud grunts/groans though. Speaking of fat cheeks; his butt soared into the air, almost demolishing the rocky mountain behind him, it was his second greatest asset, two gargantuan buttcheeks, spreading across the plains, they would probably be half of Mt Kilimanjaro now. Both buttcheeks jiggled and bounced with pure fat overload. His tail was nowhere to be seen, the two black furry cheeks farted often and loudly. <br>\r\nScar's blobby legs, immobile with fat, sat on either side of him, welcoming his newest and greatest feature. His stomach. It stretched out for miles upon miles, gurgling with sheer hunger and gluttony. Scar was badly painted to look like an elephant, and he did look like one too. The fattest one in the herd was probably a little fatter than Scar. <br>\r\nAnd on top of this massively-inflated beast. Was massively-inflated Simba. <br>\r\nSimba had taken quite the gain as well, sitting on Scar's gassy buttocks, he also rippled with pure fat. Now immobile. Simba really did look like a hippo now. Fake tusks and all. He could probably be mistaken for an adult male. Simba's gut was now rounded like Scar's before the six hour period of gaining. But he was a lot smaller than Scar before. <br>\r\nA massive hippo trudged towards the two blobs. It was definitely the smallest adult out of the herd. But was obese like the rest. <br>\r\nAnd it said-</span></div></div>",

Also, she's still just a friend.\"<br>\r\n\"I hope it stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the said, they were on their way home to their family.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the morning and Kovu just got up. He was still a little chubby from yesterday, but he still was as hungry as ever. For breakfast, the lions were able to hunt down a zebra. Since they had to share the zebra with everyone, Kovu didn't really get to have much. But he was ok with that, since he know where to get more food if he is still hungry. After his small breakfast, he walked over to Vitani to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vitani.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"What is it, Kovu?\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n\"Let's head over to the oasis.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"You really want to go again?\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I mean the fruits and berries are not meat, but it's still food.\" Kovu said. \"Not to mention, I'm still pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"Figures that you would, tubby.\" Vitani said chuckling.<br>\r\n\"Watch it sis.\" Kovu said a little ticked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kovu and Vitani go back to the oasis and Kiara was there waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you two.\" Kiara said greeting her friends.<br>\r\n\"Hey Kiara.\" Kovu said. Vitani just waved.<br>\r\n\"So do you to want to play?\" Kiara asked.<br>\r\n\"I...would prefer to eat. I'm really hungry.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Ah. So you're here to eat again?\" Kiara asked.<br>\r\n\"He's been a bit of a pig lately.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Kovu shouted angrily at his sis.<br>\r\n\"Heehee!\" Giggled Kiara. \"It's ok that you like to eat Kovu. It's just healthy.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Now if you excuse me.....\" Kovu then left Vitani and Kiara to get some fruit.<br>\r\n\"That's my brother thinking about his stomach.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"So Vitani, do you want to play?\" Kiara asked.<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could....for a while.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vitani and Kiara played, Kovu went to stuff his face with some of the fruits from some of the trees. Kovu knew that fruit was not better than eating zebra or other types of meat, but the fruit was not bad. So Kovu enjoy eating more of it. He ate a few striped melons, some bananas, and some other tropical style fruit. He continue to gorge on more and his belly continue to grow a bit more and more. After a while, Kiara and Vitani were done playing and Kovu was just relaxing by a tree with half a coconut as a drink with a bamboo straw in his paw and a full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.\" Kovu said. \"I hope it's like this when I'm king.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha! You be king?\" Kiara said overhearing him.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I could be a good king.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Well you defientely have the hunger of one.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Good one, Vitani.\" Kiara said high fiving each other.<br>\r\n\"Since when did you two became best friends?\" Kovu asked.<br>\r\n\"Since you were stuffing your gut.\" Vitani said. \"So are you ready? We got to get back.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fine.\" Kovu said not to happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Kovu and Vitani said goodbye to Kiara again and heading back to the outlands. While they were walking, Vitani took a good look at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have to say, you are REALLY letting yourself go.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"So I'm a little bigger? So what?\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"A little?\" Vitani said know it wasn't just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is, Kovu was really fatter. Not only was his belly close to touching the ground, but his legs were thicker, his body was pudgier, and his face was puffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So I may be overeating now. Like I said, I rather be fat than skinny anyway.\" Kovu said prideful.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but sooner or later, you might end of hippo size.\" Vitani said poking his belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like you are that skinny anymore.\" Kovu replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani was nowhere as big as Kovu, but her belly did extended a bit more than it use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe I have some small pudge, but it's not like yours.\" Vitani said. \"So watch out with all your weight.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk more, they happen to run into something. To their surprise, they find.......</span></div></div>",

This is quite lucky.\" Vitani said. \"Guess we better carry this to the others.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Kovu said halting his sister. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n\"If we bring this to the other lions, how much will be left for us?\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Are you saying we should eat this ourselves?\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah.\" Kovu said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"But you just ate.\" Vitani shouted.<br>\r\n\"So. This is ACTUAL meat.\" Kovu said. \"We should let this slide.\"<br>\r\n\"But the WHOLE antelope?\" Vitani shouted out.<br>\r\n\"Come on. I think we could handle it. I know I can.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Kovu would never let this go, she had no choice but to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But remember, this was YOUR idea.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two cubs dig into the antelope. Vitani was only hungry enough to eat the hind legs of the antelope. Kovu however, ate way more than the legs. He ate parts from the chest, flank, and face areas. Heck, he ate practicely all of the antelope. He now had an even bigger belly now, touching the ground and making him a bit wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUURRPP!' Belched Kovu. \"So full. But it was worth it.\"<br>\r\n\"You really are a pig.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Haha! Guess I am.\" Kovu said patting his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the eating done, Kovu and Vitani finally went back home.</span></div></div>",

Kovu and Vitani are still keeping everything secret from Zira and the other outlanders. But keeping it a secret for so long may not last. I mean, Kovu was already getting pretty big before, but now, he was getting quite large. All the feasting for the fruits and some zebras wasn't making him any smaller. The same can be said about Kiara and Vitani. They weren't as fat as Kovu, but they were both defientely chubbier. Currently, Kovu was in the Outlands home just laying down. That is, until his stomach growled. So he knew what that meant. So he went of to get his sister, who was napping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vitani! You ready to go?\" Kovu said to his sleepy sister.<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. Your belly is growling again?\" Vitani said getting up.<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" Kovu said smiling.<br>\r\n\"*sign* Alright. The fruit is fine and all, but you got to control your hunger, bro.\" Vitani said to him.<br>\r\n\"Like you are one to talk.\" Kovu said poking his chubby sister.<br>\r\n\"Don't poke me.\" Vitani shouted. \"I've been hanging with you. Of course I was gonna gain a pound or two.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha! Excuses. Excuses.\" Kovu said and laughed.<br>\r\n\"You know. With the weight we both gain, both mom and the other lions will start asking questions.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"I think we will still be fine. I don't think mom cares much about our extra poundage.\" Kovu explained. \"Otherwise, she would have said something.\"<br>\r\n\"True, but what about Nuka?\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Nuka is suppose to watch the both of us.\"<br>\r\n\"He can barely watch himself. I mean, look at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu and Vitani then turn to their older brother. Nuka was currently scratching himself,....from termites,.....again. Really, he was not in a \"watching\" mood, nor was he respondsible to watch anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Let's go.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once again, they headed to the oasis. Kiara(who was as chubby as Vitani) was already waited for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Kiara said greeting them.<br>\r\n\"Hey Kiara.\" Said Kovu and Vitani.<br>\r\n\"It looks like weight has gotten to you too.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My mom has been on me about that. But my dad doesn't seem to mind.\" Kiara said.<br>\r\n\"At least the two of us are not like Kovu.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Heehee. Yeah. He's close to a pig than lion now.\" Kiara said.<br>\r\n\"Watch it you two.\" Kovu said a little ticked. \"I don't need to listen to you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu walked away to find some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he goes again.\" Vitani said. \"Always thinking with his belly.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey. That gives me an idea.\" Kiara said.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What kind of idea?\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n\"Heehee. Do you want to have some fun with Kovu?\" Kiara asked Vitani.<br>\r\n\"Depends on what you mean by....fun?\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Well....we could....\" Kiara then whispers to Vitani what idea she had in mind.

His newfound weight made walking more difficult, his legs brushed against each other causing him to waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Kiara came back to check on him, she was shocked at Kovu's size, she had to ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happend, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i'm great, I love it here.\" Kovu replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Kiara said, pointing at his oversized belly, \"do you want to go back to Pride Rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I need a rest anyway,\" Kovu replied waddling beside his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reach Pride Rock and Kovu lied down on his fat stomach and went to sleep in the den, Kiara lay beside her tubby friend as the sun descend over the horison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was probably about as big as he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be my dream meal.\" Timon thought, as he thought of how to eat this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne way he always enjoy eating his worms was to swallow them whole and then let them wriggle around in his belly, but with this enormous one that might not be so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily he had learnt a secret trick to make the worms do as he wanted. By taking a bite of a special flower (that was containing a very strong smell), he would give his mouth a very strong scent that would make the worms want to crawl right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste of the flower was pretty awful, but Timon knew it would all be worth it for when the worm would come for the smell in his breath. After eating it, he just laid down on the ground, and just wait for the worm to come to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was breathing out (and letting the smell spread out through the air.) the worm picked up the smell, and started heading towards the source. As it came close to Timon's mouth instead of getting scared, it got only more interested as it's new \"home\" seemed to be both warm and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid on his stomach Timon could feel the big worm entering his mouth. Trying to contain himself and not bite down into it, Timon let the worm find it's way through his mouth and down his throat. (He at least had to give the worm a few tastes from his tongue as it went down.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the one end of the worm entering his stomach, and still he had the other end of it still outside of him! This made Timon wonder if he would even be able to contain it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he swallowed down more and more of the worm he had to turn around, and lay on his back in order to put less pressure on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much swallowing and stuffing Timon had the last of the worm past his lips, and he could close his mouth and \"gulp\" one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he could see that his small body looked really stretched. He was so full that he could barley move from his current position, and  his skin being so thin that you could see the white worm moving down in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I feel as stuffed as a sausage!\" The meerkat though as he felt himself shake around a little, from the worm inside trying to get out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was feeling so satisfied with himself he notice that someone has been watching him while he ate his meal, but who?</span></div></div>",

The morbidly obese meerkat gasped as he tried to get up. But he couldn't. Timon groaned and flailed in place, but even his arms were heavier and harder to move now. He was gaining weight at a medium-speed. Timon started to feel the chocolate bubbling inside of him and swelling throughout his body.

For now her fat head was at level with the chocolate lake's liquid, but her fat head was sicking more and more back into the ringing mass of her many neck rolls as she gluttonously drank and sucked in the chocolately liquid.There was not an inch where her fat blob of a body was now covered over by jiggling flabby rolls that seemed to wobble endlessly as Nala fattened. Timon could even hear the lioness's loud gluttonous gulps and sucks. Even as her fat bloated face cheeks and chin rolls poured out of the entrance to her cavernous neck rolls. Her legs were like puddles of spreading masses of flab and blubber even as they bloated with more fat and the lower parts of her legs spilling down her sides and pooling outwards, as did her chin rolls out in front of her while her fat bloated face cheeks blimped out on both sides of her pooling chin rolls. Her rump cheeks bugled out behind her like mounding hills. While her tail thickened with rolls of fat itself, her back fat of rolls piles up higher with Timon on top. It seemed that Nala had saved him but she was taking all the weight gaining liquid chocolate for herself and she was rapidly fattening all over her body, more wide than high. And between gluttonous sucks and gulps, he could hear Nala's moans of pleasure she made as she fattened. \"MORE, MORE! FATTER, FATTER! MORE ROLLS, MORE FLAB, MORE FAT ALL OVER! MOOOOOOORE!\" And by the looks of it, Nala was only taking up a quarter of the weight gaining chocolate liquid lake.....but she was far from done. At the rate of how her body was fattening rapidly, Timon guessed Nala would take up all of the chocolate liquid lake in no time soon at all. However, the hyenas saw this, got scared and ran away, fearing for their lives if the massive blob of fur would smother and crush them underneath its ever expanding radius like oozing liquid lava.</span></div></div>",

His mane had mostly grown in, with just a patch or two looking a bit shabby, and his body had developed into its lithe form, somewhat lanky as his all-bug diet still wasn't quite enough to support his still-growing nature. He had been spending time with Pumbaa, wandering the jungle, when the warthog mentioned he hadn't seen Timon for a few hours. The two of them decided to split up and find out where the meerkat had gone. As he walked, the young lion saw the hyenas wandering away from somewhere quickly, laughing to themselves, and he knew something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReversing the hyenas' steps, Simba quickly discovered the chocolate fountain, and at first he had no idea what he was looking at, at least until he saw Timon splashing under the waterfall. While the meerkat was enjoying himself, all but his head and arms were underwater (or under chocolate, to be precise), and he thought the meerkat was struggling and getting pulled under the waterfall's tides. \"Don't worry, Timon, I'm coming!\", the lion yelled, as he took a running dive into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Simba had no idea that the chocolate was thicker and more viscous than normal water, so he was taken aback when he landed with a SPLAT! and knocked the wind out of himself. This led to the lion doing what he thought the meerkat was doing, flailing around and drinking some of the chocolate in the process. By the time Simba had caught his breath, he came to a new realization, that the chocolate was delicious, and he started taking sips, then gulps, as he recovered and swam over to Timon under the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timon, are you OK?\", the lion said. \"Are you kidding, Simba? I feel great right now! In fact, I challenge you! Swim over here under the waterfall and let's see who can drink the longest before needing air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure, if you really want to,\" the lion replied, maneuvering under the waterfall and getting in position. \"3, 2, 1, go!\", Timon said, and the two started gulping down the chocolate as fast as they could. About a minute later, Simba finally sputtered to a gasp and swam out of the water. \"Uncle!\", he said, \"you win!\" The meerkat, gloatingly, started swimming onto shore, gloating all the way. \"I knew I could beat you!\", he said, as he slowly pulled his massive self out of the chocolate. To Simba's shock, his little meerkat friend wasn't so little anymore. In fact, he was absolutely massive, fat puffing out from every angle and rounding almost every visible body part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't enough, the lion was even more shocked when he had difficulty climbing out of the liquid himself. Looking himself over, he was easily 100 pounds heavier, if not more, his flanks twice their size and his entire underbody hanging a foot lower than it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this great?\", Timon said.</span></div></div>",

He could move freely still with no issues somehow and happily laid down under a nearby tree. And... hakuna matata, of course... why worry about this? Tons of food and extreme comfort. What's so bad about that? \"Well, yeah, this isn't bad at all,\" Simba started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you agree! Stick around for a little while, won't you? I'm feeling sleepy from all this food and I'm going to take a nap,\" Timon said. \"Let me know if anything happens or anyone comes by.\" Almost immediately, the meerkat fell into a food coma, his body needing all of his energy to digest his massive belly full of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba decided to wander around the area of the waterfall, but didn't see anyone or anything. He went upstream to see if he could find its source, but he found the large stream stemmed straight from a hole in the ground on the edge of the jungle. Try as he might, the lion couldn't find anything more. The hole came from underground, it looked natural, he had no explanation for it. He walked back to the bottom of the waterfall and bent down to take just a sip from the chocolate to quench his thirst. Instead, it just reminded him of how good the drink tasted. It took him only a few seconds to take another sip, then another. Then, throwing abandon to the wind, Simba decided to dive head-first into the chocolate, taking in a few mouthfuls as he swam under the surface and back up. For a minute he swam back and forth, drinking as he went, before finding himself under the waterfall itself. He treaded in place and let the chocolate fall into his mouth, drinking in the rich treat, losing himself in its taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Timon finally woke up from his nap, fully refreshed, his belly smaller as it wasn't full anymore, but his body thicker all around due to the digested chocolate that became pure fat. Simba called out to him from the edge of the pond. \"Hey, Timon, you're awake!\" The obese meerkat looked at his lion friend stunned to see him...</span></div></div>",

It was his Ma, the short and stout meerkat that has raised him all his life. \"Aw Geez Ma..\" Timon muttered, rubbing his eyes. \"Did ya hafta wake me up this early?!\" <br>\r\n\"Sure I did honey, cause today's your birthday, YAY! And for your present, your Uncle Max and I thought of the most thoughtful thing...\" <br>\r\n\"What is it?!\" Said The male meerkat, intrigued. <br>\r\n\"We're kicking you out!\" Am responded gleefully, Uncle Max, as if on cue blew a tiny party whistle. <br>\r\nTimon's expression changed completely, \"But Ma-\" he began, <br>\r\n\"No buts, the only butt I want is yours out the door!\" Am commanded with a large smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Ma what's the reason behind all of this?!\" Timon begged <br>\r\n\"Well, we still want you son, but we applied you for a job to start a new colony! Somewhere else! Aren't you excited?! Everyone's celebrating!\" Ma explained. \"There's a leaving ceremony and everything!\" <br>\r\nTimon frowned, and began to pack his bags, he could hear the laughter coming from the main chamber. <br>\r\n\"Oh honey, don't be like that, take this as an opportunity to make a 'new you' I bet you'll be the biggest meerkat the world's ever seen!\" Then Ma kissed him, \"Now I can't be late for the leaving ceremony, see you out there!\" <br>\r\n\"Fine, if they don't want me, I'll show them, I will be the biggest meerkat they have ever seen, I WILL!\" Timon exited to the ceremony with reluctance and sorrow, everyone was cheering and smiling but for a different reason, they wanted to be rid of him. As Timon walked down the center, meerkats with tiny trumpets blew, crowds screeched. <br>\r\n\"Welp, this is the one moment everyone's gonna pay attention to you, you better enjoy it buddy-boy.\" Timon mumbled to himself, then like magic, Timon waved and smiled, beginning to actually enjoy himself, but when he reached the end of the line. All the crowds scattered, without even a \"goodbye\". <br>\r\n\"Lousy guys anyways, I'll show them! I'll be so big, that they'll be absorbed in my- biggness!\" Timon stammered, \"Just you wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of being in the hot desert, Timon saw something in the distance, it looked like a person. <br>\r\n\"Hello?!\" He shouted, \"Are you okay sir, or mam?!\" No reply, Timon began to get closer only to see it was-</span></div></div>",

There was nothing edible in sight, the ground was made out of Pumbaa's least favorite, wood. Well, twigs to be exact. Pumbaa had gained quite a bit since their first encounter. His legs dangled off the ground because of Pumbaa's great belly which sprawled out onto the twig floor. Pumbaa's cheeks were a lot bigger. Both of them. His butt had gained more though. It was the size of a hyena pup. His cheeks were noticeably bigger as well. He had gained many more chins as well.

All the hiding was for nothing, because the fierce shadow was only Simba! <br>\r\n(Simba is a teen now so he has red patches of fur growing out of his head, and starting his mane, he is a lanky cub, but a well-fed one as well.) <br>\r\n\"S-Simba! What are you doing up past your bedtime?!\" Pumbaa wheezed while slumping down into the darkness to hope Simba doesn't notice. <br>\r\n\"Pumbaa,\" A matured Simba started. \"I'm not a cub anymore, plus Timon is trying to find something anyways...\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, right...Sometimes I forget that you're not a cub anymore....Now, Simba...\" Pumbaa said in a loud whisper. <br>\r\n\"I'm so hungry, and I don't have the skills to hunt down a....hmmm....gazelle....yeah a gazelle.

His head was barley visible in the light anymore. The only thing Simba could see was his eyes, and now the warthog's eyes were out of sight. <br>\r\n\"You want me to test out my nighttime hunting skills!\" Simba was excited to even think about it, One of Simba's new hobbies growing up was nighttime hunting, for when he got into a fight with Timon or Pumbaa, and when he didn't want to eat his least-favorite, stink bugs...Simba was overjoyed to hear this from his morbid, hiding, gaurdian. <br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Pumbaa agreed.

He was afraid to forget, and Simba knew he was prone to this as well. \"Gazelle...Ga-zelle.\" Simba tried to make the word sound more fun so it would be more interesting to find. <br>\r\nAs Simba repeated the same word over and over again, he was greeted by the dry clay crackling beneath his light feet. This brought Simba back to when Timon and Pumbaa found him...but that's another story. Anyway, Simba traveled for what seemed like miles but really was a couple of feet, there was a small patch of grass not to far away from his hideaway of a home. \"There HAS to be Ga-zullz there!\" (Simba had decided his new word for 'gazelles' was 'ga-zulls'.) <br>\r\nHe pranced silently and quickly over to the dry-grassed realm of abandonment. 'Abandonment' is a strong word. The truth is, it WAS occupied, but by the wrong people. (animals.) Instead of 'happily-sleeping' gazelles, there were even 'happier-sleeping' hyenas. There were at least twenty-something of them, each were different in structure and spots, but all the same in width, each hyena was pleasantly plump, but that was the only good way to put it.<br>\r\n'Wow, I've never seen a hyena so fat before!' Thought Simba impolitely but truthfully. <br>\r\nEach hyena was fast asleep, not to mention drooling and groaning in gluttony. <br>\r\n'That's weird, I've never seen a hyena that close before and that fat, but shouldn't they be awake at this time of night?' Simba thought again, stepping over one of the bigger hyenas in the pack. 'They must of eaten all of the ga-zullz...I know! I can give Pumbaa a hyena! He said his taste was striving for something new!' <br>\r\n'Now how am I to do it? They'll notice if I drag them that far, amd they hafta be at least 150 pounds each! Maybe just one. One hyena. That's all. The rest will be ga-zullz.' <br>\r\nSimba gently put his maw around the overweight hyena that he stepped over's leg. It flinched and grunted, but didn't wake up thankfully. It was one of the biggest of the patch, but definitely not THE biggest. This one was weighing around 210 pounds. But Simba heard VERY loud snoring coming from a cave within the hyena-patch. He could only imagine what monstrosity was hiding in there. <br>\r\n'Maybe 500, no 1,000 pounds!' Simba entertained himself by guessing the exact weight of the hyena-boss sleeping within the rocky den. He had made quite a bit of progress, he was already back to the cracking clay he had set foot upon earlier. <br>\r\nThe rest of the way, The lion-tween thought about what Pumbaa had been doing the whole time, sometimes Simba's mind would dart back to the fattest hyena in the lot of pigs that was the old gazelle breeding point. He wasn't aroused by it, he was more interested by it, after he gave Pumbaa his prize, The young lion would run back to the group of chubs to check it out some more. <br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that the hyena hadn't woken up yet. But as soon as Simba thought that, he was there. With is unseen protector, inside the makeshift hit Timon had made for him. <br>\r\n\"Pumbaa, in back! Look what I got!\" Simba parted away from his snoozing find. Pumbaa let out a full scream when he saw the whale of a beast. <br>\r\n\"I said my taste was varied, not a death wish!!!\" Pumbaa exclaimed. <br>\r\n\"But aren't you proud of me!\" Simba grinned. <br>\r\n\"Proud, of course, but, AHHHHHH!\" <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's asleep!\" Simba replied cheerfully. <br>\r\n\"That doesn't make a difference! What happened to the gazelle?\" <br>\r\n\"This technically is the gazelle, Pumbaa. What's left of it anyways. Inside the hyena.\" <br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Pumbaa finally gave in, Simba nudged it closer to Pumbaa, reluctantly, The hog of a hog swallowed the hyena whole. (not vore, the hyena is not alive) Simba waited for his mission giver to say something. Two minutes later the pig let out a tremendous burp. <br>\r\n\"'Scuse me.\" Pumbaa finally responded. \"Now Simba, do you think you could get...more of these hyenas?\" </span></div></div>",

Your close to a kid hippo.\" Nuka then poked at her blubbery body. Her belly jiggled a bit and it may have made Nuka laugh a bit. \"Quit poking me.\" Vitani said. \"Yeah! Yeah! So what will it be this time? A whole hippo?\" Nuka said with a chuckle. \"Actually yes.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said yes, Nuka's jaw dropped. \"I WAS JOKING.\" Nuka said loudly. \"Well I'm not. In fact, I would like two.\" Nuka then felt outraged. \"I NOT DOING IT.\" Nuka said. At first it seemed like Nuka wouldn't budge, but then Vitani thought of something. \"Mother left me in charge. You wouldn't want me to say anything BAD about you, do you?\" That got Nuka's attentions. \"Waitwaitwait!!!!\" Nuka said. \"Please don't.\" and then Nuka started to beg. \"Or.....I can talk you up and just maybe, mother will give you more respect than ever.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka got to thinking. If that happened, Nuka may finally be accepted by his mother and may even be the one to be king over Kovu when they take over the Pride Lands. With those thoughts in mind.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.......Nuka, do we have a deal?\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Nuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that deal, Nuka agree to get the other outlanders to bring Vitani any food she asked for. No questions asked. As long as Vitani was fed she was happy. The lions were able to get her the two hippos she asked for. She ate both of them and got even more fatter. She may have been full for now, but it wouldn't be long before she would want more again.</span></div></div>",

By big I mean GINORMOUS!!!!!!! She went from being a small amount of chubbiness, to being as big as a kid hippo. Now her belly has grown to the size of a large elephant. Her head,cheeks, and legs were still pretty pudgy, but her belly was defiently the largest thing about her. It was mostly a big round shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani was busy finishing the leg of a gazelle. \"This is the life.\" She said with joy. \"Too bad that mom and Kovu will be back in a few days, then I won't be in charge. Still, It was fun while it lasted.\" Vitani didn't really sweat by the thought of not being the leader anymore. She didn't even cared about how Zira or Kovu would react to her new size when they come back. She was still happy. The only thing that could make this better is more food to fill her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called her brother Nuka once again. \"What can I do for you now my dear blob of a big little sister?\" Nuka said laughing and poking her belly again. \"Real funny, Nuka.\" Vitani said looking down at him from her belly. \"Anyway, mother and the little fleabag of a brother, Kova will be back any day now.\" Nuka said. After that, Nuka tries to scratch off the actual fleas on him. \"So, remember our deal sis?\" \"Don't worry. I'll tell her.\" Vitani said. \"Now if you wouldn't mind, I'm hungry again.\" \"Yeah, I could guess that.\" Nuka said. \"I got to say, you have quite an appetite for a little cub. You have even outeaten most of the other lions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the only thing she ate was the gazelle leg and with a belly the size of a elephant and the hunger to match, she was pretty hungry. She then had an idea. She decided that she wanted a feast with as much food as possible. A major feast to end all feasts. She wanted this to included zebras, gazelles, fish, hippos, elephants, and even some fruit. Anything good to eat, she wanted it. Nuka actually liked the idea as long as he and the others outlands could eat too. She agreed to that. However, to make a feast like this, it may take a day or two. Vitani got a little pouty, but agree as long as she had something to hold her over. Nuka gave Vitani a zebra to hold her off. Then he and the other lions went off on a hunt. Vitani just waited in the cave and rested on her belly.</span></div></div>",

She tried to reach out for a gazelle, but she forgot, due to her massive blobby body, with tiny paws, she can't really reach any of the food.

Are you kidding?\" Nuka said while ripping off a zebra leg. \"But I can't reach anything....and I'm starving.\" Vitani said weeping a bit. \"Ehh....you three, go feed her blubberiness.\" Nuka said to three of the lions while he was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of the lions formed a type of line. One lion was near the food, one lion was near Vitani to give her the food, and the third lion was in the middle to pass the food down. They first gave Vitani a whole antelope to start. As usual, she went on to tare it apart. Eating away at it like there was no tomorrow. After she finished the antelope, she wanted another one. She did the same to that one leaving nothing but bones. Then the lions past her a zebra, which was also eaten in no time. But of course, she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, Nuka and all the other lions had there fills with small pudgy bellys, but Vitani was far from being full.

Irony is, she was eating a warthog when he was thinking it. (Don't worry. The warthog was NOT Pumbaa.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vitani, don't you think you had enough?\" Nuka said with concern. \"Are you kidding?\" Vitani said. \"We still have plenty of food and I'm still hungry.\" They were still plenty of meat left over. Some were half eaten, but still good. Not to mention there were a hippo or two still untouched. Even with that, Nuka still didn't like her case. \"Have you looked at yourself?\" Nuka said. \"You're bloated up so big that your belly is most of your body, and your paws can't even touch the floor.\" The other lions also agreed she was eating too much. This started to make Vitani a little peeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you all forgot, but I'm in charge.\" Vitani said. \"I'll say when I had enough.\" The other lions still holded there ground and think she should stop. But then Vitani mention something. \"Mother left me in charge and her words are still law in the Outlands. You don't want to upset her when she gets back do you?\" Vitani says. The lions were silent for a bit. Nuka, however, still didn't want to back down. \"You can't scare me with mother.\" Nuka said. \"Do you want to take that risk with her?\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka stayed silent for a minute, Nuka was already on bad terms with his mom. One bad step, and Zira might disown him as her son. Nuka didn't want to risk that. Sooooooo.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, you heard her. Fill her till she's full.\" Nuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuka and the lions group up to Vitani and fed her more food. Like before, she would stuff her face if not to get full, than to increase her already massive belly. As long as she was in charge, she had all the lions to do what she want.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been a few days since Kovu ask Zira that he could train Vitani. By training, he really meant watching her so Zira wouldn't find out about her extra poundage and be forced to lose it all. Since that day, she didn't lose a pound, but she did gain a few extra more. That's what happens when you eat more and exercise less.  Vitani's was currently fat all around. She could still move fine, but he belly did touch the ground and was quite round. Her legs had a good extra layer of fat. That and her face was fairly puffy. Now the only one who knows about this extra weight gain is Kovu. So he had to keep this a secret or he would be in big trouble too. Currently, Vitani and Kovu were out in the fields. Vitani was finishing off a antelope leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels so good to gorge again and not care.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just remember, sooner or later, mom might find out.\" Kovu said. \"When that happens, we'll be in for it.\"<br>\r\n\"You\"re right about that.\" Vitani said. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n\"We? This is your problem.\" Kovu mentioned.<br>\r\n\"Oh no. We're in this together, bro.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"You're in deeper trouble than I'm in.\" Kovu said. \"You're getting close to being the size of a baby hippo.\" Kovu then laughed a bit. But Vitani also had something to laugh about.<br>\r\n\"Hate to tell you bro, but you're not so little anymore either.\" Vitani mention to Kovu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth is, Kovu made a deal with his sister. The deal was, if Vitani ever found extra food, she would have to share with Kovu. If not, he might tell their mom or something else. So, Kovu has also did some extra eating. Now Kovu wasn't as big as his sister. He just had a extra layer of pudge around his body and belly area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Guess I do have a little extra weight on me.\" Kovu admitted.<br>\r\n\"At your rate, you will be as big as me in no time.\" Vitani said chuckling a bit more.<br>\r\n\"If that happens, I'll be in the same boat as you and get in trouble with mom.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Do you think anyone has notice your extra weight?\"<br>\r\n\"Not yet. But let's hope they don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two talked some more as time went by. Vitani currently had to hide out in a den where no one could find her. She still had to stay out of site from the other lions. Kovu went back home.</span></div></div>",

Look at you.\" Vitani said to her belly. \"You may not be as big as last time, but you will soon be big enough to to cover this tiny den. No, even bigger than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani then turn around to her feet and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't keep this up forever.

Just for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani decided to go out and try to find some food. While she was out, Kovu was with the other outlanders, including Nuka and Zira. Nuka sawed Kovu and went over to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mini-King! Where's your sister?\" Nuka asked.<br>\r\n\"Vitani? She's out.\" Kovu told him.<br>\r\n\"Really. It's just that none of the other lions have seen her in a couple days. Is she ok?\" Nuka asked.<br>\r\n\"What? Are you concern?\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Of course not. But the last time I sawed her, she got all ticky tacky with the whole training thing. Then out of nowhere, you want to train her.\"<br>\r\n\"If I'm gonna be king soon, I knew to train others myself.\" Kovu argued. \"Anyway, she's fine so don't worry about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovu seemed calm when he said that, but Nuka didn't seem convinced. Then, Nuka took a closer look at his brother's...body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Kovu?\" Nuka said to his brother.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Kovu said a little nervous.</span></div></div>",

His whole body was fatter than last time and his belly was buldging out even more almost touching the ground. Vitani was still just as big as she was with a few extra pounds. Currently the two were finish eating an zebra. Kovu stomach was groaning a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrk! I think I'm to full to finish this.\" Kovu said holding the last zebra leg. <br>\r\n\"Come on, lightweight.\" Vitani said. \"You're not gonna be king with that attitude.\"<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say......\" Kovu says looking at his stomach size compare to his.<br>\r\n\"Alright, let me help.\" Vitani said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically she forcefed the remaining piece of meat of the zebra to her brother. He didn't seem to fond of it as his belly groan some more. Vitani rubbed his belly a bit to make him feel a little better. It did helped him finish the rest of the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. You at least ate it all.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Ok, I'm full now.\" Kovu said.<br>\r\n\"Haha! You're still a lightweight.\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not like you.

It's been a while since you seen her and she expects you to be skinny by now. To top it off, I was suppose to help you lose way too, but instead I gain weight too.

Sure, Fagin had money and wealth and a good financial investor who dealt with money and business Fagin had inherited after his loan shark's empire had fallen.  When Dodger was frank, he thought that Fagin was not a smart man; but Dodger wasn't very smart himself and loved Fagin all the same.  Dodger was thinking of this solely because Fagin was feeding his dogs then.  Five bowls were filled to the brim with the usual dry dog food.  Once Dodger had guzzled his food, he gently nudged Fagin and politely tilted his head and asked for more food.  Although Fagin usually resisted at first, he quickly succumbed to Dodger's begging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Initially, all of Fagin's dogs gained a bit of sleek fat; but Dodger gained more weight faster than any other dog of Fagin's, a fact to which Fagin was oblivious.  Francis was the first to notice, \"Erm, Dodger,\" the erudite bull-dog quavered, \"Do you think that you've, um, increased your waist-line a bit quickly?\"  Although Dodger had known what Francis met, he enjoyed playing dumb and pressing on to the most extreme bluntness, \"What?  Are you saying that I'm fat, Frankie?\" Dodger asked in genuine defensiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Francis,\" Francis snapped, \"When will you ever learn that my name is Francis?\"  But in a more quiet, but more eerily intense tone, he responded, \"Precisely, Dodger.\"  Dodger chuckled, \"Frankie, have you looked lately at yourself?\"  Francis looked stupefied and immediately muttered something incoherent and stormed off.  Meanwhile, Fagin had walked into the kitchen to rinse his dishes.  Dodger ambled up to Fagin and nudged him again.  When Fagin looked down, Dodger walked to his bowl, grabbed it, and held it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fagin got the message, but chuckled and shook his head.  Dodger repeated his action, to the same avail.  Dodger waited a couple of minutes and repeated the action and was surprised when he was still met with a no.  Dodger waited until Fagin was done and did something which he hadn't done since he was a puppy and was ashamed to use such a tactic on Fagin: he used his puppy eyes.  That finally broke Fagin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodger managed to wheedle out three bowls of food a night from Fagin slowly, but increasingly constantly.  Moreover, although Fagin found an apartment in a rich neighborhood, Dodger found himself surrounded with working-class neighborhoods.  Most notably to Dodger, there was a meat-packing plant with an employee which gave any edible refuse and any salvageable scraps from the factory to Dodger whenever the dog scratched at the back door where the man worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodger had known the man since he was a puppy because the man had given him scraps from the factory which had kept Dodger alive.  This was also the man whom Dodger had first used his puppy-eyes on.  When Dodger scratched on the door, he saw the familiar face of the man who had saved him.  Immediately, the man went inside and brought out\u2026</span></div></div>",

A moment later, when Dodger had finished, he went and nudged the man's arm and begged for more food.  The man chuckled and replied, \"Allright, I guess I can spare you a hamburger patty,\" which turned into two and a hot-dog before the man finally steeled and denied Dodger's request.  Thus, a contented Dodger lay down for a nap in the yard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Dodger returned home, he was hungry again and waited calmly for dinner.  After he had eaten his usual three bowls, Dodger lay down for a nap.  Einstein, however, thought something was off about Dodger.  He seemed to look like a sausage, which was something Einstein had never seen before a dog.  Although he said nothing, Einstein was wary of Dodger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Dodger awoke the next morning and tried to rise, an ache sprang in his hind, right knee and caused Dodger to treat the knee gingerly.  To Dodger's chagrin, Tito noticed and yapped, \"Eh, boss, you ok?  Is your knee bothering you?\"  Dodger smiled and answered, \"No, I'm afraid it's an old injury that I may have aggravated.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"By your weight,\" Dodger heard Francis mutter.  Dodger snapped his head and growled, \"Do you dare lecture ME on my weight, Francis,\" Dodger spat, with special vehemence reserved for the bull-dog's name, \"Do you dare question me on my previous injuries, Francis?  Do you dare question your leader, FRANCIS?\"  The last word was nearly a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although Francis flinched slightly at Dodger's last word, the biting anaphora, and the sarcastic use of his name, Francis regained his composure and responded, \"Dodger, I have heard that if a human can feel your ribs easily as he runs his hands down them and not see them, you are a healthy weight.  I had Fagin do that to me today, and he could feel my rins with little effort.  So I ask you: could you say the same?  I detest your innuendos and blatant statements regarding my weight.  You are wrong.  I know that you have suffered much, but your weight exacerbates such injuries.  And your ethos at the end intimidates me not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Francis finished, Dodger sat stupefied.  He was no match for Frankie in words, but he was still a match in a fight.  As Dodger advanced Francis cocked his head and chastised Dodger, \"Come now, we have no need to fight.  Where we are, we don't have to fight to make a point.\"  Dodger ignored him and continued to approach.  Then, he noticed Einstein standing next to Frankie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodger felt like he had been kicked.  To have two of his closest friends turn on him was shameful.  Then, he noticed Tito, more than a match for any of them there, at his side.  Rita stood by, watching carefully.  She loved Dodger and admired his new pudginess, but she also didn't want to see both dogs poison a well and intervened, \"Have you boys ever heard of diplomacy?\" Rita asked.  Her voice checked everyone in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Francis, recovering most quickly, responded, \"Rita, I'd be very pleased if we were to, and I tried; but Dodger is acting as a barbarian.\"  But Rita, seeing his ploy, responded, \"Frankie, I'm not a dunce.  I know you hit a sensitive nerve for Dodger.\"  An exchange followed, which resulted in\u2026</span></div></div>",

Eventually, after the debate had devolved into an \"I'm right; you're wrong\" mud-slinging fest, Dodger finally snapped, \"Alright, diplomacy has gotten us nowhere.  Let's take this outside, Frankie.\"  Francis muttered something but accepted the challenge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Francis had analyzed how he would fight with Dodger.  Because Francis was short of breath because of his nasal configuration, he would allow Dodger to attack before he would make a small motion to dodge.  When Dodger had tired himself out or frustrated himself, Francis thought that he would then pin Dodger to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodger had no plan, by contrast.  He would just be fast and smooth and would knock Francis out quickly.  Einstein and Rita would be the judges.  As the two contenders faced off, Rita told both fighters the rules which both knew by heart.  After counting down, the fight began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as Rita said to go, Dodger lunged quickly at Francis, who barely managed to dodge the attack in time.  However, Dodger, being unaccustomed to his new weight, was thrown off balance slightly, which gave Francis time to recover and prepare for Dodger's next attack.  Dodger again lunged at Francis, who, this time, stood his ground and let the attack flow by him; and Francis then tried to lunge and pin Dodger to the ground.  But being more accustomed to his weight, Dodger stopped and rolled out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Dodger took to long to stand and was knocked off balance as he was standing and had the wind knocked out of him.  Before he could recover, Dodger felt felt the weight of Francis on him, trapping Dodger with his legs.  Dodger struggled to no avail.  Rita and Einstein were counting, \"\u2026three\u2026four\u2026five.  Stop!\"  Dodger stood shakily and wearily.  He had been thoroughly humiliated, by Francis no less.  \"Good game,\" Francis congratulated Dodger; but the defeated dog looked away.  \"Come now, Dodger, don't make this a shameful defeat,\" Francis whispered urgently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dodger refused to acknowledge Francis, who sensed that he had poisoned a deep well.  Dodger stormed off; but when Francis went to follow, Tito sighed, \"Frankie, don't bother.  He wants to be alone right now.\"  This last statement proved to be untrue, however, when Dodger went to his friend at the packaging plant, the man who gave him a New-York strip, an Italian sausage, a couple of Kielbasas, and various lunch-meats, as well as copious scraps.  These foods helped alleviate Dodger's foul mood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What further helped his poor mood was his stop at a bakery on the way home.  The man there was throwing away his unused confections when Dodger walked by.  When Howler nudged the man and pointed at the food, the man chuckled and gave Dodger whatever he wanted.  This man would become another routine stop for Howler.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Howler had returned home and eaten dinner, he noticed Francis's approach; and Dodger heard the bulldog's question, \"Dodger, I admit that I acted senselessly this morning.  Please, would you forgive me?\"  To which Dodger replied, \u2026</span></div></div>",

I doubt that those tiny bottles will fill us up. But the boost of energy could be what we need.\" Roscoe said.<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" DeSoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were 12 bottles in the box. DeSoto and Roscoe to one each and open them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms up!\" Said the Dobermans before chugging the bottles. The content in the protein shake contain a hint of Vanilla. The two both thought the drinks were quite good. But what they didn't notice, while the shake churn in their stomachs, their bellies started to bloat up by an inch. However, they didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. This isn't half bad.\" DeSoto said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Past me another one.\" Roscoe said.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" DeSoto said. \"We still need to get out of this factory.\"<br>\r\n\"Right, before the employee's show up.\" Roscoe said. \"They won't be too happy with all the stuff we ate.\"<br>\r\nLet's take the box of shakes and find a way out.\" DeSoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoscoe agreed and put the boxes with the leftover shake bottles on his back. Even with their, the two didn't feel as tired as they should be. Guess the shakes actually gave them some energy.

I mean look at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, both DeSoto and Roscoe were huge. Defiently large the the average dog. Currently both dobermans had budging fat around their necks, their bodies lengths were longer, to top it off, their bellies were ginorous. Both of their bellies were the same size and large and sphere like. Not to mention hanging down to the ground. Roscoe took the box of shakes and divided them into two groups of five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five for you and five for me.\" Roscoe said.<br>\r\n\"Seems fair.\" DeSoto said taking his share.<br>\r\n\"Ok. I gonna drink another one of these.\" Roscoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeSoto and Roscoe both got another bottle and drank them. Like before they enjoyed them, but they didn't notice that their bellies were slightly growing like last time. At least by another inch. But the two didn't notice again. They just enjoyed them too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's just as good as the last time.\" Roscoe said.<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" DeSoto agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drinking the bottles, DeSoto and Roscoe.........</span></div></div>",

Me neither.\" DeSoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like the boys were dealing with another one of the shakes side effects.

Sherry hold the funnel while Rufus pour the shake down Roscoe's gullet. Ronnie did the same to DeSoto, but by himself. They careful each pour one bottle down the funnel until the bottles were empty. After the first bottle, it didn't seem like it took any effect. So they each pour down a second bottle into them. Still being careful not to wake them. After the second bottles, it still didn't look like it took any effect on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's working.\" Sherry whispered.<br>\r\n\"Keep pouring.\" Whispered back Ronnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they pour down a third bottle to each out them and as they did, both DeSoto and Roscoe bellies started to expand. So the shakes were working. Giving them three bottles each so far, they each had 9 more bottles. A total of 18. The gang continues to pour more and more bottles down the dobermans hatches being sure to stay quite. They made it so Roscoe and DeSoto have drank 6 bottles each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, so good.\" Ronnie said.<br>\r\n\"They are getting quite big now.\" Sherry said.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprise if they can't even get out of this house now due to their size.\" Rufus said.<br>\r\n\"That's the plan.\" Ronnie said. \"Now let's pour in more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group goes back to pouring the shakes to them.

He confidently told Sherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well then good luck guys and when your training's done i'll be surprised when i see you guys are big fat and strong enough to take on those dreaded dobermans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so a couple of weeks or so passed, as both Ronnie and Rufus spent their time at the weight gain gym for dogs until their training was complete as both now huge dogs heavily waddled out of the gym itself with their heads held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rufus you ready to see Sherry and surprise her before we take on those two dobermans?\" Ronnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm Hmm I'm ready when you are\". Rufus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then let's go.\" Ronnie boldly commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sherry could hear the sound of heavy footsteps, as her eyes widened upon seeing her now huge friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronnie and Rufus, is that you?\" Sherry asked as she noticed they were now quite bigger fatter and stronger than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is Sherry and now that we're done training, i'd say it's time to stand up for our fellow dogs and teach them bullies a lesson right Rufus\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right\" Rufus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to take on Roscoe and Desoto\". Ronnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the three dogs made their way into the back alleyway where Roscoe and Desoto were as the other dogs couldn't help but be amazed upon seeing their future superheroes Ronnie and Rufus standing up against Roscoe and Desoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you two want and where's our food\"? Roscoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentleman you ain't getting any more food and we're tired of you both bullying our friends\" Ronnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right and now we hereby challenge you both to a tag team Sumo match. Do you accept our challenge\"? Rufus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do. We're ready now.\" Desoto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so all four of the challengers mainly the good guys consisting of the team of Ronnie the golden retriever A.K.A the golden warrior and Rufus A.K.A the iron curtain and the bad guys consisting of Roscoe and his Brother Desoto A.K.A the terror doberman twins of New York City gathered on the sidewalk from where the  alley was, as Sherry and a few other dogs were doing play by play commentary while one dog filled the role of referee for the fight of the century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Determined to become an adult bear as quickly as possible Koda decided to put all his effort into eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he wondered what to eat. He could eat salmon's like the other bears, but there was two problems with that. 1. Many other bears where probably hunting in the river right now since it was a popular place to hunt in, and 2. The effort it would take to catch even one salmon would make him burn more calories then he would gain. \"If I want to keep my food inside of me I must do almost nothing else but eating.\" Koda thought, remembering seeing some very fat bears that would do nothing but lay around lazily all day after eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving salmon out of the picture Koda tried hard to figure out what else to eat, but all that came into his mind was berries and nuts. At first it felt like it wouldn't work, but then Koda slightly remembered a hidden place that had plenty of berry bushes and trees that was easy to shake nuts out of. Seeing this as his greatest plan yet Koda decided to go of to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole day Koda went his way deeper down the forest and further away from where the rest of the bear tribe was. As the sun was getting lower and darkness was starting to take over Koda felt that this might have been a bad idea and that he should head back to the others, but just as he was suppose to his eyes got a glimpse of something small and red hiding in the dense growing forest. Looking closer he saw that it was berries, but was it the one he remembers? A taste on some of them confirmed to him that it was in fact them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let the taste stay in his mouth Koda could feel that these berries was really sweet and juicy, if he would ever have gotten a chance to taste candy it would probably have been the same thing. Feeling happier then ever Koda made his way through the thick growing bush and found inside a hidden clearing with even more berries and nuts then he remembers from last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing more happy then ever before Koda started to eat like crazy of more of the berries. Since they where as sweet as candy Koda got both more addicted to eat them, and he also got the extra energy to do it like in a sugar rush. Plus unknown to him these berries seemed to have a bit of a bizarre side effect. They seems to have the power to make everything someone eats to get a bunch of extra calories as they where being digested. So the more he eat the more energy he would get and the more calories he would gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Koda this was paradise. He would be in such a rush of the sugar that he wouldn't even notice that his midsection was starting to get wider. Not even when he was using his added body form to slam into trees and making it's nuts drop down on the ground. He was to busy to not lose his drive. \"I can't believe that I have never been to this place much more often!\" Kody thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly for Koda hours passed and it had been getting late into nightfall when he had finally managed to clean every single bush of its berries. Koda's brain started to slightly work again as all he could think about was to find more berries. Frantically Koda looked around hoping to find more of that sweet nectar of the forest. As the rush was getting lower the more desperate Koda became. He turned and looked in all directions possibly until he tried standing up which made him fall on his back. Getting completely out of his trance state Koda got a chance to see that it was in the middle of the night now, and on what those berries had truly done to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he saw that his normal looking paunch had now been stretched out to be at least three times its normal size. It looked like the little cub had swallowed down another cub. And while he had been able to still move his new body around before, his position of laying on his back made moving around down right impossible. He was stuck looking at the stars up in the sky, and on the moon that was shining down it's light to make it possible for Koda to see his new belly. \"Not to shabby for my first day.\" Koda thought proud and patted his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his proudness soon turned into fear as he heard noises coming from the nearby bushes. In this unlucky position he figured out that he would become a great victim for any predator that would be lurking around, and he would not be able to do anything about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him the mystical creature turns out to be none other then...</span></div></div>",

He could see in front of him how the bushes were starting to move as the creature was getting through it. At first Koda couldn't see anything but a dark shadowy figure approaching, but as soon the things walked into the moonlight Koda could make out what looked like big horns on the creatures head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoda instantly took and felt relieved over that it was just a moose, and even though he was just a lonely cub he know that it wouldn't take and hurt him. Taking a closer look he started to think that this moose looked familiar when he heard the noise of something else coming. Getting through the bushes was another moose, and this one was half-shouting to the other one. \"Don't take all the beautiful grass for yourself. Leave some for me!\" \"Then you have to be much quicker getting here instead of walking so slowly!\" The other one said in the same some what loud but still numbed voice. \"I have a bad knee and you know it!\" The second one said while tottering around like he couldn't see where the other moose stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realizing who they where Koda shouted \"Rutt and Tuke!\", making them both twitch and blink a lot with their eyes. After looking around for some moments the moose's started to ask each other where they were, without the other on knowing the answer. After listening to their bickering for some time Koda shouted \"Hey Guys!\", making them both see the cub on the ground. \"Hey.\" Koda said polite to them now when they where both looking at him. \"Hey I know you.\" Rutt said, \"Yeah aren't you that little bear that was together with that other bear?\" Tuke added. \"Yes I am.\" Koda answered happy. \"See, I knew it, I knew it. You're that one, little bear...that is named...\" Rutt said trying to figure out Koda's name. \"Don't be silly now Rutt. We know this bear's name, its...its...\" Tuke said before getting lost as well. \"Koda\", Koda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Koda! Of course! See, I knew it all the time.\" Rutt said snarky. \"Then why didn't you say it then?\" Tuke asked back. \"Maybe because I would liked to challenge you.\" Rutt said and was on his way to fight Tuke when Koda asked, \"Why are you both out here in the middle of the night?\" \"I have no idea but I think the reason for Tuke to be here could be because he has been sleepwalking, he does that a lot.\" Rutt said to Koda. \"Oh, Like you hasn't been doing that yourself. Have I ever told you about how many times I have to follow you during the nights to make sure that anything bad will happen to you?\" Tuke said back upset. \"But you where both talking before, didn't you notice that?\" Koda asked confused. \"We where talking before getting here? I don't remember that.\" Tuke said. \"Me neither.\" Rutt added, \"So you where both sleepwalking and <i>sleep-arguing</i> when you got here?\" Koda asked. \"...Seems like so.\u201d Tuke said after thinking for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what has happen to you kid? You're look much more rounder then last time we saw you.\" Rutt said and poked Koda's belly slightly with one of his hoofs. \"I'm just trying to help myself grow and become the biggest bear around.\" Koda said proud while patting his belly with his front paws. \"But how did you manage to feed yourself so much out here all alone?\" Tuke asked. \"I found these sweet berries that helped me getting the energy to continue eating even though I was already starting to get full, but I need to have more of them if I want to be able to reach full grown bear size.\" Koda said, \"Could you help me find them?\" \"Sure kid, we would be most happy to help you with anything.\" Rutt said. \"Just tell us what they looked like.\" Tuke added. \"Well they...they...\" Koda said before realizing the horrible truth. \"Yes?\" Both moose's asked eager to hear. \"I don't remember.\" Koda said sadly. \"I was soo into eating them that I didn't took the time to remember how they looked like, and now they are all in here.\" He said and pointed to his stuffed belly. \"Well...that's really bad.\" Rutt said. \"Makes it kinda hard to find them then.\" Tuke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting silently for a while Koda asked \"Would it be possible for you two to help me back home to Kenia and the others?\" to them. At first the moose's looked prepared to answer \"YES! Of Course! Just Follow US!\", but then suddenly something hit them in the same sad way as the berries had done to Koda. \"What is it?\" Koda asked prepared for the worst. \"We are actually not very used to walk around the forest during night.\" Tuke said. \"Since we usually use it to well...sleep.\" Rutt added. \"So that means that we two are both...\" Tuke said, before Koda finished \"Lost\". \"Yes.\" Rutt said, \"We are all three right now lost.\" \"Then what do we do now? Koda asked worried. \"Do not fear little bear, Tuke and I will be here to make sure that you're safe.\" Rutt said. \"And then tomorrow we start searching for the way back to your bear friends.\" Tuke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two moose's then took and lied themselves next to Koda to protect him during the night.</span></div></div>",

His belly that he got so big and round during yesterdays night, still looked just as big today. Things got even weirder when he put his paws on it and could feel that it wasn\u2019t as full and heavy as of before, but more empty and lighter now. (To explain to everyone the berries Koda had been eaten last night had been having an Air Inflation effect on him, as of now while the food inside had been digested the berries had made sure that all the air that had been swallowed as well had stayed inside of him.) While Koda felt this was really strange he was still happy that his midsection weighed less so he could be able to move again. He could still feel his belly scratching the ground as he walked, but it wasn\u2019t as much of an obstacle as of before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally managed to catch up to the moose\u2019s he asked them what to do now. \u201cWe have been talking for a long time now about what to do.\u201d Rutt said. \u201cAnd we have so far not been able to decided what exactly we should do.\u201d Tuke added. \u201cYou see, I think we should try to find the river and then walk along it until we find the rest of the pack.\u201d Rutt said. \u201cAnd I want us to go up to the top of the high mountains to get a better view of the area.\u201d Tuke added. \u201cSo we thought this when you came, could you decide what we should do?\u201d Rutt asked Koda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Koda felt a bit unsure what to pick, but after some deliberation he to wanted them to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Once there they reached another problem. \"Which way are we suppose to go now?\" The moose's asked each other, expecting the other one to have the answer. \"I know.\" The heard Koda say. \"You do?\" Tuke said. \"Then tell us.\" Rutt added. \"I got to learn that salmon always swim upwards against the stream, which makes it much easier for bears to catch it. If we just follow the stream the same way the salmon does them should meet another bear in no time.\" Koda explained. Both moose's was very surprised by the knowledge that this small cub had in him, and they decided to do as he said and go against the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they where walking alongside the river Koda suddenly spotted something. It was a small bush that was carrying some berries, but unlike the once that Koda had been eating before that had been red this ones where lightly green. Koda was on his way to run up and taste them, when his inflated stomach made him trip over onto his back. The moose's where quick to get to him, and asked him if he was all right. \"Yes, but i need to get up, I need to taste those berries!\" Koda said and was trying to quickly get up, which only made it harder for him. \"Take it easy little cub. Are you sure those are the berries you ate before?\" Rutt asked. \"I don't know, I don't remember.\" Koda answered sadly. \"Then <b>I</b> think we should let one of us test them, just to be sure.\" Tuke said to Koda. \"I agree completely with you Tuke, so  I suggest <b>you</b> do it.\" Rutt said, and started pushing Tuke towards the bush from behind him. \"Wait, I do it?!\" Tuke said surprised. \"I'm so glad we are at an agreement again Tuke, now be nice and help this pore cub.\" Rutt said and pushed him all the way to the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there and runs back to Koda (Still on his back) and looks on at Tuke standing right next to the bush with the green berries. \"I-I have a bad feeling about this.\" Tuke said a bit scared. \"Come on now, do it for the kid!\" Rutt shouted back at him. \"O-Okay.\" Tuke said before he got his head really close to one of its branches filled with berries, and took a big bite of it.

In an quick haste he ran to the river to stick his head down and drink the water. He drank and drank in an attempt to get cooled down, and after 3 minutes of constant drinking he felt that the heat was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Rutt and Koda he could see that they where both staring at him awkwardly. \"What is it guys...?\" He started to ask, before he felt something big jiggle under him when he moved. Looking down he got shocked himself seeing that all that drinking had been giving him a <i>huge</i> water filled belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It seemed that these green berries had a special kind of mineral that once digested would make the carrier's skin able to stretch out widely, and giving them the ability to store huge amounts of food or water without feeling any pain.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tuke still stood there in disbelief of the new belly he had now got, Rutt had managed to get enough courage to walk up towards him. \"What is this!?\" Tuke asked scared while moving around a little, making his belly shake with the steps. \"I have no idea, but this is very interesting.\" Rutt said and poked his friends hanging gut with on of his hooves. \"Don't touch it! It might burst!\" Tuke said scared, and moved away from Rutt. \"Kid, did this thing happen when you ate those berries?\" Rutt asked. \"I don't remember it working that quickly.\" Koda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\" Koda started before stopping. \"And what?\" Rutt asked. \"I'm not sure but...I don't think it <i>feels</i> the same. I'm not sure since I don't know how his feels.\" Koda said and pointed to Tuke that was just standing a bit away, still acting confused about his belly. \"If I could get a chance to feel it I might be able to tell.\" The bear cub said. \"I'll help you with that kid.\" Rutt said calmly, before shouting \"Tuke! Get over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it about?\" Tuke said as he walked over with careful steps. \"You must let the kid touch your belly.\" Rutt said to him like it was something normal. \"What?!\" Tuke shouted surprised. \"I want <b>you</b> to let <b>him</b> touch your <b>belly</b>.\" Rutt said clear. \"I'm not doing that!\" Tuke said once again in a shocking voice, and tried to walk away without tripping over, but Rutt cut his way off. \"Don't you want to help the kid?\" Rutt asked seriously. \"Yes.\" Tuke answered calmly. \"Then you must do this, since it's the only way for him to be sure if those are the same berries that he ate last night.\" Rutt explained. \"Okay, but...\" Tuke started before getting afraid. \"But what?\" Rutt asked. \"I'm afraid I will get hurt by his claws.\" Tuke confessed. \"Okay, now I understand, but don't be worried, I'm sure he will be careful.\" Rutt said comforting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling a bit unsure Tuke staggered to the small cub and let him feel on his belly with his small paws. At first Tuke was tensed about it, but after only a few strokes by the cub he started to feel more relaxed. It all felt so good, almost like a massage, so Tuke didn't even seem to notice at first when Koda stopped feeling him. Once he noticed that the cub had stopped Tuke let out a small sigh. \"What was that?\" Rutt asked with a smirk. \"Nothing.\" Tuke answered back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the kid Rutt asked \"Did it feel the same?\" \"No.\" Koda answered disappointed. \"While his stomach felt like it had more weight and was full of water, mine felt more how to say <i>empty</i> inside. Like it was just filled with air.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sad for not finding the right berries Koda walked of to rest under a tree. As he was just poking his still air filled belly he suddenly heard some weird noise back at the river. Going back he saw the moose's arguing again, this time it was because Rutt had started to make fun of Tuke's water filled belly. Their bickering got even worse and finally leads to Rutt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first Koda didn't want to interfere, since they always seemed to be arguing, but once Rutt started to nudge his hooves and horns into Tuke's water balloon like belly against his will Koda knew he had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Tuke he also had a very inflated belly. His was filled with air instead of water, but the principle was the same. They where both experiencing something that neither of them was really familiar of, nor was feeling completely comfortable with yet. So seeing Rutt pressing and pushing on Tuke's belly while he was still feeling uneasy with it really made Koda upset. He needed to teach Rutt a lesson, and he know just how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rutt was busy still making fun of Tuke, Koda went over to the bush with the green berries. Once there he realize there was a problem with his plan. His plan was to force-feed Rutt some of the berries, but right next to the bush Koda saw a problem. He couldn't carry any berries on a stick since that would make Rutt aware of his intentions, neither could he store them in his mouth because that would have the risk of him eating some of them. So he decided to test something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to concentrate Koda then took and raised his front paws up in the air, and let his hind legs balance him. It wasn't anything strange seeing bears doing that, but since Koda had a belly that was filled with air he wasn't sure if it would work. Surprisingly his inflated middle actually helped him holding his body straight up, with the air working a little bit like helium. With his front paws now free Koda took and picked 12 berries before he felt that it would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking with the berries also proved to be easier then Koda would have thought, with once again the air inside helping lifting his body, making his steps easier to take. The only thing he had look out for was for rocks that he could trip over since his belly was also blocking a bit of his view. Luckily for him he didn't trip over anything, and found himself standing next to the moose's that was still to busy being angry with each other to notice him being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Rutt was still picking on Tuke made Koda more convinced then ever to do this. Getting himself right next to Rutt, Koda made sure to get his attention by saying loudly, \"Rutt! I want to show you something!\" Rutt stopped being a bully to Tuke and lowered his head to get to Koda's eye level. \"And what would that be...\" Was all he would say before he just let his mouth hang open by the strange sight of the inflated Koda standing on two legs. In this position he could see just how big and round the bear cubs belly really was, and Koda saw it as the perfect moment to do his plan. Before Rutt even had a chance to do anything Koda took and stuffed on of his arms inside the moose mouth, and tossed the berries he had down his throat. He then drag his arm out and watch the berries take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Rutt was just super confused over what Koda had just done, but then he started to feel the same horrible burning coming from inside of him. Without a word he rushed over to the river and dived his head down and started drinking for his life. Once done he looked back at Tuke and Koda who where both laughing out loud at him. He didn't get it first but then he remembered feeling the taste of some berries before it happen, and then he knew. He didn't even had to look down to be sure but he did, and it confirmed that he too now had a water filled middle. Being just speechless over the sudden change Rutt just stood there looking at himself while it was Tuke's time to speak. \"Well,well,well Rutt. Looks like I'm not the only one with a <i>big thirst</i>.\" He said mockingly. \"I even think yours is bigger then mine.\" He added, and walked close to him to confirm that Rutt's gut was at least a third bigger in size. \"It was only because you ate a branch with four berries. That cub feed me at least a dozen berries!\" He finally said and pointed a hoof at Koda. \"Actually it was only 12.\" He answered back. \"12 <u>is</u> a dozen!\" Rutt said irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But tell me, why would you do this to me?\" Rutt asked Koda feeling very sad. \"I saw how you where making fun of Tuke having his belly filled with water and you wouldn't stop. I though you needed to be learned a lesson, and let you know how it would feel being made fun of.\" Koda told him in a very adult way. Rutt felt like a huge jerk now, laughing and calling Tuke bad names for something he hadn't even asked to become. Knowing now how bad it must have felt for Tuke, Rutt took a huge deep breath and said to Tuke \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you those bad names, and I should have stopped hitting your stomach once you told me to stop. Can you ever forgive me?\" Taking a moment before speaking Tuke finally said \"Yes, my friend.\" They both then walked up to each other to give each other a hug, but found their new huge midsections blocking them. They all three then laughed together at it, and decided to continue their journey to find the rest of the bear tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing their walk along the river they later meet... </span></div></div>",

He shouted \"Hey! Can you help us with something?\" to the bear. The bear looked over at their direction and was very surprised by what he saw. Seeing a little bear cub with a ballooned out belly almost as big as the cub itself, and two moose's with even bigger hanging jiggling guts wasn't a very common sight. \"What's...the problem?\" He asked still not having taking it all in yet. \"The kid here is lost and he's trying to find his friends and family again.\" Rutt said. \"And we thought maybe you would know where they are.\" Tuke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the bear continued to stare dumfounded at them, but then his face started to get a more <i>unsettling</i> look. \"I think I may have a slight clue of where they could be.\" He said, which got the trio very happy. \"But I would like something in return.\" He said and licked his lips. \"And what's that?\" Koda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see I have been trying my best to catch some salmon to feed myself, but recently the river hasn't been very rich on fish.\" He said as he started to walk towards them to the shore. \"All the other bears decided to move further away from here and test another river for salmon catching.\" \"So you mean they aren't even on this river?\" Koda asked shocked. \"Nope. They could be anywhere in this far wide forest, but I think they told me where their new place would be.\" \"Could you tell me where that place would be?\" Koda pleaded. \"There is just one problem.\" The bear said. \"And what's that?\" Koda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the bear was starting to get on dry land again, and all three of them could now really see just how big he actually was. As big as adult bear went he really was pretty big. Walking on all four his height was about the same as the moose's, and standing on two legs he would be twice as high. Looking at the three of them the bear gave another evil smirk and said. \"I haven't been having myself a good meal in a long time, and seeing such a sight like this is to good of an opportunity to pass.\" They all three started to shake by fear of how much closer the bear was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will tell you where the other bears are little cub if you let me eat...\"</span></div></div>",

Leave my friends alone!\u201d Koda shouted as he tried to block the bear from coming any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bears response to it was to pick up the well-rounded cub, throw him in the air, and then punch hi inflated middle like it was a beach ball. The impact sent Koda flying into a tree, with he then bounced of and into another tree, and then another, and then another. He became like a little furred pinball, flying from tree trunk to tree trunk, deeper and deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Koda gone there was nothing to protect the moose\u2019s from the hungry bear. \u201cP-Please Mr. Bear, d-don\u2019t eat us.\u201d Tuke plead. \u201cWe may look a bit plump, but our inside is actually mostly made out of water.\u201d Rutt said and started rubbing his belly to prove it. \u201cI don\u2019t care.

Once he learned to get a hang on it he set the course to get back and save his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutt and Tuke was on their way to become a bear\u2019s dinner, when they heard something coming towards them from behind in a very high speed. \u201cDuck!\u201d Koda\u2019s voice shouted, and the two moose\u2019s hit the ground in response. Before the big bear could react he was hit in the face by Koda, (giving away such force like that of a cannonball) that it sent him flying back into the river, in which he was swept away from them. Koda was then sent right into something very soft that managed to slow him down. The water filled bellies of the moose\u2019s. Looking up at them Koda asked if they where okay. Both of them showed great signs of pain in their faces, but Rutt tried to keep cool and said, \u201cYes\u2026Yes we are. You saved us kid.\u201d \u201cI did?\u201d Koda asked happily surprised. \u201cYeah, we though we would become bear food there, and then you just flew in and knocked him to the side of the forest.\u201d Tuke said. \u201cHe actually only sent him into the river.\u201d Rutt marked. \u201cIf he continues to follow the stream I\u2019ll say he will be in the other end of the forest in about an hour.\u201d Tuke said cleverly. \u201cSigh, Guess you have a point this time Tuke. Let\u2019s get moving now before he decides to come back.\u201d Rutt said, before they all three got up and started moving forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should we do now? He said that none off the other bears where hunting in this river.\u201d Koda asked. \u201cWell, we can either continue to walk upstream with this river and see if we meet any other creatures that could help us, or we could go off course and try to find another river behind the trees.\u201d Rutt said. \u201cSince this is your journey what way do you think we should take?\u201d Tuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoda thinks they should\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was jiggling all over his body whenever he stepped.

You're a lot bigger than the last time we saw you, eh.\" said Tuke.<br>\r\n\"You got that right.\" Kenai replied to them, \"Last night, there was a lot of salmon that came to the Salmon Run, and boy are all those bears ready for hibernation.\"<br>\r\n\"Hiber-what?\" Tuke asked.<br>\r\n\"Hibernation.\" said Kenai, \"Every year in the forest, all the animals have to gain a lot of weight in order to survive the cold winter. But this is actually my first winter with the hibernation.\"<br>\r\n\"So whataya do when it's winter, eh?\" said Rutt.<br>\r\n\"You hide in a cave and sleep through all of winter until spring comes.\" said Kenai, \"And the best part, if you become really big and fat, you cannot feel the cold at all.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\" said both Rutt and Tuke.<br>\r\n\"I wanna do that, eh\" Rutt replied back to Kenai.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too\" said Tuke.<br>\r\n\"Well, you have to be really big in order to survive for hibernation,...\" said Kenai, \"...but I'm already halfway through.\"<br>\r\n\"How long have you started, eh?\" Tuke asked.<br>\r\n\"A couple days after we last met.\" Kenai explained, \"When a leaf falls off of a tree, it is a sign that winter is coming soon, and every animal must pack on the pounds. Even you guys have too.\"<br>\r\n\"But we don't know where to start\" said Rutt.<br>\r\nKenai then explained to them: \"It's actually hard at first, cause you have to fill your stomach at its maximum capacity, but after a couple of days you will get results. But winter is coming really soon, so I suggest you guys should start eating now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they all turned their head and they see Koda, who's now three times bigger than he was. Koda didn't look like regular fat bears, he was a cub.  He was running and breathing heavily from getting his newly formed fat body up from the Salmon Run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that guys. *huh* *huh* Did I miss anything?\" said Koda.<br>\r\n\"Not really, Koda.\" Kenai answered, \"I was just telling Rutt &amp; Tuke about hibernation, and how they need to get bigger in order to survive the harsh winter that's coming up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, can't wait to sleep through with this\" said Koda as he sat down and put his front paws on his belly.<br>\r\n\"Wait, that's Koda?\" asked Tuke.<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" said Kenai, \"Now there's two options.

Ah- how silly I feel-\" she said, shaking her head before quickly jogging up the stairs, Thomas following her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Duchess approached the doorway to the Attic, she nosed it open gingerly- Hearing the familiar sound of enthusiastic freeform swing music.

Come now- I'll have no more bickering during supper.

Arranged neatly in that order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie had gotten slower, short of breath from trying to keep up with her brothers. The posh young cat's eating habits had been drifting more and more into decadence. After the little adventure which had prompted Thomas O'Malley, Scat Cat, and his little entourage to move in with them, Madame Adelaide choosing to use her home for a stray shelter, Marie had taken to a sort of hedonism, spending much of her time luxuriating in attention and respect of all the other cats, taking the time to indulge in her wishes to be ladylike, patrician, and growing rather gourmand- emphatically eating whenever she got the chance, consistently lounging on a nice warm pillow with a small stockpile of delicacies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lavishing lifestyle which she so readily engaged in had affected her figure thoroughly. She even seemed to be proportionally more overweight than Scat Cat. Her great round belly filled the space between her legs, thick haunches hugging its shape as it hung past her knees, to about her ankles, when she stood on all fours. Her face seemed to be one big soft sphere, wide jowels and bulging chin which hung low, shaking when she moved and pinching her little snout between them. The bow around her neck was redone several times over to be looser- and still it looked tight on her, making her face appear extra puffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, she would continue to eat- and eat, and eat and eat and eat. Spoiling herself with heaps of rich, savory treats, sometimes even demanding that members of Scat Cat's band go and bring her something more to eat, as she just lazily reclined on a cushion nearly as plush as her own headquarters. Well, demanding, requesting, or pleading- whatever would work best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering her gluttonous tendencies, Marie had- several times over as her appetite grew- requested more food at actual meal times. From increased portion sizes, to a new bowl that could hold increased portions. Of course, that was up to Duchess, Thomas (to a lesser extent), and the new butler- who had been hired to replace poor old Edgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all sat down to begin their supper, Marie took her place at her own bowl. Her  continued requests, to increase her food intake even more, had all been...</span></div></div>",

Of course, she ate far faster than either of her brothers or even Duchess and Thomas. Despite her highbrow self aggrandizing attitude towards herself and her habits, her gluttonous nature was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie took big bites from the enormous portion size she'd been given, being sure to get as much as she possibly could into her mouth at once every time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little bowl had been replaced with a full sized one, and subsequently- an actual spare serving bowl from the collection of dishes intended for humans. It was about two or three times the size of either of her brothers' bowls, and even then it was filled to the absolute limit of its capacity, the food piled up several inches above the top of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's fat jowels wobbled gently as she ate, eager to indulge in the fine high quality feed which had been provided for her meal. Even though her large, distended, broad belly was already full- she'd been eating from a plate of sweet fruit up in the attic before dinner, and eating a package of biscuits one of the stray cats had managed to obtain for her before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she'd been actively working to keep her stomach constantly full, Marie's weight had been skyrocketing recently as every behemoth meal and snack she gleefully luxuriated in consuming was inevitably digested into more and more fat, the small white cat puffing out further and further with flab each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, her stomach was full enough for every bite of food she swallowed to visibly make it grow larger- tighter- more packed than it was before, inching closer and closer to touching the ground, spreading wider and wider, forcing her pudgy limbs to spread more and more to make room for her own growing girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter managing to finish her meal first, despite the fact that it was the largest of all- Marie's bloated face wobbled gently as she pressed a paw to her mouth, trying to suppress an unladylike burp. The motion of which causing the doughy life preserver of jowel, cheek, and chin fat practically engulfing her little head to quake subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma!\" Marie spoke up, catching Duchess and the other's attention. \"I've already finished my \u00e9ntre. May I have a second course, please?\" She asked sweetly, this was a new request from her- though not too surprising. The corpulent cat, who'd already gotten visibly larger from just the one course, had been trying to find more and more ways to coerce still more food for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she'd ask for seconds...\" Berlioz muttered, prompting a raised eyebrow and a scoff from Marie as she glanced his way, her bulbous neck and face fat dressing into thick folds as she turned her head slightly to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ex<i>cuse</i> me for having a healthy appetite that I want to sufficiently fulfill. I suppose I should <i>starve</i> myself.\" She spat, prompting Toulouse to roll his eyes. Marie turned back to Duchess, pouting as best as she could- her large shining eyes framed by her cherubic cheeks. \"<i><b>Please</b></i> momma? I <i>did</i> finish early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchess hesitated, before sighing. \"Oh...alright- After all, how else is a growing girl like yourself supposed to fill out properly without a hearty diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie beamed delightedly, licking her chops as her bowl was refilled, with just as much as before. She began to stuff herself yet again, and she was absolutely planning to beg for a third course after she glutted herself again- maybe even a fourth!</span></div></div>",

Not to mention the fact that she was almost perpetually eating anyway, with the constant stream of snacks being given to her by the dozen odd eager to please former stray cats who were lodged in the home. Some were willing to really suck up to such a high-class figure as Marie, even fulfilling requests she had to keep on feeding her in her sleep, so she wouldn't need to \"starve herself\"- going so long without eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was willing to try and stop Marie's ceaseless indulgence, her immediate family was either too laid back and permissive or too polite and permissive to say anything, aside from some light teasing from her brothers. Though all in all, everyone in the house- from her Momma to Tom, to the small staff keeping the place running to the strays living in the shelter, even to Scat Cat and his band- Everyone seemed perfectly willing to spoil Marie's brains out, politely obliging her frequent requests for even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...she got fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i><b>fatter.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrequently binging to the point where her belly became taut, only to keep on eating the second she digested enough to fit more in- lard began to steadily pile on to the young wealthy cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer white furry belly blimped out like an avalanche of flab, pushing all four of her little legs apart even as they grew thicker and thicker as well, until she was lifted off the ground- her stomach larger than her legs were long. Not that that stopped her from eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rump had filled out tremendously, bloating out with flabby heavy mass, rotund yet soft and depressed by its own weight. Same as her face, having accrued so much fat that it had a great big squishy set of bowels, which wobbled and jiggled and squished around her little face. Her limbs were also doughy thick dollops of fat, hanging off her torso and resting on her sprawling belly, her little paws poking out. Even smaller parts of her body like her snout and her toes had a good inch or two of fat on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince all her fat was so soft, but so heavy- she had the vague appearance of a great big dollop of icing. Maybe several enormous bags of dough stacked on top of each other- one huge one for her belly, two big ones for her butt, four smaller ones for her limbs, and a slightly littler one for her head- the shape of a tiny cat mostly swallowed up, buried in the veritable ocean of fat, only apparent in the little soft face and pudgy wiggling toes sticking out. Her greedy little mouth often readily opening, as a helpful cat would feed it strawberries dipped in cream, or pieces of cooked chicken- more and more and more food to make sure this growing girl would <i>keep</i> growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll told, at this point Marie had managed to eat herself up to a weight of nearly 600 pounds.</span></div></div>",

They had even let the alley cat named Thomas O'Malley become a part of their own family, for saving them. Things were now starting to get back to normal, with the inclusion of Thomas becoming a new husband to Duchess and a father for her three kids. It was a relaxing and rich life they lived with no problems or surprises to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until one day when there was a knock on the door, and when Duchess opens it she was greeted to none other then Scat Cat. She remembers him as the lead singer and trumpet player from a very jazzy band that allowed Duchess and her kids to stay and crash at their place, before they themselfes started to jam so heavily that they literally \"crashed\" it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't seen him or the other cats in the band in months, but she still remembered how Scat Cat looked. He had had a very simple outfit, consisting of a black bowler hat with a red stripe going around it and a red bow tie. She also remembers him always carrying around his trumpet that must be his most precious possession. But mostly Duchess remembered him for his body. She had heard about alley cats living a much simpler life with more time to be lazy and get bigger, but she hadn't seen anyone quite with a body like him He had a body that if it could speak it would say that it wasn't to picky when it comes to food. Having that black fur and such a big nice belly made him actually look kinda \"cuddly\" for Duchess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him now standing in front of her she saw that he still wore the same outfit as before, looking a bit slightly worn now but still the same. He still carried around the same trumpet as well. His body didn't seem that much changed either, \"But I wonder if he hasn't been losing some pounds?\" Duchess thought to herself as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to her senses Duchess said, \"Oh goodnees! This was certainly an unsuspected surprise visit of you. I have to once again thank you and your friends for saving us in the past.\" \"No problem my lady,\" Scap cat said in his raspy jazz voice. \"A cat and his friends does only what's possible to help a lady and her kids in need.\" \"Yes, but hadn't you been there the kids and I would have certainly been shipped in a crate to Timbuktu.\" Duchess said taking one of his paws and shaking it gently, \"I would be prepared to do almost anything to help repay you for your heroic work.\" \"I'm glad you said just that miss Duchess,\" Scat cat said tricky, \"You see since we saw each other last time things hasn't been going so well for me and the band. Many of us got different interests and went their own different ways. Some wanted to travel to London, Some to Rome, and some to Madrid. But for old Scat Cat not having much monkey in pockets things seemed dark. That is until I remembered my old friend, and now your great husband Thomas O'Malley told me about what a great place he had heard you and your kids where living in.\" Hearing this made Duchess wonder what her husband wonder what he had been bragging about to other cats before their love was true. \"I told him that if it was true he should take the chance to live as a king. Especially if it meant he would get to live it with a beautiful queen like you.\" Scat Cat said and kissed Duchess paw like a gentleman, making her blush her cheeks slightly. \"He told me he had been starting to feel something between him and you, and I said that he should do what his heart tells him is right.\" Duchess felt relief now thinking back to her worries that he had only been seeing her as luxurious status symbol. \"After saying that he told me that if I things went well between you two and not so good for me, I could just get here and have myself some roof above my head until I was on my feet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what he had just asked for Duchess asked for Thomas to \"get here this instant!\" Hearing his wife wasn't happy lead Thomas to quickly rush to the door meeting Scat Cat who was halfway in already. \"Thomas O'Malley, that wasn't yesterday.\" Scat Cat said and gave his paw a good shake.\"S-Scat Cat? What are you doing here?\" Thomas asked slightly confused. \"You should know.\" Duchess said upset, \"You where the one to give him an invitation to our home if needed.\" \"Feeling like he hasn't been paying much attention to what's been going on Thomas felt <b>really</b> confused now. \"Did I say that?\" \"You did my friend,\" Scat Cat said flanking in. \"You told me that I could get search for you for help if you would make it big, and I got to say that with this...\" Scat cat said feeling the new diamond decorated collar Thomas was now sporting. \"I say you have been making it pretty big.\" Starting to remember what he might have said last time seeing Scat cat now Thomas was starting to get a little sweaty standing there with them. \"Well?\" Duchess asked Thomas with her arms crossed. \"I might have made a little promise to him some time in the past...\" Was all Thomas could say before seeing Duchess walking away angrily. \"Ohno, Scat Cat don't move!\" Thomas said before chasing after Duchess. \"Alright I won't!\" Scat Cat shouted back as he stood still in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchess walked into another room before stopping and letting Thomas catch up. \"Wait, Duchess!\" Thomas shouted, \"Can you tell me what's wrong?\" \"You don't know that?\" Duchess asked frustrated. \"You just go around and gives other cats promises to live with us without telling me.\" I know I said to him that I was prepared to do almost anything to him for saving me and the kids.\" Duchess continued talking without giving Thomas a chance to speak, \"But I just can't let any unknown street cats to walk inside my house. How do I know that he won't try to steal anything, or invite some of his friends without my permission?\" Looking at Thomas for answers she saw him just stare blankly for a moment before realizing it finally was his turn to speak. \"I only did this once, and Scat Cat is the most trustworthy friend I know.\" He said. He got himself on his knees before saying to Duchess, \"I swear that if he's would create any problems I will toss him out personally.\" Looking at him for moment Duchess sighed and said \"Okay I trust you.\" Thomas got so happy over Duchess decision that he gave her a huge hug that surprised the white lady. \"But I'm still not sure how the kids will feel of having a stranger cat living with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Duchess and Thomas got back to the entrance of the mansion where they left Scat cat, they found him standing at the same place as before but with the kids climbing all over him. \"I stood still as I promised but the kids tried thier hardest to make me move.\" He said while one of the kids tried to tickle him, another tried to battle his tail, and the third tried to play his trumpet. \"It's okay, you can move now.\" Thomas said, much to Scat cat's relief. \"Kids, I know this will sound strange, but this stranger here will be staying here with us for a short while.\" Duchess tried to explain to her kids. \"What are you taking about mom?\" One of them asked. \"He's no stranger.\" The second one said. \"He's Scat cat.\" The third one said. \"You all remember him?\" Duchess asked surprised. \"Yeah!\" They all three said. \"He was one of the most funny and friendliest cat we ever met.\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at how happy her three children was to meet Scat Cat again Duchess looked at him and said, \"Since everyone else in my family would be more then happy to share our home with you, I think I myself would be honored as well.\" \"Well, thanks everyone for the great welcome, I'm very thankful to be under the same roof as you\" Scat Cat said gladly. \"Is there anything you would like to have us share to you?\" Duchess asked nicely. Just as Scat Cat was about to answer his big stomach started to growl loudly. The kids found it very funny and Duchess found herself giggling a little at it as well while saying, \"Some food I guess?\" That would sit fine.\" Scat Cat said as he was being lead by the kids to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope you know what you're doing.\" Duchess said to Thomas as they followed. \"Trust me, he will keep himself clean.\" Thomas said trustworthy.</span></div></div>",

To all dishes includes small bowl of milk to drink from.\" Duchess said as she listed all the dishes they could offer him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything in particular you would like to have?\" She asked. After sitting and thinking about it for a short while Scat Cat finally answered \"Yes.\" \"I'm sorry, but yes to what?\" Duchess asked confused. \"Yes to everything.\" Scat Cat explained. Duchess at first just nodded, and was on her way to tell the kitchen staff what to cook when she realized what he had said. \"I'm sorry, but...Did you say everything?\" \"Yes, everything my darling.\" Scat Cat said like it was the most natural thing to say. \"You really want to have 3 main courses, including a appetizer, a dessert and a bowl of milk next to it?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" Duchess brain was a bit confused for a moment before saying. \"I don't want to sound like I don't let you choose what you want to eat but, you know that it is a lot of food where talking about here?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you still want to have it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, Okay, got it.\" Duchess said as she headed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went of the kids walked up to Scat Cat. \"Why do you want to eat so much?\" one of them said. \"One of those dishes is often enough to feed us all for one day.\" Another one of them added. \"Well, you see kids this belly here...\" Scat Cat said and tapped his paw on it, \"Really likes food. And since I and the band broke up my belly hasn't been able to get to have a good meal in a long time. So I'm now using this as a way to give back to my belly all those great food dishes that it hasn't been able to get these last months.\" \"Wow.\" The red furred one named Toulouse said as he jumped up to the chair next to the one Scat Cat sat, and the stretched over to feel on his belly. \"So does that mean your belly has a life of its own?\" \"He he, You could say that my friend.\" Scat Cat chuckled, \"I try to see my belly as a friend that you would like to try and treat as well as possible, and not having been able to give it any good treats for a long time makes me feel guilty for not being able to make it happy.\" He said looking at the kid who he himself was looking at his own belly trying to see it as what Scat Cat had described to him. \"But now you are going to be treated like king.\" Scat Cat said slapping his belly. \"Being able to eat just as much as you want, with nobody telling you that you have had enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that Duchess was coming back from the kitchen together with servants who had Scat Cat's food on plates. Filling up the table where all kind of beutiful looking dishes that also smelled just as good. Licking his lips in excitement Scat Cat wasted no time in eating it. His manners were at first like a gentleman when he started with the crackers and grapes. On the salad too he eats it gently and didn't rush it. It wasn't until he reached the main courses when his belly took over control. The salmon and the chicken both got taken in huge chunks that filled his mouth as he chewed it, he then use a bit of the milk laying next to him to help wash it down. As he ate his stomach started to get stretched out by all the eating and making itself an obstacle for him to reach for the food. Halfway into it he had to jump up on the table to be able to reach the food and continue eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally done Scat Cat jumped down back to the chair and then down to the floor to find himself a place to lay and rest his stuffed belly. It was now around twice as big as it was before he had his meal. Walking to a nice pillow laying in a corner Scat cat could feel his belly pressing his legs aside a little as he walked, making him take wider steps. When he reached it Scat Cat laid his back down at the pillow, giving himself a chance to see himself just how much food he had managed to fit inside there. After having this great meal his belly now was about 6 inches long, 4 inches wide, and stood out 3 inches. Duchess walked up to him and asked if he had enjoyed his meal. \"Oh yes my dear, best meal in a long time.\" Scat Cat said rubbing his full stomach. \"Then I shall leave you now so you can get a chance to rest.\" Duchess said as she walked away, giving him a chance to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to rest his head and go to sleep the three kittens walked up to him to get a closer look themselves. Seeing the kids looking at his swollen gut Scat Cat smiled, patted his belly and said \"Impressed?\" \"Oh, yes!\" they all three said almost at the same time. Once again Toulouse was being a bit more curious then his sibligns as he walked up to Scat Cat and asked, \"Can I feel it?\" Liking this little kittens curiosity Scat Cat said, \"Yes, you can test and feel it.\" but he wasn't prepared for what the small cat was planning. Without any warning the little kid took kit and jumped right on top of his belly. Scat Cat was taken completely of guard by this and lost the air in his lungs for a second as the small kitten hit his stomach hard. Toulouse then took steps across the small but soft area and laid himself in a sleeping position. \"It's so soft that it's better then the bed. I'm going to sleep here tonight.\" \"Can we get to sleep with you?\" The female kitten named Marie asked. \"Sorry, can't. I've already called dibs on it.\" Toulouse said with his eyes closed. \"Hey, that's not fair!\" Marie shouted. \"Yeah, let us also get to test the belly bed!\" the third kitten named Berlioz said before they both to jumped up on Scat Cat's belly, trying to wrestle Toulouse to give them some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing not able to say anything before, Scat Cat now took his chance and shouted \"Stop! If you are going to sleep on my belly, you will have to sleep together.\" \"But we can't.\" Toulouse said. \"And why not?\" Scat Cat asked. \"Even if we want to share it with each others it's not big enough space for us all three.\" Toulouse explained. Thinking a bit Scat Cat got an idea. \"Listen all three of you. I can help you, but then I need something.\" He said. \"What?\" They all three asked at the same time. \"I want you to get that bowl with cream for me.\" He said and pointed up towards the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he said the three kittens managed to get the big bowl of cream back to him. As he got the bowl Scat Cat took it to his mouth, and then started to constantly swallow it. He didn't focus it on tasting the cream (even though what he did taste tasted fantastic.) but to get it all inside him. With his steady pace the three kittens could only watch in awe as his stomach started to grow out before their eyes. It became larger, wider and higher as he kept on taking in all the cream. When he finally was done he put the bowl away, and had now a stomach that was three times as big as when he had first entered their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a small burp Scat Cat then said. \"Is it big enough for you all three now?\" The kittens jumped up on it and had after a few moments each found a good spot to sleep on. \"Yes, this is great now.\" Toulouse said. \"As soft as a pillow, and as warm as our mom's heart.\" Marie said. \"The most wonderful bed I've ever felt.\" Berlioz said. \"Then I hope you all can start to go to sleep now. We wouldn't want your parents find out you're still awake this late.\" Scat Cat said before falling asleep shortly before the kittens did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night they both dreamed things. Scat Cat dreamed about how much more fantastic food that he could be testing, while all the three kittens had the same dream about making Scat Cat into the biggest and greatest bed of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens the next morning?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up the next morning the first thing Scat Cat had to do was to get the three kittens off his belly. Giving it a little careful shake he managed to wake up all three of them. \"Uh, What's happening?\" Marie asked. \"Is it an earthquake?\" Berlioz asked. \"No, it's just Scat Cat.\" Toulouse said still being half asleep. \"What do you want Mr. Scat Cat?\" Marie asked polite. \"It's the next day now, and I would like to get myself some breakfast before my stomach tells me to.\" Scat Cat said. \"But why's that so important?\" Berlioz asked before Scat Cat's stomach started growling, making it shake so violently that it made all three kittens fall off. \"Well, that was the reason why I wanted you of before I was getting really hungry.\" Scat Cat said before getting up and walking straight to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following weeks was turning out to become some of the most wonderful days in Scat Cat's life. Every day he was introduced to all new kind of amazing treats that the kitchen staff of the mansion could cook up. Everything from small pieces of cheese that you bite of from a toothpick, to big things like a big juicy piece of beef, or a huge cod that was served whole with it's head intact (Once Scat Cat was done everything left was a nice cleaned skeleton of the cod). And to finish it of he always had a glass of luxurious vine to wash it down with, which always leaved him a bit light headed and caused hiccups which made his whole body twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchess still didn't appreciate Scat Cat staying at there home, but sadly she seemed to be the only one thinking that. The kids really love him since he was there own personal sleeping bag, and Thomas was just happy to sit and talk old memories with an old friend. Duchess didn't want to take away everyone's fun, but she didn't either want Scat Cat to just live on their assets without doing anything. She tired to several times talk with him about it, but every time he just says that he's practicing and making music that he will use to get a contract on a studio before he can move out of the mansion. Duchess had to take his words on it since she had heard him sitting and practicing on his room almost every day for around some hours, and she didn't know how long making music would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she didn't know was what Scat Cat was really planning. He had been practicing his music yes, but the reason for it wasn't to make his music sellable, it was to prepare for a reuniting concert that he would have with his former band. He had secretly been writing letters that he had sent out to each of his former band members to invite them all over to Duchess Mansion for a surprise gig. The surprise being that she wouldn't know about it. The plan was then was to invite all other cats that lived nearby into it. There they would throw a giant party where everybody would eat and drink as much as they could take, before every single cat would have eaten so much that everybody would look as fat as him. \"It will be one heck of a night.\" Scat Cat thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day when preparing himself in the mirror Scat Cat took a good look at just how much his body had changed since he got here. He could see that he had got some added chins and his neck was starting to disappear. His arms and legs was more thicker and forced out wider thanks to his <b>huge</b> belly. It had been big since day 1 and was big enough for the three kittens to rest on it, but now it was in such a huge size that either Thomas or Duchess could probably get enough room to curl up and sleep on it. Maybe even both of them at once. After being done looking Scat Cat tried to put on his bow tie (that he had taken off before getting to sleep), only to discover he couldn't! He tried to stretch it and force it around his thick swollen neck, but all he could do was to tie a small knot around it and making it look like he was wearing a strange neck band instead. \"Well,\" He thought while looking at his reflection, \"You know you're getting really big when even <u>my</u> wardrobe is not fitting.\" He took it off and looked at the long band in his hand, and then laid it next on a table before putting on his hat and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to have his breakfast he met Duchess, who stopped to talk to him. \"Say, aren't you missing you're bow tie?\" She asked. \"Well...I though it was starting to get old, so I ditched it\" Scat Cat said. \"Are you sure it has nothing to do with this?\" Duchess asked and slaps his gut slightly. \"Maybe a little.\" Scat Cat admitted. \"Oh, and would you be so kind to do me favour?\" Duchess asked. \"And what's that?\" Scat Cat asked. \"I'm going to give myself a nice relaxing bath, and if there is a knocking on the door could you take it?\" \"Of course I can do that for you.\" Scat Cat said happily. \"Thanks.\" Duchess said and walked up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after promising it Scat Cat heard a knocking coming from the door. Walking over and opening it he was being greeted by...</span></div></div>",

(They had all been eating very little on their travels to the mansion, and now they really wanted to each have a real meal that could leave them satisfied.)<br>\r\nAt first Scat Cat didn't noticed that his friends wasn't behind him (mostly because he was to focused to point at all the expensive looking things to impress them.), but when he did he quickly figured out that food was the most likely reason for them to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the kitchen he could see that all four of them where taking different stuff from the pantry and cooking their own favorite meals out of it. (Duchess and her family liked to try out things from all different parts of the world, so finding something to suit both the English, Italian, Russian and Chinese kitchen was actually quite easy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was such a huge kitchen all four of them had more then enough space to work on their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeppo was making a Spaghetti Bolognese, using a pasta machine to make the pasta straws, and cooking what smelled like a super delicious pasta sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit Cat was strewing up a beef stew filled with beef, potatoes, and several kind of vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShun Gon was putting up tray filled with small samples of carefully made Sushi bits.

(Plus since he still hadn't had breakfast he felt like he could maybe have some of it, once they where finished.) He was pretty surprised also by how large portions of food they all made. Even thought each one was made just for the cat making it, it still looked like it could be enough food to give 1 or 2 other cats a great meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Is that you in the kitchen?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Now!\" Scat Cat whispered, and pushed his friends from their finished plates. He saw the open door to the pantry, and quickly stuffed them all inside and closed the door just when Duchess came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scat Cat?\" she said, confused over what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Duchess.\" Scat Cat said, trying to act cool over the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She said, before seeing just how much stuff that had been made in the kitchen. \"What is all this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, food?\" Scat Cat tried to give as a good enough answer, but he could see in Duchess's eyes that she wouldn't take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...just felt like making some breakfast for myself.\" Scat Cat said, trying to sound as honest as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never want to do anything remotely related to work. You always asks the staff to make all kinds of meals for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and that's why I decided to this time do it all myself. Just so they wouldn't need to work so hard in the kitchen today.\" Scat Cat said, and started to sound more and more convincing in what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is it so much plated here? It looks like just one of these dishes would be enough to feed even your big stomach.\" Duchess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would think so, but I'm actually so hungry today that I felt for eating more then I usually do.\" Scat Cat lied. (Even thought he was feeling very hungry at the moment, not even he believed that he could eat a four course meal at once.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly to Duchess and Scat Cat the door to the pantry had opened up a little bit, and Scat Cat's friends where peeking out to see how everything was going. (Luckily Duchess had her back turned against them, so she didn't notice the other cats watching it all.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Hit Cat asked.<br>\r\n\"It looks like Scat Cat is making Duchess believe that he has made all the food for himself.\" Peppo answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's big, but can he really eat all of it?\" Shun Gon asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he touches my Soup I will go out there and stop him!\" Billy Boss said angrily, and was about to step out when he got stopped by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

So good in fact that even before he knew it he had already finished the dish before Duchess had even started prepping for her sandwich. Looking down he could see that his stomach was looking about as big as it tend to do after a meal, and he still only felt half full after what he had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could have time to eat one more thing before Duchess is finished.\" Scat Cat thought, feeling really excited to taste the others things his friends had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Looks like he's going for your dish next, Hit Cat.\" Peppo said, and he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScat Cat walked over to the big bowl of English Stew, and he was so eager to eat that he decided to sweep it down with no spoon. He lifted the thing to his mouth and swallowed it all. The sauce, potatoes, meat, and vegetables all when down his throat, with no signs of taking it slowly. (He had it all touching his tongue before it went down, so he got a chance to also taste it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again he had finished the thing much quicker then he had planned, and all that proved what he had done was his now very bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your food Hit.\" Peppo said, with Hit Cat simply giving a depressing \"Aw, man.\" as his response to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Duchess he saw that she had just finished he sandwich, and was about to start eating it. \"I might as well join her in the eating instead of just standing here.\" Scat Cat thought, and while he did feel very full right now, the smell of the remaining food was enough to make him want to have more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to pick?\" He asked himself as he looked at the bowl of noodles, and the soup with bread next to it. \"Well I already have had something that was close to soup so...\" Scat Cat thought as he reached for the noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going for your noodles, Shun.\" Hit Cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Why, oh why me?\" Shun Gon said to himself, as he could clearly hear Scat Cat slurping up his noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Scat Cat almost didn't remember his friends hiding in the pantry, and that it was them who made this food. He was just enjoying it so much that he didn't even thought about how loudly and sloppy he was eating. He was slurping up noodle strings loudly and smacking his lips every time he had finished swallowing one. This process of eating several pieces of noodle at ones when one for a small time, and just as quickly as with the two previous dishes Scat Cat finished it up with an empty bowl and an even fuller stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point he had now made his belly about twice as big as it usually is after full meal, and he even felt like it was starting to hurt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Duchess, it looked like she was almost finished with her sandwich. \"I guess I wouldn't need to eat the last one.\" Scat Cat thought, but seeing the soup bowl with fresh bread to dip into it looked so good that he couldn't help but wanting to finish what he had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as she hasn't finished her meal I should continue eating.\" Scat Cat thought and did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like I thought. He isn't leaving any dish untouched.\" Peppo said, from watching from the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I haven't eaten anything for a long time, and I'm not letting that fat cat my own made meal!\" Billy Boss said, and the other three tried there best to keep him from opening the door fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it!\" Peppo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let us get kicked out!\" Hit Cat added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just eat something here?\" Shun Gon asked, and that's when it hit them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey where inside a pantry. Filled with FOOD. It wasn't anything stopping then from taking something to please their hunger. In fact Scat was pretty much doing his best to not let Duchess notice that they even existed. The least they could do was to take advantage of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's dig in!\" Peppo said, and they all started immediately to dig in to all the kinds of food the pantry held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScat Cat himself was also heavily digging into what was left for him to eat. He knew that you should first dip and eat the bread next to the soup, so he made sure to take them in quickly so he could get to the main star of the dish. Just like with the stew he decided to skip the spoon and gulp it all down. This was even easier to take down then the stew, since the only solid thing from the dish (The bread) had already been taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished he cleaned his cheeks from food remains, and saw looked over at Duchess to see that she had finished her sandwich since long, and had pretty much stared at his whole display with the soup. She didn't looked as shocked or disgusted as she looked \"Fascinated\" over it. Looking down Scat Cat could see at least one reason to why she would think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four meals that all was the size of what he would be use to eat Scat Cat's belly now was about three times the size it use to be when he was completely stuffed. He could also feel it, since the pains of eating so much now started to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his hurting stomach in his arms Scat Cat looked up at Duchess and said, \"See. I told you that I was that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you where right.\" Duchess said, before deciding to leave the kitchen and Scat Cat alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she though as Scat Cat immediately went to the pantry to tell his friends that the coast was clear and how sorry he was about eating their food. But as soon as he open the door, he got a bit surprised by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the pantry laid all four of his band friends on their backs, with big bellies and a very emptied pantry. They all looked very stuffed, but none of them could even get close to Scat Cat's belly size. (But they all looked to be about the same size he was when he had been having his first meal at the mansion, so they where going in the right direction.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, should have know better then to let four hungry cats hide in a pantry.\" Scat Cat jokingly said, as he helped them all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you ate all the food that we made for ourselves, so we thought this would make it more even.\" Billy Boss said, as he got pulled up by Scat Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you all now follow me to your secret hiding place where you will be hiding, I will promise that I will bring you food there regularly.\" Scat Cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it be as much as this time?\" Peppo said jokingly, and Scat Cat said back that \"He would do his best to try and live up to that.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm just trying to help! We need-you need to win this!\" Mike called out after him, Sulley turned around furiously,<br>\r\n\"Win? Win?! Is that what this is all about?!

They were throwing a big party for Randall who was competing in the challenge against him. <br>\r\nEveryone was invited to Randall's party, even the professors. Everyone except OK. <br>\r\nSulley scowled at the huge house, he knew he had to win this. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him.<br>\r\nLiterally.<br>\r\nAgain.<br>\r\nMike was standing an inch away from him and he threw a loofah at Sulley's head. <br>\r\n\"Wishing you were there huh?\" Mike stared at Sulley disappointedly with his eye.<br>\r\nSulley then smiled, he got an idea. <br>\r\n\"Mike, don't worry, I'm gonna win this. There's no way I'm letting ROR win. OK is the best frat.\" <br>\r\nThat brought a knowing smile to the cyclops's face, \"I knew you would say that.\" <br>\r\n\"Now go! We will win this!\" <br>\r\nThen Sulley ran as fast as he could to the grounds of the next challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so dark he couldn't see a thing, but he was sure that if he got to know the course, he would be sure to win it. <br>\r\nSulley climbed over the construction fence with ease, he knew that no one would be there this late at night. <br>\r\nSulley was prepared to see the most terrifying course imaginable since everyone was obsessing over his terrifying it would be. <br>\r\nBut to his surprise- it was the most simple course he had ever seen. Just a straight run with zero twists or turns. It wasn't even that lengthy as well. <br>\r\nThe blue monster was...let down. <br>\r\n\"It hasta be the urchins, that's what's difficult about it.\" Sulley assured himself, <br>\r\nHe climbed a ladder upwards and saw four large wooden boxes with the words \"DO NOT TOUCH.\" On them. <br>\r\nRules would hafta wait, Sulley needed to see these urchins, and fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSulley carefully opened the lid of the nearest box, inside the box were at least millions of tiny, glowing, bright green urchins. The beast had to stifle a laugh, \"This is what is so scary?!\" He chuckled while reaching out to grab one. <br>\r\nIn the midst of his silent laughter, the urchin's spiked puffed out and jammed themselves into Sulley's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He cried out, when suddenly: the hand that he was holding it in began to puff and swell out and get bigger. Soon he was left with an enormous hand. <br>\r\nTrying to get the urchin off, Sulley shook his swollen hand as hard as he could. <br>\r\nIn the middle of the chaos with his hand, Sulley lost his balance and grabbed onto the box of urchins for dear life. Sulley saw the urchins close to pouring out on him. <br>\r\nOut of choice Sulley fell, the fall was nothing too major  but the urchins spilling out of the box was. The blue monster ducked for cover, but one stuck to his butt, he could feel it puff and swell up, then another hit his tummy. That began to feel heavier and heavier and closer to the ground. <br>\r\nBut the last urchin, fell right into the bloating beast's maw. Sulley reluctantly swallowed it, scared for his life. Then all of a sudden, something surprising happened:<br>\r\nSulley liked it. <br>\r\nThe urchin was delicious, the best thing Sulley had ever eaten. He looked around the small arena and saw that it was full of them. <br>\r\nSuddenly: Sulley lost every care in the world and began stuffing himself with urchins, getting fatter and fatter with every bite. He on purposely stuck two on his asscheeks to make them get bigger and bigger until they were larger than a couch. <br>\r\nThe greedy beast knew that this would be a long night.</span></div></div>",

He had trouble walking but once he had gotten the hang of it he moaned when he felt his cankles and asscheeks rub together while walking.

Why was everyone so scared of them? They turned Sulley into a sexy beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea struck the blue blob, he put on a new tighter shirt to expose his rotund gut and a pair of shorts which were now practically daisy dukes on him.

He made Linguini sprinkle spices, pour various liquids, stir, and mix the soup in front of them. It smelled wonderful. Remy lifted the ladle towards his head and made him lift his chef's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing little chef? What if someone sees you!\" Linguini whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy leaned forward and sipped the soup. It tasted even better than it smelled. Remy could taste every individual ingredient run across his tongue. Remy leaned his face forward into the soup and greedily slurped all of it down. A small bump appeared on his otherwise flat stomach, but Remy did not notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could use more thyme,\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had Linguini put his hat back down and then had him grab a handful of thyme. He sprinkled a measured amount of it into the soup and then mixed it thoroughly. He once again had Linguini lift the ladle towards his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're scaring me, little chef,\" He whispered, trying to be inconspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy dipped his snout into the soup and gulped it down. He was right about the thyme; the soup was perfect after adding that one simple ingredient. He finished off the ladle's worth of soup and then dipped it back down for another round. He finished off the second ladle and then jumped when he noticed his belly. It had rounded out to a little under the of a tennis ball. He had Linguini return to cooking and did not sample anything else for the rest of their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinguini stepped outside of the restaurant after finishing his shift. He took his hat off, put Remy on the ground, and looked at the soup filled rat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that little chef! I know the importance of taste testing, but you've produced perfect soups without taste testing in the past! And anyway look at yourself; you're getting fat! I can't hide a fat rat in my hat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy dropped his ears. Linguini instantly felt bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little chef... you know I'll feed you at home, and I'll even sneak you ingredients to eat, just don't test the soup. people could see you, and that's not good for either of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinguini packed up his things in preparation for the moped ride ahead of them, but before they left, Emile appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Remy!\" he scampered over to him. \"I see you finally took my advice and put on some weight! Maybe you won't be so miserable in the winter now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emile I haven't put on weight, I just needed to test something for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that to your belly! You're bigger than me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy got a good look at himself. Emile was right, Remy was noticeably larger than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinguini started to turn around and Emile scampered into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little chef, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinguini arrived at Gusteau's for the early shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he placed Remy into his hair, he reminded him \"No taste testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to the station and began to prepare the first soup of the day. It was not long before the delicious smell wafted up to Remy's sensitive nose. He tried to hold himself back, but he couldn't help it. He had linguini set down the ladle he was holding, and pick up one almost 2 times bigger. He lifted a ladle-full of soup up to the hat and leaned his face into the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little chef no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy wasn't listening. He gulped down the ladle. He forced Linguini to get another one, then another one. Remy was in the process of slurping down his 4th when somebody noticed Linguini holding the ladle to his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linguini! what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was just... inspecting the bottom for dirt,\" he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"get back to work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy's belly had ballooned outwards to the point where he had to reach over it to grab onto Linguini's hair. Remy felt like a hefty rock sitting on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shift went on without any more interruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinguini slammed the back door closed and then grabbed hold of Remy, talking to him while he was still in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a problem! Your body literally squishes in my hand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed him onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you even run away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy tried. His legs were just long enough for him to drag his chubby body across the ground at a snail's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know why I trusted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy drooped his ears, knowing it would win him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence, and then Linguini said, \u201cFine\u2026 you get one more chance, but that's it!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They needed to figure it out fast since they only got until the second sunrise to brake the curse before it would be permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rest under a tree as shelter for the night, since the castle would be a bad place to be in with her mothers state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day knew that the first thing to do would be to get some breakfast before starting to search for the answer. After testing simple things like berries and the water Merida found a great way to get food, getting fish from the river. Along the river they could see a lot of fish swiming and jumping across the river, a couple of those would keep them feed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her mother watched Merida took and used her hunting skills to catch some fishes, which they then cooked over an open fire. When the fish was cooked the both started to eat. Queen Elinor tried at first to eat just as elegant as she had been doing before in her life, but sooned found out that with her new bear paws it wasn't that easy. She realized that she would be forced to eat it more like an animal would, which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a whole salmon Elinor got a real hunger for it and decided to try and catch some more. Once in the river she found that to be as much harder then she thought as well. Merida was just looking on and laughing at her mothers failed attempts, and then started to walk up to her to offer her help. But as she approched Merida saw her mother acting a bit strange, and when she got closer she growled at her. Taken completely by surprised Merida took and backed off, letting her mother hunt for fish on her own. It all felt so weird to her. It was like it wasn't even her mother anymore, but a real bear standing infront of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more failed tries her mother finally took and catched a fish which she swallowed whole. After doing soo her mother started to act weird again, and looked around like she didn't know where she had been a moment ago. Merida was at first unsure to walk up to her, but she could see in her eyes that it was mer mother looking at her again. Once together again there was a small silence at first, but then Merida tries to figure out what had happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her mother couldn't speak as a bear Merida made sure to include every detail and watch every single expresion that her mother gave as help. \"What just happen mom was that when you couldn't catch a fish at first you became more aggressive and wild, and once you finally caught one fish and ate it you became normal again.\" She could see that her mother looked completely shocked over hearing this. \"What I guess is happening is that your hunger some how helps releasing the so called beast from inside, and eating food helps putting that under control.\" She could see that her mother had a hard time believing this reason for her acting. \"Yes, I know that it dosen't make any sence either, but it's the best explanation I can find.\" Her mother seems to accept the whole explanation better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the first thing we need to do is to give you lots of food to eat.\" Merida said and saw how her mother gave a very surprised facial expression by what she said. \"We need to do this to make sure that the beast inside of you stays there longer.\" Merida said and saw how her mother was holding her front paws on her stomach area as to tell her something. \"You may look fat afterwards, but it's what must be done. The only thing left is to think out what to do to feed you well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some moments of thinking Merida finally got an idea that was...</span></div></div>",

Zipper flew down to see what Gadget had found. She examined the bottle and at first glance it was nothing special. The bottle was white with a simple hand written label and stood at the same height of Gadget. One the label she read 'Increase I.Q. supplement'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis peaked her interest as she looked around for a notebook. She found one not too far and opened it looking through the pages. And there she found it, half way through the book she found the experiment. \"Looky here Zipper,\" she called out. Zipper flew to her as she began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intelligence enhancer, can increase one's intelligence for about 8 hours,\" she said with amazement, \"Wow Zipper who would have known he could make something like this!\" She then walked back to the bottle and opened it. \"Huh, it's still full. I guess Prof. Nimnul never used it. It good thing that he did not or we would have been in trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed the bottle and put it into her makeshift wagon.

Monterey Jack and Zipper was off on a little adventure, most likely involving cheese, Chip and Dale was at the police station hoping to find a mission, and Gadget was home working on her latest invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget was having a hard time with her newest creation. She has been trying to get this machine working for the past month and she can't figure out what is wrong with it. Right now she has just been looking at it hoping for some sort of inspiration to pop into her head. \"Why can't I figured this out,\" she said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped off her chair and began pacing back and forth across her room. She looked around her room to see if there was something in her room that can help with her problem. That's when she'd eyed the bottle at the corner of the room. \"No, I shouldn't. I have not tested it yet,\" she said trying to discourage herself. She then looked back at her invention and then back to the bottle. \"Well maybe one pill won't hurt,\" she said as she approach the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the bottle and took out one pill. The pill was smaller then normal pills, as if it was made for someone small. She held it for a bit feeling nervous about what she's about to do. \"Well bottom's up,\" she said biting into it and in no time she ate the entire pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget just stood the waiting for something to happen. Soon she began to feel a tingly sensation in her head, and as soon as it started it ended. Wondering if it work she walked back to her table and examined the invitation. Almost instantly she know what was wrong and she squeaked in excitement. \"It work, golly it work,\" she jumped with joy. She quickly got on her chair and began working on the device.</span></div></div>",

When she began to feel the pill's losing its effect it was already 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 8 hours after she took the pill.<br>\r\nShe sat on her chair feeling exhausted as she looked at her device. \"It's almost finished,\" she said softly, \"that pill help me do more in one day then in an entire month!\"<br>\r\nShe felt her tiredness grow as she was struggling to stay awake. \"This must be a side-affect of those pills,\" she said as she got up from her chair. She slowly walked to her door and opened it. Just her luck Chip was walking by.<br>\r\n\"Hey Chip I'm a bit tired today so I'll be going sleep a little early.\"<br>\r\n\"Now, but its only 5 in the afternoon? What about dinner, Monterey is cooking a new cheese dish he just learned today,\" he said looking concerned.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Chip but it's been a long day for me. Tell Monty to leave some extra for me if I wake up later.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok Gadget, you go rest I'll tell the gang.\"<br>\r\nThanking him Gadget closed the door. It was not uncommon for Gadget to pull all nighter or be so focus on her work that sometimes she would not com out in days, so Chip did not feel anything was out of the ordinary as he walked to the main room.<br>\r\nGadget closed her door and walked to her bed falling on to it too tired to change her clothes as she covered herself with her blanket drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost 5 hours into her sleep when she began to move around in her bed. She then opened her eyes and got out of bed. \"Why that was a great sleep!\" She then felt a rumble from her stomach. \"Golly that sleep made me hungry, hope there is some food.\" <br>\r\nShe left her room and into the kitchen. There on the stove there was a large pot half her size that smelled like cheese. She went to the pot and took it to the table. Opening it and it was half full of some cheese stew. She licked her lips and grabbing a large spoon she started eating.<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of eating she dropped the spoon on the floor and grabbed the pot lifting the it up over her head. Drinking the rest of the stew in a matter of minutes while spilling some of the content of the stew on her jumpsuit. With a belch she place the pot back down on the table. <br>\r\nShe rubbed her small belly as she walked to the fridge. Inside was full of cheese, fruit, and pastries. Right away she started to devourer the content of the fridge. Within a half hour she emptied the entire fridge.<br>\r\nStill hold on to her grown belly she walked back to her room. As she walked through her room she past a full body mirror. When she saw herself in the mirror she gave a small squeak in shock. \"Golly, what a ugly suit I'm wearing,\" she said as she inspected her cheese covered jumpsuit. She then unzipped her suit allowing it to drop to the floor.<br>\r\nNow she looked at her underwear clad body. \"Ah much better.\" She looked at herself once more as she began to frown. \"Wow, look how skinny I am! I guess I should get more food,\" she said as she patted her small bulging belly.<br>\r\nShe went to her closet and looked for clothes to wear. After a while of searching for the right clothes she finally chose the right ones that she wanted. She was wearing a short pink jogging pants and a large white crop top.<br>\r\nShe walked out of the Rangers headquarters and saw the Rangers Plane. She hopped in and looked over the controls. \"Um how dose this work,\" she questioned as she scratch her head. After pulling a couple of leavers and pedals she gave up. She hoped out and climbed down the tree instead, heading to the city.</span></div></div>",

She then wondered around the store until she found what she was looking for; the doll section. Squeaking in delight she began taking clothes off the dolls that was similar to her size and after taking several that she liked she when to a display of a catwalk and began to try out her selection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strutted down the catwalk wearing her selection as sexually as she can, swaying her butt side to side. One of the clothes was a black tube top while another was a red two piece dress. But after walking down the walkway several times she finally settled on one she loved. It was a white gown dress that hugged her body tightly. Her belly now extended further from her then before she left was front and center, and as a bonus the dress was extra stretchy. With a piece of string she tide her hair into a bun and walked out the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squeezing herself through the crack and with her new dress she yelled into the city, \"tonight I party like there is no tomorrow!\" And with a loud grumble from her stomach it gave its sign of agreement. </span></div></div>",

Changing out of her sleeping clothes and into her jumpsuit as she noticed something strange. As soon as she zipped up her jumpsuit it felt tighter, especially around her chest and rear. She looked around her inspecting the suit but couldn't find anything wrong with it, but she didn't think about it too much as her head ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned to her desk where her latest invention lay.

She knew what she wanted and she was going to get it. She quietly moved through the headquarters approaching the kitchen. Within seconds of entering the room she quickly went to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening it she became disappointed as there was only some fruits and vegetables. Quickly she moved to the shelves only to find flour and oats. Her stomach growled telling her to eat making her feel annoyed that they was nothing to eat in this darn place. With a disappointing sigh she left the kitchen and toward the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew frustrated as the streets was clear of trash tonight. Her stomach growled commanding her to find food as she headed to the city. Lucky she knew the best place to get food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour and a couple of garbage diving she reached her destination, a large grocery store. With a squeak of excitement as she rushed into the store. Inside the store was silent as the shelves was full of cans and package goods. She rushed down the isles toward the food she most desired; candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole isle was filled with package pastries, candy and chips. Her mouth watered thinking about all of the food she will eat. Without a moment notice she climbed one of the shelves and tore open the closest bag to her and dove into it. Within minutes she finished, existing the bag with a slightly larger belly. Licking her fingers she moved to the next bag, which was a bag of chip. With even less time she finished, her mouth covered in crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped from bag to bag leaving a trail of empty bags discarded on the store floor. One bag was filled with cheese puffs half the size of her. Another was filled with white powder mini donuts. With each bite her face became messier and her stomach became fuller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every bag it was getting harder to walk as her belly grew inside her stained white dress. She didn't feel guilty about stealing all this food as she tore open her tenth bag. She was having the time of her life gorging on fatty and sugary treats. Her stomach was as tight as a drum stick out quite a bit looking like she was several months pregnant. Even after her belly ache she kept eating as if that's all she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour has passed and the engorged inventor lay at the back of one of the shelves unable to move with over twenty bags of sweets was packed into her stomach. With one paw she rubbed her painful belly and with the other reaching for more food. Her stomach was so stuffed it was hard to breathe, let alone walk. But even with her stomach hurting, she still craved for more, as if her brain didn't know when she was full. Her breasts was being pushed up by her belly, covered by crumbs and dust. She licked her face try to clean all of the cheese dust and powder sugary. Although she still hungered she was starting to get another feeling; thirst. </span></div></div>",

When she did feel that she could move she placed her paws under her belly and with a lot of strain lifted herself up slowly until she was standing. It looked and felt like it was over twelve months pregnant and that's after it going down! She then moving one hand onto the wall slowly walked to the entrance of store. Normally she didn't want to move but she was motivated to get a drink regardless of the pain was telling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally outside, she moved slowly down the street. She didn't know where she was going but her feet pulled her forward to an unknown destination, she just hope it would led her somewhere where she can be quench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a while but finally found what she was looking for; a night club. And right below the night club was a small version of the big one made just for mice like her. She waddled to the small club as she noticed a small sign next to the entrance. She had a hard time reading it but she eventually did it. It read 'Free Girls Night! Free Drinks till 3'. After realizing what it said she smiled a wicked smile. She quickly dusted herself off trying to clean herself up as much as possible before entering the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music was blasting from the human club through the roof as several mice and rats dance on the dance floor. There was several standing tables scattered around the club and a sit down bar at one side. She immediately went to the bar grabbing a set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you have, deary?\" asked a fat balding rat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at the multitude of small bottles of alcohol trying to make a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the cheese vodka, miss, it's the best.\" a male voice came from the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice that one of the attendees grabbing a set next to her soon after she sat. She turned to see a sleazy looking rat with a sleazy smile on him. He wore a simple leather vest and was a little banged up in the looks department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh that sounds nice, bring as much as you got and keep it coming,\" she said to the bartender. With a shrug he left to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So baby, what's your name?\" the rat spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm...\" she started but paused. She couldn't remember her name! She really never needed to the last two nights she was out. She thought hard trying to remember anything what she was calling. Everything in her head was fuzzy at best as she didn't need to think except for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, um.. It's Ga.. Ga.. GARNET! Yes Garnet, it's Garnet!\" she bounced with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat almost fell off his chair from her outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a beautiful name Garnet,\" he started composing himself, \"I'm Rapper, nice to see a beautiful girl around these parts.\" he said as he looked at her paws for a ring. Then he moved his eyes to her gigantic belly, \"are you expecting soon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him puzzled, \"expecting? I'm not expecting anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... And where are you from, although I don't know how you are going to get back to heaven with wings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wings? I'm not a bird. And I live in a tree not this place called heaven.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot,\" he though, \"I found a stupid one. Has a bit of a belly but she still has a beautiful face, and look at that tits and ass. I'm going to have fun with this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just before he could make his move the drink came, a glass containing the vodka and its bottle. Immediately she grabbed the glass and gulped it down fast. Placing the cup down she grabbed the bottle, drinking it as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapper watched in amazement as she finished the bottle in no time. Before he could react she called the bartender for another bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are a thirsty girl, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no *hic* idea,\" she said as the other bottle came and started drinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I know a place where you can get as much to drink as you want,\" a sleazy smile crept on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet was already on her third bottle before looking at him. She now looked like she was about to fall asleep as she let out a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know *hic* I don't want to move at the *burp* moment.\" She then grabbed her forth bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe. It will be fun, believe me.\" He was now grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Burp* well?\" she thought as she drank her fifth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now trying to pull her away from the bar. But before he could continue a bystander came up to the bar and slapped some money onto the bar table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet ten that the girl can't drink a bottle of whiskey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet two,\" said another one cried out from the other side of the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWapper looked around seeing that several club members was looking at them, more specifically at her. He barely noticed but she had now down five bottles of vodka. All he was trying to get her drunk so he could have his way, not have her drink the whole bar, and he had to pay for all this too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're *hic* on!\" Soon she grabbed a bottle of whiskey that the bartender brought and down it. As so as she finished she had to hold on to the bar to keep herself from falling off the chair. The other bottle came and downed it the same as the other one. As soon as she finished she looked like she was going to puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURRP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon bets came pouring in to see how must she can drink before throwing up or passing out. Garnet was ecstatic, grabbing the next bottle of alcohol. With each bottle she drank the slower she gulped as her stomach was having a hard time finding room. But she didn't care, with a belly full of food and alcohol she was having the time of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn approached as she was surprised she found her way home. It was a slow and painful waddle to get here. She was kicked out of the club because she drank too much, but she did make a killing from all those bets she won. If she had a choice she would have went food hunting after all that alcohol she drank but she had a strong urge to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a stupid grin on her face she waddled up to headquarters door. Luckily for her, her stomach shrank when walking back home. Her stomach slowed digesting all of that food and alcohol. If she was sober enough she could have felt her body putting on fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeeze herself through the door with a pop making her fall unto her face. She let out a long burp before giggling. Eventually she got up and walked to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her she quickly took of her dress now standing in her now tight underwear. With a final slap to her belly she plopped herself on to her bed, quickly falling asleep. </span></div></div>",

Everything hurt as she shifted in her bed and if it wasn't for her headache she would have felt that she now sported a large beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in pain she slowly got out of bed trying to remember where she got this headache from. Sometimes she gets headaches when she works all night long, but she remembers that she went to bed early at six last night. She stomach growled but she was too much in pain to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away from her bed rubbing her temples not noticing how heavy she was from yesterday. She now weighed over fifty percent heavier than she did two days ago. She was wondering how she would remove the pain when she then remembered the pills. Yesterday morning she too had a headache, although much weaker, and after taking a pill the headache disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle was still in the same place as it was yesterday, so she lumbered herself to it unscrewed it. Quickly she took one pill out swallowing it. It took a while before she felt the becoming familiar tingling of her brain. In the beginning it was a bit painful with the tingling sensation but soon her headache vanish as she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon ideas flooded her mind gaining a urge to continue her invention. She went to her closet grabbing her jumpsuit. As she pulled it on she discovered that her butt and breasts felt very tight and a little bit with her stomach when she zipped her suit up, but thoughts of her invention quickly pushed any concern she had with her suit. Ignoring her jumpsuit's tightness when she walked she went to her work table beginning on her project.</span></div></div>",

He knew that when she was inspired she would lock herself away until she was done, but it was hard not to be concerned. He had a small meeting with Dale and Monterey concerning Gadget but they said not to worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though everyone says nothing is wrong, something was off. When ever he would pass her door a strong smell would permeate from her room, something sweet and salty, and something alcoholic? He couldn't tell, he just hope she was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGadget was working hard on her latest invention and totally unaware of the changes to her and her room. Ever since she started taking those pills she had tunnel vision for her invention and nothing else. Because of this she haven't noticed the changes happening around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was a mess with things that her other half brought home from her trips to the city. A few bottles of alcohol lay about with crumbs of food of food she brought home. Also discarded clothes lay about with pieces of machinery across the room. The room stunk with the smell of food and unwashed clothes. But Gadget didn't smell anything as she was to focus on what she was doing. She even didn't notice that she began to smell too from being unwashed for a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest change was her. She has grown massive over the past week, almost tripling her size. Her jumpsuit barely fit her as she had to keep it unzipped so her now gigantic bust and belly spilled out. Her breasts was now bigger than her head being held up by a makeshift bra that her other half had made. Her stomach hung low over her waist still taunt from last night binges. Her suit held tight to her shelf of a butt and expansive legs restricting her movements. If she had any awareness of her change she would have freaked out, but the pills prevent her from seeing anything besides her invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact she has grown addicted to the pills as it helped her with those morning headaches and helped her with her invention. She just grew and changed without her noticing as she worked.</span></div></div>",

The curse will keep Jake in his dragon form for one and no one, except Jake, would seem to care about that.  The curse increases his appetite and decreases his metabolism, making it easier for him to gain weight. One last thing is that everyone that Jake comes in contact with will want to feed him and fatten him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:  Young dragons around the world began to disappear lately.  Jake and Lao Shi were charged with investigating this, unaware that they were targets of a being or organization that likes to kidnap dragons, take away their ability to transform into their human disguises, heavily fatten up them up, and sell them as fat pets to those with such interest.</span></div></div>",

It was because today they were once again all being trained by small, but tough Lieutenant of the Bark Brigade named Lieutenant Pug. He was running everyone ragged. Expectly Lucky, Cadpig, and Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Move it cadets.\" Pug shouted at them.<br>\r\n\"Ugh! We've been running around the farm for hours.\" Lucky said tired.<br>\r\n\"Can't we at least take a break?\" Cadpig said just as tired as Lucky.<br>\r\n\"Could we...*huff*....at least...*huff*...stop for a snack?\" Rolly asked panting.<br>\r\n\"Typical whining from you three cadets.\" Pug said. \"Why can't you be like Captian Tripod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTripod was basically Pug's star pupil and the best of all the dalmatian cadets. He only had three legs, but it never stopped him from being as fit as he is. He told fitness as a big important part in life. Tripod was actually nearby Lucky and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Look at him. The perfect solider.\" Pug said.<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir.\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n\"Oh bother.\" Lucky said in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes, they were all done running. Good thing too, cause everyone was tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That's enough running for the day.\" Pug said. All the pups layed down to the ground. Lucky sat beside not by Rolly or Cadpig because they were a bit further out. Two of the pups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness that's over.\" Lucky said laying.<br>\r\n\"Good. Good. All of you cadets are making good progress.\" Pug said. \"You pups might be close to ready when the cats invade.\" Hearing that, everyone groaned.<br>\r\n\"Not this again with the cat invasion.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPug always feels that one day, the cats will invade and take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all have to be ready if that day comes. To motivate all of you, I shall now tell you one of my many war stories.\" Pug said. Once again, all the pups groaned.<br>\r\n\"Again? You got to be kidding.\" Lucky said not to happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Pug went on and on about \"blah blah battle\" and \"blah blah cats\". Lucky as well as some of the other pups were getting bored. Then Lucky's stomach started growling. He was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This pup's got a case of the munchies.\" Lucky said. He then looked at the two pups he was with. There names were Wags and Scooter. \"Hey Wags! Scooter! Can you guys cover me while I get a quick snack?\"<br>\r\n\"Will do.\" Wags said.<br>\r\n\"Just be quick. You know how Pug can be.\" Scooter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWags and Scooter then went in front of Lucky to cover him so he could sneak out. After some \"Excuse me.\" and \"Coming thru.\" Lucky was able to sneak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now to find a quick snack.\" Lucky said. \"I feel as hungry as Rolly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky looked in the troth, but their was no kibble to eat. So he decided to look somewhere else. After walking, Lucky just happen to bump into a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's this box?\" Lucky said investigating the box. As he does, the box reads LT. Pug. \"So this must be Lieutenant Pug's stuff. Do I risk getting in trouble by opening it?\" Lucky felt Pug would be too happy about him opening up his stuff. \"Know what? I'm gonna risk it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky then open up the box and sawed.....</span></div></div>",

So in these type of situations, the science division developed a special type of dog food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that got Lucky's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special dog food?\" Lucky asked.<br>\r\n\"Just eating a bit of it was like eating a day's worth if food.\" Pug said.<br>\r\n\"That's what I must have been what I ate.\" Lucky thought.<br>\r\n\"We made sure not to eat too much of it.

It looked really tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is a T-Bone Steak.\" Lucky said to himself. \"Just setting right here...on a plate...it the middle of the forest...where no one else is around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky saying that realized that all of this was JUST too good to be true. It HAD to be a trap. Lucky was smart enough to see that. He knew if Cadpig was here, she would tell him to ignore it. So that was what Lucky though he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, the steak look too delicious to pass. Even if a pup wasn't Rolly. Lucky had to either take the risk or just leave it.</span></div></div>",

Still fat from the kibble he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...hey guys.\" Rolly responded.<br>\r\n\"ROLLY!!!!!\" Shouted everyone else.<br>\r\n\"What happen to you?\" Lucky asked.<br>\r\n\"You look like you ate a whole sack of kibble.\" Spot stated.<br>\r\n\"I.....actually did.\" Rolly admitted.<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Lucky and Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Again. It's Rolly.\" Patch said. \"And after him rolling at us, that adds up to the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rolly was still on his back on the ground, the others observed Rolly for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are defientily rounder now.\" Two Tone stated while pointing his belly. It was also kinda wobbly. \"Squishy too.\" <br>\r\n\"So maybe I overdid it a little.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"A little? Rolly, overdid it is an understatement.\" Cadpig said. \"You are now overweight. You were already on the big side before.\"<br>\r\n\"Cadpig is right. You have to control that hunger of yours.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly knew that his brother was right. So he had to at least try to listen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I'll...try my best to control this belly of mine.\" Rolly said while patting his belly.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Lucky and Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Now...umm...can you guys help me up? Please?\" Rolly said trying to get up and failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the pups and Spot sighed and then tried to help him up. They knew that him with this extra weight was gonna make this a long day. Rolly agreed to try to control his hunger, but can he really control that stomach of his? It's a mystery. The next day....</span></div></div>",

Even if he ate an fair amount, he was still pretty hungry. It is Rolly after all. His stomach growled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on stomach. We just ate breakfast.\" Rolly said to his stomach. It continues to grumble and growl. \"We promised the others that we would control ourselves.\" His stomach growled even more. \"I know breakfast was more of a light snack then what we usually eat, but we promised the others we wouldn't over do it. So come on.\" His stomach did not listen to him. It just growled louder and louder. It wouldn't stop until he gave in. \"Alright! You win. I'll get something else.\" Rolly's stomach stopped growling after he said that. \"Now, there has got to be something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Rolly decided to find something else to eat. There was no kibble left in the troth and their wasn't any extra bags in the farm storage this time. So the only place Rolly could get food was the kitchen in the house. He goes through the doggy door (a bit of a tight squeeze, but gets out) and goes into the kitchen. But he had to be sure no one was watching him. Most of the pups were outside and the other pups were watching Thunderbolt on TV. No ones was in the kitchen, so this was the perfect time to get something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. The coast is clear.\" Rolly said to himself. So Rolly open the fridge and looked around to find some slices of meat, cheeses, and some other stuff. \"Perfect stuff for a quick sandwich.\" Rolly said. He then grabbed some bread and placed a slice down. He then topped the sandwich with slices of ham, turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, more ham, and then place the second slice of bread on top. With an olive and toothpick. The sandwich was as tall as he was. \"This should be good enough.\" Rolly said while eyeing the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Rolly picked up the sandwich and a quickly gulped it down. He did a small blech and then used to toothpick to get out the junk in his teeth. His belly extended a bit after eating the sandwich. \"That should hold me off til lunch.\" Rolly said. His stomach didn't growl this time. So he was satisfied for now. But he had to make sure no one knew about his extra \"snack\". Rolly knew that he promised not to overdo it to the others, but it seems like his stomach was calling all the shots.</span></div></div>",

For the next couple of days, Rolly continued sneaking in extra snacks during the days. Whether it was sneak eating more extra kibble while the others weren't looking, finding some unfinished scraps, or eating a turkey leg from the fridge, Rolly did it all. Each time he did slowly added up the pounds he was gaining. Rolly was getting more rolly by each passing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Lucky, Cadpig, Patch, Two Tone, and Spot were all curious on Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys wonder if Rolly is okay?\" Lucky asked the others.<br>\r\n\"He should be fine.\" Spot said. \"But then again.....\"<br>\r\n\"Knowing Rolly, he will let his hunger get to him.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"Has he even did anthing to lose the weight?\" Cadpig asked.<br>\r\n\"Last time I saw him, he was still on the...large side.\" Lucky said. \"Actually...now that I think about ir, I think he's put on a few more.\"<br>\r\n\"Did he really?\" Two Tone asked. \" I haven't really got a look at him tor a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright guys. Let's go find him.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pups and Spot decided to find Rolly together. Rolly was currently finishing off a blueberry pie. The crumbs and pie filling were all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...stomach, you are so bad.\" Rolly said to his stomach. \"We were suppose to stop overeating. But look at us now.\" Currently Rolly's belly grow an extra inch from before. It was also getting hard for him to walk cause his belly would get in the way. Rolly thought he could rest, but some angry pups came by wanting to shout at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROLLY!!!!!!\" Shouted Lucky, Cadpig, Spot, Patch, and Two Tone.<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAA!!!!\" Shouted a shocked Rolly. Then he looked at everyone. \"Oh! Hey...guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't 'hey' us.\" Lucky said. \"You were doing extra eating again.\"<br>\r\n\"What? No I wasn't.\" Rolly said nervously.<br>\r\n\"No you won't? Then how do you, um, explain the EVIDENCE ON YOUR FACE?\" Spot said to Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly did still had pie in his face. So he quickly licked it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can explain.\" Rolly said trying to come up with something. Nothing came explain.<br>\r\n\"You were still doing extra snacking, were you?\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"It was only the pie. I swear.\" Rolly said. It was a lie of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadpig went over to observe Rolly's belly size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...the diameter of your belly, definitely has increased.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Well that figures.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"What have you been eating\" Two Tone asked.<br>\r\n\"Umm...just a sandwich. A tall sandwich. Extra kibble, leftovers, a turkey leg, half a pizza, rib tips, a ham, and...that pie.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all that, everyone else was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't be surprised. Yet we are.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"I know I keep saying this, but it is Rolly.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"Rolly! You have to do something to control yourself.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"I tried. But it's like my stomach has a mind of it's own.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"You have to work on your willpower, Rolly.\" Cadpig said. \"Willpower is the best way to control yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"You might want to start having that.\" Two Tone said to Rolly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We are only looking out for you.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Rolly responded. \"I'll try my best to control this belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then tried to get up, but his belly was too big to make him move easy. So he...once again rolled to move. Saying bye to the others before rolling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rolly is really letting himself go.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"That stomach of his is going to get him in trouble.\" Two Tone said. <br>\r\n\"That's why we need someone to look after him.\" Lucky said. \"Make sure he doesn't get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"So who then?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...you Patch.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"Well you are tough, strong, and you do have a good eye...Patch.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Eye! Patch! Eye Patch! Hahaha!\" Spot said laughing. The pups gave out a serious look at Spot. \"Get it? Cause his name's Patch...and he has a good...eye.\" Spot started to feel awkward.<br>\r\n\"Anyway....\" Patch said ignoring the joke. \"Don't you guys usually look out for him?\"<br>\r\n\"Knowing Cadpig, she will most likely give Rolly this spiritual talk making him want to eat more.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"So true.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I resent that.\" Cadpig said not liking the comments.<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll keep an eye on Rolly.\" Patch said. \"Last thing we want is Rolly to be even more rolly polly.\"<br>\r\n\"HAAAAAAAA!!!!!! Rolly! Polly!\" Spot said laughing. \"Get it. Cause his name is Rolly...and he's\"<br>\r\n\"We get it.\" The pups said not inpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo pups decided that Patch had to watch over Rolly.</span></div></div>",

So far, he was still doing a good job. Rolly only ate when it was time to eat. Anytime he tried to sneak a snack, Patch would take it away from it. Rolly and his stomach weren't happy about it. But it was for his own good. He didn't gain any extra pounds, but his current weight lost: zero pounds. Rolly's legs still barerly touch the ground due to his belly lifting him a bit. Because of that, he had to roll to move. Patch had to help him lose some of the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at a part on the fields in the farm, he brought Rolly for some workout sess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Roll. Time to lose the belly of yours.\" Patch said to Rolly.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...do I have to workout?\" Rolly whined.<br>\r\n\"You have to. You can barely walk like that.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"I don't mind rolling. Rolly IS my name after all.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And not too long you almost rolled us over.\" Patch mentioned.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rolly's belly grumbled. Patch heard it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rolly......\" Patch said with a look.<br>\r\n\"I'm starving. I haven't ate anything in a while.\" Rolly said to Patch.<br>\r\n\"Willpower bro. Willpower.\" Patch said. \"Now. Try some pushups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushups were..difficult for Rolly to do with his current state. Not that he was any good at them to begin with. He was huffing and puffing just trying to do one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gh..aahhhahhh.\" Rolly grunted trying.<br>\r\n\"This...isn't going to work.\" Patch stated. \"You can stop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly stopped and then layed on his back still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huf...huff....hufff. That was hard.\" Rolly said. Patch just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rolly was still panting and Patch was still watching him, a truck came by to the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's with the truck?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's the kibble delivery truck.\" Rolly said getting up. \"It comes from the dog kibble factory every week to delivery the kibble for us.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? A whole truck?\" Asked Patch.<br>\r\n\"Well there are 101 of us here in this farm. We need a lot of kibble.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"Make senses.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly's stomach growled loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy belly. Willpower, remember?\" Rolly said to his stomach. But as he sees the truck and hear his growling belly. A few things come to his mind. \"Hmm.....I bet that truck has a lot of extra kibble.\" The idea of eating more made him drool. His stomach seem to really want to go for the kibble. But he knew Patch's was still watching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly was feeling conflicted again. Should he still listen to Patch and not go for it. Or should he listen to his stomach and sneak in some kibble.</span></div></div>",

He had an idea that might work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Patch?\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"What is it Rolly?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"How come you wear a rope, instead of a collar like everyone else.\" Rolly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(In the 101dalmatians series, Patch wears a rope around his neck. He's also a bit on the buff side. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Patch\" target=\"_blank\">http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Patch</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I glad you asked that Rolly.\" Patch said looking a bit happy. \"Remember when I would always rough with some of the other pups? See, when I still had a collar I....\" Patch went on and on about stuff. When he was going on about the story he looked away from Rolly. Rolly felt that this was a perfect opportunity to head for the truck.<br>\r\n\"Now's my chance.\" Rolly said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then rolled to the direction for the kibble truck. The two worker guys were currently grabbing the big sacks of kibble and brought them into the farm storage. Rolly had to wait a bit so he wouldn't get caught by them. One moment of waiting, the sack lifters weren't around the truck. So Rolly toke this as a perfect time to get to the back of the truck, where the kibble was. It was hard for him to get up on the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!!!! This is so hard.\"  Rolly said trying to get on the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one big pull, Rolly was finally able to make it inside the back of the truck. He panted a bit. But stopped to see a few sacks of kibble still on the truck. \"Food! Thank the heavens.\" Rolly said. Rolly took no time opening one of the sacks and started eating away the contain inside. But what Rolly didn't is that the delivery workers were done with the delivery already and close the truck's back door. Rolly stopped eating when he heard a loud door slam. \"Huh?\" Rolly said with his mouth full of dog food. He then realized the door was closed. \"Uh oh! I think I'm I'm going for a ride now.\" Since the delivery was the done, the truck was now heading back to the factory, with Rolly still in the truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of this was happening. Patch was still going on about is story and didn't know Rolly was gone. \"So that's why I wear this rope now. Pretty good story, huh Rolly?\" Patch said finishing his story. But after hearing no respones, he looked around finally realized Rolly was there. \"Rolly? Rolly? Roll?\" Patch started to have a panicked look on his face. \"Oh man. Lucky and the others are so not gonna be happy about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Patch freaks out about losing Rolly and Rolly was off to, who knows where exactly.</span></div></div>",

Realizing this, the only Patch could do was tell the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky, Cadpig, and Spot were currently all in the farmhouse watching TV. Patch had a really nervous look on his face. He didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....hey...guys.\" Patch said nervously. Lucky, Cadpig, and Spot turned around to Patch.<br>\r\n\"Patch? Uhhh...\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Where's Rolly? Aren't you supposed to watch him?\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"See...here's the thing. I've kinda....lost them.\" Patch told them. The others freaked out after hearing that.<br>\r\n\"You...LOST Rolly?!?!?\" Lucky, Cadpig, and Spot shouted.<br>\r\n\"How could you lose Rolly?\" Cadpig said angrily.<br>\r\n\"I turned my back on him for one second...\" Patch said. \"He just disappear.\"<br>\r\n\"Where was he the last time you were with him?\" Lucky asked.<br>\r\n\"Okay. I was trying to get him to exercise to lose some of that weight of his.\"  Patch said.<br>\r\n\"That seems like a lost cause.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was telling him the story on why I wear this rope instead of a collar after the kibble truck came in and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen him mention kibble truck and Rolly, all of them were thinking the same thing and what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys don't think....\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"That Rolly would be crazy and hungry enough to...\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on.\" Patch said. \"Do you guys really think that Rolly would....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatch stopped talking while Lucky, Cadpig, and Spot gave him a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Rolly!\" Lucky, Cadpig, and Spot saided at the the same time. Patch started to sweat. Then he ran to where the truck was. Lucky, Cadpig, and Spot also ran and followed them. They went to where the truck was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was where the truck was.\" Patch told them.<br>\r\n\"It's already gone.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"And so is Rolly.\" Cadpig stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky observed the ground and sawed the tire tracks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys. We have to follow these tracks. They should lead us to the truck and Rolly.\" Lucky stated.<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's go.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you want me to come too?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"Well you were the one to lose him.\" Cadpig said to Patch.<br>\r\n\"Fine. But we better get a few more paws on deck.\" Patch said. \"Odd are, we're gonna need help rolling him home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the others nods their heads agreeing. So they went to get a few more pups help. Meanwhile with Rolly in the truck, there were several empty sacks and one uberly fat Rolly. His belly was now four times it's last size. Rolly was just laying down rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUURRRRRRPPPP!!!!!!!\" Rolly bleched. \"That has got to be the best meal I have had ever.\" It was defientily the most Rolly has eaten in on setting. Sure his belly was full....enough, but be was still wondering where he was heading. \"I wonder where this truck is heading to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of driving, the truck stopped at....</span></div></div>",

So he was almost 101 percent sure that the workers weren't not gonna be happy about it. \"Uh no. I might be in trouble.\" Rolly said starting to panic even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rolly's current size, there was no way he could make a run for it. As Rolly worried even more he heard some voices coming from outside the truck. It was the workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Looks like we are done for the day.\" Said one of the workers.<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we get the remaining bags from the truck?\" Said the second worker.<br>\r\n\"Nah. Just leave them. They ain't going nowhere.\" Said the first worker.<br>\r\n\"Good point. My back is killing me after that last delivery.\" The second worker said. \"Why did they wanted so many dog food?\"<br>\r\n\"They have 101 dogs over there.\" The first worker said. \"Haven't you heard of them?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. The 101dalmatians!\" The second worker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked away from the truck, leaving Rolly safe for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm finally safe.\" Rolly said taking a sigh of relief. He also decided to attempt to get up. His belly defientily was much more heavier now. His legs couldn't touch the ground anymore. \"Ugh. I'm feel like such a pig. But it was worth it.\" Rolly said patting his bloated belly. \" Might as well see where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly got out of the truck by rolling at the door to get it opened. The door opened but he went falling down the ground. His belly cushioned his fall. So he was fine. He looked outside to see where he was. He found out he was in the Kanine Krunchies Factory. \"Kanine...Krunchies...FACTORY!!!!!\" Rolly shouted. \"I'm actually in front of the Kanine Krunchies Factory.\" Right now, Rolly was feeling beyond joyful. His belly grumbled a bit. As if he was still hunger. \"Wait? You actually want more?\" Rolly said to his belly. \"But was just ate three or five full sacks of krunchies already. We really shouldn't.\" Rolly belly continued to growl more and more still. \"Aren't we big enough? We're already so big that walking regularly isn't possible now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, all his stomach did was grumble and growled louder and louder. What's Rolly to do? It seems like he didn't have any willpower to control himself. He tried the best to control his eating habit and muster any willpower he had. In the end.....</span></div></div>",

At least a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly's mind nad stomach were made up. So he rolled his way to the factory doors. Inside was several machines making pounds of Kanine Krunchies like clockwork. Seems like everything was automatic and there were barely any workers around. Which was a good thing for Rolly. He was currently looking at the machines and see all the kibble being made. His mouth began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much kibble. I think I'm in Dog Heaven.\" Rolly said to himself. His belly growled a bit. \"Just wait a little more o'stomach of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly didn't want to just randomly eat kibble off the converbelt. So he rolled a little bit more to the back of the factory. After rolling so often, he was starting to get a little on the queasy side. It happens when you have a semifull stomach. \"Urk! It will be worth it. It will all be worth it.\" Rolly rolled until he found the kibble storage room. He sawed the huge door and the sign that said \"Kanine Krunchies Storage room\". \"Hmm...this room seem interesting.\" Rolly opened the door and he finds the room filled to the brim with kibble. Rolly was in awe. \"Woooooaahhh! The truck was an appetizer compared to this.\" Rolly said to himself. \"Well time to dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then dive into the kibble and starts eating away. As always, he enjoys each and every bite. He shouldn't still be hungry, but his stomach says otherwise as he continues to eat more and get bigger from it.</span></div></div>",

We all talked to everyone and he is the best guy to help you out.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"For all you know, it won't be too bad.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the three pups heard a loud whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's HIS whistle.\" Lucky said freaking out.<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here before he makes us run laps around the farm.\" Patch said just as freaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Lucky and Patch ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He..Hey!!!! Don't leave me alone.\" Rolly pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then looked in front of him. There he was. The small dark green pug with a toothpick in his mouth and wearing aviator glasses. He looked around Rolly's body. He then put his paw in Rolly's belly and realized how jiggly and blobby he was. He then spits the toothpick and is about to say some thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say cadet. In all my dog years, I have never seen pup who is more of a whale than a dog.\" Lieutenant Pug said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm no whale.\" Rolly said not to happy about Pug's comment.<br>\r\n\"With the blubber on you, I seriously doubt that.\" Pug said poking his belly. \"No matter. I here to put you in fighting shape Polly.\"<br>\r\n\"It's Rolly.\" Rolly said telling him to say his name right.<br>\r\n\"Rolly. Polly. Whatever. Cadet. It's time to start training.\" Pug said.<br>\r\n\"So you can really get me back to my old weight?\" Rolly asked.<br>\r\n\"Old weight? I'll train you so hard, others won't recognize you.\" Pug said. \"Now. Push ups. 100. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly tried to do push ups, except for one problem. His paws didn't touch the ground due to that belly of his. So the push ups were more of belly ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna take some work.\" Pug said.</span></div></div>",

Then Lucky went up to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone. Thanks for coming.\" Lucky said to everyone.<br>\r\n\"Why did you called all of us here Luck?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"We have a bit of problem with Rolly.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Rolly? Isn't he skinny now?\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So what the real problem?\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"That IS the real problem.\" Lucky stated.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Said some of the pups.<br>\r\n\"See, Rolly has not only been eating less, but skipping meals as well.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Skipping meal? Rolly? That doesn't sound like the Rolly we know.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good. A pup still needs his protein.\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Lucky said. \"Spot, explain them what could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpot then came up to the front with some sketches and a stand. Starting with a sketch of a underweight Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, here's Rolly's current state. Slightly underweight. More than the average pup should be.\" Spot said pointing at the sketches with a stick. \"If this keeps up, his body will suffer from lack of proper nutrition. Which can result in.....\" Spot than showed off more sketches of what could happen. \"Weaken muscles, frail bones,.....even....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sketch was a tombstone that said \"Here's lies Rolly.\" Everyone gasped at the thought that it could happened to Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY! We can NOT let that happen to Rolly.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"Thin or not, we need the old Rolly back.\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do Lucky?\" Two Tone asked.<br>\r\n\"Like Jewels said, we need the old Rolly back.\" Lucky said. \"But odd are, talking to him about it won't be easy.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what should we do?\" Cadpig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone thought deep about what they should do. </span></div></div>",

But it might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some of us gain weight?\" Lucky suggested.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Some of the pups said confused.<br>\r\n\"I mean, think about it. Rolly was always one of the only ones on the heavy side.\" Lucky said. \"Maybe that's one of the main reasons why he's made himself so skinny. But if there we a few more of us with his weight....\"<br>\r\n\"It might make him feel better about his weight.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"So basically, you want us to gain weight....on purpose?\" Patch asked.<br>\r\n\"We only need a few of us. Enough of us to make him feel comfortable.\" Lucky said. \"I'm willing to do it. Anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pups mumbled for a bit deciding what they should do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" Cadpig said volunteering. \"Pig is already in my name anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm in too.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"Okay. We still need a few more.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Well it is my fault for not keeping an eye on him.\" Patch said. \"So I guess I'm in too.\"<br>\r\n\"Guess since I'm already on the slighty chubby side.\" Two Tone admitted. \"Guess a few more pounds wouldn't hurt. Just as long as I can get back my girlish figure when this is over.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't mind putting on a few either.\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"I'm out.\" Tripod said. \"With only three legs, I got to keep myself fit.\" Tripod then thought about things and then realized that there was an advantage to this whole thing. \"Then again, if I gain some weight and later lose it, I might get stronger from it. Alright, I'm in too.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to hear Tripod.\" Lucky said. \"Okay. That should be enough of us. Remember, we're doing this for Rolly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lucky, Cadpig, Spot, along with Patch, Tripod, Two Tone, and Jewels decided to all gain weight to try to get Rolly back to being Rolly. Meanwhile with Rolly, who was thin enough to see his ribcage, was by himself with a angry growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're mad, but we can\"t overdo anymore.\" Rolly said to his stomach. It growled really loudly. \"I know. You're starving, but won't go food crazy again. I don't want to be fa....fa....slighty round anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly didn't seem to want to be his regular self anymore. But it wasn't healthy for him to keep not eating.</span></div></div>",

Lucky and Tripod went over to a troth and it was now full of kibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an awful lot of kibble for just two pups.\" Tripod stated. \"I mean we're not Rolly.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on. We are doing this for him.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"But still....\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n\"Hmm....how about we make it a competition?\"  Lucky asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" Tripod said with a competitive smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing about Tripod is that he is really competitive. Especially when it comes to challenging Lucky to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pup who eats the most kibble wins.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"An eating competition, huh? You're on.\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got into eating position by the troth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready....set....GO!\" Rolly and Tripod said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them started eating the kibble. Lucky ate on one side and Tripod ate on the other. They ate quickly and fast. When the troth was half empty, both Lucky and Tripod's belly grew. They were gaining weight, but they seem more focus on beating the other. After a few, the troth was empty and the both pups have gain larger bellies. The two of them pretty much tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUURRRPPPP!!!!!!! I think we tied.\" Lucky said rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Tripod said before belching. \"I defientily won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky then pulled a level near the troth and more kibble went into the troth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round 2?\" Lucky told Tripod.<br>\r\n\"Still kinda full, but you're on.\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile those two still compete with each other, elsewhere, Spot was carrying a wagon with some sacks of chicken feed. She toke one of the sacks and put it down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. This some be enough to get started.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the sack with her beak and started pecking at the feed like a chicken would. A few at a time and really really slowly. Spot realized how slow the method was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might take a while.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Patch and Jewels were inside the house going into the kitchen and heading to the fridge. The fridge was pretty huge and one can tell by looking at it, means it must have a lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what's inside the fridge?\" Patch asked Jewels.<br>\r\n\"Probably a few things. Regular produce, some condiments, some meats.\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"Let's find out, shall we?\" Patch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatch and Jewels opened the fridge and sawed the mother load. Sausages, ham, turkey, veggies and daily products, and other foods. Too much to keep track of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"Holy ground beef!\" Patch said drooling.<br>\r\n\"This should be a good amount of food to help us out. Right Patch?\" Jewels asked Patch. Patch didn't responded. \"Patch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewels turned around to see Patch already gobbling on a sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patch!\" Jewels shouted.<br>\r\n\"What? I'm actually very hungry.\" Patch stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Patch and Jewels were on their fridge, Two Tone took Cadpig to a secluded part of the farm, where a tree was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhhh.....why are we here, Two Tone?\" Cadpig asked.<br>\r\n\"You have to promise me you won't tell anyone what I'm about to show you.\" Two Tone said to Cadpig.<br>\r\n\"Okay I won't.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Tone open up this small door on the tree and opened up a secret compartment. Inside was several bags of snacks. Tons of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get all of these snacks?\" Cadpig asked.<br>\r\n\"Save them. Sometimes I get a little greedy.\" Two Tone said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Tone grabbed a bag of chips and started eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....help yourself Cadpig.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay.\" Cadpig said grabbing some jerky.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey started munching down on their snacks. So it seemed that each and everyone had their own ways of gain some weight.</span></div></div>",

Currently, Lucky, Cadpig, Spot, Patch, Tripod, Two Tone, and Jewels were all down on the ground all with painful stomachaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaahhhhh.....\" Groaned everyone.<br>\r\n\"Stomach....so full...so much pain.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...now I know what a stuffed turkey feels like.\" Patch said.

Two.\"<br>\r\n\"I ate too much ham and sausages.\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"I feel like an actual pig now.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"You are probably more than that.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"Watch it, Two Ton!\" Cadpig said to Two Tone.<br>\r\n\"Two Ton?!?!?\" Two Tone shouted not to happy. \"I'm not nearly that heavy.\" Her stomach then groaned loudly. \"But I feel like I might as well be. I had way to many snacks.\"<br>\r\n\"Speak to my after having like six troths of kibble.\" Lucky said in pain.<br>\r\n\"Seven troths.\" Tripod stated. \"I still won the eating contests.\" Tripod's belly groaned even more. \"Uggghhh....who's about who won when your stomach is in so much pain like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you even sure this will work and Rolly will want to get back to his old self?\" Spot asked.<br>\r\n\"We have to try something.\" Lucky said. While he said that, Patch notice someone walking by. It was Rolly.<br>\r\n\"Guess we are about to find out. Here he comes.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly was walking and his stomach growled more then ever. He was really hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggggghhhh!!!!! So hungry.\" Rolly said to himself. \"But I don't want to end up big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rolly said that he looked at the group of bloated pups and chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!?!?!\" Rolly shouted. \"Woah! Woah! Woah! What happen to guys?\"<br>\r\n\"Food. Just food.\" Spot said still down.<br>\r\n\"We...wanted to gain a few pounds of weight.\" Lucky stated to Rolly.<br>\r\n\"Wh...why would you do that?\" Rolly asked.<br>\r\n\"We wanted to make you more comfortable with your old self.\" Cadpig said trying to get up.<br>\r\n\"You...want me to be back to my old self?\" Rolly said with widen eyes.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We miss our rolly polly chubby pal.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"So can you get back to your old self?\" Jewels asked.<br>\r\n\"Guys. I appreciate the gesture, but I don't want to be fa.....slight rounder anymore.\" Rolly stated.<br>\r\n\"Rolly, listen.\" Tripod said getting up. \"It's not healthy to starve yourself the way you are now.\"<br>\r\n\"Who says I'm starving?\" Rolly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly's belly then ratted him out by growling loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly says otherwise.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"Rolly, have you looked at yourself? You are starving yourself to the size of a twig.\" Patch said. \"Keep this up, and you could....\"<br>\r\n\"I get your concerns, but I'm fine.\" Rolly said lying. \"Now if you would excuse me...I am hungry so I get a quick snack. One dog treat should make me go for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that say, Rolly left the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ONE dog treat?\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"Guess your plan didn't work.\" Tripod said Lucky.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Luck.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"We can't give up now.\" Lucky said. \"We just need to push ourselves a little bit more.\"<br>\r\n\"Uggggghhhhh.......\" Everyone esle shouted in protest.<br>\r\n\"This better get Rolly back. I don't know how much my little stomach can take?\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"Come on guys. For Rolly.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"For....Rolly...\" The others said with lack of morale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other felt that they had to gain more weight to convice Rolly better. Even with their stomachs in pain. The same can be said for Rolly. But only his pain is hunger from starving himself.</span></div></div>",

To top it off, his stomach growled loudly for hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....I feel so weak.\" Rolly said to himself. \"Guess I'm still hungry. But I can't eat more. I might overdo it again.\" Rolly belly still growled in protest. Rolly knew that he had to do something. \"Maybe a few more....\" Rolly then reopen the box and ate two more. \"Maybe.....just a few more.\" Rolly than ate a couple more treats. Then next thing you know, he ate more and more of the treats. Before he knew it, he ate all the treats in the box. It was the most he has eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! WHAT HAVE I DONE?\" Shouted Rolly freaked out. \"I didn't mean to eat that much. I mean, I felt better now...but still.....\" It wasn't like the box of treats made him gain anything, but he still ate more than he wanted to. \"I need some water.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then head over to get some water. He went over to the water troth in the farm and drank a bit. Dranking the water made him feel more refresh. \"Ah....that's so much bet....ter...\" Rolly looked at the water and saw his reflection. It was the first time he got a good look at himself. He saw this super thin pups who's was beyond looking well. He notice how frail his face and leg bones look.

They were gobbling down some more junk food. Chips, cakes, pie, and a MASSIVE hoagie. Like a four foot tall hoagie that was 10 foot long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys. This is for Rolly.\" Lucky said taking a few bites of the hoagie. Everyone was eating something, but they weren't to happy about it.<br>\r\n\"You keep saying that, but it doesn't make it easy.\" Cadpig said. \"I feel that I'm gonna burst.\"<br>\r\n\"I feel like that I should have burst days ago.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"I just feel like I ate a hippo.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang has gain quite a bit of weight since yesterday. Each gaining an extra inch or two then yesterday. Their bellies were overbloated to the size of jumbo beanbag chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this even really work?\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"Wasn't there some other way?\" Tripod asked.<br>\r\n\"We already made it this far. Might as well keep going.\" Lucky said. \"Even I'm feeling pretty stuffed, but I'm still willing to push myself for Rolly. Come on guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine....\" The others said not too motivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they continue to stuff themselves, Rolly still was hungry enough to eat something. So he went to the farm storage to get himself something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to eat something. I definitely don't want to starve to death.\" Rolly said. So he went into the storage and saw some sacks of kibble. SEVERAL....sacks of kibble. It seems that the Kanine Krunchies truck already came in today. This feels familiar. It's similar to the same thing that started all this. Only instead of one bag, there were many. Rolly felt that he was having an anxiety attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....so....so much kibble. Not again.\" Rolly responded. Then his belly growled louder than ever before. \"Control yourself, Rolly. Control yourself. You don't want to overdo it again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly walked over to one of the bags and open it up. \"Okay. Just enough to not be hungry anymore.\" He said. Rolly then started eating the kibble. Unlike the times he ate only a few, he actually at the average amount for a pup. But he was still, so he at more. As he ate, his skinny figure started to shape up. After a few minutes, the whole sack was eaten. Rolly has eaten a full sack of kibble again. Rolly wasn't as skinny as he was before, but he wasn't chubby or fat either. He was pretty much average pup weight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just do?!?\" Rolly shouted. \"I did it again. Eaten a whole sack of kibble.\" Why did I do that?\" Rolly then looked at himself. \"Then again, I don't look so boney anymore.\" Rolly said smiling. \"Guess it wasn't so bad. I guess I should go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly, feeling satisfied, wanted to leave. He ate a whole sack of kibble. He wasn't bone-skinny anymore. He should be good, right? But then, he heard this loud growling noise. A noise he is far to familiar with. It was his stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not again.\" Rolly said. \"We just ate a whole sack of kibble. We should be fine.\" Rolly pleaded. But his stomach still growled loudly. \"Not enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly then looked at the others sacks.</span></div></div>",

Yet part of him misses his former chubby self. He just didn\"t know what to do. Willpower or Hunger urges? After thinking about it for a while, Rolly decided what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I've been starving myself for weeks. Been cautious about my weight.

We'd stuffed ourselves so much, I feel that we stuffed ourselves more than Rolly did.\" Patch stated.<br>\r\n\"This better be worth it.\" Tripod said. \"I miss been active.\"<br>\r\n\"None of us can even walk anymore.\" Two Tone stated. \"We have to roll like Rolly.\"<br>\r\n\"It is kinda fun rolling.\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Rolly, where is he?\" Spot asked.<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him since yesterday.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe he actually went to eat something this time.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"Better try to find him.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pups and Spot walk.....I mean, rolled there way around the farm. They checked the troth, but no one or kibble was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kibble. So no one's here.\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"Well....might as well eat some more.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"LUCKY!!!!!!\" Cadpig, Spot, Patch, Jewels, Two Tone and Tripod shouted not wanting to eat any more.<br>\r\n\"It's for Rolly.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"You saying that doesn't make it easier.\" Cadpig stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky pulled the level to the kibble dispenser, yet no kibble dropped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Guess there's no kibble.\" Lucky said. Everyone else to a sigh of relief. \"Guess we should check the farm's storage.\"<br>\r\n\"Lucky dear, like we said, we don't want to eat anymore today.\" Two Tone said.<br>\r\n\"We should at least look over there to see if Rolly is there. He was before.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" Everyone else said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they went to the outside of farm storage. Before they went in, they heard a LOUD belch some the inside and felt some shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....what was that?\" Jewels said.<br>\r\n\"A earthquake?\" Spot said.<br>\r\n\"I know that belch anywhere.\" Lucky said recognizing it.<br>\r\n\"Do you think it was....\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang opens the door and see a few empty sacks. Then they saw a pup with an abnormally large belly a bit smaller than theirs. It was Rolly. Once again, an overstuffed Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Rolly said just laying the on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Rolly!\" Everyone else shouted.<br>\r\n\"Your....your...\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Slightly round again.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Let's cut the titles. I'm overly fat.\" Rolly admitted. \"And you know what, I'm okay with it.\"<br>\r\n\"But what about the whole 'willpower' thing?\" Spot asked.<br>\r\n\"I still do have willpower.\" Rolly said. \"Look. I didn't all the sacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. There were still plently of kibble sacks still left over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you still ate a lot.\" Tripod stated.<br>\r\n\"I could say the same to all of you.\" Rolly said. \"You guys look bigger than yesterday.\"<br>\r\n\"That's because Lucky wanted us to do more eating.\" Spot said. \"But it seems like it was unnecessary.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Seems like you are back to been your old self.\" Patch said.<br>\r\n\"You are back to your old self, right?\" Jewels asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I may lose some of this weight I have now, but original round Rolly will be here to stay.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did some happy cheering that Rolly was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...does that mean we can stop overeating?\" Cadpig asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone went down to the ground, groaning and rubbing their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness this is all over.\" Tripod said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Good thing too. I couldn't eaten anything else if I wanted to.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Earlier, you wanted to eat more.\" Patch shouted it like Lucky.<br>\r\n\"It was fo Rolly. It was worth it.\" Lucky said. \"I was being to strong one.\"<br>\r\n\"I tell you what it wasn't worth? These stomachaches.\" Two Tone said before groaning some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same for everyone else. There bellies were beyond the point of full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Stomachaches aren't the worst pain.\" Rolly stated. But he was stuffed too and his belly groaned as much as the others. \"Forget what I said. It's definitely the worst pain ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone just lay there on the ground for the rest of the day. Too full to do anything else. But everyone was happy that Rolly was back.</span></div></div>",

But it's Rolly, so that won't always be the case. Pongo and Perdy later found out about Rolly regaining some of his weight again. The same for Lucky, Cadpig, Patch, Jewels, Two Tone, and Tripod. They weren't too happy about the pups gaining all that huge amount of weight. That and they were all in trouble for taking food from the fridge and storage. Lucky told them that they did it so Rolly not be so skinny as he was and not under eat. Saying that lessen their punishment. However they still had to all weight. The same for Rolly. So this would be the second time for him. He wasn't too fond of the idea. Spot, didn't really get in trouble like the pups did, but she still wanted to lose the weight. She couldn't really get around with her big round body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo lose all the weight they had to do some...extra training.....from Lieutenant Pug. The gang was all out in the fields wait for Pug to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I have to lose all this weight...again.\" Rolly said complaining. \"It was hard enough the first time.\"<br>\r\n\"Look at the bright side. Your not alone this time.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"We all need to lose the weight too.\" Lucky said. \"But I'm not too happy about it myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" Spot said. \"I missing flying short distances.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm never gonna overeat again.\" Jewels said. \"I ate waaaay too much food.\"<br>\r\n\"Same from me.\" Two Tone said. \"I want to go back to being Two Tone and not Two Ton.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't really mind the extra weight.\" Patch admitted. \"Once you get use to it, it's not so bad.\"<br>\r\n\"I kinda want to get back to being skinny.\" Tripod said. \"Like I said before, this would help me get a bit stronger. So for me, everything was leading to this.\"<br>\r\n\"The problem is that we got to get train by.....Lieutenant Pug.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sighed of the idea of Lieutenant Pug training them ragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely survive the first time.\" Rolly shouted indiscontent.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it won't be so bad the second time.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard a loud shout of the word \"ATTEEEEEEENTION!!!!!!!!\" from the distance. It was, none other than Lieutenant Pug. He had a very angry look in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIEUTENANT PUG!!!!!\" Everyone shouted in surprised.<br>\r\n\"In all my dog years, I have never seen a more sorry lot of pup cadets in my life.\" Pug said. \"You all look like you could be confused for beanbag chairs.\"<br>\r\n\"Heeeeyyyyyy!!!\" Everyone said not liking his insult.<br>\r\n\"....and you. Cadet Polly. I thought I train you to know better.\" Pug said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir. Skinny wasn't really me.\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"Either way, I'm gonna train each and everyone of you pups and the chicken so hard that your tails will fall off.\" Pug said in his Lieutenant voice. Everyone else did a long sigh.<br>\r\n\"Now, everyone drop and give me 2000 pushups.\" Pug said.<br>\r\n\"2000?!?!?\" Everyone shouted stunned.<br>\r\n\"Did I stutter? Now do it, cadets!\" Pug shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to make the Lieutenant any madder, they try to do the pushups. But again, it's a problem when you belly doesn't let you touch the ground. None of them were really able to do anything except grunt and bounce a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.....is gonna take a while.\" Pug said before putting a paw into his face.</span></div></div>",

Things were nice and quite....for three seconds. At that moment, Lucky, Rolly, Mooch, and a couple of other guy pups came over and pushed her from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Thunderbolt's on!\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"I got it. I got it.\" Lucky said grabbing the remote and changing the channel.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was watching that.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey Cadpig!\" Rolly said.<br>\r\n\"We didn't see you there.\" Lucky said.<br>\r\n\"Well now that you do. Change the channel back.\" Cadpig said. \"I was watching something.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry runt. But we're watching our show now.\" Mooch said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! There is a new Thunderbolt episode.\" Lucky said. \"You're welcome to watch with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadpig looked at the group and it was all boys. The big and tough boys mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see this is gonna be one those guy things. I leave you guys to it.\" Cadpig said.<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself runt.\" Mooch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadpig gave Mooch an angry stare and growl. Then she proceeded by walking out leaving the boys to watch TV. Cadpig was really angry. She didn't like Mooch calling her a runt. She also didn't like the fact that he was right. Cadpig was always the runt of the litter. Always being the smallest. She wasn't fond of it. She took her angry out by going to the troth and munching on some kibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe those guys.\" Cadpig said angrily as she munches on the kibble. \"Acting like they didn't see me. And that Mooch. Calling me a runt. I can't stand him. I can't stand being small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she eats more and more kibble. She hits a full point and stop. She then noticed that her belly was starting to stick out.\"Guess I overdid it a bit.\" Cadpig said to herself. \"Better stop before I get too bi....\" Then it hit her. Maybe the best thing to do was eat more and get bigger from it, she would be treated like the runt anymore. \"Yes. That could work. Let's see how everyone is when I'm not so little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Cadpig decided to gain weight.</span></div></div>",

She even reached into the troth sometimes, using both her forepaws at once to scoop in armfuls of kibble at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadpig was able to choke down a pretty decent amount of what was left in the troth, but unfortunately, after a bit she had to pause. She was a very small pup, after all, and she'd been full even before she decided to actively try and stuff herself. So her stomach had gotten stretched taut awfully quickly, and she had to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting and cringing in pain, Cadpig sat with her back against the troth and her hindpaws kicked out in front of her, groaning as she rubbed the painfully stuffed orb that was her belly. She also took this opportunity to look down at herself, and admire her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd eaten a lot- her gut was distended significantly, protruding almost a whole foot from her body. It was visibly strained, the fur thinning a bit from being stretched so much, letting her skin appear slightly visible. The skin on her belly had a reddish tint, like it was stretched too far. Her belly was completely perfectly round like a ball and very firm, like a full bag of dog food. If she stood up straight, she would barely be able to get her paws to reach the ground, her belly being just a bit bigger than her tiny legs were long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, not bad at- <i>ouch</i>- all...\" Cadpig remarked, cringing as she felt a pain from her overburdened gut. But thankfully, it quickly subsided. \"It already looks like my belly's as big as I am...Geez...i really am tiny if this is all it took to double my weight...\" She mused. She looked over her shoulder, checking to see how much food was left in the trout. She was surprised to see it was still a quarter full! That meant she'd only eaten half of what was in there! It made sense there was so much food, since that troth was supposed to feed all the puppies at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate a quarter, there's a quarter left...\" Cadpig thought out loud. She looked at her belly. \"I'm already so full it hurts...and my skin looks really stretched... Maybe it'd be a really bad idea to keep eating....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneaded her belly gingerly, using both her fingers on her front paws and her toes on her hindpaws to rub it, since it was big enough to reach both. \"I'm double my original weight, isn't that already big enough?\" She bit her lower lip, glancing over her shoulder at the kibble. \"...though...imagine if I was <i>triple</i> my original weight....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully considering how much of a risk to her safety eating the rest of the kibble was, considering she already looked fit to burst- and comparing that to how much bigger she'd get to be, Cadpig finally made a decision....</span></div></div>",

She took a deep breath, struggled to a standing position with her large taut strained belly pressing firmly on the ground- and psyched herself up for a moment before digging right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for her- the more she ate the more it hurt, and she could feel her body trembling and giving in- but she just kept on telling herself- <i>triple my size, triple my size</i>- forcing herself to keep on shoveling more and more kibble into her maw. Even as her belly groaned, and swallowing got harder- she forced herself to gulp more down. Her eyes teared up a bit as she could actually hear her belly creak in a very concerning way, but she just kept shoving in armfuls of kibble with her shaking forelimbs- even as she felt her hind legs lose contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she lapped up the very last lump of kibble, leaving the troth totally empty, Cadpig was wracked with intense burning physical agony. Her belly was absolutely enormous, at least- compared to her tiny body it was. Easily double the size it had been before, it was now impossible for her to reach the floor- instead helplessly pushing herself off the lip of the troth and just kinda falling to the ground pathetically, her belly rising above her as she panted like she just ran a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut was as hard as a boulder, sticking out a bit more than twice the length of her little legs- the white fur was stretched thin amongst its massive surface area, which made the strained, irritated looking bright red skin visible, a gradient from a more healthy pink to red at the extreme bottom, with a bunch of angry stretch marks burning an even brighter red. Regardless- Cadpig felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....did.....it....\" She said, between heavy breaths, trying to touch her belly to rub it- wincing as she made contact and felt the sting of pain. \"I'm....rrngg....amazing.... I'd like to see those....boys see me...now....<i>ouch!</i>\" She cringed again, trying to catch her breath. \"...ok....maybe not <i><b>right</b></i> now...\" She admitted, realizing that- while big, for sure, she was too inflicted with crippling pain to be very impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait....'til I....digest all this...\" She said, snickering to herself- before wincing again, the laughter causing a sting of pain. \"If I can eat all this...I can eat....anything.....\" She muttered, excited to imagine her next meal, how she'd choke it down all at once like the champion she was. She couldn't wait til she was sitting on the couch, all the kibble digested and distributed across her whole body, making her huge from head to toe! She'd scare off those boys for sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts ran through Cadpig's head, before a combination of physical exhaustion, food coma, and overwhelming pain caused her to black out, right there in the barn in front of the troth, steadily drooling as she lay slackjawed with a painfully engorged gut twice her size.</span></div></div>",

She sneaked slow in the house and dropped herself on to the couch still in her work clothes to get some shuteye hoping none will noticed her. \"Peg, are you home? Get me some chips!\" a loud voice coming form a recliner pointing to a large t.v.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a groan she yelled back, \"Get it yourself!\" \"But Peggums,\" Pete whined, \"I just got comfy, and the game just got good.\" She was hoping just for once he would not talk back, but she was too tired to care. She got up went into the kitchen grabbed one of the many bag of chips from the shelf and threw them at Pete hitting him in the head. \"Thanks Peggums,\" he grumbled wile rubbing his head, \"and can you make a bigger dinner today i'm extra hungry form work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was now furious. \"That no good, lazy, bottomless fat... ugh,\" she said under her breath unable to finish her sentence. She grabbed a bag of chips and began to eat it immediately. She then looked at herself and frowned. \"All he wants is a trophy housewife, someone to just sit there looking pretty and cook for him,\" she thought wile grabbing a big handful of chips. \"Well if that what he wants then that what he gets, a big, fat, housewife, and that will show him for being so selfish,\" she thought now stuffing her mouth with the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She began to make a large dinner this time more for herself then for Pete's sake. During her cooking she kept eating chip until it was all finished. That's when she realize she has eaten 4 bags of chips and was starting to fill full. \"Peg, is dinner ready,\" yelled Pete form the living room. He always knew when dinner was ready. With that Peg's fullness was gone as it was began to be filed with anger. \"Yes Petey,\" she answered as sweetly as she can trying to masked her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She called the kids to come for dinner wile trying to prevent Pete form eating before everyone came which made Peg more hungry. When everyone came P.J. and Pistol was surprise by the large dinner. \"Woh mom, whats the occasion,\" P.J. asked wile taking his seat. \"Oh nothing special, just felt like making more today,\" she lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After saying grace everyone started piling on food on there plates as Peg was trying to match Pete plate food by food. If she wanted to intact her plan she need to eat like Pete. None payed attention to her, especially Pete, and that was a good thing this time around. She attempted to eat what she as put on her plate but found it quiet difficult to fallow. Pete made it look so easy to eat the way he did but she pushed on fulled by her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After an hour of eating everyone had there full. With distended bellies they all walking away from the dinning table to there respected rooms. Pete went to the recliner to watch a game while Peg still sat at the table rubbing her large ache stomach. Right now she was starting to regret her decisions until she looked at Pete siting in front of the T.V.. She then looked back at her stomach and smiled.</span></div></div>",

It was hard the first week of eating, still feeling full even before the next meal. By the second week it became easier as she grew accustomed to the eating. She also began developing a habit of eating when she gets angry at Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso over the course of 2 weeks Pete began slowly distancing himself from Peg, even in the bedroom. On the plus side she started hanging out with Goofy more often. It started when she was so angry at Pete and all of the snacks was gone so she when to Goofy's house to vent some steam. After that they had tea almost everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early in the morning as Peg was looking at herself in the full body in the bathroom. She was only wearing a frilly black bra and panties that was a bit too tight now. The first thing she notice was that her breast are now a couple cups bigger. Her stomach only had a little bit of fat, and her butt and waist was now much bigger, or at least bigger than usual. At least her face looked uninfected by her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeg then grabbed her pants of the rack and started to put it on. \"Ugh,\" she groaned as was trying to get her pants up her now bigger rear. With a final pull she got her traditional white pants over her butt. She then got her pink sweater and put it on. It was much easier then her pants but it was starting to feel a bit more snugged then usual. \"I need to buy bigger clothes,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Peg, when's breakfast,\" Pete bellowed from the bed. <br>\r\n\"YOU GET IT WHEN I SAY SO,\" she yelled grabbing a big bag of chips off the counter top. <br>\r\n\"Yes sweetie pumpkin,\" Pete said submissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stomped out of the bathroom and to the kitchen. She began making breakfast while stuffing herself with chips and even opened another without noticing. Over the past 2 weeks Peg has gotten better at making big meals quicker with help from the added butter making it tastes better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BREAKFAST IS READY,\" she yelled as she finished setting the table. The whole family came running down the stairs to the dinner room table. They started to pile food onto there plates and started eating. Peg made a quick look at her family before she began eating herself. Pete and P.J looked the same as before the increase in food. Pistol on the other hand had a distinct pot belly that started to stretch her clothes a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes the school bus arrived. P.J. and Pistol jumped out of the table and kissed Peg good bye before heading to school. Soon after Pete got up with a lot burp grabbing his briefcase and headed to the door. With a quick good bye Peg was all alone at the table with still a bit of breakfast left. \"He had been leaving more early to work the usually,\" she scowled at the door knowing perfectly well why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last week she also grew a new habit of having no leftovers. So she pulled all of the remaining food to her and started eating even if she still felt stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 30 minutes she finished the last of the breakfast, rubbing her big destined belly. She slowly got up groaning in pain and slowly walked to the couch and fell with a thud. She then drifted off to sleep while thinking about what she'll have for lunch.</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself one more time as she moved her hands across her body. Her face was a little bit softer but at first glance you wouldn't have noticed. Her breast on the other hand had grown considerably bigger, nearing the size of her head. A good portion of her new weight resigned there. Her stomach had only grown a little, now sporting a small pot belly. The waist was now wider then her shoulders making her butt so big that it had a small shelf. She now had an exaggerated hourglass shape, and she can't figure out if she should feel shock or existed about her body's development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeg dropped those thoughts as she looked at the clock. \"Oh my it's almost 2, I'm running late,\" she said stepping off the scale. Wearing her traditional clothes, now bigger although still a bit tight, she walked out of her house. She can feel her body quake with every heavy step she made as she walked to her next door neighbor Goofy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rang the doorbell while making herself look presentable. Soon after Goofy open the door. \"Well hello Peg come on in and make yourself comfortable,\"  Goofy said as Peg walking unto the house. In front of her there was a coffee table with a large spread of snacks fill with chips and cookies. Peg walk to the couch and took a seat sinking in more then usual. Before Goofy could sit down near Peg she already had a plate full of goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been Peg,\" Goofy said picking up his tea.<br>\r\n\"Oh it's been a rough week Goofy. Pete have been a huge pain,\" she answered while eating a cookie.<br>\r\n\"Oh it can't be that bad. Pete maybe going though a rough patch,\" he said trying to defend his best friend.<br>\r\n\"He's been ignoring me all week. He barely speaks to me, he has been avoiding me, and he had not even kiss me in 3 weeks,\" she said angry now stuffing herself with more food, \"I wondering if I'm still pretty.\" Although she knew perfectly well why. Goofy then place his hand on her arm trying to calm herself down. \"Shucks Peg, your still as beautiful as ever and no one should tell you otherwise!\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you Goofy, you know exactly what I need to hear,\" she said as she grabbed his hand holding it tight looking into his eyes, \"sometimes I wonder how things could have been.\" Goofy blushed removing his hand from her's \"gawrsh Peg, I did not know you thought of me like that, but you was still dating Pete when I got married.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she now looking down, \"Pete was much more carrying back then and I really thought he was the one.\" She then pick up her tea, \"sometimes I thought about getting a divorce.\" Goofy spit his tea hearing what she said, \"gawrsh Peg isn't that a bit extreme?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe but I can't think of anything else that can get through his thick skull. The only reason I have not was for the sake of the kids and even that is starting to waver,\" she answered after eating one of the last cookies.<br>\r\n\"How about I try talking to him. I'm his best friend after all, he'll listen to me,\" he said with a confidant smile. \"Your sometimes to good for this world,\" Peg thought while drinking her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Goofy's conversation with Peg and Max returned from school he went to Pete's used car emporium. He walked into Pete's office to see him sitting at his desk. \"Hiya Pete,\" Goofy said cheerfully. Pete looked up from his desk to Goofy. <br>\r\n\"Oh hay Goof, what you doing here,\" Pete grumbled.<br>\r\n\"Just want to asks you a couple things.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Pete said more curiously, \"what do you want.\"<br>\r\n\"Well i was talking to Peg and she is feeling a bit neglected by you.\"<br>\r\nPete frowned a bit looking at Goofy a bit peeved. Pete then got up and putting his arms around Goofy. \"Look here Goofy, I'll be blunt, have you seen Peg as of late. She is getting a bit... you know... fat.\" <br>\r\n\"Well yea, I guess Pete but I don't see what is so wrong about that?\"<br>\r\n\"Goof, what wrong is that she let herself go, lost her flare, no longer alluring. So I figured that if I spend some time away from her she might get the message.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you think that's a bit mean? Why don't you just talk to her?\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha what do you think I am, a therapist.\"<br>\r\n\"Well if your not going to talk to Peg about this then I will!\"<br>\r\nPete did not like this. \"If you tell anything I just said I'll...\" he paused as he got an idea. \"Look Goofy I'll make you a deal, next month I'm going to take PJ on a road trip in the A/V , so if you keep quite what what I said abut Peg I'll take you kid too.\"<br>\r\nGoofy was taken aback about this and began to think about Pete's offer. Peg was really mad with Pete and more lying is not going to fix things. On the other hand Max would love to go with PJ and he would be disappointed of he found out he was invited only to be unable to go because of him.<br>\r\n\"Fine Pete I won't tell Peg.\"<br>\r\n\"That a boy Goof,\" Pete said as he slapped Goofy on the back, \"Now go along and tell your boy the good news, and remember no telling Peg.\" As Goofy was walking out of Pete's office feeling defeated he has one last thought to give Pete. \"You know what Pete, you're wrong about Peg, she's still as beautiful as ever,\" he declared as he walked out the door. Pete just grumbled at Goofy's remark and went back to his desk.</span></div></div>",

Peg and Pete was standing in the living room with Pete's luggage around hem. <br>\r\n\"I decided that I need some time way from home and relax.\"<br>\r\n\"And you don't tell me?!\" As Peg's face was turning red.<br>\r\n\"I didn't what you to worry about it,\" Pete lied as he looked at Peg from top to bottom. He could see how much she as grown these past months. Her face was starting to get rounder with a small double chin beginning to form. Her neck has also grown bigger too. Her breast would be the lust of any man at there size, as big as large watermelon, showing off a large cleavage through her too small pink sweater. Her arms was big and round while still being slender around her hands and wrists. Her belly was now a large potbelly, hanging shortly off her overly tight white pants. Her butt and waist so large that they can be her own wracking ball and starting getting to big for doorways. And her legs was surprisingly slender at the base of her feet, giving her an extreme hourglass figure. <br>\r\n\"Worry?! Well I'll tell you what you should be worried about, you not going,\" Peg declared as she cross her arms under her breast.<br>\r\n\"Peggums, I have been planning this trip for the last couple month now. Everything's already bought and planned for,\" Pete whined.<br>\r\n\"Then tell me a good reason why I should let you go or so help me!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm taking both PJ and the Goof's boy with me,\" he said having a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeg didn't know what to say. Pete just guarantee his vacation. If it was just him she would immediately cancel all of his plans, but bringing the kids along was his insurance. \"Why you slimy snake,\" she said as she stomp her foot. Then her grabbed Pete's shirt pulling him closer to her face, \"you better make it thr best trip in the boys young lives and after you come back we are going to have a very long talk!\" Pete pulled him self free and straighten himself, \"well then we'll talk about you resent weight gain too and how you should get rid of it.\" <br>\r\nPeg just stood there with her mouth open in shock. She was about to blow when she heard PJ coming down the stairs behind her. \"Hey dad, ready to go. Oh hey mom, sorry to hear that you couldn't make it.\" Pege quickly turned around with her best smile and hugged PJ. \"Don't worry about that and just have a fun time with Max,\" hugging him tighter how speaking in a hush voice, \"and if Pete does something shady, you tell me as soon as possible, ok.\"<br>\r\n\"O-ok mom,\" PJ said feeling a little scared. Peg the gave PJ a big kiss on the cheek and saying good bye.<br>\r\nAfter sever minutes of packing up and saying good bye, Peg waited for the boys to be out of sight to stomped her way back to the house slamming the door behide her.<br>\r\n\"AAAHH, that Pete is such a worm, using the boys at get his vacation,\" she fumed as she walked to the kitchen, \"and telling me to loss weight HAH.\" She then she grabbed several boxes of butter from the fridge, \"well then if he wants loss then he'll get gain!\" She then tore into the first box of butter dropping 4 sticks of butter to the tabletop.</span></div></div>",

Usually he was blissfully unaware sometimes of situation but he was not deaf. Hearing the commotion for his neighbors his knew that Peg was not happy, and recently when she was not happy she ate. So Goofy felt it was a good to check on Peg to see how she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in front of there door and gave a knock. He waited for a moment but got no response. He then checked to door handle to see that it was unlock, so he slowly opened the door walking cautiously into the house. As he enter his can hear noises from the kitchen. Fearing the worse he called out, \"Peg are you alright?\" All he got as a response was moans and grunts. He walked unto the kitchen feeling very nervous. Goofy was shock when he saw Peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he saw Peg sitting on a chair that was clearly too small surround by emptied bags and boxes. She looked like she was in pain wile holding on a large bag of chips. She was slow eating wincing in pain every time she swallowed. Peg seemed to not notice that Goofy was standing in front of the kitchen with a shock expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peg! What happen here?\" He exclaimed as he ran to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuug, *munch* ,\" is all she said as she ate another handful of chips. Goofy took the bag of chips away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, give it back, I'm so angry right now,\" she said trying to reach for the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Peg, you had enough. Here, let me help you to a more comfortable spot.\" Goofy slowly began to lift Peg to her feet with great strain to Goofy, and slowly waddle her out of the kitchen to her couch. She plopped onto the couch with a loud crunch and a loud belch from Peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoofy sat next to her as she rubbed her stomach moaning in pain. \"Peg why do you do to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so tired of Pete's antics. Always selfish and not caring for this family, ouch. I just wanted to take something that he could no get beck on his own, oooh, my beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Peg I already told you, your not ugly.\" He said rubbing her back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Goofy but it's for him, but now I'm starting to loose control. For many years I have bottled my anger to him that now after releasing it I don't know if I can go back after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't say that, with enough help you can do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Goofy you don't understand it, it's not that I can't but I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked surprise at her, \"what do you mean Peg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After doing this for this long I'm starting to like it. It feels good to realize every once in a wile, even if I over do it something,\" she chuckled as she rubbed her stomach. \"But right now I still want to hurt Pete's ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoofy sat there in silence processing what Peg just said. \"Okay Peg, but allow me to help you. You can't do this alone without hurting yourself. And after this you will loss some of that weight, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you! You don't know what that means to me, and I promise after all this is over I will loss some of it,\" she exclaimed as she grabbed Goody into her breast for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoofy then pulled away looking concerned, \"what about Pistol? Won't she start to gain too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be some collateral damage, but don't worry too much, she's young. A little weight won't hurt.\"</span></div></div>",

She kicked her left hindpaw off the ground a few times, attempting to speed herself up even more- not as if she needed to, she was careening down the sloped street faster and faster anyway, picking up more and more speed as she reached the sharp upward slope formed by the sheet of plywood she'd found, and placed over a cinderblock- building herself a remarkably unsafe makeshift ramp at the bottom of the hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ramp which she hit like a train- the plywood snapping as she blew over it. But she was going so fast by then that she was well off of the ramp, soaring through the air. By the time it snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in amazement as she flew, ears flapping wildly in the wind as her skateboard tumbled loosely next to her. She let out a triumphant laugh, as the street shrunk further beneath her, she thrust her forepaws in the air excitedly, letting out a thrilled cry of sheer joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>WOOOOOHOOOOOOO-</i></b>AUURGHK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reverie was cut off abruptly as she collided with a tree branch, the wind getting knocked clean out of her as it smacked her in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyargh- grgkkh- oofh- frhhufg- gwah- yghh- hdjah- bluhgh- <i>RRFH.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a cacophony of pained exclamations, repeatedly cutting herself off as she tumbled down the tree, hitting a different body part against a different branch every other second, culminating in a rough groan as she fell the last few feet from the bottom branch, hitting the sidewalk hard. She lay there for a moment, silently cursing and clutching her torso, trying to catch her breath. Suddenly, she felt a painful stinging impact smack into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the- Wha???\" She said, her tone a mixture of disbelief and disappontiment as she picked up one snapped off half of her skateboard. Staring at it for a moment, stunned, she looked back up to the tree she'd landed in...and was promptly smacked directly in the face as the other half of her board fell out. \"Agh! Gah- dangit!!!\" She yelled again, clutching her face. After regaining her senses, she deflated, a sorrowful look spreading across her face as she picked up both halves of her skateboard, snapped clean in two. Her ears slumped down as she tried fitting then together like puzzle pieces. \"No no no no- c'mon- c'mon...\" She almost got it, but the moment she let go it fell apart again. She pouted at it, her eyes flicking from one half to the other, before slowly travelling over to the large hill she'd have to drag both halves back up, as her back, her legs, her head, and her...everything, still hurt like heck from the rough fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....aaaawwww.........man....\"</span></div></div>",

She kicked her left hindpaw off the ground a few times, attempting to speed herself up even more- not as if she needed to, she was careening down the sloped street faster and faster anyway, picking up more and more speed as she reached the sharp upward slope formed by the sheet of plywood she'd found, and placed over a cinderblock- building herself a remarkably unsafe makeshift ramp at the bottom of the hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ramp which she hit like a train- the plywood snapping as she blew over it. But she was going so fast by then that she was well off of the ramp, soaring through the air. By the time it snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in amazement as she flew, ears flapping wildly in the wind as her skateboard tumbled loosely next to her. She let out a triumphant laugh, as the street shrunk further beneath her, she thrust her forepaws in the air excitedly, letting out a thrilled cry of sheer joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>WOOOOOHOOOOOOO</b>-AUURGHK</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reverie was cut off abruptly as she collided with a tree branch, the wind getting knocked clean out of her as it smacked her in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyargh- grgkkh- oofh- frhhufg- gwah- yghh- hdjah- bluhgh- <i>RRFH.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a cacophony of pained exclamations, repeatedly cutting herself off as she tumbled down the tree, hitting a different body part against a different branch every other second, culminating in a rough groan as she fell the last few feet from the bottom branch, hitting the sidewalk hard. She lay there for a moment, silently cursing and clutching her torso, trying to catch her breath. Suddenly, she felt a painful stinging impact smack into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the- Wha???\" She said, her tone a mixture of disbelief and disappontiment as she picked up one snapped off half of her skateboard. Staring at it for a moment, stunned, she looked back up to the tree she'd landed in...and was promptly smacked directly in the face as the other half of her board fell out. \"Agh! Gah- dangit!!!\" She yelled again, clutching her face. After regaining her senses, she deflated, a sorrowful look spreading across her face as she picked up both halves of her skateboard, snapped clean in two. Her ears slumped down as she tried fitting then together like puzzle pieces. \"No no no no- c'mon- c'mon...\" She almost got it, but the moment she let go it fell apart again. She pouted at it, her eyes flicking from one half to the other, before slowly travelling over to the large hill she'd have to drag both halves back up, as her back, her legs, her head, and her...everything, still hurt like heck from the rough fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....aaaawwww.........man....\"</span></div></div>",

She should've come up with some kind of plan for how she'd land after she jumped, but unfortunately she'd neglected to think that far ahead. There was no way she'd have been allowed to pull a stunt like that if she didn't sneak out and just do it, but it looks like all the warnings Dylan gave her about safety were right after all. Who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up wistfully at the air above her. God, it <i>had</i> been a <i>fantastic</i> jump though. In that moment before she hit the stupid tree she could've sworn she knew what it felt like to genuinely fly. She huffed in disappointment, examining the splintered halves of the skateboard she was carrying. It was a pretty bad break, not clean at all, jagged wood and bits of plastic. She wasn't sure she'd be able to glue it back together when she got home- she might even have to find a new one somehow. Where would she manage to get a new skateboard on the fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as she was finally on top of the hill, only about a block, block and a half, away from home- her nose twitched. She paused, perking up. She smelled something. Looking over to the other side of the road, she spotted a small group of human workers, loading some open-topped crates of what smelled like food into a little storage building, with a few shutter doors in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolly pricked up her ears, trying to listen to what they were saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..chance that animals can get in through it?\" One of them said to another. Dolly only caught the end of his sentence. The other human scratched his chin thoughtfully, before responding. \"Hm...well, maybe. It'd have to be a pretty smart animal. But, so what if they can? This is surplus, it's gonna go to a compost heap or something, if a few animals wanna eat their fill, let 'em do it I say. It'll make <i>someone's</i> life a bit easier. Speakin' of easy lives, my wife was..\" Dolly stopped listening at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A surplus huh?\" Dolly muttered quietly to herself. \"And there's a way for animals to get in. Well, smart animals... <i>I'm</i> a pretty smart animal...\" Dolly quietly mused, forgetting about the stupid decision she just made that got her skateboard snapped. She watched the humans unload the last few crates of food, closing the shutter door behind it, and then drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolly immediately ran across the street once they were gone, looking up at the storage space building. She scanned it for an entrance of some kind, before taking a few deep sniffs- and getting a whiff of the same scent from those crates. She followed the trail around the side of the building, to a little alleyway, where there was a door...a door with a clearly damaged lock, hanging loosely beneath the knob. Dolly stood on her hind legs, propping herself up against the wall, and bit on the handle- which pulled down with no resistance, the door swinging open. \"Niiiice- free snacks!\" Dolly grinned at the open doorway, before poking her head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a supermarket in there! Well, a lot less clean and well kempt, but still! There were dozens and dozens of wide open bins lining the walls, forming little aisles- the place stretched back pretty far, meaning it was much bigger than it looked. Dolly hopped up and peered into one of the bins. It was full of hamburgers! Full hamburgers, half eaten, all kinds of toppings and stuff, all haphazardly tossed in and scattered around, falling off their buns and stuff. She looked in the next one and it was even more burgers! Unable to help herself, She stuck her head in- taking a big bite of one, it was still kinda warm! Then, after that, in the next bin were a buncha soft tacos! Or burritos- hard to tell since the tortillas had mostly flopped open, so it was just a mess of tortillas, beans, cheese, and ground meat, which Dolly promptly scooped up a mouthful of. She ran around, looking in all the bins. There was a bunch of melted ice cream with loose cones floating in it, which she lapped up like water- there were a bunch of slices of pizza, which she tore up and ate a whole one of. There was one filled entirely with buttery pasta, with nachos and all sorts of ingredients, hot dogs with every topping, popcorn and chips and pretzels, the gristly fatty cuts of steak. Dolly took a few heaping mouthfuls from every bin she looked in, pausing as she licked her lips, her slender, lean frame already showing a teeny bit of bloating around the midsection, as she licked her lips, eyes watering with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh myy GOD! How long has THIS been here??? How'd we never notice it??? Is this even real- did I die when I hit that tree and go to heaven??\" She said, to no one in particular. She looked up, her eyes catching a big ol' sign hanging above the shutter doors interior. \"Expired Food Composting Center...\" She read out loud. That gave her a moment's pause. She glanced at a nearby bin, filled to the brim with boneless buffalo wings, smothered in sauces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolly gave the bin a suspicious sniff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by a hearty bite, scooping up more than seven wings at once, chewing them up, and swallowing- licking the sauce off her lips, smirking as she gave a satisfied pat to her now noticeably larger stomach, packed with illicitly acquired junk food, smirking and belching loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>BBBRRRUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPP!!!</i></b> Hehehehe- doesn't taste expired to me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His rear end was larger than any horse, the two white, jiggly domes that made up his butt took up quite a lot of space in doorways and such.

He made a system for patrols to walk around in the city at both daytime and nighttime to make sure that the streets was remaining safe for the town citizens. He inspected and tested all kind of new weapons that was made by the city blacksmiths to se if it was good enough for mass-producing. He even invented obstacle courses and fitness programs to make sure that everybody was in the best shape possible, both men and horses.

Since all his work barley contained times of him moving from one place to the other Maximus body became very relaxed. The fact that the other things he did when not working was eating and sleeping didn\u2019t help that much. When he eats his body didn\u2019t move enough to be able to burn the extra calories it got, and when a workday was done he was usually so tired that he just went asleep without taking a chance to look at the changes his body was going through.

To start with his neck was now much thicker and you could see a clear layer of fat making it bigger. His chest was puffing out and becoming wider by his weight. His legs while still being as thin and strong as of before, started to get absorbed by his fattening chest and belly. And speaking of his belly that was something. Like on all horses his belly was the number one sign that he was losing his shape. As is had gone from being one of his most thinnest and muscle filled area, to becoming big, round, and wide. Lastly every time he leaved a room everyone in it was greeted to his fatted up behind, that was like everything else bigger, wider, and full of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everybody very clearly noticing it they where all very afraid to tell Maximus about it. Being well known as the horse who legends tells about defeated a bandit gang of 20 persons all by himself made everybody afraid of what he would do to the one calling him fat. Even though he now looked like he could barley run a couple of yards before getting himself tired nobody wanted to take the risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn\u2019t have to worry because Maximus himself would very soon discover it on his own. What is it that makes Maximus finally realize what his body has become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus gets put into position as the new captain of the guards. His duties consist of inspecting every single soldier and horse is in top shape and their equipment is of good quality. Taking up so much time of his days Maximus doesn\u2019t get time to keep himself in shape, but his new role doesn\u2019t give him time to notice it either. Because of his men being a bit feared by their leader, no one dares to say anything to him about his weight. Until one day when something happens that makes it all sink in to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A very important day for the kingdom was about to arrive. It was the day when the princess was rescued and reunited with her parents. To celebrate this there was going to be big parade throughout the whole city where Maximus and Eugene Rider (Previously known as Flynn Rider) where going to be the center of attention because of them both being the ones who rescued the princess in question. To reconstruct those wonderful events of that day both Eugene and Maximus was going to be dressed like they where a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Eugene it was no problems getting dress in the same cloths he had been having for most of his life, the same couldn\u2019t be said for Maximus. For almost the whole year Maximus had never been needed for patrolling duty and had there for never been anywhere near his old saddle. So when the day arrived everything started fine with Eugene helping Maximus to get dressed. He had no problems putting on his horseshoes and his bridles, but when they got to his saddle, things started to go wrong. After putting it on Eugene pulled the strap under Maximus belly and tried to fit one of the strap holes into the belt, only to find it being too small to reach even the nearest hole into it. \u201cLooks like you have put on some weight since last time you wore this thing.\u201d Eugene said and looked at the holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Eugene this seemed like a smaller but soon fixed problem, but for Maximus this was a violent wakeup call. He had never once thought about his weight, and now he stood here and couldn\u2019t get his own saddle on even if he tried to suck his stomach in. \u201cI think I know a way to fix this problem.\u201d Eugene said and pulled a small knife from his right boot. He took the strap and stabbed some new holes closer to the end of the strap. He then tried to put the saddle on again, and found it fit this time. \u201cThere. Look at yourself in the mirror Maximus, how do you think you look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself Maximus felt miserable. He, who once was a hard working royal army horse in great shape, was now a big sack of lazy lard. He felt ashamed over what he had done to himself. But the most humiliating thing when he looked at his own reflection had to be the saddle with the extra holes. His saddle was a special designed handcrafted part of his outfit, by putting this extra holes Eugene had unintentionally ruined the thing. He couldn\u2019t be mad at Eugene, he didn\u2019t know it was a special made one. No, he only blamed himself for doing this on himself. Eugene didn\u2019t seem to notice Maximus feeling bad about his own looks, and instead reminded him about what they where dressed up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think, but I think we are going to look awesome for the parade.\u201d Hearing the P word made Maximus whole world chatter. He had been so taken by seeing his own body that he had forgot for a second what was about to happen. In only a few moments they where both going to be led through the city with everybody living there watching them. Almost everyone that he had ever met was going to be watching him, walking through the town, looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt scared, he felt ashamed, he felt he just wanted to run away and never see anyone ever again. But he knew that was impossible. There was royal guards guarding everything, and the only door out of this stable was guarded by two men. It felt like it all was some kind of nightmare for him, that if he only waited he was going to wake up, young and thin just like before. But he knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opens and the two guards entered. \u201cOkay Eugene and Maximus, we need you both to get into you\u2019re positions.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Eugene said and jumped up on Maximus back. Maximus felt a little pain in his back, not because of Eugene\u2019s weight but by the combination of Eugene\u2019s weight and his added. One of the guards took in Maximus bridle and tried to lead him out. At first Maximus didn\u2019t move because he didn\u2019t want to show himself like this, but then he knew that making a scene here would only make things worse for him. So he decided to be a good horse and followed out. \u201cAre you having stage fright buddy?\u201d Eugene whispered into Maximus ear, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\u2019s just what it was going to be for him. Had he not known about his new looks he would have wondered why people would look at him so strangely, but now he knew just what every single stare meant. As the parade started and he started to do his walk thought the town, all of his worst nightmares came through. He could she the look of people wondering the same things as he had. \u201cWhat had happen to this great hero horse that saved our princess? Why had he let himself go so badly? He\u2019s just a big fat shadow of his former self.\u201d Some people didn\u2019t want to have eye contact with him, and some just wanted to point finger and laugh at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the parade continues Maximus could see some of the solders and horses he had been training staring at him. Thinking back he could remember them staring at him in just the same way months before this event. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have seen that before?\u201d Maximus though. Like that wasn\u2019t bad enough he could feel himself starting to sweat. \u201cAm I sweating?!\u201d he though, \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything but walking calmly this whole time. Am I really in such bad shape that walking for more then a half-hour is too much for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the parade both Eugene and Maximus was suppose be greeted by the princess herself and her parents. \u201cIf there is any kind of comfort to this it is that most of those I\u2019m working for have seen me like this in a long time.\u201d Maximus though. But all that would change now as the princess hadn\u2019t been meeting her heroic horse in almost the whole year, and didn\u2019t know the changes he had gone through. As they arrived Eugene jumped of Maximus, and bowed down to the royal family. Maximus did the same thing, even though his body made it hard. The princess then walked up to Eugene, put a sword on each of his shoulders, and knighted him before telling him that he could stand up again. She then walked over to Maximus to do the same, and first then noticed his enlarged figure. Before knighting him she walked up close to him and whispered \u201cHave you gone and gained some weight since when we last saw each other?\u201d while patting on his belly a little. This felt like the most embarrassing moment yet for him as even thought the princess didn\u2019t meant to do anything wrong, it still felt like her way of saying \u201cLook at how fat he is.\u201d Never could he imagine that being knighted would be so awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was set and done Maximus still felt like he had been fooling everyone. That he had been just been given a title he didn\u2019t deserved. What was he going to do to make these bad feelings disappear? There was only one obvious answer. To get back into the same shape as before. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop before I\u2019m as strong and thin as I was before becoming a hero!\u201d Maximus thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fate would have it that something would happen soon that would make Maximus goal of getting his glory days back stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he gets out of the stable Maximus was very determined to figure out a plan to lose his weight that would match his tight schedule that he didn\u2019t notice a big stack of barrels that was bound together got loose, and started rolling towards him. He didn\u2019t manage to do anything more then to pick up the sounds of it and see the barrels before they where all over him. His fat form got knocked over by the first one, and then started to roll down the street with the rest of them. He finally hit a wall and stopped, but when he tried to get up he felt a horrible pain enter one of his legs, making it impossible for him to stand up. Very quickly people started to rush to help him, including his former rider and former captain of the guards. \u201cMaximus, are you hurt?\u201d Maximus answered by pointing one of his hooves to the one that was hurting. The captain took and felt on it and Maximus started to make sounds of pain. \u201cOh dear god, I think you may have broken you\u2019re leg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus was brought into the stable again laid down carefully on the hay covered floor by a bunch of strong city men that had carried him in. As he laid there trying to make the pain feel less, the captain had brought in a veterinarian to help take a closer look, and maybe tell them that the captain was wrong about Maximus leg. But sadly after doing some examinations on all of Maximus legs the vet gave the sad news that Maximus indeed had one broken leg. \u201cThe only thing I think we can do now is to put down this horse, and end its suffering.\u201d He said. The captain wouldn\u2019t have any of this and told the vet aggressive, \u201cListen! I don\u2019t think you know what kind of horse you\u2019re talking about right now. That is Maximus, and he\u2019s no ordinary horse. He\u2019s the great hero horse who just moments earlier was honored in a parade for saving our kingdom\u2019s princess. There will only one horse like him ever, and I\u2019m not going to end his life unless there isn't another way.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d The vet said, \u201cBut it\u2019s not as easy like when this kind of thing happens to a human. Just like a human a horse would have to keep itself still while being bandaged, and not let any weight rest onto its broken leg. A horse simply can\u2019t do that. They will not understand what they need to do to get healed again.\u201d \u201cMaximus is much smarter than any other horse you ever seen vet.\u201d The captain said, \u201cIf you just tell him what to do to get his leg fixed, he will do it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand reality, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d The vet was saying before being interrupted by the captain. \u201cPlease, at least try.\u201d The captain begged. After thinking for a moment the vet sighed and said, \u201cFine. If you really think this horse is smart enough to understand it, I will try to fix him.\u201d \u201cOh, thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d The captain said and hugged the veterinarian. \u201cYou have no idea how much this means to me.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the captains grip the vet walked back to Maximus, who was still laying on his back trying to find a good position for his broken leg. \u201cListen here Maximus.\u201d The vet said, making Maximus turn his head to him and listen. \u201cWhat I can try to do to fix your leg is to put it in a cast and bound some sticks around it to keep it straight. But to make it have some effect it requires you to keep yourself lying still on the floor, and not try to make any attempt to walk or even stand up. Doing that would very easy break the support that will be around your leg, and could even make the damage even worse. Do you understand?\u201d Maximus answered by nodding his head. \u201cGood. Then I shall do my best to try and fix your leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hard work period of keeping Maximus leg straight and putting the cast on, the vet looked Maximus in the eyes and said. \u201cAfter getting a closer look at your leg and getting the cast on, I would say that you would have to lay here now and avoid movement for about\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was going to just let his already unfit body to do nothing else but lazing around for two months while his bad leg was slowly getting fixed. Seeing the horse\u2019s face expression the vet asked if he understood the importance of doing what he was told if he was ever going to be able to walk again. Maximus once again gave him the same kind nod that he gave earlier, only this time the horse had to really force himself to understand the painful truth of it. It was eider to do this or to be put down forever. But understanding that once those two months where gone and he could start to train his body then, Maximus agreed to have himself in a constant rest for this time period. Two months didn\u2019t seem like that hard of a time to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he would be so wrong. The first few days didn\u2019t seem that bad. He was getting his leg put up nicely with pillows and blankets, he was being generously feed by both his feeder and other persons who wanted to share their chare towards him, and his original owner the former captain was constantly by his side to give his support. But as time went on his friend had to go back on duty and his visits became less and less frequent. The people who liked to share to him became less and less frequent as well, being not so rich they only seemed to share something to him once and then never again. Only rarely did he see the face of someone visiting him twice. Even the guy who was put in feeding him on regular pace had other horses to work with and once he was done feeding Maximus he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bad thing about all this care he got was that it made his belly become even bigger then it already was. Even when the number of people feeding him started to decrease Maximus lack of movement made his gaining inevitable. Being forced to lie on his back during this whole period made it impossible for Maximus to not stare right at his own fatted middle. It was very slow process, but when there was almost nothing else to do for Maximus then to look at his own bulking center it was almost possible for him to actually see the gaining happening with his own eyes. Seeing it rise and become even bigger as the days went on. It was driving him crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting through one month of it Maximus was really starting to feel the hope of him getting back his once slim figure again fading. He had through his own eyes seen how his stomach had at a slow but steady pace been stretching out in all kind of ways. It had gone so far that he actually started to lose some of his vision because of it, but that could as well be his fattening neck and chins that was stopping him from reaching his head up as much as before. Having him lying like this pinned on his back was getting more and more humiliating by the day. The few people that were visiting him now all had the same look of fascination when they saw him laying there on the floor. They had probably never seen a horse with such a big stomach before, or maybe it was because he was in such a position that he was exposing his stomach so gracefully to everybody watching. Even his owner started to look a bit ashamed of letting people know that this was his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his own belly fat Maximus wondered why this thing even existed and why it had come down to ruin his life so much. Feeling really frustrated Maximus took and shoved a hoof into it as a way of letting his anger out, and found to his surprise that it felt somewhat good. Starting to rub his hoof slightly in a circle like pattern he started to for the first time in long feel relaxed. Like how all his bad emotions in him where being silenced gently, and he started to almost go into a trance like state of just rubbing his gut, when he got himself back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not going to let the fat win! He was going to get his leg fixed, and then he was going to do put himself in such a big fitness program that he was going to lose it all in no time. He promised himself that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One and a half month of the two months period had passed, and things had really spun out of control for Maximus. Ever since that first time feeling and rubbing his belly fat he hasn\u2019t been able to control it. He promised himself to not like it and focus on getting better and on the training, but it felt so squishy and warm that he couldn\u2019t resist and the next day he was at it again. After five minutes he once again told himself to not love and let it be. Next day again he was at it for ten minutes, and then 15 the next day, and then 20, and then 25, and then a half-hour, and then a whole hour, and finally he was so lost in loving his own fat that it was all he did every woken hour. He rubbed it with his three good legs, poked them deep into its deep softness, gave it a huge hug, and even jiggled it around with all his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany people seeing him now either thought he had gone crazy or was getting more sick, but Maximus didn\u2019t care if he was making a fool out of himself now, his belly massages was so wonderful that nothing maters to him anymore. For many of the kingdoms kids he became a great attraction to see. He would do all kind of funny moves and stuff just to have the kids feed him apple. They had fun and he had fun so he didn\u2019t complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day when there was about a week left before getting his cast Maximus got a surprise visit. It was his old owner the former guard captain who was back for an early morning visit. Since seeing him around his first week of living like this the captain had been forced to take Maximus job while he was still laying of getting his leg better, and hasn\u2019t been able to see him in almost a month. Hearing the familiar sound of the door bell got Maximus excited. Ever since starting to love rubbing his fat Maximus loved doing it at most while having some new food inside of him, and since the sound of the doorbell almost always meant food he was fully prepared. He thought it sounded a bit earlier then usual for someone to come, but he thought it was just a kid who took a quick visit to see him before school. He started to roll slightly from side to side making himself funny for the kids who wanted to feed him apples, but seeing his former owner and friend in the eyes again made Maximus for the first time in a longtime to realized how far away from his old self he now was. He stopped rolling and looked both scared and embarrassed into the eyes of his old friend. The captain himself didn\u2019t do anything but stare back for a while before saying, \u201cWell, haven't you changed some since we last saw?\u201d in a very playful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus wasn\u2019t completely sure on what to think at first, here he was expecting to get a big scolding from the man that he had been doing his army training with, and now he was just acting like what has happen to him was not a big deal. \u201cWhere you trying to make yourself look cute and cuddly so kids would feed you apples?\u201d He said and rubbed the top of his belly slightly, Maximus felt his whole face turning red by embarrassment. He then looked at Maximus plastered leg and asked him if his leg was feeling any better now. Maximus answered by lifting on of his good fore legs and turning it from side to side in a kind of \u201cMeh\u201d signal. \u201cStill a bit bad eh,\u201d He said resting his hand once again on Maximus big belly and started stroking it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Maximus tried his hardest to not reveal how much he liked it. He had done this kind of stroking on himself several times, but it had never felt as good as now when human hands where doing it. Without thinking what he was doing he let out a sound that almost sounded like a moan of pleasure. This caught the captain\u2019s attention who asked, \u201cDo you like that Maximus?\u201d Feeling even more embarrassed now Maximus knew that things couldn\u2019t get worse now so he answered by giving a nod.  Seeing this the captain took once again and stroked lightly over Maximus big wide belly, making the horse let out these moaning like sounds again. \u201cThat feels really good for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He asked and Maximus answered by giving another nod, this time with more enthusiasm in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but what\u2019s this?\u201d The captain asked as he pulled out a very delicious looking red apple from his jacket pocket. The combination of feeling very happy from the belly massage and the sight of the nice juicy apple made Maximus very excited of wanting to eat it. Seeing this the captain ordered Maximus to lay still on his back as he took and placed it on the top on the middle of Maximus belly. \u201cI want you now to try and eat this apple,\u201d Maximus was on his way to try and knock it of with on of his hooves when the captain finished, \u201cWithout using your legs.\u201d At first he wondered if he was serious, but looking him in the eyes Maximus realized that this time he was serious. \u201cI want to see that you get at least some exercise while I\u2019m here.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus took a deep sigh first, thinking about all the strength this would take before starting. As he took and started to stretch his head and neck up he started to first now really feel how much bigger he had become during this time. He could feel how the extra layers of fat in his neck and shins and chest where all doing there best to prevent him from reaching to his goal. As he stretched on he could see the apple sitting there so close, and still feeling so far away. As he tried to get closer he started to lift some of his back up from the ground, making his whole midsection starting to bend over and created new love handles. To his horror he saw the apple almost starting to tip over, making him pull himself back. Taking a minute to think out a new plan he started to see just how flexible his new middle mass was. Seeing how he could make it rise and sink in a way he wanted he got an idea. By making the chest of his belly sink down and letting the underside of it rise up, Maximus got the apple to start rolling down towards his head and straight into his open mouth. Taking it inside and swallowing it Maximus had succeeded the challenge. \u201cGood job Maximus,\u201d The captain said, \u201cA really tactician always knows how to make his biggest disadvantages into his greatest advantages.\u201d He then patted Maximus belly to indicate what he ment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so made Maximus belly start to gurgle powerfully, all that hard work in getting that apple plus still being the early morning meant that Maximus ahdn\u2019t have a really meal yet. \u201cAre you hungry also?\u201d The captain asked teasingly. Maximus played along and nodded before another stomach gurgle made itself heard. \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d The captain said, \u201cI can go and ask the man who feed who if I can take on the job of feeding you today. Plus I have made sure so I\u2019m free from work today, meaning I could use all day feeding you until you big belly reaches its limit.\u201d He said pressing his whole hand firmly on it. The thought of getting to eat apples until he couldn\u2019t take anymore made Maximus gaping his mouth in a way that almost looked like a smile. \u201cBut, seeing who you really like getting your stomach rubbed, I thought that maybe I should feed you a normal amount of apples and then use the whole day to give you the best belly rub ever?\u201d The mention of that made Maximus big horse smile to become even bigger. \u201cI sadly don\u2019t have time to do both so you have to decide, Apple stuffing or Belly rub. What do you choose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it for a short time Maximus decides to choose...</span></div></div>",

You could start to walk around again, but I recommend you to not start running until another week or so.\" the vet said before he let Maximus walk free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to once again stand on his bad leg was a very weird feeling for Maximus. After two months of laying on his back, (And one of playing with his belly fat) standing on all four felt strange...Or rather the feeling of having his stomach hanging down and his legs pressed next to it felt weird. After discovering half way through the resting this wonderful feeling he got from touching his own fat Maximus hadn't been able to stop feeling \"funny\". It felt like every time one of his hooves touched the soft, warm, place that where his middle he would get a small tingling feeling inside. Like it was his soft spot. So now having his wide center digging itself into his legs was a new feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started to walk he could really feel just how much bigger his belly had become. Before he would have felt it being a little bit in contact with his legs but still be able to walk like it was nothing. Now on the other hand he was forced to have his legs spread out wider so he wouldn't be feel like he was trying to force his legs into his stomach, and now every step he took would lead to him pressing or scratching his belly slightly, making him feel a bit \"aroused\" with every move. Having his belly sway and his almost everything he came close to also made Maximus feel the same feelings as he did when he had his leg broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he might have a problem Maximus thought about what to do. He could either try to lose some of his weight and still have a nice belly to play with on his spare time. Or he could pig himself out, make his stomach bigger, and have an even more wonderful belly rub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he choose?</span></div></div>",

He loved the feelings he got from his belly rubs, and only wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how would he do to get that food? Being hospitalised for two months had made most of his important jobs being assigned by others, which meant he didn't have any money to buy food with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembers he had seen horses working by giving kids pony rides had been given a lot of stuff to eat by both the owners and the kids visiting. Even though going from a kingdom saving hero to a fat petting zoo kids toy sounded like a (to say the least) humiliated way to go, it still sounded like a good option. He remembered all of the kids that where happy to see him when he laid with a broken leg, and gave him food to make him feel better. He felt happy, and they felt happy that he was happy. Becoming a pet zoo horse would only make things better for all of them. A day of this new life would be him leading a child around on his back, making it feel like it can ride a horse, having a lot of fun and also growing as a person. And after that he would have a bunch of other kids that just want to try and feed the horse. It started to sound more and more like the perfect life for him the more he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing his deep thinking Maximus nostrils picked up a delicious smell coming from one of the stores, and his body went on auto pilot and started to move to the source. The source turned out to be pies. Yummy, deliciously smelling pies. Maximus was about to take a bite out of one, when he got his by a rolling pin. \"Get away from my pies you fat slob of a horse!\" The man owning the store said angrily. \"If you don't have any money to pay, beat it!\" He said and forced Maximus away from his store. He then took the pies that was out for display and closed the door violently. Maximus felt really upset over how he had been treated by the man. Even if he didn't know who Maximus was (Or didn't recognize him in his even bigger state) it was no good way in treating a costumer. A man that cruel didn't deserve pies that good, and that made another idea spark inside Maximus head. An idea of him breaking into the store at night-time, and eat all of the pies himself. It did sound illegal and he could be in big trouble if he got caught, but those pies had smelt so good that he was prepared to do anything to get a chance to taste them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of the ideas does he go with?</span></div></div>",

This was his chance to prove that he could still provide the hero role, despite his extra weight. His plan on stopping it and saving the people on-board was to face away from it, wait until the right moment, and then put up his hind legs and send such great counter force to completely stop it. (But given his size he could just have used his huge horse rump as an airbag, and it would have probably done the same.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made himself ready, (Hoping his front legs would be able to hold the rest of his weight.) lifted his hind legs up, and was just about to kick the cart when something sent <b>him</b> away from spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another stallion, this one having a much more coal black coat and white mane in contrast to Maximus's white coat. That wasn't the only thing that this stallion had in contrast to him since he (unlike Maximus) was incredibly fit. He wasn't only free from any unnecessary body fat, he had also legs, chest, waist, neck and other parts of his body swelling with muscles. He looked just like Maximus had done back during his \"glory days\", if not even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Maximus had time to think about that, as while the tall dark stranger stallion was about to do what he had planned to do, Maximus was now instead doing the almost impossible task of \"Walking around on only his front legs while the rest of his body is hanging in the air\". He wanted to just lower his legs and make it stop, but the push from the other stallion had managed to distracted him so much that he now instead had his legs lifted up even more. So much in fact that even parts of his crazy wide back and spine was starting to bend over it self. It was a pretty amazing site for a horse his size to do that, but Maximus knew that if he stopped moving his legs it would cause him to immediately fall forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting rid of Maximus the mysterious stallion kept focus on saving the run away cart. He put himself into position, lifted his hind legs, and with the right amount of force managed to make the cart stop right in front of him. It didn't take long for the ones on-board the cart and the city folks watching it to start gathering around the stallion to congratulate him. Some royal guards that had not been quick enough to react to the situation was also very impressed by the bravery from this dark night coloured horse. \"That was amazing what you just did brave horse.\" The captain of the group said, as he walked up to the horse, as if he was just like a human hero. \"How can we ever thank you for all you done...?\" The captain said before realizing he had forgot something very important. \"What is your name?\" He asked the horse, not expecting it to speak back but at least help give them a clue. The horse \"answered\" by pointing a hoof at a white lighting shaped form on one of his legs. \"So you're called...<i>White lighting</i>?\" The captain asked, and the stallion nicked his head to say yes. \"Well, like I was about to say. How can we ever thanks you for saving the these lives...\" The captain once again asked, only to be interrupted by a loud \"CRASH\" sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at what had caused it they all saw that it was Maximus, who had finally managed to lose his balance walking on only his front legs, and had fallen right into a big apple stand. Now he laid there on his back in the broken stand among apples that had fallen off and onto the ground, apples that had been crushed to applesauce, and apples that was still laying in one piece under him. (Almost making it look like he was laying on a bed of apples.) And to top it all of he had a big red juicy apple stuffed in his mouth, making him look like a stuffed pig on Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was suppose to be his moment of glory had instead made him look like an even bigger joke then before. There was kids pointing and laughing at the fat horse laying among the apples, adult's who just tried to hold themselves from laughing at the sight, and soldiers that looked really ashamed over once having had Maximus as their own inspiration for becoming the best defenders for this kingdom. The soldiers instead gathered around this new heroic horse, and gave him all the praises and cheer's that they otherwise would have been giving to Maximus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everybody followed the black stallion with the white lighting mark away from the place, Maximus was left to get out of the apple stand on his own. After getting up and standing on all four again he could feel that he was still having that big read apple in between his teethes. He could just have spitted it out, but things where so bad now that he thought he might have the apple to cheer himself up a little. But he had barley chewed and swallowed it before he could hear the sound of something metallic hitting the cobblestone ground at a with a quick \"Ding\" sound. Maximus was about to look over at what it was when he could feel the answer becoming painfully clear. It was the metal lock that kept the belt on the saddle in place, and by eating that big apple it had made Maximus's waist so wide that it couldn't take anymore and just popped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus could feel the saddle starting to slip of from one side, and before he could do anything it fell completely off and hit the ground. That was it. That was the last thing proving that he was a part of the royal defence's gone. There was now nothing that would make anyone looking at him believe that he used to be some kind of hero, but instead believing that he's just a fat white horse with nothing at al. He knew he could just have not eaten that apple to start with, but that's something he could have done countless times before getting to this state. If he didn't care about stopping then, then why stopping now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this going to be the end of Maximus's heroic life?</span></div></div>",

This pitch black stallion with the one white lighting bolt shaped mark on one of his legs was like a creature sent from the devil himself to Maximus, while everyone else saw him as a bless from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't hard to see why. When a small fire had started Maximus had been running of with a small bucket to get some water from the river, and when he came back he sees that White Lighting had already put the fire out with the help of a whole barrel full of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment was when what looked like a poisonous venous snake was loose White Lighting took and put a hoof on top of the head of the snake to keep it still, while Maximus got so scared by the snake (He has a phobia for snakes) that it made his fatted body jiggle in a funny way for everybody to see. (Especially the people standing behind him got a real eye full of how much he could make his butt fat shake.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course was not helping Maximus self confidence, since everyway he looked and listen all he could see and hear was how all kinds of different people talking about \"How great this new horse was\", and \"How he should replace Maximus as the protector of your kingdom\". The other things he seemed to see everywhere was apples. Lots and lots of apples seemed to be stacked everywhere. If it wasn't on sales on a wagon, or simply one in a person's hand Maximus could swear that the image of these apples was starting to become a permanent mark inside of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his diet seemed to be consisting of nothing but those cursed fruits. No matter if he was depressed of just hungry Maximus seemed to always be near some apples to eat. And for every one he swallowed down he could almost feel how it was becoming a part of his ever growing stomach. It almost felt like his middle was just a huge sack for where he could store all of his apples.,still un-chewed and rolling around with every step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird thing was that despite all the positive attention White Lighting was getting and all the humiliation Maximus got, he was still having his role as the leader of the defence. The council all thought unanimously that despite this new horse having done some heroic things it could never compared to the same level as Maximus returning the princess and saving the kingdom from an evil which. \"He's still going to be seen as the true heroic horse in our eyes.

Unlike White Lighting, Maximus had the tailors working for the royal family doing his clothes. But also unlike White Lighting, Maximus had about 2-3 times the body his rival had, so when the tailors tried to make the thing go under and be nicely wrapped around like with White Lightning's rug they found out that they had Maximus's huge belly hanging in the way. And no matter how hard they tried they couldn't make it go around him without making it look like Maximus was carrying around ten foals inside of him. So what they did instead was to cut open the bottom of it and let it hang down to each side to try and discreetly hide just how large Maximus's midsection really was. This had bad effect of him looking like he was wearing a tablecloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party things seems to be going quite well for Maximus so far. While White Lightning was getting a lot more attention from people wanting to greet him more then Maximus, he still seemed to have his most trusting (And most importantly) of his fans left. Those where the royal council and the royal family themselves, and as long as he had them still liking him there was nothing that White Lighting could do to take his job from him. Looking at the royal family again he first now noticed that someone very important to him was missing. The princess, Rapunzel.</span></div></div>",

He just wanted to ran away and forget everything, and that's just what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone was to busy celebrating the black horse with white lighting bolt on his leg, the fat white horse took off and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears where rolling down Maximus's eyes as he didn't have anything left now. He had lost his honour, his fame, his job, and his body. He was nothing but a <i>simple working horse</i> now, no wait. He was even <b>worse</b> then a simple working horse, since with his large frame he wasn't going to be able to do most kind of shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept running through the castle's many rooms and halls he doesn't even seems to care where he was or where he was going. Nothing really mattered to him now, and he just wanted nothing more then to be left alone somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he spotted a room with a door open just slightly. He didn't know why, but something about <u>that</u> door and <i>that</i> room was really <i>dragging</i> him to it. Once he went inside and closed the door behind him he couldn't believe what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his careless running he had managed to find a room that was nothing more then a huge pantry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this place where just about everything you could imagine. There was milk and flour, fruit and vegetables, meat, fish, chicken and much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had caught Maximus attention most was, you guessed it. A big red juicy apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Maximus was about to lean forward and just eat it, but he stopped himself just before biting into it. \"This all belong to the royal family, and I can't take their food from them. It is amongst my rights as a working part of the royal defence that I...\" Maximus thought to himself, but then it hit him. He wasn't a part of the royal defence anymore. He had no rules to follow and nothing preventing him from having a feast right then and there if he wants to. \"It would still probably be considered breaking the law.\" Maximus thought, before looking at that nice red apple again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pretty much sealed the deal. Maximus had pretty much nothing to lose on this. He would probably never even get to set his hooves in the castle again, so why not leave doing what you love most?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting himself ready Maximus took off and went head first towards the apple, slamming his body towards the wall in the process and making half of the things on shelf's fall down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing now covered in flour and eggs and salad Maximus felt even less as his usual self, and he used that as an excuse to be even more crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tearing up pieces of meat like a dog, rolled around in the mess on the floor like a pig, and even tried to eat the wooden bowls and plates like he was a goat. He was pretty much being every kind of animal except a horse at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so into his crazy antics that he didn't even noticed someone else entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until seeing a shadowy figure and the light from the hall that Maximus looks up to see_____standing by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/14644443/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/14644443...</a> (Imagine the horse in the picture to be Maximus and you will have a very accurate picture of how his reaction to when this other character enters the pantry.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maximus thought deeply about the incident, knowing that the Princess was an exceptionally important member of the Kingdom. Pondering the string of events that had transpired in the last few weeks; White Lightening showing up and saving the day on multiple occasions, always seeming to be in the right place at the right time, and completely one-upping Maximus at every turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat stallion considered the nature of the dagger, the sliced rope, White Lightening's almost psychic response. He decided that these factors were too similar to be coincidence. So what was White Lightening's intentions? The overweight horse contemplated numerous possibilities, but could only really come to two conclusions. Either the horse was undermining the bulbous horse in order to attain position of Captain of the Guard, or White Lightening's desires stretched further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nervous shiver rippled through Maximus' spine, issuing a jelly-like quiver from his puffy neck, wobbling through his low-hanging belly, and petering out with a gentle shaking of his rear. The stallion realized that there was only one true option to take in this course: he needed another individual's opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Maximus thought of Flynn, the thief-turned-prince was a perfect partner in aiding the horse's quest for truth. With a sense of affirmation that notifying the prince was the best road, Maximus trotted out of the castle doors and after Flynn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught up with the prince after some time, the stallion's sloshing belly often creased and smooshed against his legs when traveling at a faster pace. Stopping up short when he finally found the prince walking along one of the castle's passages. Flynn seemed to be distracted by the notion that his wife had almost lost her life today from something as trivial as a freak chandelier accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, what's up with you?\" Flynn asked the obese stallion, whose sides bulged in and out rapidly from the quick pace of travel. \"What's in your mouth? A knife? You can eat a lot of things, but I doubt even you could stomach a dagger.\" Flynn remarked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus glowered at Flynn until the prince reciprocated his words, \"All right, all right, I'm sorry. So what is the dagger for then?\" He inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse quickly changed is expression to one of relief, now that he knew Flynn was taking him seriously. Maximus did his best to emulate the actions that transpired in the ball room. He made a gesture towards Flynn with a concerned expression on his face. \"Something to do with me. Tonight?\" The prince guessed. Maximus nodded vigorously, and made a rolling motion with his muzzle to keep going, which unintentionally sent another wave of ripples rolling quaintly through the stallion's flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to do with me...so I suppose the only thing important enough would be the chandelier event?\" Flynn asked. Maximus was already nodding before Flynn concluded his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus then turned the dagger's hilt in his mouth, went over to a rope that supported one of the royal flags near the edge of the walkway, and made a cutting impression with the dagger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn snapped his fingers in recognition, \"You think someone cut the rope. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus nodded once more and then gestured aggressively to himself to signify that a horse had been the culprit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you did this?\" Flynn asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus froze for a moment and the rigorously shook his head, creating accordion rolls in his neck with each sway. Maximus thought for a moment, before taking the dagger and rotating his head as far as he could to get as close to his side as possible. He was trying to specify the spot where White Lightening's trademark emblem was, but his bulbous belly was making it difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion then used the dagger to mimic a classic lightening symbol on his bountiful flank. He did so twice, before he lost his footing and slipped on the cobblestone. Maximus toppled over and crashed to the ground with a humiliating <i>whump</i> that sent his entire body sloshing. He landed on his side and, while his belly took the majority of the impact, the blow was enough to knock the breath out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus wheezed a couple of times, gasping like a fish before finally getting his breath back and inflating his belly widely in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn was too busy laughing to initially aid the horse, but came over and helped brace Maximus to get him back on his hooves. \"Heh...you alright buddy?\" Flynn inquired. When Maximus affirmed that he was, Flynn returned to a serious mindset and said \"I think I know where you were going with the message. The only other horse present at the ceremony was White Lightening, and the mark you mimed was his right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus let out a sigh of relief when and grinned to confirm Flynn's theory. He was happy in the knowledge that another person knew of the danger Rapunzel was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the question is, what should we do about it?\" Flynn contemplated. \"I mean, White Lightening is the most popular figure in the kingdom right now, and this accusation goes against everything he's done for the people.\" Maximus sighed. \"And saving the princess was the icing on the cake.\" Flynn noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of cake, Maximus' monolithic belly growled and rippled with a snarling hunger. The horse turned a crimson red while Flynn smiled. \"We also might have to do something to sate your hunger,\" Flynn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus only nodded in agreement, seeing as it was futile to deny what was blatantly obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now, we need to come up with a plan to catch White Lightening. We can't simply arrest a public hero, he needs to be caught in the act.\" Flynn said. \"What to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each snarl reverberated through his cavernous gut, leaving his belly wobbling with tremors. \"Though perhaps you could use something to eat before we go,\" Flynn noted. Maximus only nodded in agreement, as he couldn't do much else with hunger pangs shooting through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we stop off at a pastry shop before and sate your hunger?\" Flynn asked as the two traversed the cobbled path. Maximus eagerly agreed and soon the two spotted a pastry shop a little ways down the boulevard. The sign above it read <i>The Flakey Peasant</i>, and showed a commoner holding a tray of glorious confections. Maximus felt his mouth flood with drooling anticipation and spurred up his pace to reach the shop sooner. Flynn could only laugh and fell into a slow jog behind the horse, getting a good view of the horse steadily swaying backside whose bulging cheeks jiggled with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse and the prince, focused on reaching the shop, failed to notice the silhouette flitting through the alleyways a small ways behind the duo. The figure was hooded and melded with the shadows as it observed the pair finally reaching the shop and disappearing inside. The dark figure contemplated this, and then quickly darted off to notify his quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing! The small bell above the pastry shop rang, signifying Maximus and Flynn's entrance. Looking around, they saw a sturdy wooden counter sitting at the back of the room. To the right stood a pair of swinging doors that lead back into the kitchen. On the left wall, several rustic benches and tables were lined up to accommodate any folk wishing to enjoy their confections in good company. The right wall hosted a couple more benches and a large, ornate display of the various pastries the shop proffered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus walked over to the display, noting the variety of flavors and choices he had to choose from. Apple fritters, croissants, strudels, eclairs, cakes, pies, cream horns, puffs, rolls, buns, pretzels, and knotted breads coupled with glazes, fruit garnishes, sugars, icing, caramel, and chocolate. Maximus' mind nearly shorted out before he heard a low swoop of the doors and jolted out of his stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there, kind sirs,\" An older, well-built man said with a hint of humor. \"Can I help you?\" The man was obviously the owner and creator of the shop's contents, and Flynn quickly recovered to introduce himself and his companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir,\" Flynn greeted politely, \"My name is Fl-.\" \"Ah yes, you're Flynn Rider, the hero who rescued the princess, with the aid of..\" he cast a quick glance at the horse, \"Maximus the captain of the guard. It is an honor to host your presence in my humble shop,\" The man said rather quickly, not quite believing the caliber of the two individuals' reputations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, exactly,\" Flynn said. \"We were hoping to acquire some food to counter my friend's hunger.\" As if on que, Maximus' stomach unleashed another snarl that sent his belly rippling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper smiled slightly at the comedic timing of the growl, and said \"I would love to be of service,\" he noted the sheer size of the horse's belly. He'd heard that Maximus had let himself go, but now he was able to see for himself. The stallion's belly hung low, rounded out in the middle and pressing slightly against his legs where it creased and smushed slightly. The equine's flanks and posterior were swaddled in fat, with two bulging cheeks trying to swallow up the horse's tail. Maximus' cheeks poofed out slightly and his neck formed accordion rolls whenever the horse turned his head in any direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Tristan,\" the shopkeeper said, \"Please help yourselves to any of the pastries you wish, I was going to throw them out anyway, seeing as it nearly evening and they will be stale soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn waved a hand at the offer of free pastries and insisted that he pay the shopkeeper in full for the confections. He was the prince after all, and a small pile of coins spilling onto the counter was a perfect way to cement Tristan's unyielding friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright buddy,\" Flynn said, \"Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus almost inhaled the pastries in his hunger-driven stupor. The stallion desperately chowed down on the pastries, not giving heed to what kind or size they were. At this point, he could have eaten hardtack and hay. Though he strongly preferred the pastries to those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large stand contained 8 rows of pastries that were loosely separated by wooden partitions. Each row contained approximately 6 types of pastry, and there were about 20 of each pastry in the partitions. Though the display wasn't entirely full of pastries, due to the business that had been conducted throughout the day; The stand was still more than 3/4s full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus devoured the pastries in a roughly periodic order. He spent a minute or two on the first partition before moving onto the next. As he reached the end of the first row, his stomach began signaling that it was full. Maximus barely noticed the warning and forged onwards. Flynn and Tristan could only appreciate the voracity with which Maximus ate. Halfway through the second row, Maximus's stomach began to feel tight. The horse glanced back and was surprised to see his sides bulging outward once more. His stomach was smooth and slightly stretched, but Maximus knew that the bulbous organ still held more room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus kept at it for another fifteen minutes, before finally petering out at the end of the third row. His stomach now groaned in protest, the barrel like appendage stretched tightly, and it's monumental weight forcing Maximus' spine to dip down slightly. Maximus' sides were almost spherical and wobbled with each labored pant. The horse knew he had overeaten, but the fullness felt incredible. His stomach swaying in an almost hypnotic manner, the horse lowly laid down on his forelocks before his back legs collapsed and the stallion thumped onto his side, Pushing his unrestricted side out further and causing his butt to pool out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus took a little time to recover his breath, and orient his surroundings before finally making eye contact with Flynn and Tristan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan simply smiled and said \"Well I'm glad someone enjoys my pastries.\" Flynn shook his head, gazing bemusedly at the horse's bloated middle expand and contract rapidly. \"I think he's good for now, and I think you have a future customer on your hands.\" Tristan nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should probably get going before..\" <i>CRASH</i> A loud smash accompanied forced opening of the wooden entrance to the shop. Four vague, dark figures poured into the store and quickly ran towards Flynn and Maximus. One bolted the door behind them, while the other three quickly immobilized the prince, shopkeeper, and horse, though Maximus was already pretty sluggish from his bulging belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three need to keep quiet, you hear?\" The figure at the door commanded. When the captives nodded in fearful assent, the dark figure walked across the room and told the other three to bind the captives. Tristan was tied his chair behind the counter, while Flynn was marched over to a bench and roped to his seat. Maximus, being in the bloated state he was in, was too heavy to move, so the three henchmen hogtied his legs together and left him laying on his well cushioned stomach and rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen next? Maximus wondered. He feared what was to come, but saw no other way out of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maximus could only gape at the dark figures with a fish-eyed expression as one of the men trussed his legs. Due to the impediment of his rounded belly, the figure was unable to tie all four legs together and had to settle for tying Maximus' legs in pairs. Front and back legs were bound together. As the hooded figure worked the rope he muttered to himself \"Damn, this horse's gut ain't makin' it easy.\" After a couple more moments of muffled cursing, the captor finally secured the ropes and gave the horse's belly a sinister slap as he laughed, \"Man you're a big 'un.\" Maximus' belly wobbled in tight undulations from the force of the slap, and the sudden movement elicited a groan from the horse, as his bulging belly creaked from the unwelcome disturbance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you guys?\" Flynn asked nervously, struggling against his bonds, but it was no use as they were expertly tied. \"Do y-you know who I am, do you know who that horse is?\" The prince stuttered in a futile attempt of indignation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captor who'd bolted the door and ordered the other three to tie the victims smiled menacingly and said \"Course we know who you are. Prince and the horse who saved the princess.\" He cast a quick glance at the bloated horse and smiled even wider, \"Er, the cow that saved the kingdom.\" The captor lifted his hood to reveal a younger, scarred face of a man who had spent their entire life in the streets. A crooked nose and small scar on his cheekbone testified to this fact along with the captor's slightly rough manner of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for who we are,\" The man spread his arms, \"We are simply street folk or hired muscle for whomever feels the need to employ us.\" He gestured around the shop, \"Each of us come from a similar background of poverty, destitute privilege, and an every-man-for-himself nature. We had to learn our trade quickly or die, similar..\" He pointed to Flynn, \"To yours if I imagine.\" This was true, given the fact that Flynn had been a professional thief and infamous criminal before his ascension to the princess' side. \"But I digress,\" the leader continued. \"For all intents and purposes, you will address me as Fen. No one else needs to be named,\" the scarred man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus had been watching the leader, Fen's, little spiel and realized that he had been growing increasingly nervous by the similarities born between Flynn and the thug. In his nervous state, the stallion had been holding his breath for quite a time and quickly snorted in again. The sudden impediment of air caused the horse's taught stomach to expand dramatically and creak alarmingly from the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement got Fen's attention, and the captor smiled unnervingly. \"Our employer seems to have a certain grudge toward this one, and wants a little heart-to-heart with the legendary Maximus.\" Fen stated the last part with exaggerated sarcasm, as he observed the horse's voluminous belly and fattened hindquarters smushed against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait until they arrive, before we conduct more business, but I'm sure the shopkeeper won't mind losing a little profit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan had been glowering at the captor from his chair, straining against his bonds in hopes of breaking free, but the effort made no impact on the strengthened rope. \"You boys better leave,\" the shopkeeper growled. \"Holding royal figures hostage is punishable by death,\" Tristan's threatening demeanor caught Fen off guard for a moment. before the thug let out a loose chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll be alright,\" the captor said, \"There are other high ranking figures in the kingdom who don't take kindly to the meddling of these two.\" The captor indicate toward the horse and prince. \"But in any case, we will be using your shop as a temporary base of operations, so be a nice old man and quiet down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan grit his teeth, but seeing no other option, he held his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all that's left to do is wait,\" Fen said, and with that conclusion, he went over to a table, sat down, and lowered his cowl over his eyes. The other three bandits quietly exchanged words over who held first watch, and then they each took their position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus watched the captors disperse through the shop over the horizon line of his belly, before laying a round cheek on the floor and drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<i>Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.</i> There was a heavy thudding on the door, and the captor on watch blearily went over, peered through the peep hole and then quickly opened the door. He politely, but hurriedly gestured for the newcomer to enter before shutting it behind them. A hastily scrawled 'Sorry Closed for the Day' was propped on the other side of the door to dissuade any unwanted intruders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus was quickly jolted by the thudding on the door and lifted his head with a start before realizing something was different about himself. At first he wasn't quite sure, and then it hit him, or rather buried him. He felt much heavier. His cheeks and neck sported a soft layer of lard on them that jiggled with each small movement. His legs, though asleep from being trussed for so long, also had a layer of padding that creased against the ropes that bound him. His belly was, thankfully, not anywhere near as tight as it had been the night before, but was several inches wider and bulged against his legs, pushing between is front and back legs and forming luscious love handles where it met the floor. The horse could only guess what his rear end looked like, but it had a poofy layer of padding that dipped one cheek onto the other from its on weight. Almost smothering his tail which seemed to be the only thing that had escaped from the dispersal of fat. Maximus was astonished by the rate at which he'd expanded, but almost felt a sense of delight in the feeling of plush softness and incredible weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn and Tristan were also awoken by the sudden knocking, but they were quickly silenced by two of the bandits. They looked at each other nervously, but decided not to attempt anything for fear of causing unintentional consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lay transfixed on his bulbous body, he completely forgot about the newcomer until he felt a strong pressure applied to his middle. A charcoal black forelock attached to a large hoof smushed into Maximus' belly, causing it to bulge outwards around the indentation. As Maximus looked up, he saw White Lightening standing over him. A smug look adorned the obsidian stallion's muzzle as he removed his hoof from Maximus' belly, initiating a series of rocking and waving ripples to spread out through the horse's fat-swamped stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see,\" Fen said, \"There are others who do not take kindly to your heroics.\" White Lightening glanced at the thug and nodded appreciatively. Snorting in approval, the horse looked back down at Maximus, with a malicious, but almost infatuated glint in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look sent a shiver through Maximus' obese body, and the horse began to sweat nervously from the possible indications of that unnatural expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Fen said, breaking White Lightening out of his reverie. \"When will your partner be here?\" White Lightening gesture at the door, and then pawed at the floor once. \"One hour?\" Fen inquired, wanting to be completely sure that this was what the black stallion meant. White Lightening nodded in affirmation, before turning his attention back to Maximus. Intrigued, the stallion looked at Maximus, and then back at the pastry display. Noting the destructive state the first three rows, White Lightening realized that the other five were almost completely full. A sinister grin slowly split the charcoal horse's muzzle as he looked between the pastries and Maximus. Realizing White Lightening's intent, Maximus jerked in surprise, but also felt a slight desire as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmmm. Maximus thought, perhaps this might be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>White Lightening's intentions were crystal clear to the bound horse, and Maximus faced them with a swirl of apprehension and intrigue. He was nervous from White Lightening's almost feral display of passion dancing in the dark horse's eyes, and yet, his heart (and stomach) seemed to yearn for more. The combination produced an exhilarating effect that sent Maximus' mind reeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn must have sensed a hint of what White Lightening intended, because he called out to the stallion, \"Whoa there buddy, what do you have in mind?\" White Lightening flickered his eyes to the bound prince, and allowed the insidious grin to explain his wishes. With a snort, White Lightening turned back to the ample Maximus, with an almost unearthly focus. When Flynn attempted to intervene again, Fen stepped forward and raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anymore words to distract the boss, and you'll be whistling through your teeth.\" The threat lingered in the air, as Flynn struggled between his protective nature over his equine friend, and the possibility of losing his teeth. Then his gaze landed on Maximus, whose visage bore elements of passion and an almost challenging attitude directed at the opposing horse. Flynn sighed, and dropped his head in defeat. There was nothing he could do, and anything he tried now would only result in harm inflicted upon his person or that of his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan simply sat still, and went quiet as he saw the same futility in the situation as Flynn, though he still kept his mind open and alert in case of any possible chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pair had gone quiet, Fen nodded toward White Lightening and the stygian horse snorted with the contentment that he could continue undisturbed. He bent forward and pressed his muzzle into the Maximus' gargantuan belly to gauge the emptiness and to revel in the soft, hypnotic sensation of the horse's flab. White Lightening then took an Apple Crescent from the fourth row of the first partition and proffered it to the stranded horse. The almost dainty manner in which White Lightening did so was both disarming and encouraging for Maximus. 'How bad could this be?' the white stallion thought to himself as he eagerly tongued the crescent into his eagerly awaiting mouth and bit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tartness of the pastry triggered Maximus' almost uncontrollable love for apples. A mixture of fruit, flaky bread, and crisp sugar made that love turn to lust as the bloated stallion found himself wanting more with each second. White Lightening observed the stallion's eagerness and decided to forge on with a little more encouragement and pace. He grabbed another two pastries in his mouth and quickly proffered them to the bloated stallion. They disappeared as quickly as the first. White Lightening kept up the process until all twenty of the Apple Crescents were gone from the little wooden partition. Maximus' belly looked just as wobbly as before, though his face was caked in pastry debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening looked at the other 29 partitions, and realized that at this rate he would never be able to feed the stallion before his partner arrived. The observant stallion then realized that each wooden box was actually an individual crate/tray for the pastries. They would need to be removed for periodic cleaning and refills.Taking this into consideration, White Lightening snorted at Fen and made a small swooping gesture for him to come over. When Fen approached the black stallion, White Lightening gestured to the crate next to the Apple Crescents. a box of frosted eclairs, and motioned for it to be removed from the display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFen decided to not ask questions and obediently pulled the box from the shelf and placed on the ground next to Maximus' head. White Lightening nodded in appreciation and then motioned to Maximus to enjoy. The hungry equine didn't need to be told twice, and lifted his head to begin eating. White Lightening aided the bulging horse by shuffling the further eclairs closer towards the side of the box closest to Maximus' muzzle. Between each assist, White Lightening would nuzzle the stallion's abundant fat and gently nip at his love handles. The stallion's belly squished against the floor to form a defining bulge that outlined Maximus' expanding stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second box was gone in under 2 minutes, and while the presence of the pastries made a slight difference in Maximus' well-rounded size, it was minuscule to both him and White Lightening's eye. The raven-hued stallion realized that the placement of each partition in front of Maximus would only slow the process, so he motioned to Fen to grab another partition, but this time, White Lightening had him place the remaining four boxes on the floor, so that he could continue the process with less interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing White Lightening's idea, Maximus shivered once more. This time is was more out of joyous anticipation rather than anxiety. The movement resulted in the sloshing of his belly and the soft collision of his two, generously padded butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs each partition was set in front of him, Maximus found himself begin to get lost once again in a food-driven reverie reminiscent of the one he'd experienced the night before. With each pastry the horse downed, his yearning grew stronger; and with each partition, his stomach stretched a little more. His stomach swelled noticeably by the end of the final partition that had been placed on the ground. Though this time, Maximus' stomach didn't signal fullness, but was merely content. Upon seeing this, White Lightening gently applied pressure once more to Maximus' middle, and felt a springy, but yielding surface. The already present abundance of fat was steadily stretching over Maximus' belly, creating a cushion of soft, resistant layer similar to a mattress over a bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing harder, the obsidian equine was able to gauge the stallion's fullness and knew that there was still plenty of room left. The horse signaled for Fen to lower the next row of pastries, and once all six were placed on the ground, White Lightening began the cycle once again. Though this time he often left a lightly placed hoof on the stallion's growing belly to feel it expand. As Maximus dutifully marched his way through the second round of euphoria, White Lightening's hoof slowly went from sinking into a plush layer of fat to gently wobbling on the equine's belly before finishing at a sturdy, but still well-indented placement on the equine's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Maximus' stomach was beginning to spark with small pangs of fullness. The quivering, bulging mass slowly contracted in and out with Maximus' labored pants. The vision was hypnotic, and White Lightening found himself transfixed at the rounded sight before remembering that he still had three rows to go. White Lightening raised his head to signal Fen, but the observant henchman was already removing the next row of pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening moved on to the next bout of pastries, stimulated by Maximus' impressive growth. The horse himself was slightly dazed from the elated sense of feeling his stomach stretch once more. Being rounded out and filled with the pastries was a satisfying and pleasurable endeavor for the stranded horse. Maximus slowly lifted his head to feast on the next row of confections, and once again he felt the almost familiar pressure of White Lightening's hoof on the middle of his gelatinous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree partitions into the row of pastries, Maximus began to feel an odd discomfort at the front and back of his belly. As he ventured into the fourth box, the discomfort grew into a nuisance and then it became downright painful. A biting, pinching feeling pulsed from two ends of his belly and Maximus stopped eating to take a moment and inspect the source. He then realized that his belly, with the abundance of food being crammed into it, had slowly pushed against his front and back legs. A V-shaped triangle of pudge bulged from the natural opening in his legs and tapered off where they were bound by the ropes. The pinching feeling came from Maximus' stomach being forced into the crevice created by his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening who also sensed that something was amiss, as he felt Maximus break the pattern of eating and disrupted the expansion of his belly. Seeing the problem, the black stallion opted to simply have one of his henchmen cut the bonds. Given Maximus' current state, White Lightening was certain that Maximus was more likely to beach himself before he proved a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bonds were slipped, Maximus' belly surged forward and expanded a couple of inches from the restrained pressure. Freeing his sore, plus legs from the ropes provided Maximus with a nice degree of relief. The horse then shifted into a more comfortable position, causing his belly to splay itself on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewed vigor, Maximus polished off the rest of the row of pastries in quick fashion before looking to White Lightening almost expectedly. Nodding, White Lightening had Fen place the next row of pastries before the bloated horse. Four more partitions disappeared before Maximus' stomach elicited a protesting gurgle to signify that it was overfull. Maximus noted this, but forged on; almost eager to see how far he could get. By the end of the row, Maximus' belly was taught, with a strained layer of fat covering it. There was a slight feeling of resistance, but that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving onto the final row, Maximus chowed down, but with less vigor. White Lightening stood fascinated as the horse sluggishly plowed through the remaining pastries. His stomach stretching alarmingly. By the final partition, Maximus' belly was drum tight, and had no resistance at all. The equine's bulging gut groaned and creaked from the pressure, and pushed against Maximus' legs. Laying on his side, the belly rose a good two feet above him and hung level with his knees. Maximus was hit hard with the fullness and drifted to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he heard was a knock at the door. Who was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the stuffed-to-the-brim Maximus drifted off into a food coma, Fen quickly walked over to the shop's entrance and let in the unknown guest. Flynn heard the knock too, and lifted his head slowly to see who was at the door. At first the figure was silhouetted against the early-morning light pouring into the shop, but once Fen closed the door, Flynn saw that it was the Captain of the Guard. The prince couldn't help expressing his surprise at seeing such an authoritative figure strolling into the scene. The Captain as a tall, lithe man with a dark, angular mustache and piercing green eyes. 'To think that this was the man that had hunted Flynn for so long, only to turn out to be an enemy of the kingdom instead.' Flynn could appreciate the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the Captain said, with an mischievous smirk, \"Looks like White Lightening here was a little eager to wait for me.\" He glanced over at the dark stallion who was still resting a gentle hoof on Maximus' taught, bulging side. He seemed transfixed by the sheer size and volume of Maximus' belly, noting the stretched tender skin poking out beneath the thin fur of the stranded horse's bloated belly. With each breath Maximus' stomach groaned quietly from the enormous pressure in his gut and occasionally shivered in discomfort from the fullness, but otherwise Maximus was entirely out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"White Lightening,\" the Captain addressed the horse in a firm, direct manner to get the horse's attention. \"Has everything gone according to plan?\" The ebony horse nodded in affirmation, and gently lifted his hoof off Maximus' quivering mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand!\" Flynn cut in, unable to contain himself any longer. \"Why would you, one of the integral parts of the kingdom's security, side with a horse whose blatantly endangering others?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain turned toward the prince, and sighed. He realized that Flynn deserved some explanation, especially after the fact that his wife had almost been killed in one of their \"incidents.\" The man sat down at one of the booths across from Flynn, and rested his hands in front of him, like a parent confronting their child with an ugly truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple actually,\" the Captain said. \"Maximus is..well....a very special horse. I think we can all attest to that fact.\" Flynn nodded, and was surprised to see the captors and even White Lightening nodding in agreement. \"After all,\" he continued, \"Maximus was an elite member of the kingdom who risked his life and reputation to aid you in the rescuing of the princess.\" Flynn understood the notion and kept silent for the Captain to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after he aided in her rescue, Maximus rose to an entirely different plane of heroism.\" The Captain gestured to Flynn, \"And you were elevated right along side him. You were both legends by the time you married Rapunzel, with a reputation that spread throughout the kingdom.\" The Captain had a far away look in his eyes, Flynn knew that the Captain had entered the realm of memory, and decided to let the Captain continue undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I was exceptionally proud of my steed. He was an incredible horse with an incredible gift for justice. When the King promoted him to Commander, I could barely contain myself with the pride and joy I felt for him. Maximus proved to be a natural leader and commander too; devising training programs, fitness regiments, strategic practices, placing the Kingdom's well-being far before his own. He was more than my horse by this point, he was a figure of authority and strength for everyone. The soldiers idolized him, and Maximus continued to expand his influence over the Kingdom with exceptional results. But that wasn't the only thing that expanded. I'm sure you recall Maximus' ..er....acquisition of considerable weight over the last few months. Well as Maximus increased his role in the Kingdom's safety, his fitness levels plummeted.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At first Maximus was only slightly overweight. I worked with him quite often, so I was aware of the changes; yet they weren't bothersome to anyone, so I kept quite. After a couple of months though, Maximus truly started to stand apart from the other horses. His harness began straining against his belly, his rear jiggled more and more, his face developed additional adipose. Maximus steadily increased his waistline, and it eventually became impossible for me or anyone else to ignore. Recruits and seasoned soldiers alike began to mock him, smiling whenever Maximus entered or left a room, laughing as his belly swayed from the slightest movement. Rather than take his instructions seriously, they would imitate his mannerisms behind his back. This resulted in a noticeable drop of discipline of the troops...and it was then that I realized something must be done.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So one night, after Maximus left a briefing, almost being lodged in the door from his bulging sides, I quietly slipped out of the kingdom and went back to my home village. I'll admit that from the start, I was looking for another horse to replace Maximus. Establishing a man in his post would be impossible, seeing as a non-sentient creature can garner much more respect from their efforts than an ordinary man. I made my way back to my home, and perused the farms around the village to see if another could fulfill the task. This was when I came across White Lightening. Everything about him was perfect, where Maximus had a bulbous, low-hanging belly, White Lightening possessed a trim, toned figure. Rather than a large, swaying backside, White Lightening was perfectly fit. White Lightening could run a hundred yards without being winded and sloshing around like a water balloon. And then there was his trademark bolt on his flank. The perfect symbol to become an emblem of a new hero in the kingdom.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So we planned out a series of meticulously orchestrated accidents, where Maximus would happen to be at the time, but White Lightening would be just around the corner to one-up him. It was a double edged plan, impressing the citizens with a new hero while simultaneously deflating a certain obese equine's ego further and further. Of course we had help from a couple of friends,\" the Captain nodded to the captors standing patiently around the shop, \"their knowledge of the city and planning the accidents was instrumental in the ploy. But,\" The Captain suddenly reached forward, and laid a fatherly hand on Flynn's. \"We only meant to discredit Maximus, no one else.\" Flynn grimaced at the sentiment, and was begrudgingly ready to accept that there was some logic to the Captain's motives when he remembered one integral thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost killed my wife, the princess of the kingdom. One of the very members you were sworn to protect.\" Flynn growled angrily. \"He may have let himself go,\" Flynn motioned at the bloated horse, \"But Maximus would never put an innocent in harm's way simply because it might elevate another figure.\" The Captain was taken aback by Flynn's vehemence, before a sad, but sinister smile crept across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had hoped you would see the reasoning behind my cause,\" he said, slowly shaking his head. \"That this,\" the Caption slapped Maximus's stuffed belly, eliciting a startled whinny from the dozing horse who woke with a jolt. \"Is more dangerous to the kingdom than losing a couple of citizens in a campaign for a new hero.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus stared at his old friend and mentor with a wide eyes that held a fearful and confused gaze. Not quite comprehending the caliber of the situation, Maximus glanced around the room. Going from the Captain to Flynn then to White Lightening, and back to the Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now,\" the Captain sighed shaking his head, \"we are at a crossroads. We can't have a powerful figure such as yourself going back to the King with word of my efforts, so I suppose there's nothing I can really do, but kill you and the shop keeper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain gestured at the captors to move onto the bound Flynn and Tristan, two of them withdrew daggers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus whinnied with fear and desperation. He glanced pleadingly at White Lightening, seeming to exchange a frenetic conversation with the obsidian horse. White Lightening was also extremely concerned, he had been recruited to feign accidents and become a hero. Not stand idly by while two innocent people were executed in cold <br>\r\nblood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening frantically glanced around the room before jumping making a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>White Lightening stood rigidly, as he ran different scenarios through his head before realizing that he couldn\u2019t let the Captain kill the two captives. His sense of justice, and a quick glance at Maximus\u2019 straining belly cemented his decision to protect the bound victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinalizing the decision, White Lightening leapt into action. Taking into account the obsidian horse\u2019s speed, agility, desperation, element of surprise, and the fact that he had spent months of training to \u201csave\u201d others, White Lightening was able to get a good edge in the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn and Tristan, both possessing the same enhanced perception of their surroundings due to their fear of being killed, read the horse\u2019s intentions like a book. As the horse readied themselves, the prince and shopkeeper did so in turn. Both men tensed their legs, hunched forward slightly, and as White Lightening leapt toward the Captain, they took advantage of their captor hovering knives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn beautiful, synchronous motions, White Lightening butted the Captain hard enough to plow straight into an unsuspecting Fen. Both men dropped like sacks of potatoes. Collapsing to the ground with winded expressions. Flynn and Tristan simultaneously propelled their bodies and heads backwards and up. Smashing their heads into the base of their captors\u2019 chins, snapping the captors\u2019 necks backwards and knocking them out cold. As each captor lost consciousness, their grip on the knives slipped. Tristan and Flynn grabbed them, slit their hand ties, and then leaned forward to do the same to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening meanwhile, dealt with the Captain and Fen. Both quickly recovered from the sudden blow, and grappled over each other to stand. White Lightening managed to bring a cloven hoof down on Fen\u2019s head, knocking him out for good. The Captain struggled to stand unsteadily, still wheezing but recovered. He brandished his own dagger, grimacing at the horse with a light of betrayal flashing in his eyes. White Lightening pawed the ground nervously, prancing from hoof to hoof to keep the Captain guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the stygian stallion, the third captor was quietly approaching the horse from behind. As he crept up behind the lightening-marked horse with a drawn and raised dagger, the Captain\u2019s gaze flickered slightly from the horse to the approaching captor. Sensing danger, White Lightening turned in time to hear a loud FWOMP and a large white blur, before the captor was sent flying across the shop and sent tumbling over a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus stood, stooped over, his belly rocking and wobbling from the sudden impact. Every inch of the equine\u2019s body quivered from the effort, from the horse\u2019s flabby, creased neck to his bulging, swaying belly back to his two bulbous butt cheeks smushing together. The horse\u2019s spine formed a concave ark as it dipped under the incredible weight of the lard-laden sack jiggling underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse had to adopt a wider stance as his belly bulged against his legs and demanded more room to occupy. The quick movements had rendered the horse breathless and shaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain was almost speechless from the horse\u2019s rapid movements, and the momentary lapse in belief was all White Lightening needed to place a well-aimed kick between the Captain\u2019s green eyes. The Captain crumpled to the floor, and White Lightening whinnied in satisfaction that the attackers were indisposed. The black horse trotted forward and gently nuzzled the Maximus\u2019 belly to snap the bloated equine out of his adrenaline-fueled state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his fat face to White Lightening, Maximus\u2019 neck formed abundant accordion love handles as he nodded in recognition and appreciation for the other horse\u2019s actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn and Tristan had both managed to free themselves from their bonds, and watched the entire ordeal with unbridled fascination. Seeing such a large, heavy figure move with unearthly speed was impressive enough. But when said figure plowed into a captor with a wrecking ball for a gut, they might as well have been dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan was the first to overcome his shock. The shopkeeper took command, and instructed Flynn to help him tie up the criminals before they awakened. \u201cHow do you know how to do all this,\u201d Flynn blurted out, as the thought became a vocal entity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan grinned slyly, \u201cJust because I\u2019m a shopkeeper, doesn\u2019t mean I was always one,\u201d the greying man explained, \u201cI used to be a soldier, and a damn good one at that. I\u2019ll explain later, but for now we need to truss these fellows and get the hell out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Flynn said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to fetch some guards?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Captain might have allies under his thumb, and I have a bad feeling that Fen has some friends who are paid to back him up in these areas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Flynn expertly tied the men up, while White Lightening consoled the shell-shocked Maximus. \u201cAnd thank you White Lightening,\u201d Flynn said to the horse. \u201cYou saved our lives, and took the right path. Would you consider coming with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening considered the offer, then looked at the bound men, before resting his eyes on Maximus\u2019 bulging middle. The stallion\u2019s rounded sides rhythmically swelled with each breath, wobbling slightly from the movement. Maximus nodded to White Lightening, affirming his support for the offer as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening turned to the prince and nodded. The four individuals quickly left the shop, though Maximus was slightly wedged in the doorway, and needed help to squish his heft all the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they traveled down the cobbled street, towards what? To receive help from whom?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The odd group moved as quickly as they could through the Kingdom\u2019s streets. Taking advantage of the early morning hour, the sun was only cresting the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan explained to the others that he still knew some old friends from before his days as a soldier, and opted to seek one of them out in order to regroup and get help. They moved at a slower than normal pace due to the incredible amount of weight wobbling beneath Maximus\u2019 back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white stallion was forced to adopt a slightly widened stance, as his bulging sides and flanks blipped out against his legs. The horse\u2019s belly was a sight in itself, as it hung low and heavy; almost even with Maximus knees which kept brushing and indenting the soft flesh with each step he took. All the food he had consumed had finally begun to be digested, and the horse\u2019s stomach went from a drum-taught sphere to a softer, yielding ellipse that jumped like a salmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening walked behind Maximus to ensure that there was no one following them and be of quick assistance to the obese equine. Although his view of the horse\u2019s jiggling posterior was an added bonus. Each bulbous cheek was the size of a melon, and often created a flabby crevice for the unfortunate tail entrenched between them. Their rounded appearance was nicely complemented by Maximus\u2019 belly which bulged well out to each side of him. Occasionally it unintentionally brushed a stray store display or wall, and was momentarily smushed against the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus seemed to become increasingly use to the weight as they navigated their way beyond the Kingdom\u2019s borders and into the surrounding farmland. The sun was high above them by the time the group reached the countryside and they decided to take a well-deserved break in a small clearing hidden from the view of the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they came to a stop, Maximus gratefully sank forward on his forelocks, before trying to collapse his back legs. When he did so, something felt slightly off. As he looked down, he realized his gargantuan belly was so large, that it pressed into the soft grass and actually raised the horse slightly off the ground. Love handles suddenly appeared and creased as Maximus\u2019 belly pooled out across the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn and Tristan found the event slightly comedic, while White Lightening was transfixed on the horse\u2019s precarious position atop his monolithic stomach. Eventually, Maximus opted to lay down to one side, and allowed for his belly to rise formidably above his head. Forming a small mound of soft, supple horse flesh. Once he was comfortable, Tristan cleared his throat and began to explain the friend he had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is a trustworthy man of notable disposition and has saved my life countless times.\u201d Tristan testified the man\u2019s reputation with such voracity that the others had almost no trouble believing it to be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Flynn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarren,\u201d Tristan answered, \u201cHe was a my training partner in the army, before we became soldiers. He was always the level-headed one who tried to rationalize a situation before taking action. Often stopped me from getting my arse kicked when I took offense to a slur or challenge. We had strengths that complemented each other and made us a great pair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you guys quit?\u201d Flynn inquired curiously. The horses were also focused on Tristan with singular intent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tristan chuckled, \u201cWe both began to grow weary of the risks taken by soldiers. When you have an inseparable friend at you side, and are constantly thrown into life-threatening situations, you always begin to look for a way out.\u201d Tristan sighed and leaned back. \u201cThe final straw was when that lovely girl, Rapunzel, was taken. The insipid wench that kidnapped her was old, but cunning and devious. When she slipped into the castle, she didn\u2019t go unopposed. Warren spotted her and tried to intervene, but the old witch possessed a dagger/ She sliced it across Warren\u2019s face and took his left eye. She would have finished the job if I hadn\u2019t spotted her and called out. I was the one who sounded the alarm the night the princess disappeared.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So I suppose you\u201d he gestured towards Flynn, \u201cCan see why I have quite a bit of respect for you two. Dispelling the old cur was a moment of closure for my friend and I. And as for why we left? Well, Warren was simply unable to perform his duties any longer, and I wasn\u2019t letting him go anywhere without me. He moved to a farm in the country, secluded from others while I stayed back to pursue a career in confections.\u201d He chuckled as he glanced over at Maximus\u2019 enormous belly, which swelled and retracted steadily with each breath, sweeping away blades of grass as the soft flesh slid over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a certain irony when what perhaps would have been my greatest customer, brought with him an incredible vice of criminals.\u201d Maximus adopted an apologetic expression on his cushioned face, but only managed to look like an adorably plush stuffed animal one might see in a children\u2019s toy chest. Tristan laughed out loud now, and waved away the horse\u2019s attempt at an apology. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you could\u2019t have known. Besides, a little turmoil always keeps one\u2019s mind and body fresh. I enjoyed the change of pace.\u201d He said. Tristan  stood up and brushed stray grass from his pants. \u201cSo now, I suppose we continue on to my good friend\u2019s farm and develop the next part of our plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others followed Tristan\u2019s example, but Maximus had quite a bit of trouble. His big, blubbery belly was a formidable obstacle that seemed quite content with staying at rest on the grass. Maximus strained to push himself up, but only managed to push himself further into his own belly. His efforts caused his gut to fold over on itself, and jiggled like jelly. Suddenly the huge stallion felt a large push from under his back, and realized that White Lightening had nosed himself under Maximus and was using his strength to aid the white stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus tried again and felt himself begin to lift, while White Lightening helped him. The obsidian stallion\u2019s muzzle was buried in a large expanse of supple horse flesh. The belly almost engulfed his entire face, and caused the surrounding adipose to bulge outwards from the displacement. White Lightening pressed harder, burying his chest and forelegs into Maximus' plush belly to gain more traction. It felt like trying to move a sack of pudding. Maximus struggled to keep his feet under him, but had a hard time with his bulbous stomach obscuring them from view. The process was precarious, but the two horses eventually made progress against the imposing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus finally came onto all for legs once again, his belly rocking from the change in stance. His entire body wobbled like jello, and his swaying stomach almost threw him off balance as it formed a counterweight to the rest of Maximus body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was stable, Tristan lead the group back to the road and they continued their trek down the pathway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow far is it?\u201d Flynn inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout a day\u2019s walk at our pace,\u201d Tristan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the retired soldier, the prince, the heroic black stallion, and the bulbous, bulging equine made their way down the road into an uncertain future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that future was?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flynn and Tristan traveled slightly out in front of the horses to anticipate any unexpected travelers who might recognize the faces of the prince, White Lightening, and Maximus. Though the latter was probably safe due to his large, wobbling stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening walked a couple of yards behind Maximus to ensure that no one tried to sneak up on the group from behind. The placement afforded White Lightening with the increasingly familiar sight of Maximus' bulging sides framing his wide-spread butt. Both of which wobbled with each step the burdened stallion took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they reached the farm of Tristan's friend, Warren. As they drew closer, Maximus began to truly feel weighed down. He'd been forced to walk with a slightly widened gait, due to the imposing presence of his belly. His low hanging gut continuously swayed from side to side and forced Maximus to concentrate on keeping his balance. Hours of doing just this had reduced the poor equine to a gasping, heaving wreck. By the time they were making their way down the final pathway to Warren's farm, Maximus was stumbling from slight deliriousness and fatigue. More than anything, the obese equine desired water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAd they finally spotted the farmhouse, Maximus' eyes were only focused on the sight of a water filled barrel propped against the side of it. He trotted as fast as his lard-laden legs could carry him, stuck his head in the barrel, and began sucking down water. While Maximus occupied himself with quenching his thirst, Tristan greeted his old friend who was making his way towards them from his quaint cottage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello old friend,\" Tristan greeted the man, before embracing him with a big bear hug and a hearty slap on the back. \"It's been quite a while.\" Tristan released his grip and the two turned towards the others as Tristan made to introduce his life long friend to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren was a sturdy, well-built man who stood a couple inches shorter than Tristan and Flynn. He had close-cropped brown hair, a slightly crooked nose, and his right eye shone with unabashed humor. Flynn couldn't help but have his gaze drawn to the man's left eye, which was scarred vertically from the middle of his cheek to the top of his forehead. The eyelid was slightly ridged in the middle, and covered an empty socket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go one then my good man! Don't be shy.\" Warren boomed in a deep, throaty voice. \"I prefer people to look me directly in the eye rather than try to be all polite and pretend to avoid it.\" Flynn was momentarily shocked by his directness, but quickly recovered and walked forward to shake the man's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Flynn Rider,\" the prince said simply, \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren smiled and said, \"Yes I've heard all about you! You saved the princess and became a national hero. I applaud you for your services to the kingdom.\" Flynn nodded in thanks for the complement and returned the recognition by saying, \"And Tristan has told me all about your days as a loyal soldier and guard for the royal family. I admire your loyalty and brevity.\" Warren chuckled and slapped the prince on the back. \"Thank you son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan then introduced White Lightening, who Warren only seemed to judge for his intentions above anything else. Despite the stygian horse's initial efforts to dethrone Maximus, White Lightening had proven himself to be a trustworthy ally. The two exchanged nods of recognition and Warren moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there's Maximus...\" Tristan began, before trailing off when he realized where the horse was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maximus was brought to Warren's attention, the supple, barrel-shaped horse had finished nearly the entire barrel of water and proceeded to collapse joyously against the side of the barn in a refreshing patch of shade. The miles of walking Maximus had done were enough to burn off a couple of calories from his bloated stature and his stomach had initially shrunk slightly. But now it was bulging firmly once more, rocking and sloshing from the gallons of water it contained. Maximus lay in an undignified manner, with his belly bulging out and above him, his tongue lolled out, and creases of fat forming as his belly began to fold over itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water had expanded the horse's belly considerably, and now Warren walked over with a sly chuckle and said, \"This must be Maximus, the horse with a larger than life reputation and actually appears to truly be larger in life.\" He placed a hand on the horse's swollen abdomen, which groaned slightly from the touch. It's peak nearly level with Warren's chest, the horse neighed a weak greeting to the new face. He attempted to look up at the single-eyed soldier, but only succeeded in making his neck compress in a series of love handles and add further ripples to his water-balloon of a belly. It was all White Lightening could do not to press his muzzle into the soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus slowly drifted off to sleep once he knew that he had at least managed to be introduced to the new individual. Once he was out of it, Warren turned toward the others, \"Has a hardy appetite does he?\" Flynn, Tristan, and White Lightening nodded in assent. They had all witnessed the eating capabilities of the beached stallion, and were entirely convinced that Maximus could swallow a hay bale whole if he wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when he wakes up, he'll be in for a surprise.\" Warren chuckled inwardly. \"I have one of the largest apple farms in the area, and this one would certainly appreciate some fresh produce.\" He gestured to the gently rising and falling belly which swelled and gurgled with each breath the horse took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now, I suppose we should get serious,\" Warren said, \"I'm guessing you didn't come here with some of the Kingdom's most influential figures simply for a surprise visit.\" He directed the statement at Tristan, who grimaced and said, \"We have a little trouble with the Captain of the Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren invited them to come join him in his home for some fresh water and food so that they could get the story in full. While Flynn and Tristan went with him, White Lightening stayed behind. Being a non-sentient creature he wouldn't much use in explaining the details to Warren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio disappeared into the cottage, White Lightening took the time to fully appreciate Maximus's incredible size and girth. The dozing equine's neck was swaddled in rolls of fat that bunched up and provided Maximus with a couple of extra chins. The horse's upper leg was risen in the air and rested on Maximus's lopsided belly which took the form of a slightly miss-shappen half circle. The top half bulged proudly and dipped down on itself slightly from the weight of sloshing liquid inside it. The bottom half was pressed against the grass where it formed luscious love handles that rippled in any movement. His posterior featured two overblown cheeks quashed together from their own weight and bulged outwards on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening padded forward, and slowly laid down before resting his head against Maximus' supple midsection. It was the softest pillow White Lightening would ever encounter. His head waved slightly from the displacement he caused by squishing a part of the belly. Soon he fell into a blissful sleep of his own, because after all, heroic horses needed their rest too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two horses dozed, and the three men went over the recent events and began to plan, the afternoon light faded into darkness and night fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was to come the next day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Flynn, Tristan, and Warren resided in the cabin to go over a plan for taking the corrupt Captain of the Guard down from his position, White Lightening dozed against the huge, round belly of an unconscious Maximus. The two stayed this way for several hours, before Maximus finally began to stir. The estranged horse slowly woke up, and for the first time in three days was able to take the time to register his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArching his neck, Maximus noted how rolls of fat bunched along his neck and his cheeks poofed to either side of his face. He lifted his head further and drew in an impressed breath which caused his belly to swell slightly. All he could see was a bulbous white dome bulging proudly and protruding almost three feet out. The massive organ sloshed gently from the little water it still contained, and with this movement, Maximus noticed a soft pressure on the lower half of his belly. He couldn't quite identify it, until it began shifting and the obsidian head of White Lightening peeked curiously over its equator. Snorting in greeting, the black stallion rose to his feet and padded over to Maximus' front to give him a better position for communicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the stygian stallion, Maximus nickered softly to express his thanks for White Lightening's help in their daring escape. The heroic horse snorted in return, before gesturing vehemently behind him to the rows of apple trees in the orchard beyond. White Lightening's intent was obvious, as Maximus craned his head to full extent and realized that his absolute favorite fruit resided with the rows of trees. His mouth began watering at the prospect of consuming more of them, and why not? Maximus reasoned that if he was already such an incredibly large size, then consumption of something so healthy as an apple would surely be beneficial to the bloated equine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus nodded in agreement that he would love to go down to the orchard, and White Lightening quickly, almost eagerly, moved forward to help the white stallion to his feet.  The two of them opted for the same method they'd utilized earlier and White Lightening bent his neck to use his head as a wedge/lift for Maximus. Slowly, but surely Maximus rose with the aid of the barn, his stomach squished against its side wile White Lightening pushed from the other. The two opposing forces cause Maximus' belly to bulge extensively from the displacement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maximus finally got all four legs underneath him, he realized his mistake a split second too late. Having slept for several hours, the horse's pudgy legs had fallen asleep and were temporarily dead from the inactivity. Maximus attempted to lean back against the wall, but he was leaning too heavily on White Lightening and ended up collapsing sideways on the unfortunate equine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus' legs gave out, and his stomach slowly tilted to his left side before Maximus toppled, belly first, onto White Lightening. The heroic horse only had time to let out a startled whinny before his head and back were smushed by the monolithic belly. Luckily for White Lightening, Maximus' stomach was considerably cushioned from layers of fat and the left over water the horse had consumed. He felt as if a giant, jello-filled balloon was encasing his entire body in a soft fuzzy cocoon. The air was knocked out of White Lightening's lung as the majority of the obese horse's weight came to a jiggling halt on his shoulders and back. Maximus was effectively stranded, as his legs stuck out in four directions, and his stomach was pressed in by White Lightening's body. His belly bulged with random love handles that rippled with tremors and quivered where they met White Lightening's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping from the incident, both Maximus and White Lightening let loose anxious braying laughs as they began to see the humor in their situation. After eventually calming down, White Lightening indicated a rolling gesture with his head that meant he planned to lever Maximus off him by slowly rotating the horse off his back. Maximus nodded, and the black stallion slowly braced his legs before lifting himself slightly to provide a crude ramp. Maximus slowly rolled over, his belly sloshing madly from the constant changes in direction until the horse was unceremoniously dumped onto the ground where he rested on his bulging belly. White Lightening shook his head to cool himself, before going over and helping the fattened horse stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment they simply grinned at one another, before Maximus snorted and indicated toward the apple orchard intently. White Lightening nodded vigorously, and the two began to trek their way into the neat sentries of apple trees. A late afternoon sun cast deeply etched shadows into the pathways, which provided a welcomed relief from the blistering sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus was utterly captivated by the pervasion and size of the apples growing throughout the plantation. Luscious orbs in various hues of reds, greens, and yellows hung from the branches of sturdy trees that dipped under their weight in a similar fashion to Maximus' belly in proximity to his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTongue lolling out, Maximus continued for about a quarter mile before happening upon a basket of scarlet reds that seemed to have only recently been picked. Looking back at White Lightening, as if to seemingly ask for permission to indulge himself, he received a rigorous nod from the black stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maximus unorthodoxly consumed the basket of apples, White Lightening contented himself by nibbling on a couple of strays that had fallen from the nearby trees. He also cast periodic glances at the busy equine's bulbous posterior, which jiggled from the ferocity with which Maximus attacked the apples. Each cheek wobbled and gently slapped against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Maximus finished the basket and burped contentedly. He turned to White Lightening who raised his eyebrows questioningly, as if to say 'Is that all?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus snorted and looked up to the trees hungrily, salivating at the thought of more apples. Following his gaze, White Lightening suddenly had an idea. He athletically leapt into the air, and jarred one of the tree's branches. Several apples tumbled to the ground, which Maximus surged forward to eat, only to be stopped short by White Lightening who gestured for the obese equine to lie down. Taking heed of the request, Maximus laid down on one bulbous side, and curiously gazed at the the black stallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening then picked an apple up with his teeth and walked over to the bloated horse and proffered the apple to Maximus. The plan clicked in Maximus' head as he realized the stygian horse's intentions and thought back to the night before in the pastry shop. This time though, White Lightening took his time to feed each apple to the fattened stallion. Noting that with each bite Maximus took, his belly swelled a fraction of an inch more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a period of two hours, White Lightening fed Maximus close to a hundred of the apples. Combined with the thirty or so present in the basket, it wasn't long before Maximus' belly once again reached a creaking point of fullness. His taught tummy gurgle and protested from the incredible volume of food stuffed into it. Each movement from Maximus elicited a loud groan that testified the equine's exceptionally bloated capacity. White Lightening, satisfied with Maximus' appetite noted that the sun was finally setting, and casting fading slices of light overhead. He realized that Maximus wasn't going anywhere in his condition, and decided that this was as good as any place to spend the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing his legs, White Lightening made to rest his head against his friend's tight stomach, but was greeted with a hard, lumpy, and inconsistent surface. He realized the apples weren't entirely digested, so Maximus appeared to have consumed a large, uneven rock that stretched his gut to rigid proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, White Lightening contented himself by resting his head on the equine's supple neck, which contracted rhythmically with Maximus' breaths. Closing his eyes, White Lightening drifted into sleep and into the night where the unknown waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Maximus was awoken by the constant chirping of birds and a strange pressure on his neck. Yawning expansively, the obese horse slowly blinked the sleep out of his eyes in order to regain a better sense of his mental faculties. Noticing that the effort to awake himself via inhaling fresh air wasn't alleviating the pressure on his neck, Maximus finally turned his fattened head towards the source. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening lay with his head draped in the plush rolls of the stallion's neck and was blissfully unconscious. Maximus realized that the black equine must have been severely lacking in sleep from the events that had transpired over the course of the previous couple days. Attempting to shift his head back into a more suitable position, White Lightening rolled over and ended up with his face buried in the Maximus' flabby shoulder. Suddenly finding himself unable to breath due to the suffocating layer of fat that encircled his face, White Lightening bolted awake in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling deeply, the athletically built stallion quickly gathered his surroundings before laying eyes on a widely smiling Maximus. The horse let loosed a gentle bray that transcribed to the equine equivalent of a laugh. The sound was considerably deeper as it reverberated off the horse's cavernous belly. White Lightening snorted in turn and rolled his eyes before clambering to his feet to stretch. In doing so, he was also afforded a good view of just how large Maximus had truly grown over the last couple days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus' face was swaddled in adipose and currently puffed around and under his muzzle to form an extra set of chins. The equine's neck was riddled with rolls of fat that creased from the slightest movement. The most impressive aspect of Maximus' overblown stature was his belly, which had digested the majority of the apples into an addition several inches of plush fat. The horse's belly seemed to bulge in every direction and, with Maximus laying on his side, was almost level with White Lightening's own trim stomach standing up. The sheer weight of the colossal gut caused it to fold over slightly on itself and form large love handles where it compressed against Maximus' legs in addition to pooling on the ground. His belly possessed a layer of lard almost two feet deep, which was softer and more supple than any mattress one would ever be able to find. Maximus' gelatinous rump also sported to smaller, globular versions of his belly, which rippled from any movement and completely buried the unfortunate tail residing between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus was, for all intents and purposes, able to officially stomach another horse if he so desired. As White Lightening helped the bulbous stallion to his feet, Maximus' belly swayed like a water filled hammock and reached slightly past the equine's knees. The two slowly made their way back to Warren's cottage where the man himself sat with Flynn and Tristan who were laughing and talking over a hearty breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems that a certain horse has discovered my legendary apples,\" Warren boomed as he was the bulging stallion waddle their way at a slow pace. From his vantage point, Warren could see the equine's sides swollen well beyond his shoulders and wobbling from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good humored farmer laughed loudly at the sight, before saying, \"I'm glad someone enjoyed them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus' ears swiveled toward the sudden sound and a guilty grin slowly crept across his pudgy muzzle as he made his way over to them. Once they arrived, Maximus settled down on his belly and was pleased to discover that he was actually quite comfortable resting on it as if it were a jello-filled bean bag. Settling down, the horse unintentionally squished his stomach out to the sides, causing them to bulge further until it supported him. Smirking satisfactorily, Maximus looked over at White Lightening whose gaze lingered on the incredible sight before snapping out of it and looking back to the three grinning men. Both horses nodded for them to continue on, indicating their desire to hear the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Tristan began, taking the lead in describing the plan as he was the most adept at explaining, \"We all have several advantages on our side going into this. We each,\" he gestured to the separate individuals in turns, \"Have plenty of experience and familiarity with the layout of the kingdom. We have the power of compelling and well-respected members of the public. With Flynn and Maximus being legends and White Lightening becoming a hero. Warren and I are also well connected to some friends who live in town. We also have the advantage of White Lightening still appearing to be under the Captain of the Guard's influence, which would enable him to discredit the Captain just as effectively as the Captain's intent to discredit Maximus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded at this and agreed that everything said so far was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our plan then,\" Tristan said, \"Is to turn the Captain's most influential weapon against him. White Lightening is the spearhead of the Captain's campaign to shift Maximus out of his position, and staging an accident is his method of doing so. Now we have gone over the possibility of having Maximus save someone else in a staged accident, but we realized that this would only pit the two horses against each other, and that wouldn't work. So we realized that we needed to have the Captain become personally involved, perhaps seeming to endanger Flynn in some way, and then have Maximus and White Lightening work together to rescue him. The public loves duos, and a pair of horses intent on saving the kingdom is the perfect way to unite their voice to us and to expel the Captain from anymore plotting. We thought we would have Flynn sneak back into the city, seeing as he's the prince after all and be placed in the position of speaking out against the Captain's actions. When the Captain approached Flynn, he would then challenge the Captain to defend himself. When the Captain is asked to produce his supporting figure head: White Lightening, both Maximus and White Lightening come into protest against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Tristan sat back from his lengthy explanation and looked around. \"Any questions?\" When no one raised their hands, he said, \"Good. It will take a couple of days for us to contact our allies in the kingdom. They'll be able to sneak Maximus and White Lightening in, and then aid in ensuring the Captain is the one confronting the prince.\" Tristan sighed, \"Maximus, this is the harder part for me to ask of you. I'm going to need you to lose a bit of weight. Not all of it, but enough to allow you to walk and trot without the threat of tripping over your own belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus considered the request, and realized it was the right thing to do before nodding. White Lightening seemed a little saddened by the thought, but then he stepped forward and gestured to himself before Maximus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you're requesting to help him,\" Tristan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening nodded and Tristan agreed that this would be beneficial. \"Don't worry Maximus,\" he reassured the bulbous stallion, \"It will only be a couple of days, and then you are welcome to the contents of my shop free of charge when this is all finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large smile split Maximus' muzzle at the thought and the horse agreed to go through with the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Tristan cracked his knuckles, \"Let's get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen over the next few days?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next couple days neither White Lightening nor Maximus relished in the desire to see Maximus' bulging, quivering belly have to shrink. But each horse's sense of cut and loyalty to eradicating the danger presented by the Captain strongly overrode their obsession with Maximus' plush middle. White Lightening monitored the bloated horse's progress, keeping it as simple and painless for both of them as possible. He opted to restrict Maximus' food intake and to take light, but effective walks around the farms with the obese equine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two horses devised a small reward system that eased the notion of not bingeing a little: For every half-mile Maximus walked, he was awarded an apple to stave off the worst of his hunger. Every three miles they walked was followed by a short break and a couple more apples. At first, Maximus grew winded simply from traveling a hundred yards, his gasping caused his monolithic belly to sway precariously under his concave spine. He would often simply collapse into the plushness of his belly for comfort, reveling in its softness, as he nuzzled the tender love handles and creases that bulged out from the sides. White Lightening often struggled with the urge to bury his own face in the puffy white layers of lard, but steeled his nerves and grit his teeth whenever the temptation arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the first day, Maximus' belly only shrank internally. His large, bulging stomach remained as soft and low hanging as ever, but he could feel his appetite decrease effectively, and by the end of the day; Maximus wasn't tempted to simply eat to the point of bursting, but rather to a feeling of contented fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maximus and White Lightening worked on the stallion's figure, the prince and two ex-soldiers sent letters out to their trusted allies to plan for the impending procedure of combatting the Captain's influence over the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gathered their news, they realized that, all in all, the process would take approximately 4 days to complete. This gave White Lightening and Maximus the proper time to work on the overfed stallion's stature and build up his endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second day Maximus began to notice his belly decreasing slightly in size. It no longer forced his legs to widen in his stance, and the bulging appendage slowly contracted slightly above the level of the stallion's knees. He was also able to manage quarter-miles at a slow, industrious pace and refrained from simply stuffing himself with the succulent orbs surrounding him. White Lightening also noted the progress, impressed by Maximus' rapid improvement. White Lightening himself also showed additional restrain, but would occasionally and, of course, accidentally stumble head first into Maximus' plush side. He couldn't get over the hypnotic feeling of encasing his muzzle in the deep felt flab, marveling at the abundant warmth and the jello like texture. This happened several times throughout the day, but Maximus never seemed to mind, and often rolled his eyes in amused exasperation at the obsidian stallion's awful attempts to \"accidentally\" bury his face in Maximus' stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Maximus had made even more substantial progress. His belly now considerably smaller, though by no means had it lost its pillowy softness, required less and less food. Maximus found he could achieve a trot for short periods of time, and was able to walk half miles with little trouble. His belly was now several inches shy of reaching his knees, and bulged out less when he inhaled, but White Lightening still insisted on aiding the obese stallion to stand up whenever the situation arose for it. Maximus found himself enjoying the contact more and more as he allowed for the stygian horse to aid him each time with a small sense of satisfaction. By the end of the third day, Maximus was about the same size as when he had first entered Tristan's shop. Thinking about the pastries it held, Maximus licked his lips at the prospect of being able to once more stuff himself to bursting capacity. The sentiment stimulated Maximus quite effectively,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final day before their plan to take the Captain down commenced, Maximus was up to the point where he could walk a mile in relative ease, trot a quarter mile without being winded and his belly was now about half the size it had been when he'd started. It only reached halfway down to his knees, but was still exceedingly soft and supple. White Lightening called off training early for the day, so the two could rest for the ensuing action. Both lounged in the shade of the apple trees and White Lightening laid his head against Maximus' belly. The bulging equine was entirely used to the fact by now, and thought of it as a gesture of endearment. Where the black horse's head lay, Maximus' stomach bulged outwardly, as the weight of the stallion's head displaced some of the horse's plush flab.The two remained in this manner until the sun set and then they made their way over to the cottage where the Flynn, Warren, and Tristan resided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So our plan will be implemented in two day's time,\" Warren said. \"We'll be traveling tomorrow and sneak into the kingdom in the night. I have received word that almost a third of the guard is under the Captain's thumb, which means we will have to be careful to only interact with those on our side.\" Everyone nodded in agreement. \"Once we are inside, we will hole up in a friend's house and then in mid-afternoon, when the Captain makes a mandatory round to check on the guards, we will make our move in the Central Square. Flynn will confront the Captain head on, seeing as he is a powerful and well-known figure. He will accuse the Captain of treachery, and when the Captain makes to have Flynn arrested, Maximus and White Lightening will come to the rescue. Tristan and I will be waiting with reinforcements. Hopefully we can draw him out into the light and crush his campaign when White Lightening takes the side against him. Any questions?\" Everyone shook their heads. \"Alright then, let's get some rest.\" Warren cracked his knuckles, and everyone took that as the signal for them to get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus lay against the barn, White Lightening resting his head on the stallion's belly. They fell asleep as the night fell and a new approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would it bring? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, the sun rose in a beautiful dawn that awoke a sleeping White Lightening with a piercing ray cast straight into his dozing eyes. He slowly sat up and was greeted with a splendid, almost ethereal sight. Maximus' protruding belly aligned almost perfectly with the rising sun, forming an illuminated outline around the stallion's bulging midriff. Hypnotized by the sight, White Lightening quietly laughed to himself at the comparison between the equine's gut and a holy entity. As exceptional as the swollen side was, White Lightening found himself more amused than astounded and simply hoped that the vision was an indication of good luck for their impending trials against the forces of the corrupt Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching, White Lightening noticed the two ex-soldiers and the prince already moving about and readying themselves for the day's walk back to the outskirts of the kingdom. The group would have to be careful on their return trip, as the Captain most likely had guards posted at vital intervals along the main routes into the kingdom, so they would be forced to take back roads, country paths, and short cuts in order for the more famous figures to avoid detection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking his muzzle once more into the still-dozing Maximus' plush side, White Lightening reveled at the softness of the appendage before feeling a shudder as the voluminous masses' owner snapped awake. Maximus gazed around himself groggily and noted the early hour of the rising sun with an obvious note of disdain. Struggling to his feet, the white stallion trotted over to the rain barrel at the side of the barn and took a refreshing gulp of the cedar-infused liquid. The movement caused his still-large belly to sway steadily and his ample rear end to pad softly together. Taking his fill, Maximus looked around at White Lightening and nodded a friendly greeting. The stygian stallion returned the gesture in kind, before they both headed over to the three men who were talking about the best paths to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tristan and Warren being retired soldiers, they had been forced to remember the entire surrounding area by heart and mind, and Flynn had grown up navigating the maze of numerous paths in the forests to ironically evade the horse he now considered his best friend. Though in the bulging state Maximus was in, the thief-turned-prince would have had a much easier time escaping presently than when he had to in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men seemed to agree that they were relatively safe to move on the main road for about half a day, and would then take an abandoned side road that arced around numerous checkpoints, before dead ending at the barren remnants of a small isolated farm about half a mile from the kingdom's official borders. It was here that they would meet the contacts who would then smuggle the lot of them in two trade wagons, which had been given clearance by the guards not under the Captain's orders to let pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the two horses were also ready, Warren stood up and shouldered his pack. \"Looks like we're ready to move out,\" he said as his one good eye glinted brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn intercepted him and Tristan before they truly got going and said, \"Before we leave, I would like to thank you both for your aid and efforts to help us in this situation. I know you didn't have to, but without your ingenuity and connections, we would truly never stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Warren stepped forward and clapped the prince on the soldier, \"My loyalty was cemented to you and that exceptional horse the day you proved yourself a hero and risked your life to save the princess. My duty as a soldier would never allow me to turn my back on brethren, no matter what shape or form they come in.\" The last part was gently directed at Maximus in a good natured humor, as his shape was mostly round and form mostly bulging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan nodded at the sentiment, feeling no need to add only but a simply, \"We're with you,\" patting the prince on the back before nodding respectfully to the two horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the unified group set out on the road and began their journey back towards the kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled without incident, before they came across a singular scout while only a mile from the abandoned path. He turned to flee, with the intent of losing his quarry and notifying the main patrol that was a couple miles ahead of him. He never stood a chance. White Lightening lived up to his name, as he ran the soldier down in a flash, tripping him and knocking him out cold with a solid hoof to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tied him to a nearby tree, out of sight from the main road and left a dagger just out of reach. They knew the soldier would eventually come around, but he would be unable make any noise and would be forced to untie himself over the course of several hours before he managed to be free enough to begin the arduous process of reaching the dagger, and then successfully untying himself. By that time the group would be in the wagons and well past the kingdom's limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the guard was thoroughly secure, the group continued into the woods in a hurry. They were partially afraid of running into another scout and also racing the descending sun. Maximus maintained a respectable pace, despite his ponderous belly wobbling under him with the consistency of a bowl of jello. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group made it to the checkpoint just as the sun was lilting in the sky, and Maximus' belly once more accompanied the glowing orb as he gently collapsed to the ground to recover his breath. His sides compressed against the ground, forming love handles that quivered in from ragged breaths and gently flattened the random clumps of weeds dotting the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling down next to him, White Lightening indulgently lay his head on the horse's soft side and smiled from the feeling of his head sinking slowly into the soft layers of fat. The group waited until an hour after night, before they all got up and began moving past the abandoned site. A hundred yards into the woods, they unleashed a tittering bird call that echoed off the looming branches and was eventually joined by a return call of the same nature. A small glowing light appeared from behind a tree, and a young man in his thirties beckoned to them. The group approached the figure, whom both Tristan and Warren embraced. The man introduced himself as Trevor, the son of one of the retired soldiers' most trusted friends. Trevor was lean, and had an narrow face, dark eyes, and long hair. His eyes widened slightly at the sight of the rotund Maximus, but he said nothing. He then lead them to two ox-drawn carriages and had the three men crawl in one and the horses hunker down in there other. Maximus struggled to fit through the wooden partition between the floor and the bottom of the carriage, causing his belly to smash against the sides and groan a little from the compression. White Lightening helped push him in, before clambering in himself. Once they were secure, the carriages were off into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriages bumped along for about an hour, stopping at various check points along the way. Eventually everything drew quiet, and the carts came to a final halt somewhere in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage partitions were slid open, and light poured into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat awaited the horses and the men?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGood evening,\u201d a deep voice resonated in the abandoned street, as the five companions exited the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan and Warren rushed toward the silhouetted individual as soon as their feet touched the ground and embraced their friend who was an integral reason for the ease of passage into the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRupert,\u201d Tristan exclaimed enthusiastically, \u201cI cannot tell you how relieved I am to see you and your men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in question nodded, a wide smile adorning his face. \u201cOf course old friend, I couldn\u2019t stand idly by while that cur of a Captain twisted this city.\u201d His gaze then shot up to the three well-known figures standing off to the side. \u201cAnd you three are the ones with enough clout to stop it.\u201d The greying man nodded in turn to the prince, the White Lightening and then to Maximus who elicited a hearty chuckle. \u201cMind you, this one seems to have plenty of clout under any circumstances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus felt his rotund cheeks redden at the joke, and shuffled sheepishly in embarrassment. The movement caused his bulbous gut to sway gently, as if to further emphasize Rupert\u2019s point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d the soldier clasped his hands, becoming dead serious in the process, \u201cLet\u2019s get going. We have a small, but well-hidden room for you all to spend the night. About an hour before dawn, I\u2019ll have one of my men lead you to your positions in the Central Square and arrange for the Captain to pass through at the height of the morning market rush. You guys will do your thing, and we\u2019ll get rid of this bastard once and for all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple, straightforward, effective; the companions were quick to accept the plan without hesitation and together they made their way into the safe house, although Maximus\u2019 bulging sides made his entrance through the side door a little squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were hunkered down, the men situated themselves in comfortable positions on the floor, while Maximus propped himself against the wall and White Lightening propped himself against the stallion\u2019s plush belly. After the long day of travel, the group was asleep in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, as dusk was barely suffusing the early morning gloom, the group was awoken by a gentle knock at the door. Blinking blearily, Maximus was quick to rise when he remembered their reason for being here. The obese horse had a pivotal role to play in the events to come, and he needed his mind to develop a razor sharp focus if they were to play the plan correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was up and ready, Rupert led them down into the square. Utilizing alleyways, side streets, and the emptiness of the early hour, they found their way into the square in quick fashion. After the group stopped, Rupert indicated to the different areas of the square. He didn\u2019t need to explain its exact layout as everyone was already familiar with it, but he did point out the vantage points where each member would reside. Flynn would assume the identity of a street peddler in order to get in the captain\u2019s path, White Lightening and Maximus would be sheltered in a small stable to the side of a large restaurant, and Tristan and Warren would simply behave like normal citizens as they weren\u2019t too recognizable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose and the market place began to come alive, each individual kept their focus on the part they were to play. The signal to initiate the plan occurred around half past ten in the morning, as Flynn waved a bright red cloth in the manner of a merchant attempting to sell his wares. He kept his act up until he had a good view of the Captain slowly ambling down the northern stone steps accompanied by five of his closest men. Upon seeing the target, Flynn waited until the Captain was near the middle of the square before vaulting over his cart and ripping off his tattered disguise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAPTAIN GLADE,\u201d the prince shouted, loud enough to draw attention from nearby citizens, \u201cI am decreeing your arrest for treason, attempted murder, and conspiracy by the power of royal declaration!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain was momentarily caught off guard by the prince\u2019s sudden appearance, but he quickly regained his composure and yelled back, \u201cYou may declare those words, but they have no power ever since you were established an exile of the crown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmuring rippled through the crowd as the citizens struggled to anticipate which side was right. Flynn smiled knowingly, \u201cEveryone here is surely aware of the Captain\u2019s association with a horse known a White Lightening?\u201d He called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name drew a nod from the surrounding individuals, \u201cWell he was being used in those staged accidents to increase the Captain\u2019s hold on the security of this kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain scoffed, \u201cAnd what proof might you have of this incredulous accusation?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn smiled knowingly, \u201cSee for yourself,\u201d he cried, spreading his arms dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side of him, an obsidian stallion and obese equine appeared. \u201cI have the proof of the heroic horse known as White Lightening, and the assurance of the legendary Maximus. One of these figures you claim supported you, and the other being the very individual you tried to overthrow.\u201d<br>\r\nSmiling widely, Flynn folded his arms in immense satisfaction, \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain turned a deep shade of red, a frantic look in his eyes as he realized he was trapped. \u201cI have this!\u201d He exclaimed, drawing his sword which was accompanied by the unsheathing of five more. \u201cYou may have won politically, but I will be damned if you live to see the end of this day.\u201d The Captain cursed the prince, \u201cAnd that traitorous black runt,\u201d he snarled at the obsidian horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Flynn drew a dagger and clashed with the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening took advantage of his speed once more and leapt into the air before taking two of the enemy guards down with each hoof. He landed on top of their chests and gave them each a strong knock on the helmet to ensure they would stay unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximus lumbered toward the guard closest to him and jerked his head back as the opponent\u2019s sword grazed his muzzle. Stepping in as the guard followed through, Maximus butted him in the chest with his head and sent the guard reeling into a nearby stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white stallion took a moment to register the prince currently grappling with the Captain before looking over his shoulder to see Tristan, Warren, and several men fighting their way through the crowd to assist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment nearly cost Maximus his life as he felt a stinging sensation burn in his bulging side. He realized one of the two guards still standing had taken a wild swing and managed to draw a shallow cut along his bulging belly. Wheeling around, Maximus lunged at the guard only for the man to be swept off his feet in front of the white stallion\u2019s eyes. He realized White Lightening had propelled a back hoof into the guard\u2019s knee, hyperextending it and ensuring the guard would be unable to regain his balance. Maximus quickly brought a hoof down on his head, and knocked the guard out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Lightening seemed to be handling the final guard on his own, but Flynn was starting to lose the battle between dagger and sword. Suddenly the Captain swept the prince\u2019s dagger out of his grasp and opened a shallow cut across Flynn\u2019s chest. The prince stumbled to the ground and watched as the Captain raised his sword. Neither ever saw Maximus coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulging stallion launched himself in the air and landed squarely on the Captain, burying him under the equine\u2019s large posterior. The humiliating defeat knocked the Captain out cold and Maximus took his time getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered the group\u2019s names, as Tristan and Warren finally made their way onto the scene. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Tristan gasped, \u201cWe have friendly soldiers and some medic coming shortly. Rapunzel is making her way down too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn smiled at this last statement before passing out from the pain of his wound laid out across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days passed for the horses and prince to recover. White Lightening had also sustained a sprained forelock from his stunt with the first to guards and had been too preoccupied to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they recovered, Maximus was offered his old post as commander back, but the stallion made it clear that he wanted White Lightening to occupy the post. He looked forward to serving as an advisor who could focus on certain other important things, like expanding his waistline once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn returned to the loving arms of his wife and helped Tristan and Warren filter the guards to weed out those still under the Captain\u2019s influence. As everything wound down, Tristan came to visit the two nearly recovered horses. \u201cThank you for all you\u2019ve done. I think I still owe this one,\u201d he patted Maximus affectionately on the belly, \u201cA trip to my shop. I promised after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two horses looked at one another before nodding in turn, that sounded like a good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it, or did something else happen?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days transpired as White Lightening was indoctrinated into his new post, Flynn reunited with Rapunzel, Tristan and Warren rewarded for their efforts, the Captain appropriately trailed and imprisoned for his actions, and for Maximus to enjoy the freedoms of an advisor. Despite taking a step down from his exalted post as the Commander of the kingdom's security, Maximus was content in the knowledge that White Lightening would be more than capable of fulfilling the role and Maximus himself would be fulfilling other obligations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ensuring that the kingdom was in somewhat working order once more, Maximus took to thinking about where he would go from here. He kept up his usual eating habits and maintained a relatively neutral figure with a large, plush belly, chubby face and neck, and impressively proportioned posterior. He was quite mobile in his present state, but Maximus missed the experience of being able to stuff himself to his heart's, and belly's, content. Mulling the issue over in his mind, Maximus also thought back to the days when he was trim and as physically fit as White Lightening currently was. He did enjoy the strength and agility that went along with the notion of being in shape, but this sentiment was almost immediately quenched when Maximus indulged himself in simply feeling the weight swinging below his spine. He adored the pressure of being stuffed to the brim, feeling the tightness constrict in his middle, and being the heaviest entity in the area. The softness, the rounded stature, the cuddly image; Maximus realized he was simply delaying the inevitable by trying to convince himself otherwise. He went to get White Lightening one quiet night and decided to take Tristan up on his offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two horses made their way down to the familiar's pastry shop, bumping into each other humorously and nodding gestures of respect to passing citizens who recognized the two famous horses. Eventually they came up to the entrance and made their way inside where Tristan seemed pleasantly surprised at their appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to close down for the night anyway,\" he chuckled softly, before gesturing to the expanse of his shop. \"You two have access to everything currently residing in here, including the display trays and the little something extra I made in anticipation for Maximus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down behind the counter, Tristan pulled out an additional barrel of sweetened apple cider and presented it to Maximus in grand fashion. \"A toke of gratitude and respect,\" the shopkeeper said, \"The stand is also entirely full. Business was slightly slow today, so I hope you have a large appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready salivating at the aromatic fragrances wafting from the barrel of cider, Maximus reached into his side pocket and made Tristan take a large bag of silver for the contents. Although the shopkeeper blustered and protested at the offer, Maximus was even more adamant that he take it, utilizing his plush features to adopt a cuddly, pleading gaze which finally won Tristan over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair you know,\" the shopkeeper muttered with a smile, \"But I can't fight you.\" He took the bag of silver with a sigh before bidding the horses good night and locking the doors to ensure privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to focus on the food and drink, Maximus opted to eat one of the eight rows of confections before taking a deep draft of cider. For the first two partitions, the white stallion was fine, but his harness and side straps began creaking under the strain of containing the horse's expanding middle and Maximus' second drink from the barrel snapped the leather in quick succession. His unrestrained belly dropped several inches and wobbled ominously from the sudden release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at the relieved pressure, Maximus waited for White Lightening to bring forth the next row of confections. He downed the third and fourth rows with relative ease, and shivered in delight as White Lightening gauged the increasing pressure with his muzzle. Maximus' belly grew tighter and rounded with the additional food, causing the fellow stallion's muzzle to slowly be pushed outward by the increasing pressure. By now, Maximus' belly was slightly resistant and wobbled from the additional liquid it held. His low-hanging gut swayed level with the equine's knees and bulged against Maximus' legs in tight creases. He was at a similar stage to when he had initially been stuffed during the initial hostage situation with the Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the incredible amount of food Maximus' belly, he was nowhere near as full as when he'd been stuffed to the same point days prior. He attributed this to the fact that his increased consumption had consequentially increased his capacity. With this revelation, Maximus became determined to finish the contents of both the stand and the barrel. Moving through the fifth row at a steady pace, Maximus' belly grew more taught and sagged lower and lower to the ground. White Lightening could only watch the process with incredulous awe, as his eyes traced the outline of the bulging mass slowly creeping towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the sixth row, Maximus found himself experiencing a sensation entirely alien to him; the floor brushing against his bare belly. Looking down, he realized his bulbous gut was pressing slightly against the floor and each additional bite caused his ponderous mass to spill out more onto the floor. Encouraged by the sight, Maximus plowed through the rest of the sixth row and well into the seventh row before he began to realize his belly was occupying a large portion of the floor in a rather spherical manner. White Lightening was entranced by the spectacular vision and could only imagine what the final state of the overstuffed horse would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his haste to finish the pastries, Maximus unintentionally abandoned the second half of the cider as he forged onward with the pastries. He was polishing off the rest of the final row, when Maximus realized his belly was pressing well against his spine to actually create an arch. His legs were also pushed out to the sides, and bulged into the soft, expansive flab with impressive results. White Lightening also buried his muzzle in the pillowy mound that was Maximus' stomach and was ecstatic to find that his muzzle was almost buried up to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Maximus eyed the barrel and determinedly waddled over to finish his expansive quest. Titling forward, Maximus took deep, rolling drafts of the cider and White Lightening watched spellbound as the liquid level decreased in proportion to the swelling of the white equine's gut. As Maximus drank, his feet gently lifted off the ground and his full weight became supported by his staggering belly. He was, effectively and incredibly, immobilized by his large ballast of a gut. Once he finished, Maximus leaned back and burped politely, before rocking and sloshing on the quivering mass of his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge love handles and rolls of flab formed from Maximus' weight, and his legs were forced outward at slight angles to rest on the plush expanse. Looking to White Lightening, Maximus smiled with the fullest expression he had ever witnessed, closed his eyes, and allowed his head to sink deeply into his soft, malleable chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking from the awe-inspiring sight, White Lightening walked forward, lay his head on the sea of softness, closed his eyes, and drifted into a peaceful sleep of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you take the story next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two remained good friends, and White Lightening always ensured the plush equine had enough to fill his voluminous gut.

His large, swaying belly became a campaign and successful inspiration for Tristan's bakery which adopted a new logo: A large, well-rounded equine laying on the ground with their belly framed by a rising sun. He then went on to call it <i>The Curved Crescent</i> and gained a considerably larger business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary horse known for his legendary belly was headed for a future of excitement, food, plush sensations, and the accompaniment of a close band of friends.

Even the animals are preparing for the winter season, too. Well, most of them, anyways. It just so happens that some animals are just going to wait for the winter season to come so that they can play in the snow. Bambi, however, wasn't so sure about what he would do. After all, his mother made sure that her son was a good deer. But he would eventually make his decision about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Bambi was playing with his friends, Thumper, Flower and Faline, like he would any other day. Then after quite some time, Flower tells him them something that surprises Bambi. \"For the winter, I hope to gain some body fat so that I can hibernate all winter.\" \"Yeah, I hope I can do just about the same, too.\" Bambi replied to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Thumper, who have heard what Bambi had said, suddenly had an idea. \"Hey, Bambi. I have an idea. Why not I force-feed you to get you ready for the winter?\" Faline was shocked about what Thumper had said to Bambi. \"Umm, Thumper? Don't you think he's fine as he is?\" \"No worries! Bambi will be ready for the winter by the time I'm done force-feeding him!\" Thumper said to Faline. \"Isn't that right, Bambi?\" \"Of course, Thumper!\" Bambi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's just one thing I might not know about. When are you going to force-feed me?\" Thumper knew Bambi would want to get force-fed by him right away, but he also wanted to wait until tomorrow to do that, too, since he only has quite some time before Bambi's mother shows up and takes her son back to her home. So he replied to him...</span></div></div>",

There's plenty of time left before your mother comes!\" Bambi, of course, became excited because he was going to get force-fed by one of his friends right away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaline was still concerned about it, though. \"My Bambi's getting force-fed by Thumper!? But don't you think...\" But Thumper said to her, \"Oh, come on! Haven't I told you already? He'll be fine! He'll just be a bit overweight by the time we're done.\" Faline eventually went over to Bambi and said, \"Well, Bambi. If you're getting force-fed, then I won't mind it. I'll still love you, even when you might be a big blob when Thumper is done force-feeding you.\" \"Thanks, Faline.\" replied Bambi. \"Hopefully, you don't end up being a really big blob, though.\" said Faline to Bambi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so both Bambi and Thumper walked away from their play place to where he would be force-feeding him. Their other friends went back to their parents and talked to them about what Bambi and Thumper are planning to do. Their parents' reactions are quite surprising! Especially Flower's mother. \"Bambi's getting force-fed by Thumper!?\" \"No worries, mother. I'm certain he'll still able to move after the force-feeding is done. Besides, what I'm planning to do is very different from their plans.\" \"Oh, I see. Well, we better get back to our homes, now.\" They both went back to their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bambi and Thumper have just arrived at the spot where he would be force-feeding him. Bambi said to him with question, \"Umm, Thumper? I know this is the place where you'll be force-feeding me. But with what exactly?\" \"Well, I'll show you.\" replied Thumper. He got out his remote for one of his force-feeding machines and pressed the button. With a creak and a squeak, Bambi saw that Thumper has...</span></div></div>",

Thumper placed the box in the middle of the humongous field. \"I snatched this from some  humans.\" Thumper said proudly, patting the machine. <br>\r\nBambi inspected it and sniffed it, \"Are you sure it's safe?\" Asked Bambi, \"Of course it's safe!, everything humans make is safe!\" Thumper replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was a small cube-like metallic box with human writing neither of the animals could read. \"See, it says safe right here.\" Thumper pointed to a random location on the box, Bambi nodded in gullibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumper pressed a green button on the box, suddenly the box exploded forward into a large conveyor belt. Bambi was a bit taken back by all of this but he was still willing. <br>\r\n\"Since this is a human contraption, it has human food. Any human food ya like will pop outta this thing.\" Explained the rabbit. \"Now let's get to it.\" He tapped his foot rapidly in excitement and in impatience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBambi sat his thin buck-booty on the grass and watched in wonder as a singular cherry pie popped out of the machine with a playful whirring noise. The buck was a bit confused at first, but then he opened his mouth wide, and after quite a few bites he finished the pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, that was a lot Thumper, I think I'm done.\" Bambi groaned as he turned to leave.<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh uh...\" taunted Thumper, \"It's called force-feeding for a reason.\" Thumper pressed a blue button on the box, robotic hands shot out from the sides and dragged Bambi back into place. They tangled like vines around his four legs, the deer bucked and retaliated but to no avail. \"Hehehe I'm gonna make you bigger than the fattest bear!\" Chuckled Thumper, a little creepily. Bambi struggled some more as he gulped down another pie. </span></div></div>",

Faline was just a young fawn who didn't know much about the world around her, giggling at everything. The king of the forest begun his daily work of protection for the forest, with the queen of the forest deceased from hunters that had trespassed into the forest, nothing was to stop the king from protecting his domain, it was his only focus. Peeking at the king she had noticed a new young buck that seemed afraid of his surroundings, \"this is your domain Bambi every little creature from the smallest field mouse to the largest bear are under your protection, we conduct your teachings of this land later, for now meet your people\" he stated to his son, noticing the doe hiding in the bushes behind a mighty oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBambi didn't know what to expect from the new area that was his father's domain it was all new to him, he had his two friends with him which made the transition to this new environment more bearable. Thumper and Flower have been through it all with the prince of the forest, from him dealing with his mother's passing to his father taking him to the strange new place. Faline didn't know how to approach this new playmate any other way than to be her rambunctious giggling self, she didn't have many playmates other than her twin brother since not many fawns were around her age to play with. Seeing that the young buck was alone she saw this as her chance to meet him, chasing him through the trees like a bat out of hell, swerving and crossing Faline finally made it to her target who wasn't even expecting a doe like her to be around. Bursting out of the trees and into a clearing Faline frightened Bambi half to death with her antics she started to speak in a coy manner \" what's the matter scaredy cat, can't catch me even if you tried to\" this got right under the skin of Bambi as no young doe was going to out race him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two begun to play in the large forest that they called home, it was fun for Bambi it seemed like all of his worries began to disappear, this little race seemed to be the start of a great friendship. While the two fawns played they never even heard the cracking of a branch off in the distance, the sounds of what ever broke that branch. After a while the two fawns were exhausted from their games, \"what was that noise\" Bambi exclaimed frightened about what it was. Closer and closer the sound came to Bambi and Faline, afraid of what these noises were caused by the two of them fled. Faster and faster they ran trying to get away, Faline got stuck upon a loose root twisted leg and caught between the entanglement of roots. Bambi fled frightened by what ever was creating those horrid sounds, not having the nerve to go back for the doe he coward away looking for his father to protect him. Meanwhile the noise got closer and closer only to reveal a bunch of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crackle of the brush that was around the edge of the dense forest that was behind Faline, not knowing what this sound was the only thing Faline thought to do was to back up but as she noticed quite quickly, this was impossible for her hind leg was still tangled in the rich number of roots that based the bed of the forest. She didn\u2019t know what to do as her only option of escape was exhausted thanks to her leg being completely immobile by the massive trees that surrounded the area where Bambi left her to fend for her self, \u201cso much for the prince of the forest\u201d she scoffed at him, trying to make light of the situation only made Faline realize that it was quite a dire situation that she was in as the sound of what ever was moving into the forest began its descent upon her position with unbiased intent. Scared of what she was going to encounter Faline futilely tried to tug at the roots that bound her to the spot where she awaited the fate that has been given to her. It seem as it humans have entered the forest of the king, three of them looked quite unassuming much less threatening than her mother has described them, Faline just looked at the humans they held a metallic looking object in each of their hands this object peaked Faline's interest she made sure to be hidden from the humans as they prowled deeper into the forest to fortunes untold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000There were only three humans that Faline could see all dress in the same garb which consisted orange vests covering flannel shirts and brow pants that helped them blend into the surrounding area. Curious with these humans Faline didn't even notice there was someone creeping upon her hidden position, the clicking of a gun was heard behind Faline, fearing for whom ever was behind her Faline begun to worry whom was behind her. Sharply Faline turned around just fast enough to see a glimmer of whom was behind her, seeing golden locks swaying in the wind as Faline begun studying the beautiful face of what seemed to be a woman, looking like she didn\u2019t belong with the three other more gruff older looking men that accompanied the young woman. Faline couldn\u2019t even flee from her hiding spot as the woman bashed the poor fawn across the skull knocking her out for a time, dragging her new found catch the edge of the woods to place upon in the back of her pick up truck to be mounted. \u201cyou call that a catch its not even a one pointer\u201d one of the men chuckled as they all left the area to return to their own lives. Driving home to a lavished mansion like property the woman whom hasn\u2019t even looked at her catch since they left the home of Faline, changing the station of the radio she couldn\u2019t do anything but scoff at her own inability as a hunter saying quietly to herself \u201cgood one Nadine all you can catch is fawns, looks like impressing the higher ups with my hunting abilities is something that I need to work on\u201d, looking into her rear view mirror, backing up into the drive way of her well earned home, nothing but trees and forest encompassed her property fences darted around so no critters would wander into her property uninvited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u3000\u3000Dragging her newly acquired kill through the garage and into the basement of the house, it was an impressive level all on its own. The garage was split into four large section, which all had memorabilia from her past achievements and adventures over the years. Closer and closer Nadine got to the area where she usually skinned and chopped her various animal kills, not even realizing that Nadine had never finished the job upon Faline and the young doe was merely knocked out from the trauma of being bashed into the skull with the stock of Nadine\u2019s rifle. Groggily Faline begun to wake up from her unconscious state in fear and confusion of where she was. Scared and alone Faline begun to do the only thing she could think out at the time, run away from this place where she found herself in, kicking Nadine\u2019s hands causing her to let go of the young doe\u2019s legs allowing her to run wild. Corner to corner Faline tried to find an escape route for her self as there was no hole or opening that she could squeeze through, even with her small stature she didn\u2019t know how to escape from this woman whom uprooted her from the place she called home. Trying as she might Nadine could see the fawn wouldn\u2019t listen to reasons no matter how much she tried to calm her down, looking upon her prize more closely she could see this doe was quite beautiful in her own right, knowing that she wouldn\u2019t calm down and not seeing any other way to relax the doe Nadine grabbed her trusty tranquilizer gun and took aim. Almost instantaneous the drug concoction that was in the needle that was shot into Faline\u2019s side, out like a light the drugs took hold of Faline and unconscious came to her quickly. No longer wanting to skin this beautiful doe Nadine could only chuckle as a sinister thought popped into her head, laughing more manically she only whispered \u201cone pointer huh? We\u2019ll see\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ever since he and Pocahontas had arrived to the British kingdom they had been treated well, with good food and a nice house to stay in. The place was huge with every room having it's own treats. They had very comfortable chairs to sit on, and a bed that once he felt it never wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only one other thing that he liked more then the bed, and that was the food they had. When they had been having dinner Meeko had catch the smell of something that he had never smelled before. It had been the smell of cooked meat, boiled vegetables and baked bread. All of it was like taken from a dream to him, and even thought he only got small samples of it served by his owner he that it tasted just as amazingly. He just knew he had to have more of this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd later during the night when everyone else was asleep Meeko still couldn't stop thinking about all that food that could be stored in that room. Looking over at his owner he could see that she was sleeping as well, and decided to make tonight his chance to have something special for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking out from his room he quickly remembered the way he needed to walk to get back to the dinning room. Once there he saw a huge door, from where during dinner he had seen people carrying trays of food coming from. \"That must be from where the food come from.\" He quickly concluded, and made his way over there. To his luck he saw that the door was slightly open, and all he needed to do was to simply walk in to enter the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he almost fainted by the sight he saw. The room was filled to the brim with all kinds of food. There was meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, bread, wine and much more. Not letting his growling stomach wait anymore he immediately started dinning on the first thing he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing to enter his mouth was some grapes. Sweet as the berries of the forest Meeko gladly took and stuffed his face with as many of them he could before swallowing and going over to the next thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked almost everything he ate. If it was raw meat or just the sauce that was being served next to it didn't matter, he still loved it. The only thing that leaved a bad taste in his mouth was when he find some hot spices that on it's own just was an incredible burning feeling in his throat. He quickly had to drink something to get the fire inside of him out, and the first thing he saw was a huge vine bottle. After getting the cork of he drained it completely, making his throat feel better but now instead made him feel a little <i>funny</i>. Everything looked a bit dizzy, and he had some slight hiccups now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was enjoying himself the most he could swear for a moment he heard something nearby. Looking back at the entrance he saw...</span></div></div>",

He was pretty much the role model of the typical hero that everyone would want to become, and that everybody loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not everybody, as in the deeps of the underworld a certain god of dead was not to happy at all over how things where going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable!\" Hades shouted as flames shot out of his body, and his otherwise usual blue flamed hair got red for a short time. \"Here I am trying to make myself three course meal of chaos. One course Burned city's, One course drowned villages, One frozen army ship for desert (Filled up with real soldiers), and a glass filled with the tears from the few people that managed to survive all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do I get instead?\" He asked no one in particular before bursting out in flames again \"A Hero Sandwich that comes in and serves me some Knuckle-sandwiches next to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting (some what) calm again Hades's two henchmen Pain and Panic dared to enter the room. They both know all to well how their boss could be a bit \"Frazzled\" a times when things didn't go his way. (And since Hercules had entered the picture not much had been in his favour.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad luck again Hades?\" Panic asked. (According to Hades he was never really losing anything he was aiming for, he just was having bad luck.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that Hercules guy again?\" Pain asked, and got quickly hushed by Panic. (The worst thing you could to was to mention that hero's name while he was still present in the room.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This time it was own brother Neptune that just decided to be a jerk to me, what do you think?!\" Hades said to both of them, and they both transformed themselves into bugs, ready to get stamped on by their master for being so worthless. They often did that to get of pretty painless as Hades often just felt pity over how pathetic guys he had to work with. \"Okay, okay, you two. Change back.\" He said and the two shape shifters did so instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades then went over to his throne to rest a little. (Acting so over rage all the time could take a lot out of you.) As he did the two minions carefully walked over and waited permission from him to talk. \"What?\" Hades finally asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We where just wondering if there was any other plan you have tried on defeating...\" Panic said before a angry stare from Hades made him stop saying a certain word. \"You know who.\" Panic then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't think that's what I have been thinking about?!\" Hades said in a not shouting tone, but still very loud and upset one. \"I have tried every single trick in the book...\" Hades said, before Pain interrupted with the question \"What book?\" \"What book do you think? The <i>101 Ways for an evil overlord to conquer not only earth, but also heaven itself</i>.\" Hades said and materialised a thick book out of thin air, before burning it up. \"Oh, okay.\" Pain said, happy that he got an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't matter since every time I try to make any of these plans to work <b>He</b> comes in saves the day, either alone or with his assistant flying horse!\" Hades said, and went back to just being grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when suddenly Panic got an idea. \"But what if he's in a situation where he would need the assistance of his horse friend, and he wouldn't be able to help him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades was first on his way to call what they had suggested as stupid, (Like he often did.) but this time it actually sounded like a good idea. \"You're right.\" He said, barley able to believe his own words. \"Without his trusty animal side-kick he would be much more vulnerable for further plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now was \"How was going to start this plan of making Pegasus less of the heroic animal that he was?\" Hades or Pain and Panic?</span></div></div>",

As he reached the tree he decided to try touching the dot with one of his hoofs, but as he reached on hoof up and was just about to touch it, it suddenly disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the flying horse even more of a question mark then before Pegasus tried looking all around the tree to see where the dot had gone, and that's when he heard a familiar voice from behind. \"This is actually much more fun then most people think.\" Looking behind he could see Hades standing there, holding a laser pointer in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing very well that this guy never was good news Pegasus made himself ready to attack him, but that's when Hades put down his laser pointer and started doing what he did best. Negotiating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Pegasus! (I hope it's okay I call you Peg for short.) You may think that a individual of my kind would search you up to try and create any kind of \"devise\" to sabotage you and your abilities to help a certain \"Son of the Gods\" on his quest to return to Olympus.\" Hades said. He knew that he had such a silver tongue that he could basically start his talk with him saying what his plan was, and could still end up tricking the other one to do as he wanted. (Pegasus was so far still on his defences of what Hades had to say.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would be right, if not that I'm actually here to reward you.\" Hearing this made Pegasus lower his attack position slightly, as he didn't get what the god of death could mean. \"Think about it my be winged stallion. You do pretty much half the work for him as you fly him into battle everywhere and assist him when you fight other flying creatures, like the Stymphalian Birds.\" Hearing this made Pegasus start to question all he had done with his friend so far. Had he really got all the credits he deserved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all I came here to do was to give you <b>this</b> as a small gift from me.\" Hades said and held out a red apple. Pegasus at first was about to foolishly take the apple, until he realised just how easy of a trap this actually was. \"Oh, no worries. This apple here is not poisoned or anything. This isn't like the story of Snow White.\" Hades said in a joking tone, and held out the apple once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Pegasus smelled the apple first to see that it was fine, and when it smell pretty normal he decided to dare tempt fait and ate it. It actually tasted really good, and the winged horse was enjoying the taste very much. What he wasn't noticing that Hades was looking at was that apple Pegasus had eaten was building a small bit of fat on his belly area. (Only about half an inch, but it was still something.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like the taste of that?\" Hades asked, and Pegasus nodded happily. \"I would love to give you a whole basket of these apples if I had the time, but you master will soon exit the temple, and he might get suspicions if he saw you and me talking.\" Hades said, and this got Pegasus a little worried. (As he had completely forgot about Hercules, and almost thought that he was going to see them together.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my suggestion to you is that you go back to him now, and when you have your chances to be alone I can send you some more treats to have. Does that sound good?\" Hades asked, and Pegasus gave once again a over clear \"YES\" nod, as he really wanted to have more food to eat. \"Great! Here's my card. Just call me when ever you want more stuff from me.\" Hades said as he handed out a business card to Pegasus (That he took with his teeth.), before going up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pegasus was just about to go back to wait for Hercules, he could hear his voice saying to him. \"Pegasus! What are you doing over there?\" Pegasus was just about to run back to his friend when he remember that he still had Hades business card hanging out of his mouth. He knew that if Hercules saw it he would be a dead Pegasus, so he did the only thing he could think of doing with it. He stuffed it inside his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to keep his deal with the devil (Or in this case the god of death.) a secret for now Pegasus acted like it was nothing strange going on, and walked over to his human buddy. \"Why where you looking at that tree?\" Hercules asked, and Pegasus just did a shrug with his wings (As if to say \"I don't know.\") as his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules seemed to not think anymore about it as he climbed up on the back of Pegasus, and then he flew them both off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they where flying Pegasus could still feel the business card he had stored in his mouth, and was thinking about whether or not he should contact Hades again.

Inside his stomach acids where starting to digest the card, and that was making it start doing \"it's thing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole plan with the card from the first place was that when Pegasus would want to contact Hades he would simply scratch it and POFF he would be there, and having the card getting broken down inside of him was more then enough to activate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne other small thing that Hades had done (That hadn't been completely thought out) was that he would appear <b>where</b> the card was. And since it was inside the belly of Pegasus, that's exactly where the god of death ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside Pegasus looked normal for one second, and then suddenly had his belly grow out 5 times it's size! And given that the Pegasus couldn't possibly support the sudden extra weight dragging under him, he started to lose control of his flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds Hercules and his partner was plummeting down towards the ground, and no mater what Pegasus did he couldn't get himself back up straight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the belly Hades tried to comprehend over where he was. He knew that he had only been given this to Pegasus, and therefore it was inside of the horse where he now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?! Did Hercules figure out what we where planning and this is a legit way to get revenge on me, or is it just a very accidental (And surrealistic comedic) mishaps?\" The god was asking himself, until he felt the half digested card in his hand. \"The fact that Pegasus and Hercules is currently plunging through the air could also indicate that this must be the \"accident\" version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then thought about just letting them crash and die, but remembered that he made a fair deal with Pegasus. (And it wouldn't be nice to just ruining that deal like this, would it?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a quick snap from his fingers he teleported himself out of the gut, and back into his underground lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Hades out of his stomach Pegasus suddenly felt a lot more lighter, and manages to at the very last second break the speed just enough, and make a bumpy (But harmless) landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they where safe on land again...</span></div></div>",

Taking a moment to recover their breath, the two minions looked around in curiosity at a city they\u2019d never glimpsed before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPockets of clouds laid in whisps on the lowest levels of the marbled floor. Obscuring the ground and providing an ethereal cushion for one to step on. Ornate and lifted pedestals, gardens, pathways, balconies, and other architecture dotted strategic points around the mountain\u2019s plateau. There didn\u2019t seem to be any activity taking place in the immediate area, but green flashes, boisterous noise, and pulsing music testified that the place wasn\u2019t as abandoned as it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly Pain and Panic drifted through the resistant layers of cloud and eventually crested a ridge that dipped into a large, central portico and lush olive trees surrounding it. Rich rose and quartz marble columns supported a decorative aqueduct that wound its way through the party scene; occasionally nectar and ambrosia descended in celestial cascades. Shifting frescos colored their ways across the columns in tune to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party goers glowed in numerous, spectral shades ranging from blood red to sapphire blue to deep purple. The coloration was a manifestation of both their powers and their personas, with the spectrum designating different meanings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of the party, Hercules and his father strode among patrons and friends who offered compliments, congratulations, and witty gestures to the hero of Olympus. The bronzed Greek was basking in the moment as he reveled in the success of his latest accomplishments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter observing the scene for some moments, Pain and Panic\u2019s sharp, pointed ears perked up when they heard a booming laugh issue from the King of the Gods. \u201cAh son, I can\u2019t begin to express my pride in your service to the kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules balked slightly as his father slapped is shoulder, but recovered with a shaky grin. \u201cThanks father,\u201d the demigod said, idly rubbing his sore back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou deserve all the recognition you receive,\u201d the white bearded deity bellowed, \u201cI only wish your friend were here to enjoy the celebration.\u201d Zeus looked to the sky, as if hoping to spot the Pegasus swooping in for a late arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s busy with the modeling of his new stable,\u201d Hercules explained in a bored tone indicating he\u2019d explained numerous times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right,\u201d the God of the Sky rumbled, before his smile brightened electrically. \u201cBut let this not stop us from engaging in the revelries.\u201d And with that he guided his son to another group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain and Panic looked at each other in disbelief. The chances were almost too good to be true, and yet, they\u2019d heard the words uttered by the ruler of the Gods himself. Shrugging they turned on heel and made their way back to the main center of the celestial city. Reading engraved Greek directions, they followed a cobbled pathway up to a large, arched building that hosted to brass doors with equine inscriptions on them. Together the demons pushed the grand entrance open and ventured inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair realized they might be recognized once inside, and Pain quickly transformed into a luminescent blue caretaker leading a gorgeous, brown and white Pegasus Panic by some reigns. They ventured into the rows upon rows of horse stables, each becoming grander and fancier than the previous ones. After several minutes of walking, they finally came upon their target. Pegasus was just putting the final touches on a luxurious, four room stable that appeared nicer than most nobleman\u2019s homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorting in satisfaction as he nuzzled a painting into place, the winged equine stepped back to admire the work of art. Pain and Panic\u2019s illusions both stared in wonder as well. The picture showcased Hercules riding astride a heroic Pegasus after a particularly important victory against the Hydra. Pain and Panic both rolled their eyes at the gaudy display of pride, but Pegasus seemed content in allowing it to serve as the center piece of his brand new stable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with satisfaction, the winged hero turned his head and gave a slight start when he saw the illusions projected by the minions. His eyes grew wide and dopey from Panic\u2019s simulated appearance, before Pegasus fluttered over like a dove and nodded his head in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching on, Panic nodded in return, feigning interest and admiration for the pure white stallion. Stepping forward confidently, Panic tried not to do exactly what his name entailed. He swallowed his pride, gritted his teeth and shook himself free from the reigns. \u201cGo get dinner ready,\u201d he whispered to Pain, before continuing into the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain nodded frantically, and hurried off as if he were some servant with pressing orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic went in and was introduced to the world of a hero. Prancing and playing the stereotypic role of a female besotted by a heroic male horse, the minion turned pegasus did his best to go along with Pegasus\u2019 awful efforts at flattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abashed stallion led the illusory female on a tour of his new palace, showing off the crystal pools spouting from a refreshing fountain in one room to the unequivocal views of the lounge area. Everything was tailored for the use of four legged steeds, and Pegasus reveled in his access functions usually reserved for humans and gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic couldn\u2019t but be slightly impressed by the fancy settings, but he was well aware of his role and the end goal. Adopting a slightly bored demeanor, the brown and cream colored illusion seemed to only take interest in the final room Pegasus introduced: The kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic allowed his appearance to heighten her levels of interest considerably upon viewing the extensive dining/food preparation area. Whinnying encouragingly, Panic\u2019s pegasus gestured toward the kitchen and winked seductively to the eager stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus immediately picked up on the inclination and made for the pair to lay down on two plush, curved cushions situated around a marble and bronze table. Ringing a bell with one hoof, Pegasus nickered reassuringly that food would be arriving shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral moments later, a scrambling Pain dressed in the guise of a servant chef bustled in and made a large show of laying out an impressive amount of food. Once everything was set, Panic\u2019s female took charge and began eating. Pegasus took the signal and began to eat heartily as well. They held a respectful silence for a little while, occasionally making eye contact, but mainly concentrating on their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, Panic finally allowed his alluring roan to issue a polite cough and signal that she was finished. Pegasus also seemed full and made to push his platter of vegetables away only to be stopped by Panic\u2019s illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon\u2019s pegasus hypnotically padded over and picked up another bowl of assorted produce in her mouth. She pushed the bowl towards the stallion who, completely bewitched, took the food without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Pegasus\u2019 trim stomach issuing a low growl to indicate that it was full, the stallion continued to eat more as he gazed entrancingly into the female pegasus\u2019 encouraging gaze. As he ate, he failed to notice his belly slowly growing tighter and expanding roundly from additional food. His concave stomach slowly pushed out to swell into a faint sphere that only extended with the food being crammed into it. On and on the feeding session went, until finally, Pegasus\u2019 swollen abdomen could hold no more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a lithe, powerful horse meant the stallion could never afford to indulge himself in this manner. Only after he\u2019d broken out of his daze did Pegasus realize his once in warding curving belly now protruded outwards in a smooth, taught foot wide globe. Gently, Panic\u2019s roan nuzzle the tender surface of his bulging belly before turning on forelock and swaying hypnotically out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned Pegasus could only stare on in wonder, his enlarged abdomen pressing into the cushion and arching his back slightly. As he looked on, his mind started to churn along again, and he slowly came back into the embrace of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would that reality be?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pegasus could barely contain himself in indignation from the way he'd been treated by the female Pegasus. He was a hero, a champion of the Gods and she'd treated him like some farm horse whose mental functions equaled that of drooling idiot. Pegasus reciprocated that last sentiment; he had acted like a drooling idiot, but the he'd been duped so easily caused worry to blossom in the heroic stallion's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to figure out where he'd lost control, Pegasus attempted to adjust his weight. He shifted slightly, only to be impeded by something when he moved too far. Looking down, Pegasus moaned internally as he remembered the other aspect of his hypnotic date: His swollen belly stuck a solid foot out to the side and gurgled with any movement. Pegasus tried to calm himself, but instead he was hit with a trance as the fullness overcame him and he fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate the next morning, Pegasus awoke to find a slight crick in his neck. As he gently stretched and crack the sore joint satisfactorily, he noticed small rolls of adipose bunching around his shoulders. Looking further down, the white stallion gasped as he witnessed the small paunch that had formed between his legs. It bulged out slightly to the sides and wobbled faintly from the sudden movement. Shaking his head clear of the present issue, Pegasus slowly got to his feet and studied the room around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table on which he and the female pegasus had dined still bore remnants of their meal, and the winged horse\u2019s eyes widened at the volume of food he\u2019d consumed. Snorting in contempt at his indulgence, the equine made to exit his apartment in search of the mysterious roan. As soon as he was departing the kitchen, he felt a pleasant nuzzle grace his smoothly curving abdomen. Jolting from the sudden contact, Pegasus turned swiftly to make eye contact with the familiar female pegasus. He made to gesture angrily at the female for abandoning him the night before, but was stopped short by the pleading look Panic conveyed in the roan\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping unsteadily, Pegasus was once more entranced by the sheer intrigue of the female equine\u2019s disposition. She slowly lead him back into the kitchen with a coaxing smile, before indicating for him to lay down on the cushion. As soon as he made contact with the pillow, a chef bustled in wheeling a large cart and impressive bowl of soup on it. As the chef pulled the cart up, Pegasus mentally corrected himself. The bowl was more of a cauldron, and the female roan\u2019s plans were pretty easy to guess at. Hypnotized by Panic\u2019s beguiling demeanor, he slowly allowed himself to be spoon fed. Though the horse\u2019s pride diminished slightly from the notion, he found the treatment a relaxing change of pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic tentatively had his avatar engage in bewitching the stupefied hero. The night before, the two demons had confided in the results of their first encounter with the legendary Pegasus. The two were slightly underwhelmed by Pegasus\u2019 presence, but they agreed that they should keep up the romantic front in order to follow through with their plan. In order to keep the Pegasus off balance, they decided that sporadic feeding sessions and a small degree of intimacy were enough to distract the bewildered equine long enough for him to become hefty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, their plan revolved around a large cauldron of soup, an alluring roan, and the steadily swelling stallion currently laying on the cushion. With each bite, Pegasus\u2019 abdomen bulged out a little more as the volume of soup increased. Slowly Pegasus\u2019 belly began to fold over itself as from the sheer weight of the warm liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus released labored pants as he powerlessly gulped down each ladle full. By the time the cauldron was three-fourths empty, the stallion\u2019s gut bulged over a foot above his shoulders and quivered ominously. Once the rest was emptied, Pegasus unleashed a quiet burp and groaned from the fullness. Panic\u2019s illusory roan gently pressed her muzzle to the horse\u2019s distended belly and caressed it with a soft press of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gesture was enough to sate the Pegasus into a lulling sleep, and Panic quietly retreated once more from the ornate apartment. Once outside, he turned back into his blue, demonic self and scurried over to an abandoned stall where the pair had taken temporary residence. Pain was waiting for him, and his face split into a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this will be much easier than we thought,\u201d the red minion said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Panic agreed, \u201cWe just need to follow through and soon that cursed horse will be too fat to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed menacingly before plotting the next steps in their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would those steps be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Together the duo decided to continue their plan with a series of fattening occasions for the unsuspecting stallion. Panic simply resumed his role of the alluring roan and Pain functioned as a convenient chef, servant, and owner of the imaginary pegasus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion himself awoke the next morning to find himself inexplicably full. He also felt sluggish and slightly disconnected from the world around him, and as the equine searched around the room in hopes of finding an explanation, his eyes soon settled on the cause. His belly had acquired an impressive layer of plush adipose overnight and was now pressed softly against the cushions. The mass between his legs rose several inches above his side and a thin layer of lard coated the rest of the horse's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily clamoring to his feet, the horse swayed precariously from the newfound weight currently wobbling under his spin. Becoming increasingly alert of his surroundings, the usually lithe horse turned stark red as he realized his appearance was far different than the one present in all his prideful portraits. The embarrassed hero couldn't leave the stable in fear of the public catching wind of his new dilemma. With a pathetic sigh, Pegasus decided to take a refreshing walk around the vast corridors of his home and try to shed some of the excess with from his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking had become a chore for Pegasus, as he soon found out when he was left breathless from a short walk that had taken him only a quarter mile. His sides heaved and quivered with each breath and soon the horse was forced to lay against a stall for support. He pressed one ample side to the wall and felt the fattened flesh squish against the painted wood. Once the he'd recovered from the unexpected exertion, Pegasus heard an eerie neigh emanate from further down the line of stalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes rose and widened as he caught sigh of the attractive roan prancing away from him in intriguing fashion. Momentarily forgetting his distress, the gut heavy horse fluttered behind Panic's illusion and into a smaller, more reserved stall that functioned as the minion's fake abode for the attractive roan. It was outfitted solely to provide the heroic equine with plenty of food in order to ensure an expanded waistline and heftier disposition. The room was furnished tastefully with imaginative kitchen ware which included a small pantry, preparation table, and a main dining table where two large cushions resided for the comfort of the diners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large meal was played out once more for the Pegasus who actually managed to refrain himself from the sentiment of being stuffed for a moment, but was eventually overcome by the desire to please the alluring illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPegasus plopped his ample form on the seat and looked eagerly to the female equine. Panic made his roan amble her way around the table and begin the feeding process in short order. The two maintained another drawn out session for quite some time, Pegasus' belly swelling with each bite and growing increasingly tighter from the internal pressure. Salads, pasta, wine, breads, and cakes all traveled from the roan's loving offer into the cavernous gut of a stupefied stallion. Pegasus felt himself begin to be forced forward as his gut stretched deeply into the cushion and rounded him out further. He was growing larger by the second, but presently, nothing mattered other than pleasing the beguiling eyes of Panic's illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the meal had finally commenced, Pegasus was once more rendered stuffed beyond his usual capacity and possessed a straining, creaking behemoth of a belly that rounded well above his shoulders in a makeshift horizon line. The dozing equine chuffed in pleasure as Panic had the roan press her muzzle once more the hero's taught underbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pegasus drifted off into unconsciousness, Panic transformed back into his devious blue self and called out to Pain so they could discuss what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what would they do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pain and Panic opted to allow the Pegasus to sleep on, while they planned for a large, impromptu meal to be readied in the morning. At the moment, the famed stallion was laying on his side; a crevice of fat running the length of his spine and rounding out in a swollen, softened rear. His dome of a belly extended a foot from his flanks and contracted with steady, rhythmic breaths. They would wait until the next morning to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic aided Pain gathering a veritable cornucopia of foods. Sweetened breads, hot chocolate, grapes, spiced delectables, and numerous other foods were gathered on a silver platter for the hero's enjoyment. Pain reverted into his chef's form as the sun began to rise, and Panic transformed once more into the spellbinding roan whose appearance caused an exceptional amount of intrigue and transfixion on Pegasus' part. As the winged equine stirred, he placed one hoof firmly against his softened chest and felt a downy wind sweep lightly over the plush surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the hero smiled as he was greeted by Panic's avatar which gazed flirtatiously back to him, while the residential chef scurried about in order to lay out another abundant feast. Pegasus moaned lightly as he struggled to right himself up, feeling his belly compress into gently rolls that added a curly texture to the usually smooth curve. His shoulders and ribs also contorted in a display of pudgy horse flesh, but eventually the white stallion managed to struggle and triumph over his ponderous middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he righted himself to a more dignified position, the bloated equine was greeted with the familiar sight of an ornate layout of various foods delicacies backed by the illustrious roan engineered by the deceptive Panic. He felt a faint pang of reluctance emanate through his bulging form, but one quick glance into the female horse's beseeching gaze and everything subsided to the usual eagerness to appease the mysterious figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach bite was accompanied by an affectionate nuzzle to his midriff, which provided bouncy resilience and texture thanks to the ever increasing volume of food accumulating within it. Pegasus felt his stretched middle grow tighter, and Panic's avatar began to indulge him in soothing, gently strokes with her nose that pressed lightly into the taught flesh and displaced his engorged middle in wide, shallow trenches. Pegasus moaned in delight from the euphoric sensations, while simultaneously taking on additional weight to accompany his slowly swelling stature. The crest on his back shivered with wobbling mannerisms as he reveled in the cyclical treatment of being stretched and then relieved by Panic's expert motions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ridiculously large pile of food dwindled to nothing more than crumbs, Pegasus' bulging side crawled higher into the air and formed a steeper, more prominent slope that angled itself proudly into his creased flanks and softened chest. He found his forelegs spread gently by the ample pressure exuding outward from the incredible influx of food, and he managed to wiggle one feebly in order to convey his stuffed, but sated state. As he forced the last portion of bread past his maw and felt his middle creak with the ensuing pressure, Panic settled the roan's gaze directly in front of his. The hero made to loll off once more into a stuffed unconsciousness, but Panic nudged and nipped him into standing position. The fattened horse moaned at the request, but rose altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered from the incredible weight curving beneath his padded spine, and stumbled a few steps before Panic set his roan into support mode and rested her trim figure against his taught one. With a wide eyed glance, he looked in wonder for a place to rest and was guided by the roan into another chamber of the apartment where an ornate fountain trickled lullingly into a wide, mosaic Roman bath. Pegasus realized the water would be perfect to alleviate the sagging heft of his midsection from his poor, overstuffed physique and was quick to enter the calming water. He sighed as the bubbles caressed his rounded side and began to ease the tightness into softness as he was greeted by the exceptional sensations and drifted into a hypnotic experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked to Panic's roan, the avatar was running through options and planning on how things would transpire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would they?</span></div></div>",

Not to mention Jumba and Pleakly going out on some intergalactic convention in space. So everyone was gone, expect for Stitch. Stitch had the house to himself. The reason why he wasn't in a.....travel mood lately. Nani didn't really trust Stitch by himself because he might wreck the house. But Lilo did trust Stitch and knowing even if he did made a mess, he would clean up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStitch has just got out of bed and he was pretty hungry. He went down to the kitchen to get some food from the fridge, only to find the fridge with chains and locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAAATTTTT?\" Stitch said seeing a locked fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a note on the fridge. Stitch read the note and it said:<br>\r\nFurball, don't even think about raiding the fridge. If you get hungry, there are a few bags of dog food. Nani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStitch wasn't too happy about the note. He then looked at the dog food and tried it. To him, it tasted like sawdust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck! Eek!\" Stitch said after eating the horrid food. He then look at the fridge again.<br>\r\n\"Bahhh! No lock can hold Stitch.\" Stitch said clawing at the locks. Usually Stitch can break anything, but these locks were still intake.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Stitch couldn't believe it. Then he looked at the P.S. of the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S: I had Jumba made special chains and locks that even you can't break. So good luck with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!\" Stitch yelled realizing that he was stuck with that sawdust to eat. \"What to do? What to do?\" Stitch had to think about what to do about food. Then, a certain cousin came to mind. \"Frenchfry!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't know Frenchfry, he is a cook-like experiment with a french accent and as well as a high class cook. He can practically make food out of nothing. The side effects to his food was massive bloating and not feeling full from eating. After a battle with Nani, he promised not to try to cook people anymore. Even know this, Stitch still called his cousin over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Stitch brought Frenchfry over and to Nani's Kitchen and explained his siuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can Frenchfry help Stitch out?\" Stitch asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course. I live to cook and serve.\" Frenchfry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenchfry started to spin like a tornada cooking at rapid speed to make breakfast for Stitch. He fried some eggs, made some hashbrowns, several stacks of bacon, and huge stacks of pancakes, waffles, and french toast (of course). He placed all the food on the table, ready to eat. It was enough food to feed a family of 10 and it was just for Stitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appeitee!\" Frenchfry said to Stitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStitch pretty much drooled down to the floor for 10 seconds. Then went straight for the food. Stitch started with a few slabs of bacon and enjoyed the fatty, salty taste. Next, he goes for the hash and eggs. Not even using a fork. Then he grab some maple syrup and poured it on top of the waffle, pancake and french toast stacks that were taller than he was. After he was done adding syrup, he attacked the stacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good.\" Stitch said eating the pancake stack. But as he has eating, he didn't realized that his stomach was starting to gain rapid amount of pudge. Frenchfry's food still had the same effect as before.</span></div></div>",

He remembers that Pleakly bloated up to the size of a room and Jumba according to his video diary that Jumba's belly swollen up to the size of his spaceship. But was anyone ever went past that. It seem crazy, but Stitch had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Frenchfry?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n\"How big can Stitch get from Frenchfry's cooking?\"<br>\r\n\"It dependz on how much I make, but other than that, nearly endless.\" Frenchfry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no limit to the weight someone can gain. They can bloat up from the size of house, to the size of a city. The idea kinda excited Stitch a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Let's put that to the test.\" Stitch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenchfry seem confused for a second, but he loves to cook and serve so he went for it. First, Frenchfry helped move Stitch outside of the house so he would have plenty of room and not get struck. He was struck at the door again for a while, but he got out and bounced a bit. After he stop bouncing, Frenchfry was ready for Stitch's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stitch would like dessert.\" Said Stitch. \"A cake. A BIIIIIIIIIG cake! Chocolate and with plenty of Frosting.\"<br>\r\n\"Oui!\" Frenchfry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrenchfry then did his tornado thing again and dash to the kitchen and back. He quickly worked on the large tower of cake. In a flash and with a few finishing touches, the cake was done. Man, what a cake it was. It was three large layers, all the same size. The cake was chocolate with vanilla and coconut frosting, and some blue icing. The cake was even a few inches taller than Stitch was. This made Stitch, once again drool out a pool of....drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetie!\" Frenchfry said.<br>\r\n\"Don't need to tell Stitch twice.\" Stitch said waddling over to the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands were too short because of his round body, so he just dove his head into the cake and eating away. Frenchfry was pretty surprised. He knew people loved his food, but not so much to not sweat about the bloating. Stitch ate most of the cake pretty fast since it was down to half of it left. Well, not for long. Stitch ate as if it was his last meal of something. After a short time, the cake was no more. But Stitch.....he was still the same size as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What gives?\" Stitch asking why he's still the big size he was last. But he didn't know that it was just a delayed reaction. The second he said that, his body started to rumble.<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Said Frenchfry who decided to take cover behind a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment, Stitch began to expand like no tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

The ring master had told the trainers that since dumbo was born they would need to add more food to be added as time went on as dumbo was growing. Dumbo was trying to eat as fast as he could before the other elephants came back for the night. By the time the other elephants were done half the food was gone so the trainer added more but forgot to lock the cage door. Dumbo had not gained enough to stop him from getting stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbo snuck out in the middle of the night and smelled the left over food from the circus that evening. None of the guards heard dumbo walk past the guard office. Dumbo smelt the food and quickly ran to eat it up before anyone else could. He found the food and it was still warm, dumbo stuffed his mouth and he just kept eating even if his stomach hurt. When all the food was gone he had doubled and weight but he still looked the same. He thought he would have grown bigger but he thought he had to eat more to grow. So he went o look for more hay and he did not have far to look it was just behind the elephant cage. He started to eat and move some back into the cage so he could not get caught stealing food. Dumbo finished moving the food in and closed the door, no one old know who took the food. Dumbo started to eat the food so he ate all he could and he was half the size of the other elephant and was fatter then any of the other elephants, but he was not happy with his size but he planned to eat more and become the worlds fattest elephant.</span></div></div>",

While one distracted dumbos mother the other two and prissy force feed dumbo till he could not eat anymore. \u00a0Dumbo had been stuffed to the weight of two elephants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbo was happy he did not have to do a thing, he just had to eat the other elephants did most of the work for him. The trainers came to get the elephants ready to perform and they were surprised to see how fat dumbo was he wasn't the smallest elephant they had anymore he was the fattest. The ringmaster was called to the elephants cage to see for him self. He thought that one of the elephants had broke loose but he was surprised to see the bigger, fatter dumbo. \u00a0The ringmaster was pleased to see that he had something new to show to the public that night. Prissy's plan had failed and she just got madder than ever. She had seen how much happier dumbo was since he had become fatter so she wanted to be bigger than him. She forced the other three elephant that had helped her fatten dumbo up to fatten her up. She was fed as much as she could eat, but she was still a third of dumbos weight. While the circus was amazed at dumbos weight prissy was gaining on dumbos weight she was more than half dumbos weight but that night. Dumbo and his mother and a few of the elephants slept together while prissy was being force fed all night. By morning prissy had grow to dumbos size and weight, she was happy with her new size. Dumbo woke to a surprise to see prissy equal to his size and weight. He like seeing another elephant as big as he was. When dumbo was small prissy never really like him being around her, but now that he was as big as her she did not mind being around him. The ring master came around to check in with the elephants care and had seen that now he has the two fattest elephants in the world he could not be happier.</span></div></div>",

The employees of the shelter quickly realized that Buster wouldn't get along with any of the other dogs and quickly learned to isolate him from the other dogs.  Buster wanted companionship but realized that he only knew how to manipulate and control other dogs.  He grew cynical; he didn't eat, play, or walk.  But he always eventually ate.  His nature, his drive for food was still a goal.  He didn't have the life of luxury some dogs had; nor did he think he ever would.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster might not have been the first dog to hear the car pull up, but he certainly did.  He tried to suppress hope, but to no avail; deep down, he knew that he wanted to be adopted.  He suppressed his optimism and let out a chuckle.  Then he saw her.  She appeared to be a rich woman with a rich husband.  She was dressed simply, but elegantly and her husband dressed similarly for a man.  They were both thin, but with a miasma of cigarettes that made Buster's nose crinkle a tad.  He watched the couple guardedly, with intense suspicion but made no overt aggressions.  He made no pretenses of cuteness because he knew he wasn't competitive with puppies.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few passes by, the woman finally noticed Buster and eyed him with curiosity.  The pound woman explained how Buster fared with other dogs, but the woman was having none of it, insisting that she wanted a fierce dog to protect her from potential criminal-types.  Buster still made no signs of aggression, only weariness and caution.  The woman seemed to like Buster instantly, so she summoned her husband to look at Buster.  He elicited the same response his wife had made, and they decided to adopt Buster.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He seems like a big strong dog,\" Sherry, the woman who had adopted Buster, said, seeming to admire, but not fuss over Buster in a way Buster found genuine and soothing.  He knew instantly that this human was his type; and her husband was a detached, calm, rational man who was deliberate, firm, and consistent in the same way his wife seemed admiring.  Buster liked him too.  The only criticism the man, called William, had for Buster was, \"he's a bit gangly.  I always imagined a guard dog being a bit more stocky.\"  Sherry nodded at this but replied, \"True, but we have remedies for being skinny, Bill.  That's not difficult at all.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The house where the car stopped was a medium-large house with a cast-iron gate and a victorian design.  Buster had no idea where he was.  It was obviously some suburb, but Buster hadn't a clue where.  It didn't really matter to Buster.  Buster was housebroken and new very rudimentary commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\"  But he was otherwise untrained.  </span></div></div>",

Paul was a tall, thin child who was scholarly but immensely kind.  Buster found James more irritating, loud, and adventurous.  Buster could live with that.  But Buster heard another sound: the dropping and clatter of food pellets into a bowl.  It was repeated a couple more times before Buster heard the sound of the bowl scraping the floor.  He ambled down the stairs, still cautious about his new family, but immediately went into the kitchen, where he first smelt the other dog.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster began to growl before William smacked Buster on the head and told him to stop growling.  Buster whimpered but obeyed.  The other dog was already eating when Buster walked in.  Buster stopped and waited.  The other dog was apparently a German Shepherd or Belgian Malinois, probably the former; but he, Buster knew instinctively the other dog was a male even before he had confirmed, seemed different from every dog Buster had ever known.  Buster had known German Shepherds, but none had been this large.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, the other dog finished his bowl, looked up, and saw Buster.  \"Oh,\" he began sheepishly, \"oh excuse me, how rude of me.  You must be the newcomer here.  I'm sorry, well, this is inconvenient.  I'm sorry, my name is Clarence,\" the German Shepherd introduced himself thus and sat down gingerly, like it was a mild discomfort to sit.  \"Yeah, um, call me Buster,\" Buster replied, taken aback by the apologies he had just heard, \"Do you think we could get more food?\"  Clarence chuckled and beamed, \"I like your thinking.  Let me show you how.\"  He started barking, and in a couple of minutes, Paul had come in and refilled the bowl.  This time, Buster drained the bowl, \"I was famished,\" Buster grinned sheepishly.  He was no longer ravenous and was about to walk off when Clarence called him back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where are you going?  Aren't you still hungry?\" the large German shepherd asked with a bewildered look.  \"Can we get more?\" Buster asked incredulously.  \"I usually get seconds, thirds, and on occasion, fourths,\" came the reply after a pause.  After a chorus of barking, James came and filled the bowl but stayed in the kitchen. When Clarence had finished the bowl, James took it and filled it again.  Buster started his own second bowl with the same zeal he had stsrted his first bowl with, but only got three quarters through it and only barely managed to finish it, having been put almost into a food coma by rating that much.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0James filled the bowl a couple of more times before he felt Clarence lie down next to him.  Buster dozed for what seemed to be a while before he felt Clarence nudge him.  \"Come on, the humans are eating.\"  Buster was furious at Clarence for his interrupting Buster's sleep; he had no idea why Clarnence would do this.  \"Why do you care?\" Buster asked, thoroughly irritated.  \"Have you ever had human food?\" Clarence asked.  When Buster shook his head, Clarence replied, \"it's to kill for.  Come on.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The humans were indeed just beginning to eat.  Buster nestled between Paul and James while Clarence perched between William and Sherry.  James was quite generous with his food, Paul was not so much.  But it seemed that every other bite James slipped food to Buster.  Human food really was to kill for, Buster discovered.  The morsels of everything James and Paul dropped were seemingly divine.  Buster had never believed in a higher power than himself, but now he absolutely wanted to. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clarence got lucky, but his share wasn't nearly as lucrative as Buster's share; and Clarence seemed disappointed afterwards.  Buster had a small suspicion that perhaps he had overextended himself, but he immediately dismissed the thought.  He would eat less the next night, he thought to himself.  </span></div></div>",

One day, Buster plucked up the courage to ask Clarence a question, \"So what was your life like before you came here?\"  Clarence, who had been trying to groom himself, looked up, and frowned, \"What do you mean?  Except for a time that I don't well remember as a very young puppy, I've lived here all my life, according to Sherry and William, all four years of it.  Why? What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster proceeded to tell Clarence about his old gang, their adventures, and the life he had led before the pound.  \"Then,\" he concluded, \"William and Sherry picked me up at the pound and the rest is history as we know it.\"  Clarence nodded, but kept a pensive tone, \"I much prefer life here, where I'm fed and loved.  I dislike change and disruption.\"  Buster appreciated his friend's response, but wished Clarence had understood his situation better.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clarence went back to cleaning himself for a little while before he asked Buster, \"Hey, Buster, can you scratch my back?\"  To Buster, this seemed like an odd request, not malignant, merely like a tomato and peanut butter sandwich odd.  Buster hestitantly obliged.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To Buster, Clarence seemed soft, but not because his hair was soft, if anything, it was bristly, but becuase it seemed that his skin gave way to pressure far more easily than Buster's own skin did.  Buster did think, however, that his own skin had become more soft lately; perhaps it was a result of being an inside dog.  Not that it much mattered, Buster thought to himself, but Clarence seemed bigger than Buster was, the latter thought to himself.  But when they stood next to each other, they were the same height, Buster even thought that he was a tad taller.  But Buster observed Clarence more and tried to deduce the cause of their differences.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster watched as Clarence stood up.  Clarence appeared more rounded than Buster, but not in the same way Buster was round.  When Clarence stood, his abdomen appeared cylindrical, but with little rolls of skin jiggling slightly as he walked, and when he sat, those little folds merged into bigger rolls.  Buster had no idea what caused this.  He had never seen anything like this on any dog before.  Buster looked at himself, and was surprised to see that the very distinct hourglass shape he had once had had grown less pronounced, an effect he attributed to being an indoor dog.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was the only difference that Buster could determine was different between his form and Clarence's.  \"I was curious,\" Buster queried Clarence later that day, \"do you like exploring the neighborhood?\"  Clarence turned and replied, \"\u2026</span></div></div>",

Clarence seemed to agree because he exhorted Buster, \"Come on, let's go see the neighborhood!\"  Although it was technically illegal, no one patrolled the neighborhood looking for dogs without leashes.  Also, Buster realized, he had a collar, with his name and address on it; so if he got lost, people would know where to return him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clarence squeezed through the doggie door with a huff, and Buster followed afterward.  \"Come on, let me show you Dave's house.\"  Buster had no idea who Dave was, but he sensed that Dave had a personality similar to Clarence's.  A few houses down the block, Clarence stopped and declared, \"Here we are!\"  Buster, however, couldn't help but notice how Clarence's voice sounded a touch labored, like he was almost panting.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clarence led the way to Dave's back yard.  When they reached the back door, Clarence called in, \"Dave!  I hope you don't mind that we're here.\"  Then, Buster heard scrambling of a dog's nails on a hard floor, \"Give him a moment; he's an old man; so he gets a bit stiff.\"  About a minute later, a head with black hair as long as Clarence's sticks its head through the little doggie door.  \"Dave!\" Clarence calls, to which the dog head responds, \"What, Clarence? I was taking a nap.  Oh, hello there,\" Dave apologized, only then noticing Buster, \"and you are?\"  After Buster had introduced himself, Dave welcomed them inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster recognized Dave to be a flat-coated retriever, but only just.  When he walked, Dave's midsection swayed from sighed to side in a rhythmic motion with his stride.  And when he sat, Dave's midsection folded into a moderate-sized pad of flesh.  Dave didn't walk very far because his food bowl was only a few paces away from the door.  But it was full of the same food Buster and Clarence were accustomed to eating.  A woman sat in the next room with the noise box on in the background.  Dave offered his guests something to eat.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite having eaten breakfast not long before, Buster decided to offer to Clarence the first go, \"I can always get more if you want,\" Dave said nonchalantly but pleasantly.  Clarence decided to eat first, so Dave called in the woman from the next room with a short bark.  When the woman came in, she seemed surprised to see Buster, but refilled the bowl and watched the dogs eat in turns, even feeding Dave little bits of cold cuts and candies when she wanted to.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having gorged themselves, Clarence and Buster decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Clarence squeezed through the doggie door out of Clarence's house and Buster followed.  Buster turned and watched as Dave tried to squeeze through the doggie door.  But despite his best efforts, Dave couldn't squeeze through the doggie door.  Eventually, he stopped trying and started panting, in full view of Clarence and Buster.  Eventually, the woman who had fed them came and opened the door for Dave, who hobbled down the stairs, mozied over to where Buster and Clarence had stopped, and sat with a dull thump and a pant.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bye, guys, sorry I'm not in the shape I used to be.  I'm afraid getting around has become more of a hassle lately, but good night!\" he said all this with small pants interspersed, as if walking that far had winded him.  Buster and Clarence said their goodbyes, leaving the monstrous dog panting and sitting where he was.  And when Buster glanced over his shoulder, he saw Dave exert himself trying to heave himself up.  Buster thought it was sad that such a magnificent dog should have to end like this.  But he knew that such things were inevitable and that Buster was just a bit earlier than some.  That happened with bigger dogs.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner came in due course; and Buster's selfishness allowed him to sit between Sherry and James, the two most generous givers of food.  And William had even brought home a burger and fries for Clarence and Buster, in addition to their usual food and table scraps.  Buster ate with a zeal he had never known before.  He was bored, and his only entertainment was food, so he ate more.  Before long, when Buster stood, he had a boxy appeance similar to Clarence's.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Buster was bored; he still longed to roam around and meet new dogs.  Clarence only knew Dave, but Buster got quickly bored of just those two for company.  So he went out looking for other dogs on his own.  There were other dogs in the neighborhood, but very few were off leashes and roaming around.  And to Buster's disappointment, none of them was a female.  Buster dejectedly walked toward Dave's house.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, Buster saw another dog not on a leash.  It was probably a golden retriever, but Buster wasn't quite sure.  Buster did notice, however, that the other dog had the same stocky build that Buster himself had.  The square abdomen with no tuck-up, the soft flanks with no visible ribs.  \"Good morning,\" the other dog began, everything was so formal here, Buster thought to himself, so pretentious.  When Buster realized that the other dog was walking in the same direction he was, Buster struck up a conversation. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So,\" Buster began, \"where are you headed?\"  The retriever thought for a moment and replied, \"I guess Dave's house.\"  Buster grinned, informed the retriever that he was heading there too before the other dog looked up suddenly, \"Excuse me, I'm Gary, I live right down the street.\"  After Buster had introduced himself, the pair walked in silence for a moment before Gary stopped to sniff a pile of grass.  \"Sorry, thought that I smelled a cat, nevermind.\"  Buster then heard a faint sound like nails on a pavement.  He turned and saw Clarence running, no, Buster thought, bumbling, to try and catch up.  Despite having run less than 100 yards, Clarence was struggling to catch his breath; and when he recovered, he panted, \"Sorry, I haven't run like that in ages.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Buster felt sorry for Clarence for a bit before the trio was heading to Dave's to get food.  Dave must have heard them approaching because he got the woman they all knew to let him outside.  But when Dave saw them, he looked worried: \"Guys, I can't feed all of you, sorry.  I don't have enough food.  But I do know of a place where I'm sure we can get enough for us all.  There's a deli near here, just a couple blocks that way.  I can show it to you if you want.  I used to, before my masters got their nanny for their kids, go down there quite frequently.  Now, with my joints the way they are, it's too much effort.  I guess I haven't been there in six months to a year.  Yeah, it's been a while.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that, Dave\u2026</span></div></div>",

The dog that gets past every obstacle, beats all the odds, and fight crimes like no other. His show was like a typical serial, being told in short exciting episodes, and always ending in an exciting cliffhanger to have audience come back to see next episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have watched it for several seasons, and as the pups grow older more and more of them started to see the \"cheap factor\" of the show. They started to get a learn on what \"bad acting\", \"bad scripting\", and \"bad production\" was, and suddenly the show didn't seem that good to them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had made most of them definitely feel \"to old for this show\" was the latest season's storyline. It was told that while trying to stop a crazy scientist from testing his new \"experimental ray\" on a tied up woman, Thunderbolt had been hit by it instead and ended up being...FAT! For the rest of the season Thunderbolt will have to do his best at trying to be a hero while carrying around all of his extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor many of the Dalmatian puppies this was just \"to stupid\" for them to watch, but for one young Dalmatian this was an eye-opener of a season, and that pup's name was Rolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolly had always been a very pudgy pup, and for most times he felt like he it was a disadvantages, and that he was never able to do anything great. But this new season was showing him a whole new perspective on what fat dogs can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of his brothers and sisters thought he was weird for still watching the show when it \"wasn't even trying anymore\" to them, but he didn't care. Fat dogs had someone they could look up to and be inspired by, and that dog was Thunderbolt.</span></div></div>",

Even thought he looked very fat on TV Thunderbolt actually was still his slim action self, but he was now wearing a fat-suit when doing his acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a comfortable thing to wear, since it made him feel just like he was carrying all that extra weight, and it also affected his movement a little. It took him about a couple of hours to get it on, and just a little less time to get it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his personal dressing room Thunderbolt took his time to have some food and water, and to just lay down and rest for a moment. Being in serial during the sixties was a lot of hard working if you wanted to become a big star, and it had to come with some \"lesser good moments\" as well. Because the truth was that Thunderbolt (Just like most of the Dalmatians) thought that this was a very stupid idea for the show. It's scripted to only be throughout this season and then have him changed back to his normal self again in the last episode, but he was already starting to get sick of it right now halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for me getting my salary I don't know how much more of this I could take.\" Thunderbolt thought to himself, as a crewmember entered his room to tell him he was about to be back for recording. Thunderbolt tried to get up on his own but found the suit keeping him down on his back, so he had the crew member helping him to roll over so he could get on all four. \"Another thing this stupid thing does to make things harder for me.\" He though as he got himself to the sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should the story go now?</span></div></div>",

The veterinarian had said that Thunderbolt would never walk normally again.  After five years of television screening, just as Thunderbolt was reaching the peak of his ratings, this had happened.  A set man had had some Jack Daniel's on the job and had knocked over a light, which had fallen on Thunderbolt's leg and had crushed it.  Thunderbolt only knew, however, that his leg hurt miserably.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was discharged, there was no media coverage, no attention, no praise, just quiet, which Thunderbolt appreciated if he was honest with himself.  When Thunderbolt's handler had phoned the studio, the manager said that he would ask around and see if anyone wanted to adopt Thunderbolt.  After a few days of no response, Thunderbolt's handler decided to put up an add in <i>The Times</i> to see if someone wanted a former dog television star.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having phoned <i>The Times</i>, Thunderbolt's handler waited for a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger was looking through the morning paper catching up on how Labor was doing in the polls when he stumbled into the classified section and saw a small advertisement that caught his eye.  \"Anita, dear,\" he called, \"Anita, when you have a moment, would you come see?\"  When he got a response, he went back to looking at the advertisement that read thus, \"Former dog televison actor in need of good home.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Anita appeared, Roger handed her the paper and pointed out the advertisement.  \"It looks like Thunderbolt\" was all she said.  When her husband told her that it was, she looked up and immediately responded, \"Oh, no, we can't afford another dog, Roger.  They'll have to start living outside.\"  When Roger pointed out that most of them did anyway, Anita huffed and replied, \"I suppose that I really can't argue with you, can I?  But I expect a favor later.\"  When Roger kissed her, car-key already in hand, she knew the answer.  No, there was no reasoning wither her husband when he set his mind, which fortunately wasn't too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Roger arrived at the address mentioned, he realized perhaps that he should have left more than a name and message that he was coming for Thunderbolt with the woman, but it was too late for that now, he realized.  It was a shabby part of London, a housing project, formerly called a slum, which Roger nearly called it.  Perhaps it wouldn't be too terrible, he thought.  He went to the designated address and heard the din of raucous children inside.  Roger found raucous children distasteful and grimaced at the thought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, he saw a woman carrying an apparently three-year-old child in her arms.  She looked tired and disgruntled.  \"What is it ya want?\" she spat in the same derisive tone that Roger was hearing all around him.  \"Hi,\" Roger began, \"I'm here to pay for Thunderbolt.  Do I have the right address?\"  When the woman nodded, ahe set the child down and grabbed a leash and pulled a limping dog with a cone on him out of her house, which smelled worse than the dog himself did.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger picked up the dog and set him gently in his car and drove back home.</span></div></div>",

The car door opened and he smelled vaguely familiar smells of dogs whom he sensed that he had once met.  A man, a gentle man, based on how carefully he held Thunderbolt, carried him up to a house, a rather large house which smelled of dogs, who were now barking madly.  \"Quiet!\" Roger shouted at them, and they all ceased barking immediately.  Roger fumbled with his pocket and finally managed to extract some keys, put them in the door, open the door, and set Thunderbolt down carefully.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The room was still eerily silent.  All of the dogs, every single one Thunderbolt saw, was a Dalmatian, all adults now.  One in particular, however, Thunderbolt recognized.  \"Are you,\" the Dalmatian asked, stultified seemingly by Thunderbolt's arrival, \"Thunderbolt?  The actor from that show, what was it called?  Anyway, are you Thunderbolt?\"  Thunderbolt lowered his head in shame, \"I was.  but now I have this,\" Thunderbolt gestured at his caste, \"it's untreatable.\"  \"Well, anyway,\" the Dalmatian continued, \"I'm Patch, and these are my parents,\" gesturing to Pongo and Perdita, \"and my 98 siblings.  Welcome to our home.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When it seemed that everyone had forgotten about him, Thunderbolt took a snooze.  But when he awoke, the living room was empty except for one Dalmatian.  \"Goo' afternoon,\" Thunderbolt yawned to the Dalmatian who lay down a few feet away.  The Dalmatian stood, meandered a bit closer, close enough to have a quiet conversation, and inquired, \"What brings you here?  I don't mean to be rude, but why aren't you still a movie star?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt chuckled, \"Did you hear me say that this can't be healed?\"  When the other dog shook his head and asked pardon for talking about such sensitive matters, Thunderbolt chuckled and looked at the other Dalmatian, \"Why aren't you playing with your other siblings?  Don't worry about me.  I'll be just fine on my own.  Go run around.\"  Rolly let out a sigh, \"Do you wanna know why they call me 'Rolly'?  It's because I'm fat.  I've been this way all my life.  I get tired way more easily than my siblings do, I can't keep up with them, and they tease, which makes me want to drown out the teasing with food.  Never mind that I am just as smart, if not smarter, better at debating, or better at arguing.  They call me fat, everyone laughs, and I get ignored by everyone.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe you should try to lose some weight.  I mean, you aren't exactly thin,\" Thunderbolt suggested, trying to be helpful.  But Rolly only gave the sarcastic laugh that says that he didn't actually think someone has said something funny, only so dumb as to elicit a chuckle.  \"I'm sorry,\" he sighed, \"When I said that I always was the way that I am now, that wasn't quite true.  For six months I lost weight and kept it off; but the fat jokes never stopped or even slowed.  They've always come in the same number.  So losing weight wasn't the solution.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt was impressed, \"Well, why didn't you keep it off?  You just proved them right; you just quit.\"  \"You know,\" Thunderbolt said, thoroughly demoralized but having an idea dawn on him, \"I think I have a way of dealing with these little buggers who won't leave you alone.\"</span></div></div>",

Rolly explained that the only way to feed all the dogs was to free feed them in a large trough of food in the kitchen.  No other dog or human was inside on such a beautiful summer day, so Thunderbolt went in and ate hismself full of dog food.  He hadn't let in Rolly on his plan, but soon enough Thunderbolt was sure that Rolly would catch on if he were as smart as claimed he was.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When everyone came in, Thunderbolt hobbled near, but not next to Rolly to get to the food line.  The crowd allowed Thunderbolt to eat whatever he liked before it returned to its shoving.  Rolly, who had been smart and had waited til just before and just after everyone had left before he gorged himself on the food in the trough.  Now thoroughly full, Thunderbolt hobbled over and plopped down in his previous seat.  And the crowd got down to talking.  Rolly and Patch, Thunderbolt noticed, were in a heated, well, Thunderbolt noted, only Patch was upset.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tension finally reached the point where Patch yelled, \"Why am I even talking to you, you overgrown self-righteous prick!\"  Everyone who had not been watching the conversation turned and laughed and jeered.  \"Perhaps,\" Thunderbolt interjected in the jeers with a raised voice, \"when one resorts to name-calling in an argument, one has already lost the argument.\"  Rolly didn't smirk, but he smiled a bit for just a second, just enough for Thunderbolt and no one else to see it before he had smothered it again, the best thing he could have done before he glared for a momentat Thunderbolt, which everyone but Thunderbolt thought was Rolly's first reaction.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thunderbolt, I didn't need your help, but thank you.\"  He stormed out of the room, and Thunderbolt didn't follow him.  Later, however, Thunderbolt found Rolly stuffing his face at the trough with no one around but the two of them.  Thunderbolt followed suit; and when Both finished, Thunderbolt got down to business, \"That was wonderful acting and the best amateur show that I've ever seen.\"  Rolly walked out gingerly with his hips swaying back and forth before he gestured for Thunderbolt to follow him.  \"It's not safe there.  People can hear you.  Come to the barn.  There's old food there too.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly and Thunderbolt were both out of breath when they reached the barn, albeit for different reasons.  Rolly opened the door and walked over to a closet and grabbed and swallowed a mouthful of oats from a horse feed bag and quickly lay down on the dirt floor.  \"I'm glad that you read into my ploy.  I guess that being an actor helped.  Thanks, though.  Maybe now people will respect your opinion because it disagrees with mine.  That was beautiful though.  Are you ok?\"  When Thunderbolt had nodded, Rolly offered him the oats, which were a tad stale but still wholesome and tasty.  He glad ate a few mouthfuls.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But there was something else that I wanted to tell you,\" Thunderbolt added before they left back to the house, \"I'm trying to help you remove the stigma from your head by trying to gain a little weight myself.  I'm old, I've had fame, what good am I anyway.  I'm\u2026\" he never would say disabled.  \"Injured?\" Rolly tried, and Thunderbolt liked it, \"injured,\" he finished.  Rolly chuckled sadly before he retorted, \"Look, sir, are you sure about this?  Mine was a lonely and sad life before this.  Do you really want to be ostrasized forever?  You're a former movie star; go be popular with my family, don't stay here with the sad, fat loser like me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt nodded, \"Too damn bad, kiddo.  I'm tired of living like a twig and eating like one.  I want to be free and eat freely.\"</span></div></div>",

I hate to break this to you, but it's best that we tell you the straight truth.  And you may want to manage Thunderbolt's weight, it could become a complication if gets too big.  He's fine now; I understand why he has gained a few pounds from being unused to being sedentary, but he should slim down soon, so just watch him a bit and make sure he does.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger listened, thanked the doctor for his advice, and walked Thunderbolt to the car to go home.  At least this time, Thunderbolt noted, he didn't have a cone on and wasn't woozy when he left the vet's office.  Roger looked at the bill and face-palmed himself: this was why he didn't too often come to the veterinarian. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back at his home, Thunderbolt waited until everyone had left the kitchen by spying on it from his spot in the living room before he mozied over to the trough and ate a normal meal.  The six weeks had passed slowly, with eating, sleeping, and talking being the only things he could do.  He could barely go outside to relieve himself before Roger dragged him back inside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, however, he had a limp, which made his polite refusal to play seem plausible.  He would sometimes wander with Rolly to the barn for the seemingly endless supply of oats that satisfied Thunderbolt when he didn't want to risk being seen eating or wanted to seem like he wanted to play but couldn't.  With a bit of relish, however, Thunderbolt noticed that he had started only now to begin losing his movie-star's physique.  His ribs didn't show when he turned as much as he could, which was less now than it was with his normal physique thanks to the small roll of flesh that formed when he tried to chase his tail.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These were the subtle things that Thunderbolt noticed were happening to himself.  Of course, Thunderbolt marvelled, he looked nothing like Rolly, who had a barrel-shaped appearance and a \"pigeon chest,\" as humans called it.  Little dimples of flesh formed at his haunces when he sat; to Thunderbolt, Rolly looked like an adorable puppy still, despite obviously being three years old.  Thunderbolt pondered for a second that he was, in fact, six-years-old and was middle-aged.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The barn was situated on a little hill that always nearly caused Thunderbolt to laugh when it caused Rolly to begin to pant simply by going up it.  He chuckled to himself; he was only a bit winded because he was an injured old man.  Rolly was a healthy young man.  \"Here we are,\" Rolly exhaled after drawing a deep breath.  Thunderbolt was amused by the young man's attempts not to sound winded, which were obviously not working.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, how many bags of oats are left?\" Thunderbolt asked Rolly, who answered, \"I estimate 1 or 2.\"  Thunderbolt knew immediately that this was a lie, despite Rolly's unchanged tone.  And then Thunderbolt heard it: footsteps.  Someone knew about their hiding spot and was spying on them.  \"Excuse me,\" Thundebolt said, \"I need to relieve myself; I'll be right back.\"  Rolly nodded, understanding the not-too-subtle hint Thunderbolt was leaving him.  Thunderbolt knew exactly where the noise had come from, so he went to that side of the barn and found\u2026</span></div></div>",

If he knows you're spying on him, he'll think that I'm a spy.  I want him to lose weight, but I need you to not blow my cover.  Please, just go; and don't tell anyone.  Rumor is a horrible monster.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, Patch left in a bit of a hurry.  Thunderbolt rushed back inside.  \"Look,\" Thunderbolt stammered to Rolly, \"we have to go soon.  I don't trust your brother not to blabber.\"  But Rolly looked calm, \"Ok, but we have to eat this entire bag of oats or else they'll have evidence.\"  Thunderbolt agreed until he looked at the bag, which was still 3/4 full.  \"I'm quite hungry,\" Thunderbolt muttered to himself, and the two dogs quickly began to devour the contents of the bag.  Thunderbolt began to worry that the troop was coming.  Only a quarter of the bag remained, but Thunderbolt's stomach already felt distended.  Rolly, however, managed to fit the remaining oats into his stomach.  Thunderbolt knocked over the trash can and quickly stuffed the bag and the spilled contents back in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When that was finished, Rolly scrambled with the lock until he had locked the door to the feed room.  Both dogs sat panting for a moment before they heard the playful noises of Patch and his brothers, who seemed to be scouting the land playfully, but Thunderbolt sensed why Patch had really come, and he sensed that Rolly knew.  Rolly was sleeping when Patch opened the door and called, \"Hey, does either of you two want to come and scout the farm with us?  Mr. Thunderbolt, if your leg hurts, we don't want to exacerbate that pain.  Rolly, do you wanna come?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly, who had only heard his brother's story hazily, stretched lying down and replied, \"No, thank you, though.  I was fine talking with Mr. Thunderbolt's company.\"   Patch laughed menacingly, \"Ha, that isn't true.  You were eating oats and sleeping in the barn.  Don't lie!\"  \"Boys,\" Thunderbolt interjected, \"it's not nice to lie about someone like that.  He was just talking to me.  I know, Patch, that your overheard discussion of ours sounded nefarious, but Rolly was doing no such thing, only daydreaming, in his usual way, that he had the oats that we know are in the back closet of the barn.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Patch looked thoroughly beaten and left before he could show it to his siblings.  \"Thank you, sir,\" Rolly intoned sleepily, before sleeping off his oats.  \"Rolly,\" Thunderbolt whispered, \"return later tonight.  Make sure Patch sees you go.  Don't eat any of the oats, but scratch at the locked door; and if he reveals himself, appear startled to see him.\"  Rolly nodded before his eyes glazed over and the two of them dozed off together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That night, Rolly made sure that everyone was asleep, including Thunderbolt, before he began his plan.  Patch had almost fallen perfectly for his plan: he slept near the back door away from other dogs, he was a light sleeper, and he opened his eyes just enough to let Rolly know that he had seen him.  But Rolly didn't show Patch enough of his head to let him see that he had been noticed, but he indeed had been noticed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly plodded over to the barn in the cool autumnizing air.  When he got there, he weezed and forced open the door, leaving it open a crack when he closed it.  It made too much noise to close it all the way.  At the door for the oats, he did exactly as Thunderbolt had told him to, he whined and scratched at the door, pretending to hope that someone would open it for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly could almost feel Patch watching him.  And then Patch made the fatal mistake: he rearranged his position and knocked the door.  Rolly spun around, embarrassed that his brother was so clumsy and stupid.  \"Patch?\" Rolly said in feigned surprise, \"What are you doing here?\"  \"That's my questionto you,\" Patch spat back at Rolly.  \"I'm sorry,\" Rolly whined, \"did I disturb you with my futile wishes?  If I did, then please excuse my lack of deftness.  You know that I've always been a bit clumsy.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Patch scowled, shook his head, and traisped off to bed, too tired or perhaps to dumb to see through the ploy.  How was this his brother?  Rolly asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next morning, when the two were alone and no one was spying on them, Thunderbolt whispered, \"how many bags of oats are there?\"  This time, Rolly replied, \"I estimate forty or fifty, which should last us through the winter.  After that, I have no idea what we'll do.\"  Thunderbolt nodded, appreciative of the honesty. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But rumor was indeed a horrible monster; so Perdita, having full confidence in Patch, heard his report that Rolly had found a secret stash of oats in the barn.</span></div></div>",

Do you want me to find him and bring him to you?\" Pongo asked tepidly.  \"I would appreciate it,\" was his wife's steely reply.  Pongo rushed off to find his son, who did seem to disappear often.  Pongo found Rolly dozing with Thunderbolt in the barn, about which Pongo had heard a strange rumor recently reagrding Rolly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo nosed Rolly, \"Come on, son; your mother wants to see you.\"  Rolly blinked slowly, rolled himself over with what Pongo could only describe as with a touch of difficulty before getting up with a stretch.  \"Are you ok, Rolly?\" Pongo worriedly asked his son who chuckled and responded, \"Sorry, I'm tired; I guess I didn't sleep well last night. I sometimes get up slowly to stretch if that's what you're referring to.  Mom asked me about it too.  It helps me limber up. \"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo shrugged: Rolly's behavior was nothing like his own, but this was just a minor idiosyncrasy that was well within observed behavior.  Pongo trotted ahead to not keep wis wife waiting, but Rolly seemed to struggle to keep up with his own father, who was an 8-year-old Dalmatian, a rather old man outrunning a young man.  Something was strange, Pongo noted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Pongo got back to Perdita, Rolly seemed out of breath and sat with a thump and panted before he struggled to ask, \"You wanted to see me, Mother?\"  Perdita looked a bit shaken: her husband was only breathing slightly heavier than he usually did and quickly recovered.  But Rolly\u2026seemed to live up to his name.  When he sat, folds of fat protruded from his abdomen, making a small indent like a reversed hour-glass shape.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perdita had no idea where to begin, \"Rolly, are you ok?\". Rolly shook off the question with a laugh before he scoffed, \"Mother, you know that I've never been much for exercise.  Why are so surprised?  Father has always liked exercise.  He still beats Patch at races sometimes.\"  Perdita did see Rolly's point there, amazed at how insightful her son could be.  \"Rolly, Patch brought me a rumor that I was hoping that you could disspell: have you been eating oats from the barn?\"  Rolly laughed, shaking the rolls of flesh on his sides, \"Yes, mother, I walk through a locked door and eat oats!  I wish.  You know me so well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not appreciating the sarcasm but appreciating the answer, Perdita dismissed him.  \"You know,\" Pongo meandered, \"I saw Thunderbolt in the barn too, and he looked like Rolly.\"  Perdita turned, \"What does that mean?\"  she asked, sensing what he meant but wanting to confirm.  \"He looks a bit\u2026heavy, no?\"  Perdita considered and stated, \"Perhaps he does; but he's not our son.  Besides, he's old and crippled, of course he's going to go a bit soft.\"  Pongo was amazed that his usually discrete wife had failed to pick up on his implications.  But he decided to let it go.  Now was not the time for an argument.  Pongo knew that his wife was planning a way to deal with their portly son.  </span></div></div>",

Thunderbolt turned, a bit surprised to see a visitor, \"Good afternoon, Pongo, what brings you here?\"  Pongo replied with something about how he had seen Thunderbolt exercising and was wondering how he was doing in his recovery.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not much has changed,\" Thunderbolt sighed.  Pongo was frequently \"just curious\", so Thunderbolt was surprised when Pongo continued, \"except your weight, that is.\"  Thunderbolt couldn't tell whether Pongo had been joking, so he let out a half-hearted laugh.  \"You're right, I guess.  I had suspected as much, but I wanted someone else to confirm it.  I had so many sycophants when I was a star.  I never could tell who was being honest with me.  I don't have to worry about that with you, I see.  Thanks,\" Thunderbolt sighed a fake sigh of resignation but was secretly elated that someone else had noticed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once again, Thunderbolt expected the conversation to die or switch topics, but was bewildered when Pongo awkwardly interposed with, \"Too many oats, huh?\"  Once more unsure of whether Pongo's comment was meant as a joke, Thunderbolt again responded in the same way, \"So, you've heard those rumors too, I see.  No, I'm afraid Rolly and my own boredom had too much influence on my wasteline.  There's so much food in the trough; it's amazing really.\"  Pongo nodded and got to his main point, \"You say Rolly influenced you in some way?  How?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt chuckled, \"If you haven't noticed, your son Rolly enjoys food as much as you enjoy Perdita.  But as I said, my own boredom more than anything caused me to eat.  There are no accessible oats, by the way.  And Rolly just enjoys being in the barn away from the noise of the house and yard.  And I'm trying to lose weight again.\"  Pongo kept pressing, however, \"You seem to have a lot of sway over Rolly.  Perdita is worried about him; could you perhaps influence him to adopt your dietary wish to lose weight?\"  Thunderbolt smiled, \"I'll try, but you overestimate how much influence I have over him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo smiled, seemingly satisfied with the result, and walked away.  Thunderbolt went back to exercising; so he went longer than usual to look like he was committed to losing weight.  But as soon as he was done, he immediately found Rolly, who was sleeping in the barn.  \"Rolly,\" Thunderbolt whispered, \"we should probably talk soon.\"  Rolly perked up from a half-awake trance, \"when and where?\"  Rolly yawned, stretching and rolling over slowly.  \"How about at the living room in an hour?\"  Rolly nodded and drifted back off to sleep; Rolly was a lazy dog, Thunderbolt thought to himself.  That was fine, he had nothing better to do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The living room was quiet at this time of the day when everyone was outside playing and relaxing, so Thunderbolt and Rolly were alone in the living room.  \"So, Thunderbolt,\" Rolly began, nervous to get to the point, \"what's up?\"  Thunderbolt sighed,\"Rolly, your parents are worried about you.  They think that you ought to lose weight, and they think that I'm on their side.  Never forget, and I mean never, that I am always unwaveringly on your side.  When we are alone, I'll always be honest; so remember that too.  I think we should, to maintain our fa\u00e7ades, have you lose a bit of weight before you regain it?  Does that sound good?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly paused for a moment, appearing to weigh his options, \"I think that it serves our strategic interest well.  I agree for now.\"  Thunderbolt nodded, \"Then let's devise a plan.\"</span></div></div>",

You must never tell anyone that you are working out unless someone asks, and you can't do it in brazen places.  You have to strike a perfect balance.  I will be your eyes and ears and tell you what I hear among your siblings.  We must satisfy your parents.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know,\" Rolly yawned, \"we could let this blow over.  This seems like a way to stir more interest and a way for them to demand more results.\"  Thunderbolt nodded, \"But it doesn't.  You don't actually have to lose any weight, you merely have to appear like you're exercising.  Maybe, when your mother sees you exercise, but doesn't see you lose weight, she'll lay off your case.  But again, you also mustn't eat when anyone else is around.  If you do, eat less than you normally do; show restrain; and act like you're on a diet.  And also, if you eat when someone else is around, make sure he isn't around when you eat again.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly nodded, agreeing with Thunderbolt's plan.  \"I can't promise ease; but I can promise hope,\" Thunderbolt added, \"Come on, let's go get something to eat.\"  And having sated themselves, Rolly went back to the living room to await the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day came swiftly; and Thunderbolt nudged Rolly as the sun was rising before any of his siblings stirred.  \"The moment we see two of your siblings, we stop and go in the barn,\" Thunderbolt whispered when the duo got to the barn.  Rolly assented, nervous about the exercises.  \"All right,\" Thunderbolt said, \"Run down the hill and back five times.  Is that good?\"  Rolly replied that he was ready and went off.  For the first couple of laps, Rolly seemed to be managing fine, keeping a light run going; but by the fourth relay, he was panting and beginning to drool; and by the fifth lap, he was positively foaming and had slowed to a walk.  When Rolly got to the top of the hill, he collapsed, panting and drooling all over the ground.  So he was a bit out of shape, Thunderbolt thought to himself, no worries.  Rolly's stomach growled, \"I'm famished,\" he grumbled.  Thunderbolt chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How about you do 25 jumps in the air.  You know, the kind you used to do as a puppy when you were excited,\" Thunderbolt suggested.  Rolly groaned and forced himself up.  When Rolly jumped, he got little more than a few inches off the ground.  \"Higher, Rolly,\" Thunderbolt encouraged before Rolly tried again, jumping a couple inches higher, \"better,\" Thunderbolt encouraged, \"24 more of those.\"  Once again, by the end of the exercises, Rolly close to collapsed.  \"At least we can go in the barn now,\" Thunderbolt whispered, having seen Perdita and Pongo watching them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your parents have noticed,\" Thunderbolt said as the thoroughly exhausted Dalmatian plodded into the barn.  Rolly did one more round of half-heared exercises before he quit, flopping onto his stomach to cool himself off and catch his breath.  Thunderbolt meanwhile walked off to get breakfast; and while he was doing that, Perdita came up to him and thanked him, \"For what?  Exercising him?\"  When Perdita nodded, Thunderbolt continued, \"I'm happy to do that.  If you want, I can keep doing it.\"  Perdita giggled, \"Why does he listen to you and not Pongo?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt pondered, unsure of the answer, \"Well, I am a former movie-star that he loved as a child, according to him.  And we did spend a lot of time together when I had my cast on.  I think he connected with me in that time.  And how, I don't know.\"  Perdita nodded, thanked him, and walked off, and Thunderbolt ate his breakfast heartily and went back to check on Rolly when everyone had eaten.  \"How are you doing?\" Thunderbolt asked, actually concerned about Rolly's health.  \"Tired,\" Rolly panted, \"and near starving.\"  \"Then come on,\" Thunderbolt gestured, \"let's go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two got to the trough, however, Perdita was standing there eating; so Thunderbolt whispered, \"Remember, restraint,\" in case anyone had overheard him.  Rolly nodded and only took a few mouthfuls of food before he walked away.  Thunderbolt took the opportunity to shove more food into his stomach.  Perdita, who had finished, whispered to Thunderbolt after Rolly had walked away, \"I'm amazed!  How did you get Rolly to restrain himself?\"  Thunderbolt shrugged and swallowed, \"I asked, and he did it.\"  Thunderstruck, Perdita nodded and went outside.  Seeing that no one else was inside, Thunderbolt gestured for Rolly to come back into the kitchen; and then Rolly stuffed his face with enough food to give himself a nearly-swollen stomach.  \"Careful, Rolly, you don't want to throw up,\" Thunderbolt chortled at Rolly, who stop eating and flopped down in the living room, not bothering to even get on the sofa.  So Thunderbolt gingerly raised himself on to the sofa, hindered by his food.</span></div></div>",

Thunderbolt kept telling them that he was getting better results from Rolly, but this was where Pongo and Perdita split: Pongo was sceptical and wanted the exercises to stop, arguing that somehow, perhaps by putting Rolly's body in some type of \"starvation mode,\" which meant that it consumed fewer calories.  Perdita, however, seemed to Thunderbolt to so desperately want to believe that her son was just on the precipice of losing weight that she argued for a redoublingof their efforts.  Thunderbolt actively sided with Perdita, which he knew would make Pongo that much more stubborn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So Thunderbolt let another month pass.  It was now mid-February, a cold, wet February.  Perdita had made herself a nervous wreck trying to get Rolly to lose weight.  She pestered Thunderbolt constantly with questions.  For Rolly, however, sneaking food was becoming harder with more people in the house meaning fewer opportunities to eat, so he frequently went to the barn with Thunderbolt to pillage the supply of oats, which dwindled to half their original supply from the previous November.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly grew worried that they would run out of oats, so Thunderbolt argued that they should save the oats for winter only, and Rolly agreed.  Meanwhile, Pongo kept trying to soothe his frantic wife, \"Perdita, please, please, you see what the exercise has done to Rolly.  Perhaps we should lay off the exercise regimen for Rolly.\"  Perdita kept resisting pointlessly, until Rolly fell down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was mid-march, still cool and icy, but also marshy and wet.  The hill was of course no exception.  And Rolly, being the klutz that he was, rolled down the hill one day while his mother was watching.  The fall hadn't been terrible, and Rolly had only gotten a few nicks and bruises here and there, nothing that wouldn't have healed in a couple of days.  But Perdita, being in the frenzied state that she was in, had had a \"conversion\" and had run over to her son, who said he was ok but feigned some pain.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perdita had immediately asked Thunderbolt to stop with the exercise regimen, which Thunderbolt had seemingly reluctantly agreed to.  Perdita had then hung her head and gone inside and had curled up in a ball and had sobbed for a few minutes.  She would soon, however, accept Rolly's state and would get over her past qualms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rolly,\" Thunderbolt whispered, \"Now you actuallly need to lose some weight.  It doesn't matter how quickly you gain it back so long as your parents notice that you've lost some weight.\"  Rolly sighed, \"Thunderbolt, please tell me that this is the final stage of your plan?\"  Thunderbolt winced, \"No, but you have to trust me, ok?  It'll be over soon.\"  Rolly nodded, wishing the pain to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dieting hurt far more than exercise did, both mentally and physically.  The hunger left gnawing pains in Rolly's stomach, and the realization that he couldn't do anything about it made him irritable.  He didn't outwardly show it, but he did feel irritation.  Thunderbolt, meanwhile, took Rolly's share of the food so that people wouldn't suspect that Rolly was on a diet.  That led to many uncomfortable sessions on the couch, wheezing to try and draw a breath because of the volume of the food in his stomach.  It hurt, but Thunderbolt wanted his plan to work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps mid-June, shortly after Rolly's fourth birthday, \u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt's injured leg was hurting again.  The pain was the prickly, shooting type that makes one want to lie down curled up in a ball and weep bitterly.  Thunderbolt knew, however, that he had to ignore the pain.  He had accidentally slept on his leg again, and that was the source of his pain.  Thunderbolt knew immediately that he wouldn't be able to do his exercises that day.  So he stood and hobbled over to the food trough where he took a few mouthfuls of food and hobbled over to see Rolly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo, however, had been awoken by Thunderbolt's movements and had risen to see what was happening.  Pongo caught up with Thunderbolt outside, \"Want some help?\"  Thunderbolt shook his head, \"I'm fine; I just slept on my leg, which now feels uncomfortable.  Sorry.  Did I disturb you?\"  Pongo laughed, \"It's not as if you meant to; I sleep lightly, perhaps a function of being the one the kids came to when they were sick in the middle of the night when they were younger.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt nodded, sympathizing with Pongo's claim; but now, having nearly reached the top of the hill, his knees ached; so when he got to the top of the hill, Thunderbolt sat gingerly down on his uninjured leg.  Rolly, who had heard the approach, came out and greeted the two of them and sat down near them.  His fat dimple caused from his sitting was gone, Pongo noticed with satisfaction.  He was perhaps ready again to try to help Rolly lose weight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rolly,\" Pongo began after the greeting, \"you look like you've lost weight.  You look so much better.\"  Rolly grimaced, \"Yes, but I feel worse.\"  Pongo frowned, \"Don't worry; you'll get over it soon I'm sure.\"  Rolly nearly rolled his eyes, but neither said nor did anything.  \"Have you perhaps been restricting your eating?\" Pongo asked, prodding the issue.  Rolly shook his head; so Pongo continued, \"Perhaps we could monitor how much you eat and see if that helps?\"  Rolly grimaced, pretending to loathe his father's advice, \"Perhaps,\" Thunderbolt interjected, \"because of my leg, I could monitor the food trough and see how much Rolly eats.  Pongo nodded, \"but I'll relieve you at times if you want.\"  Thunderbolt laughed, \"why not? Let's try it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly knew immediately what he had to do.  If his father were guarding the trough, Rolly would restrain himself; but if Thunderbolt were at the trough, Rolly would have his field day.  That would help Rolly tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt appreciated his duty as sentinel.  Pongo would take over being sentinel at night, whereas Thunderbolt would be sentinel during most of the day.  Thus, whenever no one else was in the room, except Rolly, of course, Thunderbolt would eat as much food as he could; and he would allow Rolly to do the same.  Rolly was delighted to be able to eat as he pleased again, and spent as much time as he could eating when no on else was around.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long for Rolly to gain back the little skin fold that he had once had, and it didn't take too long for Thunderbolt to obtain one for himself.  Pongo noticed that Rolly was gaining weight again, so he decided to scrap the project of the diet soon after it had started because he had lost too much sleep from it.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo, however, decided not to give up on his crusade to get Rolly to lose weight and immediately set out to see what he could do.  Pongo tried stealthily watch his son, who never did anything suspicious in front of his father.  Pongo couldn't find the missing link.  Then, one day, as he watched Thunderbolt walk, waddle was a better description, Pongo thought, he noticed something.  When Thunderbolt sat, he had the same fold of skin over his haunches that Rolly had; so he thought\u2026</span></div></div>",

Perhaps Thunderbolt had no idea how much a dog should eat, or perhaps Thunderbolt hadn't been too careful when he watched Rolly eat.  Perhaps Rolly had persuaded Thunderbolt that he should have more food by some connivance.  Perhaps even Thunderbolt had been convinced that Rolly was normal and didn't know how to make Rolly lose any weight.  Or perhaps the two were unrelated.  Perhaps because of Thunderbolt's injury and boredom he had gained weight, being unable to be exercised away by the scant activity that Thunderbolt was allowed; and perhaps Rolly truly couldn't lose weight now as he once had.  But Pongo quickly discarded that thought.  But one lurking suspicion ran through Pongo's mind continually: what if Thunderbolt had sabotaged Rolly's weight-loss efforts?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pongo immediately dismissed that as absurd, primarily because he had no evidence, and otherwise because Thunderbolt had no incentives for doing any such thing.  But conspiracy theories have ways of appealing to one's innate sense of attaching malice to sheer ignorance or stupidity.  So Pongo dismissed this conspiracy as baseless.  Nevertheless, Pongo continuously monitored the food trough and watched to ascertain Rolly's habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think that your dad's on to us,\" Thunderbolt remarked; Rolly glared at Thunderbolt for stating the obvious.  \"Yes, I'm aware,\" Rolly huffed, clearly enunciating each word to berate and demean Thunderbolt.  \"Do we want to use the oats?\" Rolly inquired, having forgiven Thunderbolt for making dumb statements of obvious facts.  Thunderbolt snickered, \"I don't know, O Smartass; you tell me.\"  Rolly scowled again, \"Look, I said I was sorry for being a smartass.  I have no justification for it, and I hope that you'll forgive me.  But if you want me to make an executive decision, I will.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt nodded, \"Give your dad a week.  He'll get impatient; and when he does, you can go back to your old habits.\"  To that, Rolly prompted, \"and if he doesn't?\"  \"If he doesn't,\" Thunderbolt elaborated, \"then, yes, you may and should.  But be careful.  Your father has heard the rumors and will no doubt put sentries up to guard here at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week passed, but Pongo didn't give up his quest.  So Rolly, sticking to the plan, carefully began to stick to the plan.  Two weeks passed, and Pongo noticed with a broken heart that Rolly still hadn't lost any weight.  Perhaps Rolly was right.  When he had lost weight previously, he had been growing; and perhaps this was the natural full shape of his body.  Perhaps he wasn't overweight at all, and perhaps he didn't need to lose weight.  But still Pongo never gave up.  He watched Thunderbolt eat his enormous portions from the bowl, plod off to the couch, and flop down on the floor because he could no longer force himself up on it anymore because his leg had so deteriorated.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things on Rolly's front looked no better for Rolly.  The supply of oats was slowly shrinking because of the heavy crutch it gave Rolly while the poor dog was being deprived of food.  Rolly's weight gain became anemic compared to what it had once been, but still he waited out his father.  But Rolly made a mistake one night when he was preparing to get some oats from the shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly was very careful to be wary of intruders.  He knew his siblings were smart enough to get downwind of him, so he knew he had to rely on sight and constantly shifting directions.  Thunderbolt told Rolly that he was being to thorough and that he would be seen one day.  And indeed, one night Rolly was seen pacing around the barn by\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps Rolly had been too cautious, but his father Pongo saw him one night pacing outside of the barn.  It was a night in early June, a warm, humid, summer night that called for open windows to let in a breeze lest the house feel too stifling.  Pongo usually didn't have trouble with the heat, and the cold usually bother him more; but that night he couldn't sleep.  He considered walking around, but decided against such a course of action given that a walk would only make him more hot; so he decided to go roll around in the dewy grass to cool himself off.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having gone outside to do just that, he spotted his son prowling around the barn.  But given that Rolly hadn't changed his course or flinched in any noticeable way, Pongo concluded that Rolly hadn't noticed Pongo.  Indeed, Rolly hadn't.  Although he had only eaten a few hours previous, Rolly was hungry again and had wanted a snack before bed, just enough to last himself through the night.  He wasn't carefully watching because he didn't really expect anyone to notice or care enough to see what he was doing.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Pongo had noticed, so Rolly was unaware of his father's presence.  Pongo lay stock still until Rolly had moved on.  Pongo hoped that his son would be too lazy to check on any disturbance if he even sensed one.  Rolly trudged heavily and sleepily around the barn a few more times before he went inside.  Pongo waited a minute; and having realized that Rolly wasn't coming out for a while, Pongo decided to follow.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the first sounds that Pongo heard was the distinct sound of a dog's paws on wood.  Pongo thought that that noise was just Rolly's wishing to have the inaccessible food in the storage closet when he heard a distinct click followed by a creak of rusty hinges swinging.  Had Rolly really gotten into the food closet?  Pongo dismissed the thought before he peered into the door of the barn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door to the food storeroom was ajar, and Pongo heard the distinct sounds of Rolly's ripping something, a sound followed by the distince sound of someone's eating.  The barn was dark, and Pongo didn't want to give away his position.  But halfway through the barn, Pongo stabbed his paw on something sharp, \"AH, DAMN IT!\" He howled in agony.  The sound of eating immediately stopped, and Rolly poked his face through the door, or did something with the door given its squeak.  \"Dad?\" Rolly asked, with a note of genuine panic, \"are you ok?\"  \"Yes, yes, I'll be ok,\" Pongo muttered, but his paw was too injured for use.  \"Be careful,\" Rolly whispered, \"There's a shard of broken glass here somewhere.\"  \"Yes, son, it's in my foot!\" Pongo wanted to scream, but instead said it at a mild level in a harsh tone to compensate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, Dad; let me help you.  Or at least, let me get help,\" Rolly pleaded.  \"Don't ask me, son; just go; do it already,\" Pongo scream-whispered.  And so Rolly ran as fast as he could, which was not that fast given his girth; and he bounded inside to his master's room.  Rolly had taken precautions of locking the storage door before he had left, so he was safe on that front.  But Rolly grabbed his master's leg by the pants and dragged his helpless master down to the kitchen, where he ran ahead while his master fumbled for a flashlight before catching up to Rolly halfway up the hill to the barn, where Rolly, Roger noticed, looked almost out of breath, and panting heavily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Roger smelled the blood, he saw his first Dalmatian in a pool of it with a shard of something stuck in his paw.  Roger nearly fainted before he grabbed Pongo and whisked him in his car to the vet after he had stopped the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger waited frantically while he stood outside the vet's office, waiting for the vet himself to arrive.  The clerk at the desk was uncertified for doing anything like what was required.  Roger was dreaming that Pongo had been struck in a major vein and was bleeding beyond fix.  Roger was hoping that that wasn't the case, but was fearing that it was.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the vet finally arrived, Roger hurriedly and emotionally explained what was wrong to a bleary-eyed vet who nodded and tried to assauge Roger's fears to little avail before wheeling Pongo into the operating room.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger waited and waited for an age before the vet came back\u2026</span></div></div>",

I will keep him until he awakes; but until then, you should go home and rest.\"  Roger stared uncomprehendingly: how could that little shard have caused his beloved dog so much pain?  Roger refused the vet's offer to leave; the vet then shrugged and allowed Roger to sit in the operating room with Pongo.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A vet-tech walked in and relieved the doctor of sitting there.  \"He'll be fine, I'm sure,\" the vet-tech whispered.  She was a middle-aged woman of perhaps fifty, Roger didn't dare ask, however, who was thin with a perfectly proprtioned body for Roger's taste.  Roger found some solace in her words, \"I'm sure this happens regularly,\" Roger chuckled, \"so why am I panicking?\"  The woman smiled, \"At least now you're out out of that sombre mood you were in but a moment ago.  I'm Linda, just so you know.\"  Roger's head snapped up, \"Oh, yes, where are my manners?  I'm Roger, and you know Pongo.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Linda gave a wan smile, \"Yes, good to know your name.  And, yes, I do know Pongo.  I'm sorry we had to meet under these dire circumstances.\"  Roger nodded and looked back at Pongo, who seemed only a bit uncomfortable in the life-support equipment.  Roger then sat back down and nodded off to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roger awoke to Linda's frantic whispers, \"Roger, get up!  Pongo's dying!\"  Roger snapped awake and stood immediately.  The veterinarian stood, trying to administer something to a drugged Pongo, whose mouth seemed sealed shut.  \"What's wrong?\" Roger could only feebly croak.  \"Pongo's having a heart attack!\"  Linda shouted.  Pongo's cardiac monitor grew more feeble with each heartbeat, Roger thought.  And with each paaing moment, the ekg grew more and more feeble until it completely flat-lined.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The vet and Linda both tried to resuscitate Pongo to no avail.  After several minutes, the vet stepped away, looked at Roger in a bleary-eyed way and whispered, \"I'm sorry, sir: Pongo is dead by cardiac arrest caused by a blood-clot, probably from his leg.\"  It took Roger until the end of the vet's sentence to realize what was happening; then he blacked out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Roger came to, he thought that he had woken from an awful nightmare.  But when he saw Pongo, not breathing and cold to the touch, lying on the table, he knew that what he had seen was real indeed.  Pongo was dead.  There was no way around that horrible, terrifying, and morbid fact.  Roger knew that he would have to cope with that.  So he took Pongo's corpse, placed it in a shroud, and drove back home with it in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having arrived back home, Roger got the wooden cross that he had gotten from the little church down the road, took a shovel, dug a grave, and gently placed Pongo in it.  Roger bawled the entire time.  Anita eventually came out, saw what Roger was doing, and wept with him.  Perdita knew what was going on, as did Thunderbolt; but none of the children but Rolly seemed to get what was happening.  When the funeral was complete, the couple went inside.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a couple of days, Roger didn't feel like eating anything; so he gave his food when Anita wasn't looking to Thunderbolt, who appreciated the rich human food with his whole heart.  Although it never satisfied him, Thunderbolt always had an appetite for more.  But after that couple of days of grief, Roger recovered his appetite, which at first disappointed Thunderbolt.  But Roger lost his appetite again a few days later, after eating twice what he normally ate in a day for a week.  But then, for a couple of days here and there, Roger would lose his appetite and slip his plates under the table to Thunderbolt.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perdita was also never the same.  She stopped doting over her children, became more cold and irritable, and stopped caring as much about what her children did, an approach thatbsuited Rolly just fine.  Rolly, to cope with the grief, buried his nose into more food and ate more than he could have forced himself to eat.  Rolly just wanted the excuse to eat; and although he loved his father, he moved on quite quickly.  Thunderbolt also needed the pretense if he was going to keep eating like he was and not exercising.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Thunderbolt and Rolly slowly put on more weight for a little while until\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly lay on his side, napping to digest his breakfast when he felt the gentle touch of some paw, so he lifted his head and turned it to see who had tapped his exorbitant roll of fat that formed whenever Rolly lay on his side.  Having seen his mother standing and glaring at him.  Rolly tried to stand up, but got no further than where he had started, hampered by the mass of his abdomen.  The pitiful dalmatian then remembered that he had to first roll himself onto his chest and belly, a process that left him a bit short of breath; he then scrambled with his front paws to get himself into a sitting position before he finally began to shift his weight as far forward as it would go before he managed to lift his bulk off the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally, this process was not as much of a rigamarole; but Rolly's full stomach made catching a deep breath difficult; and sleep made him groggy.  After about thirty seconds of this struggle, Rolly finally managed to pant, \"Yes, Mom?\"  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perdita looked a bit shaken at her son's display of such an obvious weakness, but she let no more concern show in her face than was already present.  \"Yes, Rolly,\" she whispered as she shed a crocodile tear, \"It's about your father.  Patch, and others have confirmed, that you were not in the house on the night your father\u2026passed.\"  Here, Perdita shed a genuine tear, but not becaue of love of her lost husband, but out of loathing of her son's perceived conspiracy in this plot.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly nodded, willing to listen standing, despite that his knees were beginning to ache; and he dared not ask to sit, lest his mother go off about his softness and weakness.  \"No,\" he sighed, \"I remember that I was in the barn.  I was the first one who heard father after he cut his foot.  I tried to save him!\"  Perdita nodded, throughly unconvinced by her son's charade, \"How did you avoid the glass?\"  Rolly knew he needed a better answer than \"luck\" or some other stupid answer.  It had indeed been luck, but Rolly knew that his mother wouldn't be placated by such a simple answer.  So he fibbed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I saw the shards when a stray beam of moonlight flashed on the shards.\"  There were windows all around the barn, so this answer would be plausible to his mother.  But what Rolly sensed would be his mother's next question would be harder to have a convincing answer to.  And surely enough, Perdita then asked, \"How did you not hear your father's approach?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly pondered but remained calm for a moment before he answered honestly: \"I don't know.  You know that I've never been observant.  And dad was, I'm almost certain, trying to spy on me--not maliciously, just to see what I was doing.  When he howled in pain was the first time I realized he was present, and you know how I get around food.  But, Mom, asking someone to disprove a negative is a logical fallacy.\"  Rolly's mother even chuckled at this, but Rolly knew it was a derisive laughter, one mocking, not supporting him.  But, in truth, she knew how he was with food--how he entered a trancelike state when food was within a five-foot radius.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she had to have someone else to blame.  \"Damn you,\" she snarled, taking Rolly aback, \"why was I given you, the worthless sack of heart disease and diabetes that you are.\"  And with that, Perdita stormed off, leaving Rolly silently sobbing at the ad hominem his mother had just hurled at him.  What she said Rolly knew to be true, but it was nevertheless a grevious insult.  And that hurt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly was still trying to control the endorphin-enfused water flowing freely down his face when Thunderbolt came hobbling in before he thumped his meaty back side down on the ground with a thump that knocked Rolly out of his nauseous melancholy.  Thunderbolt knew something was terribly wrong, so he immediately panted--because he lacked the breath to do anything more forceful, \"What--what can--I d-do to h-help.\"  Rolly knew that his face was a mess, so he lay down beside his companion and told him what had just happened, but deliberately leaving out the final insult.  Thunderbolt immediately sensed that Rolly was telling most--but not all--the truth.  But he didn't want to press the issue further.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly shook his head, calmed his sobbing, which had left him out of breath anyway, and said with a firm, somber voice, \"No, Thunderbolt.  Nothing that I would ever ask you to do.\"  Thunderbolt again decided not to press the issue.  But Rolly decided to continue, \"Besides, it isn't anything you could help me with anyway.  I need to control my own weight; that's all.\"  Thunderbolt nodded, but was aghast that his partner in crime would up and abandon him on such a whim, because Rolly was not whimsical.  Perhaps he was just in a state of furor and unwilling to control his rage, so he was just spewing idiotic rage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But what if he were serious?  What if what he had said had indeed been meditated upon beforehand?  Thunderbolt revelled in this new bombshell revelation.  If Rolly lost weight, Thunderbolt would lose all credibility.  He had to find some way to lessen or slow the damage.  \"And how will you do it--lose weight, I mean?\"  Rolly paused for a moment before he declared:\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Rolly stated this, Thunderbolt felt like he had just had his body crushed like his leg under the stage-light.  This plan was serious and well-considered, not a rash rage-induced throw-away statement that was not meant to be taken seriously.  Thunderbolt knew he had to do something; so he nodded his head and mused, \"Ah, I see.  It's probably for the best that you gently coax yourself away from the food that you like so much.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt understood that Rolly knew that the former was going to be a hindrance to the latter's efforts, so Thunderbolt needed to find a way to penetrate that guard.  He had to initially seem against the plan but seem to come around to it; so he added, \"I think you're a good weight just the way you are; but I'm glad that you decided to lose weight slowly and incrementally and not quickly.  I don't know if I like this plan, but you can do as you will.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly sighed, \"I appreciate the compliments, your frankness, and your willingness to stay out of the way.  But I intend to do this anyway.  I need to.  To win affection and trust from my mother.\"  Thunderbolt nodded, realizing the piece of the puzzle Rolly had left out.  \"Did your mother insult you?\"  Thunderbolt mused jokingly.  And by the way Rolly's cheek flushed bright red and by the ways he turned away in shame, Thunderbolt knew that he had hit the nail on the head.  He scooted over and thoroughly apologized to Rolly, \"Hey, I didn't mean to embarrass you.  I just wanted to understand your sudden 180 on your life's ambition.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly turned, seemingly just remembering that not cowing to his mother's will and eating as much as he pleased was indeed his life's goal.  But his resolve returned, his eyes hardening, \"You won't change my mind on this matter.  I will lose the weight.\"  Thunderbolt retired, seemingly defeated.  Some time later, Thunderbolt got up and wandered slowly, partially deliberately, partially because it embarrassed him when his flesh around his ribs shook violently when he moved any faster, to the deserted food trough, which was around the corner from Rolly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly could not ignore the slow, contrived movements that Thunderbolt took to raise himself from the floor.  And Rolly knew that there were only two things Thunderbolt would be doing in that direction: getting food or relieving himself.  And from where he heard the footsteps stop, Rolly deduced that Thunderbolt had stopped for the former.  And having not forgotten his diet, Rolly tried to ignore the sound of Thunderbolt scarfing down a midday meal.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, however, Rolly got up, unable to resist the sound of scraping food any longer.  Thunderbolt had only been digging around with his nose for a minute or two when he heard the slow footsteps of Rolly, and the Shepherd decided to force himself to eat.  Rolly, who had usually eaten the midday meal before he had started his diet, now felt the urge to eat something.  No, he realized, not to eat, but to placate his stomach.  Thunderbolt now feigned surprise as he looked up, nodded, and walked back into the living room to let Rolly make his own decisions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the large Shepherd had finally sauntered out of the room, Rolly stood in front of the tantalizing food: would he give in and abandon his diet before he had even started or would he stick to his diet and resist the urge to gorge with abandon on the present food.  Rolly stood, fretting over one of the toughest decisions he had ever made in his life.  He stood petrified for a while, perhaps five minutes or more, agonizing over his decision before his knees made a decision for him.  He had to lie down to rest before he could make a decision.  Eventually, he stood, with a straining effort, and gingerly padded into the living room.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had done it! Rolly realized.  He had resisted food for the first time in his life when he had not been too full to eat any more.  Small steps, Rolly knew, were the only way to achieving any goal.  Hours passed, and the gurgle of Rolly's stomach grew more frequent and irritable.  Thunderbolt felt almost perfectly the hunger that Rolly felt when the Dalmatian's stomach growled in that way.  Thunderbolt had been unfed at midday throughout his acting career, which left him feeling ravenous for dinner; it was not a pleasant sensation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dinnertime rolled around.  Rolly felt the growl in his stomach grow only more desperate as he waited for everyone to finish dinner.  Rolly knew how much he should eat.  He would eat until he was pleasantly sated, but not overfull.  Before anyone else came for dinner, Rolly performed his elaborate routine to stand and waddled over to the food trough, just recently filled by Roger.  And Pongo ate rapidly until he had begun to feel satisfied, but not overfull.  And he knew he had to stop.  So he did momentarily, but he knew he couldn't agonize over his decision like he had at lunch, otherwise, he would fail and gorge himself more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So he made a decision quickly.  He moved himself away from the food.  The sensation was dizzying.  He had succeeded again, Rolly thought to himself.  He just had to slowly wean himself off the food.  He just had to keep doing what he was doing, and he would lose the weight he wanted.  He had to keep reducing the rations, and he would succeed.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But after a few days, Rolly found that the nagging urge to glut himself with food was just as strong as it ever had been, if not stronger.  Rolly knew that he had to persevere, but his weak flesh wanted to ignore his strong mind.  Prudence and temperance be damned! shouted Rolly's stomach to his mind.  Shut up! Rolly growled back at his stomach.  Rolly had to decide what he wanted to do.  He needed to talk to someone.</span></div></div>",

Five days of regimented dieting had shot Rolly's will to continue with his plan.  The obese Dalmatian had just made his second round of food cuts, a further demoralization for his cause.  But he had decided to persevere in his austerity.  Rolly knew that the weight would come off slowly at this rate, if at all.  It would take a year or more at this rate, but Rolly knew that he was now at a critcal crossroads for his future; so he wanted advice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt felt a paw poke gently at his hill-shaped abdomen.  The poke didn't get to his ribs before the massive dog awoke.  \"Thunderbolt,\" came Rolly's familiar voice, \"I need your advice about my diet.\"  Thunderbolt looked up and heaved himself with some difficulty onto his stomach and after a deep breath, he exhaled, \"Well, I can't say that I'll be useful to you.  But what do you want to ask me?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly lay down and took his own deep breath, \"I'm at a dilemma.  My will to continue dieting is weak, at best.  I was wondering whether I should indulge my stomach or stay strong and soldier through my indecision.\"  Thunderbolt was immediately excited by the news and let his ears perk to let Rolly know that his position on Rolly's diet had not changed.  But Thunderbolt then gave an honest answer, \"Rolly, you've always been so decisive.  I know you can musterl the willpower to resist your temptation.  But if you must give in, make the giving in at one meal time and not too frequently.  That always was how I heard my humans say to diet.  But you have to remember not to give in too frequently.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly nodded, but before he got up to walk away, he asked, \"And how frequently is too frequently.\"  Thunderbolt considered his answer before he responded, \"Well, obviously it can't come every day; but you have to try and make it as long as you can.  You have to really try.\"  Rolly nodded, grinning, pleased that Thunderbolt had given him helpful advice, in spite of his obvious biases.  Rolly had noticed how Thunderbolt's face had lit up when Rolly said that his will to continue was weakening.  But this fact left a seed of doubt in Rolly's mind.  The advice all seemed earnest enough, and Rolly suspected that he knew which parts of Thunderbolt's account.  The cheat day.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly suspected that the cheat day thing was false--that he had to keep soldiering on.  But Rolly didn't think Thunderbolt was sabotaging his efforts directly, but he knew he had to try to keep soldiering on.  Rolly decided eventually that Thunderbolt's advice was too intuitive, too obvious.  But perhaps Thunderbolt had no idea what worked either, that all he had was speculation.  But Rolly played devil's advocate with himself and challenged his previous assertion with the fact that he had no better ideas.  And speculation was better than nothing at this point.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So Rolly decided to try Thunderbolt's advice, despite his reservations.  He soldiered on for two days more; and on the seventh day after he had started his diet, Rolly finally folded and gave in to his temptations, engorging on all the food he could feed upon, vowing that his third round of food cuts would come the next day.  And, in spite of how such promises usually turned out, it did indeed come.  And in the middle of the week, Rolly made his fourth round of cuts to his intake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this point, his stomach snarled rapaciously and whined that it was being denied of its rightful inheritance.  Rolly, no longer able to sustain the constant complaining of his stomach, on the twelth day indulged his stomach until it screamed for mercy for the opposite reason.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Rolly had taken a day to indulge himself, he realized that his \"indulgence days\" were quickly running closer together.  He promised himself that he would only indulge himself once every seven days, on the seventh day.  So he had used his indulgence of the week, Rolly pondered sullenly.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite his early weakness, Rolly had managed to stick to his diet, in spite of his almost constant, gnawing hunger that seemed to have a mind of his own.  But he was losing patience.  He had reached a level of food austerity needed to maintain a normal weight approved by his family, especially his mother.  But that amount rested on the presumption that Rolly would actually lose weight.  Much to his chagrin, and to Thunderbolt's tacit, but open, pleasure and amusement, Rolly seemed not to have lost any significant weight, maybe ten pounds at most.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly's spirit had been crushed by his dismal results.  \"Perhaps you need more time,\" Thunderbolt had stated, trying to console his gloomy companion, \"you didn't gain the weight overnight; and because losing weight is harder than gaining it, you can't possibly expect quick results.\"  Rolly knew that Thunderbolt was telling the truth; and although Rolly didn't usually let his feelings distract him from his thoughts, this truth was unpleasant given that it seemed like he had been dieting for quite a while.  He knew it had been a mere 8 weeks, but those had caused immense pain, physical and emotional.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly didn't feel better, only worse.  \"This a medium-to-long investment,\" Thunderbolt had proclaimed, with the arrogant superiority of someone who thinks he knows everything.  But in spite of himself and his own will, Rolly had trouble planning for the future--he was an \"in-the-now\" kind of guy.  He didn't want to sacrifice now for medium or, worse, long term pleasure and prosperity, especially when his best friend wasn't.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't even as if Thunderbolt were suffering for his lack of foresight.  Although he was years older than Rolly, and had a crippled leg, Thunderbolt seemed to pay no price for his weight.  Thunderbolt knew this was untrue, but he knew how to hide his problems from Rolly.  But after losing only maybe fifteen pounds, Thunderbolt noted that Rolly could already roll over much more easily than he had at fifteen pounds heavier.  His routine for standing up and walking were less elaborate than they had been, and he could now walk faster and didn't have to breath as hard after a walk to the food bowl or outside to relieve himself.  These small differences made Thunderbolt mildly envious of Rolly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shepherd didn't know why, because he could force himself to lose weight; but Thunderbolt couldn't suppress his instictive urge to have his cake and eat it too.  He wanted to be able to eat as much as he wanted and not get fat or have any of the repercussions associated with that weight.  No, that fat, Thunderbolt corrected himself.  Thunderbolt knew his desire was impossible and irrational, but at the same time, he wished it was so.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having thought of getting up, Thunderbolt decided that he should go relieve himself while Rolly was sulking by himself outside.  And so began the increasingly elaborate routine Thunderbolt used to get himself up.  He began to roll over and eventually managed to heave his hind legs under his massive belly that hung over his feet and made a pear shape from the base of his tail to his shoulders.  Thunderbolt began to scoot his front legs backward until they were constrained by the limits of his massive chest and stomach.  The corpulent Shepherd then pushed his hind legs back as far as they would go before he pushed up with those legs as hard as he could, gently lifting his butt from the ground until he was fully standing, his inufed hind leg, howvever, felt especially bad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He took a step forward, more of a shuffle, with that foot.  Deciding that he had just sat on it for too long, Thunderbolt began another step; but this time, he felt a searing pain in his injured back leg.  And when he moved the opposite front leg from his injured leg, with his center-of-gravity on his injured leg, he felt a shooting pain in that leg before it buckled and collapsed, forcing Thunderbolt with a massive thump into the ground.  Thunderbolt nearly howled in pain as loudly as he could before he stifled the urge at the last moment.  He wasn't greivously injured, but his back legs hurt like hell.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt knew better than to try standing again, a premonition confirmed by the approach of Rolly's heavy, plodding footsteps.  Rolly didn't have to shuffle like had had to anymore.  A sight that made Thunderbolt green with envy.  \"What happened?\" Rolly asked, in a concerned manner.  \"Sorry,\" Thunderbolt answered hastily, \"I thought I needed to go outside when I realized I didn't; and I sat down a bit faster than I meant to.\"  Rolly suspected Thunderbolt had been leaving something out, but he had no idea what it was. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly sat carefully next to Thunderbolt and saw that Thunderbolt grimaced slightly before the rotund shepherd smiled, \"What's going on out there?\"  Rolly sighed, \"The idiots are playing stupid games.  I've been listening to Roger complain about the coal-miners' strikes around the country.  I have no idea what 'coal' or a 'miner' is though.  So I was bored and came in here.\"  Thunderbolt chuckled, explaining to Rolly what \"coal\" and \"miners\" were, and why they were so important.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Rolly pondered for a moment before he turned and looked at Thunderbolt with the sort of grim determination one wears on one's face before one goes into battle, \"Thunderbolt, will you diet with me?  I need a partner.  I need someone to give me resolve.  So will you?\"</span></div></div>",

He knew that he ought to lose a few kilos if he wanted to feel better and move around better.  But hunger was difficult for him, painful.  Suddenly, Thunderbolt had a memory dragged to the surface by the thought of losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt was back in the recording studio, after one of his taping sessions.  His vet had come to check up on him, a routine examination to make sure that Thunderbolt was still physically fit.  The check-up had proceeded normally, with an exchange of pleasantries and some vaccine boosters and a talk about routine schedules, sleep, and behavior.  Eventually, Thunderbolt got put on a scale and weighed. \"41\" read the scale.  The vet looked discouraged.  \"Sir,\" the vet quavered, \"I'm afraid your dog is 41 kilos.  He should weigh at most 37 kilos, and I would like to see him closer to 35.  Do you think you could do that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt's manager, Reed, nodded and thanked the vet.  When the vet left, Reed had glared--not looked sympathetically or disapprovingly--but glared with all his wrath.  Thunderbolt remembered shrinking away from his manager and whimpering pitifully.  Thenceforth, until Reed got Thunderbolt down to 33 kilos, Thunderbolt was given a half rations once a day.  Not one of his normal meals, but half of one not twice but once a day.  Those six weeks had been miserable, an undesireable memory and Thunderbolt's reason for his hoarding of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt came out of his memroial daydream eventually, but not until Rolly walked away chuckling, \"Tomorrow, Thunderbolt, we begin.\"  Thunderbolt knew then what he had to do.  Thunderbolt knew that Rolly was demoralized.  He knew that the poor dog was suffering not just from hunger, but from the repeated humiliations from his family members, who all liked to poke and prod at Rolly's fat rolls to make fun of him maliciously.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt was surprised no one had bothered to come after him yet.  Perhaps he had drawn sympathy from his injury, immunity from his movie-star status, or perhaps it was just because he just wasn't a member of the family.  Thunderbolt knew from experience, that wisdom of unlettered men, that families criticized each other more harshly than they did outsiders, at least good families did.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But none of these things mattered.  Rolly did laugh at his family, and had always done so, and would, Thunderbolt hoped, continue to do so, not because he didn't understand the joke, but because the laughing was the only way to get the others to stop laughing at him.  Thunderbolt thenrealized that he ought to go and relieve himself soon or he would go on the carpet.  He stretched and yawned; heaved his massive stomach onto the floor between, over, and just outside his paws; and rocked his weight back and forth until hebwas on his feet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time, he was careful with his back leg, moving it gingerly and as quickly as he could, and shuffled outside, maneuvering his soft, gelatinous body through the doggy door built for two Dalmatianss to walk abreast through it at the same time.  But Thunderbolt's flanks gently brushed both sides of the door ever so slightly at the same time.  That occurence had never happened before, Thunderbolt grimaced.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going back inside, he was careful not to brush against the doggy door's sides, because it hurt his flanks.  Having gotten into the kitchen, he noticed that Roger was there; so Thunderbolt  went into the living room and flopped down heavily, panting for a moment from his exertion, his back right knee ached from the weight mounted on it.  Perhaps he did need a diet, Thunderbolt thought, it would help him with his mobility.  So perhaps he would give the diet a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolly sat before the food bowl, unwilling to give up his attention to the food before him.  Resisting the food was excruciating, a herculean task.  Tomorrow, he thought, at least he would have Thunderbolt's help to give him resolve.  Today was Rolly's cheat day, but Rolly knew that his cheat days were causing him to stay hungry when he was eating his reduced, no, normal, Rolly corrected himself, portions.  He knew he would also have to indulge less on his cheat days if he were to be less hungry throughout the week; nevertheless, he countered, his cheat day wouldn't feel like an indulgence if he were to restrain himself.  And the restrain defeated the purpose of a cheat day at all.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Rolly turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thunderbolt awoke when he was hungry, like he usually did.  He scratched himself, took his time standing, and meandered over to the food trough.  Rolly was already there, seeming to wait for Thunderbolt.  Rolly stood awkwardly.  \"Ok. So, do you want to ease into this diet or do you want to go cold turkey?\"</span></div></div>",

She had started to eat a lot and started to develop a hanging gut, and to her surprise she love it! She loved the feelings she got when walking around in her new state, and seeing her new big belly swing from side to side with every step. She gave Maggie a show of showing her new body to her, and Maggie could see just how happy Grace looked now. \"So I guess you liked it?\" Maggie asked. \"YES! YES! I just love it!\" Grace said jumping around with joy, \"I just wish to become a large as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, You still will never be bigger then me.\" Maggie said to herself cocky, which Grace heard. \"Hey! I bet I can be twice your weight by tomorrow night!\" Grace said back challenging. \"Oh really?\" Maggie said back. \"Really!\" Grace answered back quickly. And so the bet was on where both Maggie and grace went their own ways to try and find things to eat to make them bigger then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started Grace knew this wasn't going to be easy to win. Both she and Mrs Calloway had made many jokes about Maggie's giant size for a good reason, and that reason was because she <u>was</u> that giant size. Even if Maggie didn't eat anything during the whole time the bet was on, she was still three times the cow that Grace was now. And while Grace still was usual self with just big potbelly, Maggie was a walking lard piece, with all of her body being fat and thick. She knew that if she wanted to win she had to find some place where there was lots of food, and where no one would ever think about looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie on the other hand didn't seemed as much bothered as she thought that with her current size that she had been having for many years she would be winning easy. Still she felt that perhaps there would be something that could lead to defeat, but she couldn't figure out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night both cow finally figured out just what they had been thinking about earlier. The pantry! That place had a lot of food stuffed inside, and whoever ate there would be guaranteed a victory in this bet. Grace thought that tonight would be her only chance to do it without having anyone else knowing anything about it. She knew that both her and Maggie where sleeping in stables right next to each others, so she needed to keep it quiet so she didn't wake her up. Carefully she made her way out of the barn, and started to head to the pantry to eat more then she had ever eaten in her whole life.</span></div></div>",

He had mostly just been staking out the latest movements by Prince John and his men, taking the occasional break to pilfer the pockets of the occasional guard. Flipping one of the few coins he had held onto in his hand after dropping the rest off at the church, he thought he saw something nearby. When he stopped by to look, the fox broke out into a grin. A raccoon was out cold propped against a tree, every breath a deafening snore. Two things in particular caught Robin's attention - the raccoon was massive in weight, easily twice the size of Little John or the Sheriff. It looked as if his clothes had nearly managed to stretch out to his size, too, the shirt larger than expected but straining at the raccoon's gigantic gut, the pants struggling to contain his massive legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, Robin noticed that the raccoon had a decent pile of gold as well as one larger and oddly-shaped gold piece on a necklace. Robin smiled to himself as he relieved the obese sleeper of about half of his money - he wasn't completely heartless - and grabbed the necklace off his chest, trying it on himself. Robin slowly walked away, the necklace swaying to and fro with every step.</span></div></div>",

Mostly confident that it was just him worrying about nothing, the fox continued down the path, blissfully ignorant of what exactly he had bouncing off his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as Robin carried out general reconnaissance on the area, taking note of the latest activity from Prince John and the Sheriff's men and working out strategies for upcoming heists against the king's gold.

Over the course of a few minutes, Little John had finished the stew and poured out some strong helpings for the two of them. Robin found himself enjoying the meal more than usual, and after guzzling down his first bowl in just a few minutes' time, he quickly asked for seconds, then thirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the meal digest, Robin laid back on the log and relaxed, closing his eyes for a minute. When he opened them, Little John was standing over him, a perplexed look on his face. \"Hey, Robin... have you looked yourself over lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that, John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should probably see for yourself...\" Little John grabbed a nearby mirror and shined it on the fox. In addition to the ten pounds he'd put on earlier, Robin's dinner had contributed to another 25 pounds on his frame. No longer could the fox be called skinny, or even normal-sized. He had a bit of a paunch sticking out over the belt on his tunic, while his arms and legs were just a bit thicker than they had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened, Robin? Did you have twenty-five meals today or something?\", Little John queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I might know what the culprit is,\" Robin replied. \"Earlier today I came upon a fat raccoon sleeping in the woods - twice the size of the Sheriff himself - and, figuring him to be part of the king's guard, lightened his pockets a bit. This-\" he said, as he struggled to take off the necklace around his neck, finally succeeding after 10 seconds- \"seemed to be a nice reminder of what I'd done, but it may have been a bit more than that. Seems to me that it's why I'm a bit less lithe than normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Robin and John marveled at the magic necklace, and after a moment, each told the other that they'd come up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

After resting for the night, the two spent the next day taking turns sneaking into the immediate area around John's castle, studying how the guards spent their time, what their responsibilities were, and most importantly, where they'd be able to snatch a few uniforms, so that they wouldn't have to risk making their own and getting caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was nearly sundown, Robin finally spotted an elephant guard enter a side room near the castle in his full uniform and leave wearing street clothes. \"That's definitely the changing room,\" he thought to himself, before the sky darkened and he didn't have any other opportunities to continue his recon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the fox returned to the room, timing the distance between each guard's entry and exit and judging when the fewest guards were on duty.

Taking a few minutes to poke around, he desperately searched for a smaller uniform, but it wasn't going to happen - it seemed Prince John liked his guards to be hugely fat, as so they'd be more imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused as to what he could do in the situation, Robin pulled one of the XL uniforms on for a split second, to see if he could pass as a king's guard. It wasn't to be - the uniform's sleeves billowed out and he appeared to be a child playing dress-up when he looked at the chest. Realizing he had just a few minutes before the king's guard ended, he grabbed two uniforms off a rack, put them in his bag and quickly fled from the room, finding a safe vantage point about 50 meters away on the side of a building. He stuck around until the first night shift worker came in. The obese ram entered and exited the room in just about a minute, meaning the coast was clear and Robin's intrusion wasn't noticed. As the falling sun masked his tracks, the fox left the castle area and retreated back to his camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go, Robin?\", Little John queried as Robin entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairly well,\" the fox replied. \"I managed to take a few uniforms without being spotted, but the sizes weren't exactly to my liking. They'll fit you, but we might have to think of an alternate way to get me in as a guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he described what had happened, Little John reached into the bag and looked at the uniforms. \"Wow, now we know where John likes to spend the peoples' money,\" the bear said as he tried one of them on. \"This thing feels great,\" he added, stretching in the uniform. Taking it off again and putting on his regular clothes, the bear paused for a second. \"Hey, Rob, thanks for getting this 2XL, it fits me perfect, but why is the other one...\"</span></div></div>",

No. No, no, no, that won't do. I can't rightly do that,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have much of a choice, do you?\", Little John replied. \"You can't exactly waste another whole day sneaking this uniform back into the guards' quarters, and even if you did, none of the others would fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, I don't think it's such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, you're all about being selfless and altruistic. You risk your freedom, even your life, daily for the good of the people. Now you have an opportunity to possibly stop your most hated enemy and you're not willing to take it? What does that make you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, it's your waistline or the kingdom, think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought for a few moments, then realized John was right. It had to be done... but why did he have to slip up and grab such an outlandishly large uniform? \"Ugh... well, you're right, John, we need to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get down to business, then,\" John said, grabbing the necklace and handing it to the fox. Resigned, Robin put it around his neck, and the strange feeling he had initially felt putting it on returned. Right after, he decided to put on the massive 4XL uniform, which was intended for an animal at least three times his size, even counting the close to 50 pounds he had put on from the first time he wore it. \"Now we need to get you some food and speed things along,\" John said. \"Stay right here, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John ventured into the forest to forage, Robin sat down on a stump and absentmindedly batted the massive uniform around. Holding it out to its full extension, he sighed as he imagined how large he'd need to get for it to fit. He continued doing this for only about five minutes before John returned, an armful of apples, berries and nuts in his arms. \"Rob, I've got your first course right here,\" the bear said, dumping the food next to the stump and returning into the woods to find more food. Feeling the effect of the necklace, Robin grabbed an apple from the pile and took a huge bite, crunching into it and savoring its juices. Over a period of about 15 minutes, he finished all of the fruit and nuts, pausing when he was finished and taking a glimpse downward at himself. The uniform still spread itself well beyond where his current weight lay, but when he grabbed two sides of it and pulled it back against his belly, Robin could see that his gut had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another moment later, John returned with...</span></div></div>",

So when Little John arrived back at the camp so soon after leaving, Robin wasn't prepared for what the bear with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle John complimented Robin on finishing the pile of fruit and berries, then told him his second course was already ready. To the fox's surprise and dismay, Little John pulled a large sack from behind his back. In it were two loaves of bread, half a sheet of cornbread and about a dozen large sweet roles drizzled in honey. \"C'mon, Robin, eat up,\" the bear said as he shoved a roll in the fox's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor more than an hour, Little John watched over the fox, making sure he ate every bite  before he'd let him do anything else. Robin half-heartedly shoved bite after bite of bread and roll after roll down his gullet, and if he waited more than 30 seconds between, the bear would shove another piece of cornbread into his mouth. This gradually went on until Robin, feeling ready to explode and unable to keep his eyes open, took a bite that led to John cheering. \"All right, Rob! You did it! In the morning, I'll go back to the baker and get your next meal. Until then, go to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin acquiesced willingly, content to slip into a deep, deep food coma, a grin almost forming on his lips while he grimaced at his full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Robin awoke as if he'd been asleep for a year, groggily coming to.

When the fox tried to put his tunic on, changing out of his clown clothes of a uniform, he found it simply didn't fit anymore.

The belt on the tunic, when he tried to fit it around his waist, hung uselessly in two directions, unable to come close to meeting ends.

Marian's bag was full of massive sweet rolls, dripping with honey and sugar, each one nearly the size of a discus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I heard Little John's plan with the baker, I threw in some of my own money so that we can make sure they're focused on your needs first! Here you go, Robin!\" Marian then shoved the first roll she could reach into the fat fox's mouth, making sure he took a big bite and watching him gulp it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery similar to the previous stuffing session, Marian and Little John kept watch over Robin for the next few hours, making sure that he finished one of the 24 sweet rolls every ten minutes without fail. By the end of the fourth hour, the rolls were depleted and the fox was quite bloated. In the course of the day, the fox's weight had skyrocketed another 75 pounds, pushing his overall weight to about 300 pounds. His body shook with every step he took, and from head to toe the changes were obvious. His second chin had begat a third, and his neck was shrinking, making his wider face more noticeable than ever. His chest was growing outward and his arms had become much more thick, to say nothing of his belly, which hung about a full foot off his frame. When Robin struggled back to his feet in the guard's uniform, there was clearly still some room to fill, but the garment now fit well enough that it didn't quite hang off his frame anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cycle continued like that for the next few days. Robin would sleep off a massive meal full of bread and pastries at night, and in the morning, Marian and Little John would be waiting with his next breakfast. The loads never again got quite as large as the two dozen rolls, but Robin fell asleep multiple nights in a row feeling like his stomach was about to explode. Creeping closer and closer to full fruition, Marian and Little John finally celebrated when Robin's form fully fit the guard's uniform...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the morning of the fourth day after Maid Marian had started joining in on the stuffing sessions, Robin yawned and slowly awoke, struggling to sit up and then slowly working his way to his feet, when he saw John and Marian celebrating about ten feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\", Robin said, before he himself felt it. The loose uniform, which had slowly felt a bit more form-fitting at the end of each day, wasn't loose anymore. In fact, it was slightly stretched across his belly and on his sides. He couldn't see himself fully, but the uniform - alternative shades of white, gray - suddenly felt like it belonged on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had undergone a full transformation in the past few days. Slowly but surely, chins were added to his face as his neck shrank. His chest was exaggerated yet somehow unsagging, though his gut hung about two feet out and down as well, kept in decent suspension around his waist due to the fabric having a bit less room than expected. His arms were round and thick, hanging off themselves no matter how the fox positioned his arms. His legs, from what he could tell, were also massive, thunder thighs and then some, though he could barely see past his belly. His butt did jut out a decent amount, and its padding meant he'd never sit on an uncomfortable chair again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've done it,\" Robin said, still melancholy about his transformation. Though he eventually came around to the massive eating challenges that Marian and John pushed him through, he still knew that his days as a sneaky, lithe archer were over for at least the next few years. Some aspects of being fat were actually fun - he felt bigger and stronger, possibly thanks to the necklace's powers, and Marian was surprisingly flirty no matter how big his belly got or how wide he had become - but it was also a new and uncomfortable chapter for the vulpine. \"What now, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle John, now a good 150 pounds lighter than the fox who he used to tower over, smirked. \"Let's get this plan in action!\", John said. \"Our first step should be to infiltrate the king's guard. If Marian can decorate it well enough, if we package the necklace in the right way, we can say it was given to Prince John as a gift. Then we can just sit back and watch the lion keep getting bigger until he can't even get up, much less tax the villagers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle John and Marian then told Robin to kneel, to which he barely managed to oblige. His stomach shifted uncomfortably, hanging nearly down to the ground and out past his knees. It was very difficult to remove Robin's necklace - it seemed the thing takes more of a liking to its wearer the longer they wore it - but twenty minutes later, they had succeeded. Robin and John left to see where they could slip into the guards' ranks easiest, while Marian stayed behind to prepare the necklace in the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the plans had gone swimmingly. John and Robin would alternatively report for a different king's guard shift, explaining that they were new hires. They were even able to give false names without a second thought - the other guards were clearly in it for the paychecks, as well as the large feasts held for them at the conclusion of each shift. Robin in particular caught flack from these feasts, as the other guards scoffed that a fox had become big enough to join the guard. As such, they goaded him into eating massive portions each night to \"keep up his figure,\" and while the gain was slow, he added another 20 pounds to his frame over the period of about five days. It wasn't very noticeable in context of his larger gain, but Robin could feel his uniform actually start to feel tight at times if he sat wrong or took in an entire deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had finally become time for them to risk bringing the necklace to John himself. They both figured the lion would recognize their faces, but Robin's face was about four times wider than it had ever been before. As a result, the two figured he would be safe bringing the necklace to the king, and he had his chance the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mid-day and Robin was about halfway done with his shift when he found he had been given direct guard duty outside of the king's quarters. He had been carrying the necklace in his back pocket. The necklace itself was inside a small box wrapped in a festive paper - a good enough design, Robin felt. When the fox had about an hour left on his shift, he summoned the nerve to knock on the king's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\", the king called from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, your highness sir, it's one of your king's guard, sir. I have a gift to present to you,\" Robin stammered out, suddenly getting slightly nervous. What if the plan didn't work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a second for his worry to pass, though, as John excitedly tittered. \"A gift for me? Come on in!\", the greedy lion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin walked into the king's quarters with the most dignified walk he could manage, difficult in his newly-gained 470-pound body, and launched into his best attempt at a story as he walked up to the throne, kneeled at the lion's feet and presented the king with the necklace. \"Sir, before I joined your guard I was but a simple farmer. When I was a boy, my mother trusted me with this necklace, and said that a previous king had saved her life when she herself was as young as I. She asked me, if I were to ever have the opportunity, to pass this necklace along to a great king, and so I give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince John paused for a moment, looking at Robin's fat face for longer than the fox was comfortable with, before finally saying...</span></div></div>",

It sickened Robin a little to say that John was great, or even a king in the first place, was \"great,\" but he knew exactly how to press John's buttons, and had been successful with the plan - doubly so when the king immediately put the necklace on in front of him, presumably because of his lust for gold. \"It's wonderful! Thank you... oh, what is your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped for a bit before coming up with the answer he thought the lion would be even happier to hear. \"Sir, you don't need to know my name, for I am just a humble guard in your employ, dedicated to the kingdom flourishing in any way possible,\" he said. The lion, predictably, was enthused from this story and thanked the fox once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his shift ended, Robin snuck away from the guard's quarters as fast as he could. This plan - this crazy, nonsensical plan - had actually succeeded to a point. When he returned to the camp, which had been expanded a bit due to Robin's newfound girth, Marian and John were ecstatic as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next week, Robin stayed away from the kingdom completely, not willing to risk any encounters with the Prince, mostly spending time with Maid Marian. Little John, meanwhile, regularly reported to shifts, and over the week's time, he had great news whenever he saw the lion. After a day, the notably thin lion had fulled out his robes just a bit. Apparently between then and the third day he had enjoyed a few large meals, as his weight started to grow at a faster pace. By the end of the week, the lion had added more than 75 extra pounds on his frame. What was even better - he was surrounded by so many yes men and people eager to please that he wasn't noticing himself balloon up to become overweight, then push the limits of obesity. What's more, as he grew, he became more one-track minded, wanting more food and entertainment and neglecting to guide the king's guard to collect any taxes. The plan had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the middle of the night, a shadowy figure turned the espionage tables on the foxes and bear.

His gut now hanged 3 feet down and out, his upper arms now the size of tree trunks in Sherwood Forest, lower arms more thicker but a little over halfway the size of his upper ones, his legs more massive than ever, more chins forming, the only differences this time is that his butt is bigger with each check the size of a watermelon, and his cheeks have gotten a little more rounder looking like a chipmunk shoving some nuts in its mouth. The fox keeps getting bigger. And the guard costume has certainly ripped with that amount of weight. His arms, stomach, legs have rips around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out of the table, he immediately headed to the closest powder room, despite the fact that he waddled instead of normal walking. He closed the door the powder room, looked at the mirror and at first gasped at what he saw. He later thought to himself, 'Can this be true? Am I really gaining that much weight?' He later realized why he ate all that food without that magical necklace. At first he thought 'Can you gain a lot more than you imagine if you have a bigger appearance - even without that necklace?'

John pulled a cart carrying the food and barrels of ale, but when he dropped it the loud sound woke up the Sheriff. With the Sheriff not knowing who he is, Little John spoke out \"Rough day, huh Sheriff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Now with the snake gone, the king is looking for a new right-hand man.\" The sheriff said while Little John was unloading the food from the cart. John first smiled about Sir Hiss' banishment. But turned upside down to a frown and a little nervous. \"He wanted the guard that gave him the necklace. But ran off early this morning. So I asked if I wanted to.\" With those words, Little John opened his eyes. \"And he said yes. So starting tomorrow, I will be his assistant. No longer collecting but recording taxes. Go on tours for the kingdom. I'll be his personal bodyguard.\" Little John now smiled and said (as he's setting down the food), \"Well, that's something to celebrate about\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebrate? What's all this food for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what you've just said. All this courtesy of Maid Marian.

A little more scruffier than Little John. Soon he will be saying goodbye to that little obese frame into becoming more obese. As soon as John says, \"Dig in!\" He immediately started with the meats, then soon after that he started on the meat pies filled with lard and butter. His stomach was starting increase in size. He went on to the buttermilk scones filled with delicious marmalade. Pudding, biscuits, cakes, all come and gone. When he started eating the pastries his stomach felt full but he wasn't finished yet.

Robin Hood,\" the king said, his stocky frame now imposing as the king displayed his disdain for his enemy. \"I should have known such a suck-up of a guard wouldn't have been telling the truth,\" he continued, occasionally gnawing on a turkey leg he held in his right paw. \"And you've won! To a point. You succeeded in making this king fairly regal, but I wouldn't want to be the only one having fun,\" he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook his head and felt what he hoped he would never have to wear again around his neck. The magic necklace had made its way back onto his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's worse was that a veritable smorgasboard of food surrounded him, just within arm's reach. The king had gone all out in preparing this meal, ordering his cooks to prepare what must have been a dozen cakes, countless pieces of meat, loaves upon loaves of bread, and even pitchers filled with cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin Hood, for an attempted attack against Prince John, you have been sentenced to hypnosis therapy,\" John said with a smirk as he turned and left the room, Hiss remaining right where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the snake used his hypnosis ability to catch the fox's full attention, and as much as he tried to fight, Robin gave in to his calls of \"gluttony\" and \"eat\" within a minute.

He immediately shoved a fistful of cake, then a second, into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could he be?!\", Maid Marian cried out.

His gut was even more pronounced but as he was still sitting against the wall, the width of the fox was what really took Marian aback - he was likely close to his height across at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got over her initial shock, Marian was lucky enough that Hiss was too busy gloating about his fortunes to pay attention to the area. Grabbing a frying pan and sneaking up behind him, Marian gave a mighty swing and immediately took down the snake, who slumped to the floor. Shoving his unconscious body in a cabinet and locking it, she then ran to Robin's side just as he snapped out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened... oh, no,\" Robin said, realizing how much bigger he had grown. Struggling, slowly, over a period of several minutes, he finally made it onto unsteady legs, hampered by his belly which sagged to the ground. As he twisted to stretch (as much as he even could), things got worse - the uniform ripped and tore in three different areas, making him look foolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Robin didn't have many plots left before he'd lose his mobility entirely.

Meanwhile, Robin continued to figure out how to best use his immense body and kept watch in the pantry, especially making sure Hiss wouldn't alert anyone to the area by pulling him out of the cabinet, stuffing an apron in his mouth and tying it around his mouth to muzzle him, and re-securing him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, Marian finally reappeared with John in tow, and though he seemed just as reluctant as Robin to get bigger, he put the necklace on.

I know you want to get out there and back us up, but they'll get you in a split second right now. Me and Robby... well, we've done this a bit more. Here,\" he said as he took off the necklace, \"hold onto this for us, so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. And stay safe, we don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and John turned (slowly) to leave, but not before Marion gave her massive boyfriend a peck on the cheek for good luck. And with that, they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two 600-pound animals were on the third floor of the castle, which meant they needed to go three floors up to reach John's quarters, where he almost definitely would be with the vast majority of the kingdom's gold. Of course, the castle's layout was sprawling and extensive, with staircases located almost haphazardly in different locations. They had a path, but knew it might take some time to finish it before they could reach their final goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had made it about a quarter of the way up to John's quarters when they finally ran into the first platoon of the king's guard - about half-a-dozen smaller, but still fat, animals under John's employ. It took about a minute for them to fend off the weasels, dogs and badgers coming toward them - surprisingly, their added weight made their punches extra powerful, making it easy to first knock back, then knock out, their opponents. Slowly, John and Robin became accustomed to fighting in their bulkier bodies, even bouncing the last unfortunate weasel standing between their bellies before finally letting him hit the wall at full speed, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they progressed deeper, crossing one staircase and a hall before a second fight, then another hallway before coming upon a third, they noticed the king had layered his guards by strength. By the third platoon, they weren't taking on smaller animals anymore - the weasels gave way to bulls and pigs, then elephants and rhinos. Each fight took longer, was more difficult, and eventually left Robin and John puffing at their bigger size. At the foot of the fifth-to-sixth floor staircase, they were matched against two hippos, each one matching their weights - after a marathon 15-minute battle, which culminated in a makeshift tag-team sumo battle, they both nearly fell to the ground in exhaustion after finally defeating their enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, though, they were one door and one staircase away from confronting their final enemy, the prince, and finally ending his reign of tyranny. After pausing for several minutes to rest, the fox and bear finally rallied and opened the door, only to discover another obstacle in their path.</span></div></div>",

Good to see you boys finally decided to put some meat on those bones, though you went a little far, huh? Y'all know that attempted treason is punishable by death in our little kingdom, right? While John's upstairs, I'm sure he won't mind if I'm your judge, jury and executioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stood in front of the two heroes. He, until very recently, was an even match for John and dwarfed Robin. Now, the bear didn't tower over him, but doubled his fram. Robin was even wider. Grinning, he drew a sword. \"En garde, you thieves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sheriff began swinging wildly at John and Robin, who, despite their size and exhaustion, were able to dodge his swipes easily. After just a few seconds, John rushed at the wolf, knocking him back and getting the sword out of his hand, forcing him to fight them hand-to-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for John and Robin, their former battles over the past several hours had left them unable to stand an extended battle, and though they tried to keep their feet, the Sheriff quickly gained the upper hand. Their swings were doubly slow due to both fatigue and their added size, and though he himself was by no means skinny, the wolf was able to dodge nearly all of them, only taking a few glancing blows. In contrast, the fox and bear struggled to avoid the wolf's swings and maneuvers - at half their size, he was twice as mobile. It took only a few minutes for a well-placed kick to knock Little John on his back - and the bear couldn't get up after, the extra weight holding him down. As he squirmed and shifted, trying desperately to regain his feet and get back into the fight, Robin and the Sheriff entered a lopsided fistfight. While low punches only bounced off Robin's massive belly, high blows were knocking the fox senseless. After a few more minutes, the wolf had exhausted Robin until he dropped to his knees, his entire body heaving as he gasped for air. The Sheriff sauntered over to his sword on the ground and lazily grabbed it, slowly putting it to the fat fox's throat. Robin faced the still-open door, hoping desperately for a savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin Hood, you are hereby accused of attempting to overthrow the monarchy. How do you plead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... never... you... know... John is... corrupt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Your new weight is making it hard to hear. I think... yeah, that's it, you said guilty, right? Well, Mr. Hood, do you have any last words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" a voice rang over the wolf's shoulder. When the Sheriff turned to see who disturbed his victory, a fist came flying at his face. With one sweeping blow, the wolf was laid out, knocked unconscious immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked up to see his savoir, and found it was Maid Marion. Thing is, something seemed different...</span></div></div>",

She looked much like Robin had earlier, during his marathon eating sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marian? What happened? Why did you wear the necklace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Robin, I did what you and John told me - I used stealth. No one would want to say a word against me, so I walked in plain sight around the castle, only to see the forces of the king's guard growing at every checkpoint. I knew that if I didn't do anything, you'd find yourselves in big trouble. The two of you rapscallions decided to clear out the pantry when I returned to put on the necklace, but luckily, the dairy was next door, and the farmers had just completed a big treatment of heavy cream. A few hours of drinking later, and I followed the trail of defeated guards to find you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin jumped to his feet - well, as much as he reasonably could at this size - and embraced Marian, who had just saved his life. The two struggled to kiss due to their new sizes, which made them both laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say I'm happy with our new status, but we might finally be able to stop that old John now,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Little John finally made it back to his feet. \"Who's stopping me?\", he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the three noticed the Sheriff seemed dangerously close to waking. \"I'll take care of that,\" John said, and took a seat right on the wolf's stomach.

He was about 120 pounds fatter than when he'd first been exposed to the necklace, clearly obese but dwarfed by the much fatter vulpines, and knew he'd met his match. As Robin and Marian converged on him, he began giving them offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me and I'll pardon you, Robin! I'll make you second in command, Marian! I'll do anything, just don't take the crown from me! Here, you know what you'll love? This is a special cake,\" he said, pushing a small and intricately-decorated treat toward the foxes. \"It was made specially for me by the bakers' coalition last month. They say it's made with the purest ingredients in the world and is the most filling food in the world. I'll give it to you free as a peace offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Marian said, \"that does sound tempting.\" She walked over to the treat and ran her paw through the icing, scooping some up. \"Ooh, that is good,\" she said. She reached in her pocket, pulled out the necklace and put it on before taking a full pawful and shoving it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot breaking eye contact with the king, Marian ate the cake as fast as she could, taking sloppy handfuls and shoving them into her mouth. As the cake quickly disappeared, every bite seemed to make her stomach even bigger as she thickened all over. By the time it was finished less than three minutes later, Marian had grown another 200 pounds, nearly catching up to Robin. She took her much-bigger gut and used it to shove Prince John into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to step down from the monarchy. You are to leave this area for good. If you don't, Robin and I will see to it that you rot in jail for the rest of your miserable life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, the lion nodded, and Marian backed off him. The lion morosely handed over the crown off his head, which Marian put on Robin's head. \"As the highest-acting member of the king's monarchy, I declare Robin the temporary king,\" she said with a smile before the two massive foxes embraced in a hug. They'd finally stopped the tyrant.</span></div></div>",

To test the theory, once they got to the jail cells, they threw the necklace around Robin's neck and, his hands restrained, found it easy to test its magic by stuffing a pastry into his mouth. Sure enough, even with his large size, the fox noticeably grew a just-noticeable amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were enthused by this development, and ran to tell John what they had discovered. Almost immediately, the call was sounded: instead of a traditional punishment, Robin would receive public humiliation to prevent him from ever stealing from the monarchy again. The news spread quickly and sadly among the town - Robin was to be held in a main room of the castle on public display. He would regularly be fed large portions and fattening foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarian and Little John worked quickly to devise a plan once they first heard of the plan, but by then the fox had been brought out to a sizeable crowd. Over a period of a few hours, guards and cooks would alternatively bring Robin slabs of meat, pitchers of milk and heaps of sweets. Try as he might, the magic of the necklace eventually prevented him from turning down any of the food. As his eating quickened, so did his weight gain. His baggy prison clothes slowly swelled with extra weight. Each day, it seemed the fox gained 50 pounds, and if this kept up for long, he'd be too big to even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarian and John finally devised a plan, but it found them taking a major risk.

It was at full harvest, with dozens of fruits hanging from branches and having fallen to the bed of grass below. Almost doubled over from hunger, the fox walked over to the tree's roots and grabbed a piece of the fruit. It appeared to be an orange, but it was much larger than traditional oranges were - one would barely fit in someone's palm. Deciding that now was as good as ever to have breakfast, Robin peeled the orange and took a bite, only for the sweet flavors to overwhelm his taste buds. The fruit felt strangely sugary in how sweet it was, but that made Robin just crave it more. He quickly finished the orange and grabbed another. Even stranger, he began feeling full after eating his third fruit, but he couldn't stop taking more and more. A half-hour passed as Robin ate orange after orange, finally finishing more than two-dozen of them around the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, Robin felt tired, but didn't quite realize the toll the fruit had taken on his body.</span></div></div>",

She bid the fox good morning, and explained her wares for the day. She had prepared several muffins and some regular breads, but what caught Robin's attention was her selection of pastries. She had made several different types - some large donuts, a few triple-chocolate muffins and, best of all, a small cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think about the words coming out of his mouth, Robin asked her how much it would cost for him to purchase all of her pastries for the day. She was taken somewhat aback at the direct query, but admitted she could let go of them for about 12 pieces of gold. In a flash, the fox presented the baker with 15, a total she happily accepted. She loaded the donuts, muffins and cake into a knapsack for Robin and wished him good day, shocked at her sudden payday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Robin scampered away from the city for a few minutes, coming to a huffing halt about five minutes after he had started running. His creeping bulk was the real culprit, but Robin figured he was just too hungry. Just as well, though, he had found himself before a secluded clearing, complete with a bed of leaves that the fox could relax in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping himself down on the ground, Robin's mouth started to salivate as he untied the knapsack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost overtaken by his appetite, the fox took a big bite of a donut to begin his feast of a breakfast. He immediately tasted its deliciousness, as it was glazed and stuffed with sweet buttercream. Eating as fast as he could but slow enough to savor the sheep's delicious recipe, he finished the first donut and immediately turned to the remaining three. Each one was more delicious than the last - next he had a chocolate glazed stuffed with jam, then two covered with fudge.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't incredibly large, maybe nine inches around, but it appeared to be thick with cream and sugar. The frosting on it was an even thicker chocolate butter, and when Robin took his first bite, he could not believe what his taste buds were experiencing. The cake was the most delicious thing Robin had ever tasted, and he at first only nibbled from one place and another. But those bites slowly gave way to appetite, hunger and greed, and the rest of the cake was gone in minutes, Robin blissfully leaning back into the leaves and falling into a blissful food coma with the last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, he had awoken, the forest still as beautiful as it had been before, and sat up. Well, he tried to. He had an unfamiliar blockage on his lap when he tried to get up from his lying position, and rolled to his side, only to feel the heavy shifting of his stomach. Robin couldn't believe what he was seeing. Not only was his tunic riding up on him nearly up to his waist, but a large belly was lying where his svelte self used to be. Struggling to his feet, the now-portly fox stumbled his way back to camp, his weight unfamiliar under his frame. Eventually, when he got there, he went straight for his mirror to look himself over. He was stunned - his frame had literally doubled in the last 24 hours. That 20 pounds he had gained overnight was nothing compared to what happened with his huge breakfast, as his arms were tight in their sleeves and flabby outside of them, the red fur covering them making them look even bigger. Robin had a definitive second chin and the beginnings of a third one, and his belly hung as much as eight inches off his frame. His legs had widened as well, as had his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Robin finally realized the properties of the coin he had stole, and sought to take it off his head. Strangely, he couldn't - he pulled and pulled for a second, but the string had shortened somehow since he had initially put it on, and the coin itself seemed almost magnetically attracted to him. The 250-pound fox started to worry and wonder about the fate he had put himself in.</span></div></div>",

Bolt thought about telling mittens and rhino but decided against it. Already two days in and Bolt's plan worked it was to eat as much as he can until he became fat. Bolt's plan was working until penny decided to monitor his food to two bowls a meal.

Bolt was brought out of hes trans by a familiar call \"come here bolt lunch time!\" he heard Penny yell from the kitchen. Bolt rushed over to the kitchen to see his favorite person holding a bowl of his favorite kibble in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Bolty hungry\" asked Penny as she set down the extra large bowl of dog kibble on the ground. You began to eat the food and slowly but surely finish it off. It was the first day Penny was home alone for a week while her mom went on a business trip. Bolt barked once and Penny was already filling up the second bowl of kibble. She set it down and sat next to you and began to rub you're slightly flabby back. She squeezed one of you're developing fat layers as she said \"I wish you could understand me so then I could tell you that I want you to be the fattest dog on earth.\" Bolt thought it over and made a goal for himself. To be the biggest and fattest dog on earth. Later that afternoon Bolt approached Mittens and Rhino and told him their plan.

(Knowing that all gorilla's are somewhat chubby in shape.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Terk?\" Tantor asked. \"I was just about to ask you the same thing, but what has happen to you?\" Terk asked, surprised to see her friend suddenly gained so much weight. \"What do you mean?\" Tantor asked pretending to not know, feeling a bit embarrassed over how he looked. But he could see in the face Terk was giving him that trying to hide his extra weight was down right impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.\" Terk said and poked the soft elephant belly fat with her finger. \"I seriously don't know! Ever since I got here I have been trying to find my way out, and somehow that has left me ending up like this.\" Tantor said, sounding scared over the thought of him continuing to gain without a way to stop it. \"Well, at least <b>I</b> know how to make sure to keep my body in shape...\" Terk said before patting herself on her stomach, and getting a big soft \"pat\" back. Looking down she saw that she also had got a bit of a gut that wasn't there moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. This place is freaking me out!\" Terk said, not believing her own extra paunch that she now had. \"If only there was a way for us to get out of here.\" Tantor said, whimpering. Seeing a big tower like building shot up through the fog roof gave Terk an idea. \"I will get up there, and see where the closest exit is.\" She said before starting to climb the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tantor waited down on the ground, Terk made her way up to the top of the tower. Being an experienced climber should mean that she could do this without any problems, but with her new hanging belly getting in the way sometimes was giving her more of a challenge. And that wasn't all. The extra weight was making her tired much more easily, forcing her to make several stops on the way up. And given the rule of the fog making you fatter for every single little breath you take, you can only imagine how much Terk's big breathes of air was affecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much climbing Terk finally reached the top and could for the first time get a really good look over the place. It was much larger then what she remembered, but thanks to the great height of the tower she could see that a few miles away in the west from where they were there could be seen a great line to where the city ends and the jungle starts. \"If we just go in that direction all the time we should reach it fairly quickly.\" Terk thought as she was making her way down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought getting down was easier then getting up it didn't feel like that to Terk, and that was mostly thanks to the many extra pounds she had gained under her climb. And as she was climbing down sometimes she nearly lost her grip as the heavy weight of her body was pulling her down. She felt like she was that lazy male of the gorilla pack that did nothing but eating bananas all day and getting really fat. \"This must be how it would have probably looked if he had to climb this.\" She thought as she was getting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the bottom back again Terk now (Thanks to the fog) had been gaining...</span></div></div>",

She also felt her arms and legs being less muscular then when she started, and her chins and neck felt a lot more swollen around her head.

A tribe just like most others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not as much as other tribes. Unlike other tribes these ones had been having a obsession of worshiping the animals of the jungle, or rather the animals of the jungle that had some extra weight put onto them. But since there wasn't many unnaturally fat amount of creatures in the wild, the tribe used to trick some animals into their city to have it feed to the limits, and later become more pudgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did it to all kinds of animals like Elephants, Gorillas, Jaguars, Snakes, Bird, and much more. They did it since they thought the fatter the beasts where, the more luck they would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that proved to be very wrong, as only focusing on finding animals and feed them a lot leaved them open for other tribes to attack them. And that's just what happen. When the men of the tribe was out \"hunting\" animals to take back to the village, members from other tribes had sneaked in and killed everyone inside it. They then waited for the men to return before taking care of them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now their spirits still haunts the place, and while they wont make any appearances for any humans walking around, they will come out when they notice any animals inside their area, and they will make sure to try and please them like the animals they had tried pleasing before, and make this place their home...for the rest of their lives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the now very obese Elephant and Gorilla heading towards to exit the city wasn't something they where very pleased with, and they would make sure to keep them here. While their greatest powers where to make the air they breathed more fat filled, they did had the ability to momentarily make parts of their bodies \"whole\" instead of transparent. They knew that this would be enough if they did it in the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tantor was walking and Terk was walking slightly in front of him, the ghost used it's moment to make it's hand visible and tap Terk on the back. Before Terk had a chance to look back and see the hand, the ghost made it invisible again, and that left the gorilla to think that it was Tantor doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anything.\" Tantor said, simply not knowing what had been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you have to tap me on the back with your trunk?\" Trek asked, sounding a bit more annoyed this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done anything with my trunk.\" Tantor said, even he starting to sound slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling for having a any longer pointless arguing Terk moved behind Tantor, just to simply avoid being touched by his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's when the ghosts decided to change it up a little, and instead the ghost hand now took and grabbed the huge elephant's rump. (And like when it had touched Terk earlier, the gorilla female did notice when it's touched her elephant friend.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long time for Tantor to notice it, and he quickly turned around to face Terk. (And the ghost hand once again disappeared before any of them had time to see it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that!\" He said, sounding more upset then he has ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was what?\" Terk asked not knowingly. (But her way of saying it, made it sound like she was <i>acting</i> not knowingly.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first pretend that I touched your back with my trunk, and then immediately after you take one of your big gorilla hands and grabs my butt!\" Tantor shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not even looked at your big butt!\" Terk said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with your eyes, no.\" Tantor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the attitude you are giving me?\" Terk asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You</b> are the one to talk about attitude.\" Tantor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't like it we don't even have to walk together!\" Terk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just at that moment they reached a fork in the road. There was a left road, and a right road to choose from. The walls where to big to Tantor to look over, and Terk was to fat to climb over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the left road should be the right one.\" Tantor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just because of that I think the right one is the correct one to pick.\" Terk answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they both hated each other to no end at the moment they both decided to continue walk the road they picked. (Both to get out as quick as possible, and to also have to avoid walking with the other one.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghosts loved this as it now meant that it would be much easier to keep them both trapped inside here forever.</span></div></div>",

Then- Tantor felt everything on him shake, first his belly, then his ass, and the rest of his body shook. He felt like an earthquake surged through his body. Villagers gasped and screamed. The shock the earthquake caused on the elephant made him let a stream of farts and burps erupt from both ends. Of course Tantor had zero control over his gas. 'Ughhhhh, 'scuse me!' He thought. 'Oh no....' Tantor felt it coming...He started to sweat...the gas seemed to never stop...and then- he surged forward with flab! Everything on his body began to swell. His butt, his belly, even his trunk!!! His trunk grew to the size of three houses and it crashed through the ruins, growing longer and larger at it smashed through jungle and stone. Though, the object placed on his trunk was still small. His stomach was like an ocean. Ruined houses, trees, and water felt his flabby wrath. It was fizzing with magic inside so his burps and farts were rapid and literally every 5 seconds. As he grew it became more of a stream of jets burning his butt and his hidden moulth. They were loud too. It could probably be heard from over 70 miles away.<br>\r\nHis legs retreated into his sides but the were still growing larger as well. His growing behind sprung him up so he could sit on his MASSIVELY OBESE buttock. Behind him, everything felt his butt's wrath. He cringed every time he felt it cover something. His behind caused his 1000000000000000000000000000000 pound legs to crush already broken buildings below him. His 100000000 rolls of chins spilled onto the floor, creating a sea of flab that not even the bravest sailors could make it through without being covered. His cheeks didn't need any detail. They were huge, ok? <br>\r\nAnd inside this mountain of flab Tantor sat there. Embarrassed of what he'd become. 'Will this ever end?!'

It was only his first week and he was already half asleep. <br>\r\n\"Who knew so many people want ice after, y'know all that mess...\" Kristoff laughed, Sven grunted an \"I don't know\" grunt. \"C'mon buddy, a few more to go...\" Kristoff hacked the ice with extreme strength with his pick axe, working hard cutting through the thick layer of ice that was the lake the buddies were standing on.<br>\r\nSven on the other hand, had no reason to be tired, he was just plain lazy. He didn't care if the ice got back safe or not, he just wanted carrots. <br>\r\nAs Kristoff hauled the last block of ice onto the sleigh, something snapped. <br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" He gasped, running to the cause of the noise. \"Aw man, looks like this...thingamabober came off...oh well, we'll fix it when we get back. Now run Sven!\" <br>\r\nSven galloped through the snow swiftly and gallantly for about 5 seconds. The sleigh began to tip over while he was running.<br>\r\n\"Looks like that thingamabober was important after all.\" Sven's human companion wondered. <br>\r\nThen, BANG CRASH  SMASH! <br>\r\nKristoff and Sven went tumbling down a large snowy hill, sleigh and all. <br>\r\nWhen Sven regained consciousness, it was all a blur, all he remembered was falling down the hill then he was there, at the bottom of a large hill stuck in the snow.<br>\r\nSven grunted annoyed, and struggled to get himself out from the snow but succeeded in the end. Sven's mild annoyance changed to worry when he didn't spot Kristoff anywhere in the debris of the sleigh. Sven began to freak out, but he realized it was almost nighttime so he had to find shelter quick. <br>\r\nA little ways away the reindeer found a small cave with blue ice coating the inside like a nice, blue lair. Sven wandered inside, peering at the frozen stalactites and stalagmites with awe. Sven ventured deeper into the den, hoping not to come across any bears or wolves already living inside. It seemed completely empty for the most part, the only exception of life in the cave was him. The reindeer soon realized he was hungry, and started to remember Kristoff bringing him carrots and such. Sven didn't dare go outside at an hour like this, something would for sure eat him before he eats. So he wandered the cave hoping to find anything edible, and then, there it was. <br>\r\nThe most perfect glistening icy blue berries dangling on a branch above Sven's head. They almost seemed like they were glowing he was so hungry. Without hesitation, the reindeer kept into the air, teeth biting the branch, snapping it, and the reindeer falling on his bottom. At least he got the berries. Sven ate the berries in one sitting, they were horribly bitter, but at least it was something. Then the reindeer closed his eyes, and fell asleep.  </span></div></div>",

She goes to a river to hunt for some fish. Today seem to be a lucky day. The river was flowing with tons of fish. Most of them were jumping out of the water.

So much fish.\" Vixey said. \"I'll be sure to catch quite a bit for Tod and I.\" Vixey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixey then started diving into the water and catching the fish.

Maybe I went a little overboard.\" Vixey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled even louder than before. She caught fish, but didn't ate any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving.\" Vixey said.

More than usual.\" Vixey said happily. \"So I caught a whole bunch for us. But then I got hungry and ate them all. So to make up for it, I was gonna catch you this BIG tuna. Like HUGE tuna.... and I did. But then it was trying to get back to the water. One way or the other, I wasn't gonna it get away. So..... I picked the other. It right in here.\" Vixey said as she patted her belly. It still squirmed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod was a bit downfounded that Vixey had such an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I... suprised.\" Tod said not knowing what to make of this.<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry.\" Vixey said. \"I did tried to save you some.\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay. You didn't have to go to so much trouble.\" Tod said. \"I would have been fine with just one fish.\"<br>\r\n\"That's.... sweet of you to say.\" Vixey said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her belly continued to groan with the Tuna still moving inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?

Her cheeks were round like tennis balls. Her neck was thicker as well. Lastily was her belly. Three words that could describe it was huge, wide, and round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had shrunken a bit, but it was pretty large ball of white fur. Actually, it more of an oval shape since it stretched to her sides. She was still mobile, even if her belly was touching the ground. After standing for a moment, her belly growled again.

Due to her current size, she wanted to do her best not to overeat this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had such a big bounty before, she went back to the river.

He and the rest of the guardians were on the trail of a nafarious villain that went by the name \"The Chef.\" He was known for going to planets with the early stages of life and harvesting anything on them; plants, animals and the occasional rock, and then cook it. This was extremely damaging to any emerging life so they had to put a stop to it.<br>\r\nThey landed on a planet know only as DHC8T2A, a young life bearing planet. And judging by the trail of destruction nearby their landing zone, the newest victim of The Chef. Following the relatively simple path to a seemingly complex cave system the guardians decided to split up with the intention of calling the others if they found The Chef.<br>\r\nRocket went down his path and within half an hour picked up a strange scent, he followed the scent to a dead end...but his keen eyes saw small scratch marks on the ground and he was able to push a boulder away from the wall and reveal a small, but well lit, hidden passage.<br>\r\nStepping into the chamber that the passage led too Rocket came face to face with The Chef. The Chef was a small, only a head taller than rocket, fluffy neon orange monkey like creature with 3 eyes. Around the chef were various plants and animals, a large sack, a bubbling cauldron, and a roaring fire. How he was ventilating Rocket would never know/<br>\r\n\"Ah, a new critic to taste my wonderful delicacies!\" The creature said with a smile, revealing his large fangs.<br>\r\n\"The only thing I'm going to be tasting is whatever the hell I buy after getting the money for busting you, you murderous scumbag!\" Rocket replied, pulling out one of his trusty weapons.<br>\r\nThe Chef merely grabbed a handful of green powder from his sack and threw it into rocket's face. Rocket's eyes watered and then he sneezed but besides that nothing unusual happened.<br>\r\n\"The hell was that?\" Rocket asked. Only to be brought to his knees a moment later by the most intense hunger he had ever felt in his life. His mouth started to water as his nose suddenly picked up all sorts of smells he didn't notice at first. He took a couple steps towards the cauldron. \"What...what are you making?\" He asked, letting go of the weapon he was holding.<br>\r\n\"Just some stu.\" The Chef grinned. \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Rocket cried, getting ready to get on his knees and beg for it.<br>\r\nThe Chef took out a large ladle and a large wooden bowl and served it up for Rocket.<br>\r\nIt was the best thing he had ever tasted.<br>\r\n\"This is the best thing I've ever tasted!\" Rocket exclaimed, quickly gulping down that serving and two more.<br>\r\nThe Chef was very eager to serve Rocket, and he did so with much gusto before the rest of the Gaurdians arrived and quickly shut down his kitchen.<br>\r\nRocket laid there craddiling his engorged stomach. He stifled a belch and slowly stood up and followed the others out of the cave and towards the ship. However; he would stop every few feet to sample some plant life. When the others noticed this Groot had to pick him up and carry him the rest of the way; but not before Rocket broke off a piece of Groog and sampled it.<br>\r\nNow standing in front of the mirror Rocket knew two things. One; that he had gained weight. And Two;...</span></div></div>",

It quickly filled up space and it seemed to effortlessly absorb furniture/servants into its mighty bulk. Beast felt his ass grow and flap in the wind behind him. He felt like a machine gun of gas. Belching and farting often. His ass doubled, tripled its size before it had begun to weigh him down. Sticking out of the castle were two massive, rippling globes that seemed to be expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast's girth had overflown the whole castle at this point. And the castle's brittle shell was ready to burst. </span></div></div>",

She couldn't imagine what this hulking creature could do to her Papa. But the creature's main asset was his plump belly stretching outwards and down. It jiggled with every step he took closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take my Papa's place.\" Belle spoke strongly to the monster. <br>\r\nThe Beast scowled, \"Fine, take him to the village.\" He demanded two gargoyles to take him away. Belle reached out to her Papa but didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beast dragged her through the long hallways and winding spires of the castle until he showed her the room she would be staying in.<br>\r\nBelle creaked open the door, it was a quaint room, but a nice one. Tapestries hung on the walls of royalty and mythical creatures. <br>\r\n\"Now I expect you to be down for dinner in an hour, that is not a request it is a requirement. Do not disobey my orders otherwise I'll throw you in the dungeon. Do you understand?\" The Beast spoke sternly to Belle as he stared her down, then he slammed the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle cried, first her Papa now a monster has imprisoned her?! Then a kind voice spoke:<br>\r\n\"Cheer up dear, things aren't always as bad as they seem.\" She spun around to see a teapot smiling at her. <br>\r\n\"W-who are you?!\" Belle gasped, \"You're a teapot...and you're talking!\" <br>\r\n The teapot giggled, \"I'm Mrs Potts dear, now I hope we'll be friends, but in just a few minutes the master expects you to be down for dinner. So we better get you dressed.\"<br>\r\nJust then, a very large wardrobe waltzed her way to Belle and Mrs Potts, <br>\r\n\"Madame de la grande Bouche darling, pleased to meet you.\" She spoke in a loud booming voice, but nowhere near as loud as the Beast who ran the castle.<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get you dressed, aha this dress used to fit me, let's see if it fits you...\" Madame threw a humongous baggy dress onto Belle, it probably could fit a cow. <br>\r\n\"Aha perfect!\" Madame sang. <br>\r\nBelle stared at the dress, it was so large it covered her feet. \"Now, Madame I'm afraid this dress is far too big.\" <br>\r\nMadame laughed, \"Of course it is! Every night the master expects you to eat every single morsel on your plate, the dress will fit perfectly when you're done with dinner. <br>\r\nBelle didn't really know what that meant, but before she could speak Madame pushed her out the door. <br>\r\n\"Good luck honey!\" <br>\r\nAnd before Belle knew it she was sitting at an overflowing table filled with food as she stared at the Beast.</span></div></div>",

He reached out and stuffed some cake into his maw, he was eating quickly and sloppily.<br>\r\nLumiere realized what was going on so he rallied the troops from the kitchen and sent them to the dining room to stuff the Beast in the form of an assembly line. <br>\r\nThe Beast opened his mouth wide as plates upon plates of food were dumped down his throat. <br>\r\nThe Beast groaned with gluttony, he rubbed his swelling tummy as the food slid down his throat. He was beginning to plump up quite nicely, his cheeks becoming the size of large oranges as he chewed. He grabbed his gut and plopped it on the table so it would be more comfy. It had taken up more than half of the table at this point, and it was still growing. His ass was swelling as well and riding up the chair behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle stared at him in awe as he continued to gorge himself, she couldn't take any more of it. She slowly got up from her chair and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRRAAAAAAAP!\" The Beast belched, \"Where do you think you're going?!\" <br>\r\n\"Far away from here!\" Belle yelled back at the overweight Beast, then she ran off. </span></div></div>",

And yes, I am COMPLETELY serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Judy sat stunned and stared at her new boss.

Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After staring for a second, Judy straightened herself up. \"Yes, Chief. I do, Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Chief nodded once. \"Good. Now get outta my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Judy got up, and walked out of the Chief's office. As she was leaving, she inhaled deeply, and sighed. She knew what was going on. Nobody liked that there was a bunny on the force, and Bogo figured if he gave her an impossible task, it'd be the easiest quickest way to get her out of his building, permanently. Judy groaned in defeat. Then she thought... all her life, she was told her ambitions were impossible. But she proved everyone wrong, and worked past it all. She showed her parents, she showed Gideon Grey, and she'd show Chief Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he wants me to weigh five hundred pounds...\" she muttered to herself, as she marched off with a new spring in her step. \"I'll weigh a thousand.

They'd had yesterday's case locked up, or so it seemed - stopping a simple heist at the bank. Nick's driving skills and Judy's ability to keep a tail on the getaway car were enough for them to be there when it careened into a fire hydrant and lost a vehicle. When the robbers themselves - an elephant and a hippo - slowly started taking off on foot, the cops had gotten cocky and pursued on foot instead of waiting for backup. Once they'd cornered the two huge animals in an alleyway, it seemed like a routine arrest... until the hippo simply body-slammed Nick as he approached with a Taser, knocking the fox out against a wall. Judy put up a fighting chance against the elephant, but he'd managed to take every blow she could give - it was like taking on a pile of bricks. Exhausted, she crumpled down next to Nick, who was just coming to, as Officer McHorn and the rest of the cavalry arrived and made short work of the robbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when they arrived at Bogo's office just after the meeting's end, they expected to get reamed out. Bogo was surprisingly civil to them - mostly because he had an offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps, Wilde, don't get me wrong. You're two of the better officers on this force by far. But instances like yesterday simply cannot happen. Not only did you almost compromise your case, but you both were at huge risk. Judy, Nick, I understand you're two of our smallest patrollers by far, but I'm not sure I can allow you to continue putting yourselves in danger. Judy, your poor parents are emailing me every third day, asking for you to go back on parking duty. And I might need to do that -\" he was cut off by the rabbit's combination of screaming and moaning - \"unless you're willing to work with me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was still shocked by the prospect of parking duty, so Nick followed up. \"What's your idea, Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to make you two bigger. Sturdier. Able to take some hits. And I think... well, I've thought about putting you on a workout plan, but I don't think either of you can bulk up like our cat officers. But, speaking of cats, I remembered that time Clawhauser was the only person in the lobby when that bear went savage, and he was able to wrestle him down surprisingly easily for a cat of his size. And that might be a viable solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy were confused. \"I'm not sure I follow,\" Judy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm gonna pull you off the force for a few weeks, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want you two to get fat,\" the water buffalo replied. \"It'll give you extra cushion in fights, it'll stop you from being pushed around so much... it could work. If it doesn't, we'll try something else. But please give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy were still just as confused. The three sat in silence for an uncomfortably long time, until Judy finally said...</span></div></div>",

Thank you for understanding. I've already approved both of you for a month of paid time off the normal force. I've already informed Clawhauser of the situation, and he was willing to help, so report to him in the time being. You're dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fox and rabbit walked from Bogo's office to the front desk, they discussed what they'd just agreed to. \"Carrots, this is the best job I've ever had and I want to keep it, but I can't wrap my head around this thing,\" Nick said. \"What do they expect us to do? And are you really OK with getting huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it does seem strange,\" Judy replied. \"Really strange. But Bogo actually likes us. He would have reamed us out if he didn't. So I'd rather stay in his good graces, even with as weird as this idea is. And hey, a month of free PTO? A slacker like you can't turn that down,\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled back. \"Well, you've got me there,\" he said. \"Let's just hope this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at Clawhauser's desk, where the cheetah was beaming. \"Chief told me about the plan! I'm so excited! This is going to be so much fun!\", the big cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're excited about this?\", Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser laughed. \"Of course, silly! For the next month I get paid to hang out and eat nonstop with my two favorite members of the force! What's not to love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, what exactly is the plan?\", Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah responded by pulling out two boxes of donuts. \"Well, for starters, we're going to sit and chat while you two each finish one of these boxes,\" he said. \"You might be surprised to learn there's some fun to be had at this size. Plus, who doesn't love chowing down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took each of the animals a seeming eternity to choke down their boxes of donuts. Clawhauser had gotten them from one of the boutiques for larger animals, so each one was nearly the size of Judy's head. Both Nick and Judy couldn't deny how tasty each sweet was - Boston Creme, chocolate glazed, blueberry cream and vanilla-caramel blend, to name a few - but the rabbit was already full after her third, and Nick was full up after his fifth. Clawhauser wasn't about to let things end there, as each leaned back in their chairs and rubbed their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief didn't give me time off for nothing! You're gonna keep going!\", the cheetah said, and with each flabby paw he grabbed two more donuts out of the box and shoved them into his friends' faces. Begrudgingly, Judy and Nick kept chewing and chewing, cajoled into it by the cheetah's insistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day, the boxes were empty and the small mammals had never been more stuffed. Both of their stomachs left outlines against their uniforms, which had tightened slightly around their waists. Almost sleepwalking with exhaustion as they began to meander home, they cringed when Clawhauser called out after them, \"we're doing milkshakes tomorrow!\"</span></div></div>",

When he looked around, he was already at work. <br>\r\n\"I must of passed out last night.\" Said Benjamin, wiping away a pile of drool that filled his desk.<br>\r\nThe cheetah noticed that boxes upon boxes of donuts were scattered throughout the office. None of them were in the trash can. <br>\r\nThe chubby feline grabbed three donuts at once in his desk and shoved them into his maw. <br>\r\n\"Mmm...now that I've had breakfast, I'm ready for work.\" He didn't question anything, the donuts everywhere, no one in the police station, and he didn't even seem to really care, he just sat there with an ecstatic smile on his pudgy face as he waited for someone to arrive. <br>\r\nAnd he waited, and waited, and waited, for three hours straight. But no one arrived. <br>\r\n\"This is very odd...\" The cheetah scratched his head with his claw in confusion. \"No one's here!\" It finally hit him, no one was in the office. <br>\r\nThankfully, in case of extreme emergency, Chief Bogo left his phone number on the wall just in case something terrible happened, because the Chief didn't trust Clawhouser 100%. <br>\r\nSo the wild cat picked up the phone at his desk and began to dial the number. <br>\r\n\"555-555-5555\" he repeated to himself, hoping not to screw up. Suddenly he stopped, \"Oh no, what's the rest of the number? Oh yeah!\" <br>\r\n\"Chief Bogo, yeah this is Benny, I'm scared and confused and why is nobody here? Thank you. AHHHHHHHHH!\" He screeched into the phone at last second, realizing something. <br>\r\nHe was huge. <br>\r\nWell bigger than he was before. <br>\r\nHis clothes were close to tearing off, his gut almost scraped the floor, his tail was dwarfed by the two massive jiggling orbs that bounced behind him every movement he made, his arms and legs were thicker like sausages, and his cheeks had grown as big as baseballs with a second chin to compliment it. <br>\r\n\"How could it be? I'm fatter, then before!\" The large cheetah tried to waddle out of his desk, but it seemed to close in around his girth, he didn't realize it, but his seat had broken a while ago so he was sitting on the floor while he was asleep. As much as he twisted and turned, he couldn't escape. <br>\r\nSuddenly-</span></div></div>",

Volkovoi was slightly disappointed.  He was a wolf, and only a bit out of shape.  He might have been in the lower-middle quintile of his class in fitness, but he could still run; and he seriously doubted that his partner would be able to.  Officer Clawhauser\u2019s uniform looked a bit tight on the cheetah, and the man\u2019s face looked like pumpkin.  Almost as soon as they were in the surveillance room, Clawhauser opened a box of donuts.  But he paused for a moment before he offered Volkovoi the wolf\u2019s pick ofthe donuts.  Volkovoi went for a plain glazed; chocolate would make him stir-crazy and he knew it.  The coffee alone already was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clawhauser smiled and took a chocolate one.  The two finished their first donuts, then their third\u2014there were only six total\u2014before Clawhauser spoke first.  \u201cSo, Officer Volkovoi, that\u2019s your name right? Good, what brings you here?\u201d Volkovoi leaned back, stretched, and smiled.  \u201cPlease, call me Ivan, Officer Clawhauser; you\u2019re the superior here.\u201d  Clawhauser laughed openly at that, causing Volkovoi to stop and frown before Clawhauser interjected, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that notion is too funny for me to entertain yet.  No, this relationship will be friend-to-friend as long as I\u2019m in charge.\u201d  Volkovoi smiled; his harsh features\u2014his eyes, lips, chest\u2014relaxed noticeably.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dBut anyway, as I was saying, I\u2019m here because I have experience with cyber-security,\u201d Volkovoi smiled.  He didn\u2019t say anything further, but Clawhauser immediately understood what he had meant.  \u201cSo you\u2019re here because of a plea deal because they know that you\u2019re a cyber-criminal?\u201d  Volkovoi winced, \u201cI was.\u201d  Clawhauser laughed: \u201cDonmt worry, man, your secret\u2019s safe here.  I\u2019m here because I was once caught trying to wiretap the mayor\u2019s office, back when I was young and fit.\u201d  Volkovoi laughed, but Clawhauser frowned and pulled out his phone.  \u201cHere,\u201d Clawhauser showed the wolf a picture of a thin Cheetah who was unmistakably Clawhauser in the face.  Was Clawhauser a photoshop God?  But he was with someone, and you couldn\u2019t really photoshop that too well.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDamn,\u201d Volkovoi laughed, \u201cyou really were!\u201d  Volkovoi looked at himself; he had a small little gut that formed when he sat.  \u201cI can\u2019t ever really claim I was fit,\u201d the wolf admitted finally.  Clawhauser smiled, \u201cI get it; life\u2019s hard.  Just smile and move on.\u201d  They turned to the cameras.  All this surveillance; they were looking for someone.  \u201cSo just who are we looking for?\u201d Volkovoi asked.  Clawhauser smiled.  \u201cI guess, here, familiarize yourself with these guys and help me look for them.\u201d  Clawhauser then handed Volkovoi a sheaf of about 20 pages or so of criminal records for various people.  Volkovoi quickly looked through them, spending about a minute learning each of their names, faces, identities, etc. In the meantime Clawhuaser opned a family-sized bag of potato chips and placed it between the two of them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was done analyzing the files, Volkovoi noticed that Clawhauser had opened a bag of potato chips that he shared willingly with Volkovoi.  Volkovoi smiled and took a pawful and took them while he looked for the suspects in the city security footage.  It was mentally taxing work, and Clawhauser gave the wolf various tips on how to scan the cameras for faces methodically and not taxingly.  Suddenly, Volkovoi noticed someone who looked suspiciously like one of the suspects on the wanted list.  This guy, Evan Pasturefield, was a registered sex-offender who had violated parole and had been untracked since he had violated parole.  Clawhauser huffed, \u201cLook at that; his car even has the stereotypical look of a pimp car\u2014what with the magenta custom wheels and everything.  Call the Chief.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volkovoi nervously picked up the phone and called the chief\u2019s office number.  One ring. Two rings.  \u201cYes, Clawhauser, what is it?\u201d  \u201cAh, sir, this is Officer Volkovoi, we think\u2014we think we found Evan Pasturefield\u2014the one who violated parole.\u201d  Bogo snorted, \u201cAnd where is he?\u201d  Volkovoi nervously looked at Clawhauser, who told him, \u201cAt the corner of, uh, 7th and Mongolia.\u201d  Clawhauser facepalmed himself, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, 7th and Magnolia\u2014Magnolia, not Mongolia.  I misspoke, sorry, sir.\u201d  Bogo laughed, \u201cIvan, on my first day, I dipped my tie in my coffee.  At least you didn\u2019t do that.  Wilde\u2019s in the area; he\u2019ll be on it in a minute.\u201d  And Bogo hung up.  Volkovoi set the phone down gingerly.  That was embarrassing.  At least he hadn\u2019t dipped his tie in his coffee.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volkovoi then realized he was parched, so he asked Clawhauser if he wanted anything to drink, and Clawhauser smiled.  \u201cI\u2019ll have some Mountain Up if there\u2019s any in the fridge.  There was some in a 2-Liter in the fridge in the lounge\u2014where the coffee is\u2014that\u2019s for general consumption.\u201d  Volkovoi nodded and trotted off to the lounge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he arrived, Volkovoi found the fridge stocked with a panoply of 2-Liters of seemingly every variety of soft drink he knew of.  He stood in front of the door before he noticed.</span></div></div>",

Pouring what each wanted into his and Clawhauser\u2019s tumblers, Volkovoi moved to put the drinks back in the fridge before he noticed Judy, who was standing indecisively at the fridge.  \u201cYou\u2019re letting all the cool air out, Officer Hopps,\u201d Ivan tutted.  Suddenly, Judy wheeled on Ivan and snapped, \u201cSo?\u201d  Ivan didn\u2019t know what to say.  The coldness of the response had stunned him.  \u201cGeez, lighten up.\u201d  Suddenly, Judy sprnag back and grabbed the wolf by his tie.  She was obviously going for the throat, but the size mismatch was too much.  Still, she managed to grab  the back of the tie and pull as she came down, which started to choke Ivan.  But Ivan gently pried Judy\u2019s fingers off his tie and properly loosened it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNow, do be civilized, Officer Hopps,\u201d Volkovoi smiled, genuinely this time.  How, he wondered, could she take anyone down?  He genuinely worried for her.  If some predator got hold of her, he\u2019d tear her to shreds.  People said that was discriminatory, but wasn\u2019t that just a fact of life?  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended you, Judy; but I was merely joking with you the same way you did with me.  It\u2019s a two-way street here.\u201d  Before she could respond, Volkovoi left.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in the surveillance room, Clawhauser was smiling, \u201cLook, Ivan, look!  There\u2019s a chase!  Nick and a few others are chasing that bastard all over town.\u201d  But he didn\u2019t need to explain because the wolf noticed immeidately what was going on.  Ivan smiled.  They had him.  Suddenly, the fugitive took a sharp right an intersection and floored the accelerator.  Following them on camera, Volkovoi had yet to figure out why the pig was only suddenly accelerating.  The chase took a series of sharp lefts and right down a series of allies that Clawhauser and Volkovoi thought Nick nor Pasturefield was able to make, much less in rapid succession before they reached what appeared to be the beggining of a suburban cul-de-sac.  Suddenly, it appeared that in the distance the pavement was moving.  Why hadn\u2019t someone riding with Nick shot at the bastard yet?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the reason emerged: she was young\u2014an antelope by look\u2014and beautiful.  But she had a gun to her head by one of the bastard\u2019s stooges.  He and the leopard were eating the chips like popcorn, Volkovoi realized.  And they were nearing the bottom of the bag.  Volkovoi smiled.  It wasn\u2019t even lunchtime. His focus then shifted back to the action.  The pavement had in fact moved.  And they were nearing the closing hole.  \u201cWilde, your car isn\u2019t gonna make it!\u201d Volkovoi yelped into the radio.  \u201cClawhauser, I\u2019ll be fine.  Are you ok?\u201d  Volkovoi rolled his eyes again.  \u201cIt\u2019s Volkovoi, but you\u2019re not going to make it!\u201d  And the pig did, but Wilde\u2019s car didn\u2019t.  The pig accelerated at just the right time.  It was a science to him at this point, it seemed.  Not hitting the parked cars in the turnaround was the scariest part of the whole encounter.  But Wilde didn\u2019t hit any of them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGeez, that guy\u2019s nuts!\u201d Ivan seethed to Clawhauser, who only smiled, \u201cyeah, but he\u2019s as good as the chief at practical skills.  The chief\u2019s only still the chief because Bogo can handle the paperwork of chiefdom.\u201d  Having finished the chips and checked his watch, Clawhauser smiled.  \u201cWanna take a lunch break?\u201d  Volkovoi laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re hungry after that?  I\u2019m about ready to vomit.\u201d  Ben laughed, \u201cI get that; wait for the adrenaline to subside; then you\u2019ll be hungry.\u201d  Surely enough, fifteen minutes later, Ivan\u2019s stomach rumbled despite the offerings of a breakfast, donuts, and potato chips to it.  \u201cThose are carbohydrates,\u201d Clawhauser explained, \u201cthey\u2019re more for keeping you from going crazy with boredom than to fill you.  Protein satisfies you; might I therefore recommend to you the borger place down the street?  It\u2019s synthetic meat\u2014grown entirely in laboratories\u2014but it\u2019s still good enough to eat.  They taste almost like the real stuff.  And would you mind if we met up with Officer Lighthoof?  He\u2019s amusing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was apparent that the monicker \u201cLighthoof\u201d was not exactly appropriate for the horse who sat across from Volkovoi at lunch.  He was not only tall, but well muscled and well padded.  His forearms and legs were massive\u2014even by a horse\u2019s standards\u2014nor did the gut that spilled nearly to his lap when he sat indicate that he got a shortage of calories.  He was older than both Clawhauser and Volkovoi, probably about middle-aged, but he was a quieter person than Clawhauser\u2019s often bubbly personality.  The two in combination were really quite something.  Volkovoi would feed Lighthoof gossip, and Lighthoof would spin some very acidicly amusing sarcastic comments back about them.  But that all stopped the moment the food arrived.  At that moment, there was only the sound of eating.  The bacon cheeseborger was phenomenal, and Officer Lighthoof quickly polished off a black-bean burger with a side of oatmeal and french fries.  Having stifled a burp, Officer Lighthoof stretched and yawned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volkovoi smiled.  The two\u2014and he laughed self-deprecatingly\u2014and perhaps soon three fat police officers all sitting together made Ivan chuckle.  \u201cBoys,\u201d Lighthoof smiled sleepily, \u201cCan I crash with you for an hour or two?  I need a good nap.\u201d  Clawhauser smiled, \u201cSure, Harry, that\u2019s no big deal; your wisdom is much appreciated.\u201d  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Having returned to the station unnoticed, the three slipped into the surveillance room just as the phone was ringing.  Volkovoi picked it up, \u201cOfficer Volkovoi, sorry, sir, we just returned from lunch break.\u201d  Chief Bogo immediately whispered, \u201cListen, Volkovoi, you can\u2019t go around making fun of Officer Hopps.  She\u2019s valuable for PR, and we can\u2019t lose her.  Do I make myself clear?\u201d  Volkovoi was now confused.  \u201cSir, listen, if that was about this morning, sir, I apologized.  It was a joke.  She had made the same joke to me a few moments before.\u201d  Bogo sighed, \u201cI get it.  But my advice is to stay away from her.  Treat her professionally, but stay away.  The media will spin this as discrimination if she tells them to.  I don\u2019t know.  Bye.\u201d  Bogo hung up.  Volkovoi\u2019s face fell.  He couldn\u2019t make a joke?  What kind of environment was that?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWhat was that all about?\u201d the leoard asked pleasantly.  \u201cNothing, just a congratulations,\u201d Volkovoi smiled back, \u201cI just don\u2019t like congratulations.  They have a tendency to expose me to being knocked flat on my ass.\u201d  Clawhauser sniffed it out immediately, \u201cDid you harass Judy?\u201d  The wolf dipped his head, abashed at his co-worker\u2019s emotional aptitude.  \u201cI made a joke to her, she tried to choke me by grabbing my tie, you know.  So I pried her paws off my tie.  She must\u2019ve reported me.\u201d  Clawhauser frowned.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like Judy.\u201d  Volkovoi nodded and smiled wanly.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He noticed Lighthoof\u2019s stomach rising and falling slowly and deeply.  He sat amusedly staring at the fleshy hill that quivered and shook a tiny bit with each breath.  But the horse only breathed just barely audibly.  \u201cSo what does he do?\u201d  Volkovoi asked Clawhauser.  \u201cHe\u2019s a security contractor who builds databases for criminals and tries to predict which ones\u2019ll commit more crimes.  We\u2019re working on it as an alternative to bail.\u201d  Suddenly, the phone rings, and on the other end of the line is...</span></div></div>",
