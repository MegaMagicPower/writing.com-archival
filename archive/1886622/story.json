She is from a place named Deloma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a small nation with a strange culture. Specifically, married men are kept in diapers by their wives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe history books of Deloma say that the women grew tired of being dominated by men and banded together. They refused to marry any man who would not accept the woman as the head of their household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept their husbands, the ones who accepted the new arrangement, in diapers to remind them of their status in the family. Many women go further and choose to treat their husbands completely like toddlers, or even little girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unaware of any of this until you suddenly find yourself expected to conform to it.</td>",
