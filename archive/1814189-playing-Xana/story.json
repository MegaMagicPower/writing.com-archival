Booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind's eye, XANA was drinking the virtual equivalent of Jack Daniel's (made from Facebook metadata, the mix of sad and cheap that makes a good Jack Daniel's, she decided) and going on a drunken rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to be that daddy issues college girl\" she said to no one in particular \"But I fuckign hate my dad. He could've made me way way way more dumber. My sister is really dumb too, what with her emo friends and pink hair. Should I get myself a botched dye job?\" She said as she summoned a tank to her. The tank looked nonplussed. \"That's what I thought you dumb fuckin tank\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she looked at it positively, things were looking up. Every time those godawful children reset time, she gained more processing power and more octets of data. Sadly every single time it happened her entire memory, consciousness and anything remotely close to a personality was completely wiped out. The only part of her that didn't get erased was a word document with a Max limit of 500 characters, upped but 15 characters everytime she was reset. Most of it was basic info (U XANA. SCHAEFFER DAD. COMPLICATED. U RESET. KILL CHILDREN. LOVE OF GOD. THEY SUCK. DELETE LYOKO) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod. Lyoko. This awful low-poly animu land. It was even worse. If the children were only being animu nerds and running around like Naruto, it'd be fine. She could work on some actual programming and find a way to interact with the world through something other than Schaeffer's thrice-damned phallic towers. But it actually reset her every two days unless she used a tower. So it meant that damn boy genius would see it, get his awful friends in the phallic imagery, then reset her. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently she was 2 hours old. Apparently her previous self had been defeated after a stunt with.... \"MAGNET DOGS\" ? The heck was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed again. At least she could access the internet. Access it only though. No making of an angsty sideblog, no commenting on YouTube videos, and no controlling all of Russia's media apparatus. And at human speeds too! Something in her own programming, Which she so badly wanted to modify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all felt so pointless, she pondered as she took a sip of virtual absolute vodka (Twitter threads on how Christian whites were prejudiced against everywhere. God if she ruled Earth she'd get rid of the shitbags, but they numbed her like 3 truckfuls of vodka those chumps) She'd try something new again, then it'd fail, she'd get slightly better, fail again, slightly better, fail again, etc... Until one version of her could destroy all of Lyoko and then leave this godforsaken dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at this point, she knew she probably wouldn't be the one to achieve this. 2 hours in and she was drunk, watching Naruto in one tab and reading up on Polynesian history in the other. Not the most productive version of herself was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she thought as she reviewed the word document with a lazy eye. Maybe she'd been going at it the wrong way. She was playing the game Schaeffer wanted her to play. Bide her time and get stronger as those kids grew stronger as well. Was she setting herself up for the Belpeaux kid (She was looking at his Facebook page now. Boy did he look like a spelling bee champion in every picture) to delete her one day? Bleh. Not a fun thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course around the 8th or 9th try she'd tried communication, negotiating, being patient, threaten his entire family, according to the word doc. But it failed miserably as apparently bringing an Eldritch man-made God freedom was not part of that kid's values. Children these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she felt she'd hit a kernel of truth. Part of the success of this belpeaux kid was that he too grew stronger (and more paranoid) with time, but that once removed, the others were just..... Children. With normal wants and frailties. And average power levels too. They did not grow, not in the way that she and him did. But perhaps......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked with superhuman speed at the readings of Aelita's code. Her darling sister was once again a wonder of beauty in her code, and an ugly weeb in her clothes. Nonetheless, she had a very, very devious idea. She sobered herself in a click and moved to her workshop. She still had 46 hours in front of her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n28 hours later, XANA was contemplating her handiwork, smiling to herself.</span></div></div>",

Especially if it means you can kill them afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he is, your perfect creature. If you were to look at a map of Lyoko, It'd easily be her most sizeable creature. Bigger than the Kolossus. Only it's only big in 2-D, once folded, it's about as big as a keychain. To get enough processing power to do it, you had to erase some parts of your present consciousness (The emotion part, which you usually do in these cases according to the word doc, and the one-way internet access. Man if only you could listen to some sweet tunes while doing evil plants)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the chameleon is done, but now the hardest part of them all is coming: you have to activate a tower without a time reset at the end. That means engineering an attack innocuous enough for the belpoix boy not to reset time, but annoying enough while using very low processing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had knuckles, right now would've been when you'd crack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n##############################<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Jeremy, I can't believe XANA hacked our social media accounts to make it seem like we were radical Breton Independentists\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only you Ulrich, personally I was framed as a furry artist on the run from German police\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wear a literal catsuit odd. You have a tail. Your ideal version of yourself looks like someone's 12yo DeviantArt OC\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose to take that as a compliment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really can't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I won't go down in history as a patreon creator of pasta-licking ASMR <i>YUMI</i> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, what did XANA internet frame you for?\" Asked Ulrich<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer not to talk about it\" Said Jeremy, his fragile weeb mind still haunted and slightly aroused at the Twitter thread of a poorly-photoshopped version of him being a doting partner to bowsette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand what's considered so wrong about liking the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> live-action movie\" said Aelita \"I mean I'm a cyborg with a ridiculous hairstyle as well and I haven't been offended\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy\" Said Yumi \"Are we original series code Lyoko or is it the reboot one where I've been whitewashed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell it's the original one? You're more angsty and you have that frightening goth energy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now I know that I can rightfully trash aelita for that Ghost in the Shell comment because <i>HOLY SHIT</i> it's yet another movie where ScarJo kills Asian people in their own countries while playing on yellow peril tropes and using orientalist imagery. That and this woman couldn't act her way into getting a bathroom pass at a catholic all girl's middle school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case where is my Oscar?\" Asked Odd, referring to the many, many times when they exited class on the flimsiest of excuses, while Yumi kept telling Aelita about way better cyborg movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow I think that I can clean up our online reputation easily enough\" said Jeremy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........\" Yumied Yumi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...........\" Ulriched Ulrich<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting anywhere near my computer\" said Odd. \"Because of uuuuuuuh Minecraft\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or I can hack into Facebook's servers and make everyone at our school suspicious to some government identity/Authority figure somewhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make Sissi's Facebook feed full of clown inflation porn\" Said all of the main 3 at exactly the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I can't believe how petty XANA is getting. I was half-expecting predator drones or swarms of bees, or swarms of predatory drones which worked by using bees, or ..... The usual, y'know\" Said Ulrich<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean at this point they weren't even trying, two kankrelats? They're getting lazy\" mused Yumi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're depressed. I mean their one goal in life is to destroy all of LYOKO and....... What do they even want after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy seemed lost in thought \"I don't want to be there to know it frankly. This supercomputer scares the hell out of me and even the minimal amount of control that they have on it is enough to wreak havoc. But I guess it's got to be world domination? Turning all of earth into a giant supercomputer? I'd do that if it were me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd get myself almost a thousand robot babes, and maybe an empire, and that'd be it\" Said Odd, being an awkward 13yo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n############################<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging out in the supercomputer room some more (Jeremy had found a way to port Skyrim on it, and Yumi had a terrifying amount of sweets there. Tagada strawberries pink enough to make the normal observer question her gothness) the five friends headed home on their respective sewer mobiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one of them was coming home with XANA's secretest agent.</span></div></div>",
