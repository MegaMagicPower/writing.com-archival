At the TV, there was a news about a strange crisis happening around the world; about people getting sucked into many, mysterious portals that were popping up everywhere. You however, didn't see and heard very well as you were slowly about to fall asleep. Finally you dozed off, completely unaware of one of these many portal that was now opening up from below you and immediately sucked you in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did the portal lead you?</span></div></div>",

You don't know where are you exactly but you know that you are not in your home world anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wander around for a bit, you began to wonder about your current location. Suddenly, your eyes have landed on to something huge. Curious, you decided to get a closer look at the giant object.</span></div></div>",

You had made it just past the \"equator\" when a shadow fell across the ball, and it was lifted up into the air. A voice shouted, \"FOUND IT!\", and suddenly you and the ball were flung out into the field, where a bunch of giant athletes converged on the ball. You in a soccer ball during a soccer match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stretch of time (it was hard to tell with the constant, nauseating motion) was literally a blur. You could hardly make out any faces, except for one -- a giant girl with apparently blue skin and rainbow-colored hair. She moved like lightning, and kicked the ball as hard as she could every time. Due to this constant hammering, your death-grip on the sides of the panels that kept you from flying off loosened as you grew exhausted. Finally, the ball came to a slow stop somewhere in the field. Panting, you waited for the final blow. And suddenly, who else but that rainbow-haired soccer player came into view?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood over the ball like a colossus, one foot on either side, utterly unaware of your presence. Still, you couldn't help but feel as if she was subtly gloating over you... Then came the kick. But instead of sailing off into the green field, she began to show off, bouncing the ball off her knee, heel, and head. You were bumped and jostled around before the last, sharp strike that sent the ball up and away while leaving you on her person. But how did she send off the soccer ball? And where were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She used her head -- you are now between her mouth and her nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She used her foot -- you have fallen (unfortunately) into her shoe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She used her heel -- you are stuck between her skirt and the back of her biker shorts</span></div></div>",

She hit it with enough force that your fatigued limbs could no longer keep you with the orb, and you pitched out of the groove and onto the iridescent soccer player's face. You landed just under her left nostril, and were about to yell for her attention, when her nose flared and she inhaled deeply. Due to the lack of handholds on her skin, you were vacuumed up into her nasal cavity and almost sucked further back down her throat and into her lungs. But your ride came to a quick stop as you hit a sticky pile of mucus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to get out, but your thrashing against the walls of the vast cavern only mildly irritated your unaware host's body, causing it to exude more mucus, which piled on you and nearly engulfed you. While your head was free, the rest of your body from the neck down was encased in the giantess's slowly solidifying snot. You were stuck. All you could do was yell and rock your prison, and she was too big to hear your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not too large to feel you rolling around in her nose, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">AH...<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">AHH</font>...<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">AHHH</font>...<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">AHHH H</font>...</font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the explosion.

A giant female appeared. At least, they appeared female, and humanoid -- they were wearing something like blue jeans, after all. But they had skin and hair colors that no normal person would have. And they were busy snipping away at something. Clear strips fluttered down. Tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious giantess walked over to the seat you were in. You tried yelling up at them, but they either didn't know your language, or they were too engrossed in their project. Another snip. Another piece of tape came floating down on top of you. You tried to escape, but the tape just spun in the air and landed on you, sticky side down. You were stuck to the chair, and could only watch as the giantess set down the project on the desk, turned their body around, and began to sit. You realized that you were about to end up beneath the right butt cheek of this giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were they?</span></div></div>",

But this world nothing like they ever seen before, it was a gargantuan world filled with almost anything several times their sizes even the smallest thing like a paperclip would tower over them. But that was the least of their worries, this unusual was filled with enormous creatures that were surprisingly human like them. They were enough to over shadow every buildings and structures in their world, they were also pretty odd as they shown to have strange features most particular their odd multicolored skins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle do these people know, they actually ended up in the gigantic version of Canterlot high from MLP Equestria girls. Everyone were all hanging around, talking to one another, playing some games or other activites, and all minding their own business, unaware of the nearly-micro outsiders amongst them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Any character of MLP are allowed, but it has to be from the Equestria Girls series If it's someone from the main series, then they must be humanized exactly from the films.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Other fetishes allowed in this story as long if it's still remains with the main theme of the story which is the Marco/Micro content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. This is an unaware story but interaction are still allowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Try to use decent grammer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Keep the personalities and characteristics of the MLP characters the way they are, unless there's a reason behind the changes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. To keep this a little original, the characters have no knowledge of the MLP characters and settings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Your character can have of variety of personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Don't end the story way too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Deaths are allowed but please make them detailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
