Suddenly you could hear a voice, not far away, but not distant, but not close either, it didn't seem to come from anywhere.  Neither did it sound like anything.  You could hear it, but it didn't sound like anything.

On the one in front of you, a red kite shield with a... mickey mouse? emblem etched on it.  How strange, you never knew the mickey mouse cartoons to be that millitant.  On the pedestal to the right of you, a longsword appeared.

Unfortunately the both of you weren't floating down like Disney's movie, instead the both of you were falling like the sequel. As you and Sora were falling down at a great pace, you could see lots of weird things that were studded. Mirrors, stoves, pianos, clocks and other everyday appliances are studded onto the wall. Your speed gradually gets slower and as you and Sora touch the ground it seems like you were floating down.You got to your feet and looked around the room. You look around and see that you're in a round room with red and pink checker tiled floor and wallpaper, and four couches of different colours surrounding you and Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fur and whiskers! I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!\" screamed a white rabbit who was running towards a hallway leading to another room, looking at his unusually large watch, wearing a red jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

He scurried through the door, screaming, \"I'm late! I'm late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice echoed, as he ran further and further away. You couldn't see the rabbit anymore, and you assumed he wasn't very far, so you decided to keep trailing after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peeked into the door the strange rattled rabbit had left open behind him-- wait, there were two larger doors overlapping a smaller door. Three doors for one entrance? What's the point? You thought for a moment, as you started twisting the door nobs in confusion. You regained your focus, and you and Sora entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sora stepped into a perfectly rectangular room. It had a small round table in the middle of it and fold-able bed on the right, with doors of many diverse sizes that surrounded the perimeter. The door sizes were very odd. Some were smaller than others, wider, narrower, larger, and all sorts of different sizes. You turned the nob of a door to the left that was closest to you, and pushed and pulled, but it wouldn't budge. You tried the same with many other doors, but not a single door would open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room and kick the bed causing it to reveal a secret passage that was far too small for you to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where's that really tiny yellow door</i>, You think to yourself when you see Sora looking at a small yellow door that was slightly open. You instantly recognize the golden doorknob on the yellow door as the talking doorknob that greeted Alice in the movie. You quickly rush over to the yellow door where Sora is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get so small?\" he asks himself as he examines the door not noticing the face on the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're simply too big.\" replied the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks!\" Sora screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you be so loud? You woke me up. I need a bit more sleep.\" replied the doorknob who was about to snooze off when Sora stopped him from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do we have to do to grow small?\" asked Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try the bottle... over there?\" the doorknob stated while gesturing towards the table and to your surprise, two bottles along with 2 cups suddenly appeared on the table. Both of the bottles had labels saying <i>Drink Me!</i> but the colour of the labeling were different. You don't know if you should try the blue one or the orange one.</span></div></div>",

The forest seemed really large as the grass was three times bigger than you and there were <i>lotus trees</i>? Anyway before you can think anymore suddenly a purple head that was smiling suddenly started appearing and disappearing until the remaining of it's body started appearing which then the body started putting back its head in. It was the Cheshire cat that you've seen in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, indeed?\" the Cheshire Cat commented, \"Poor Alice. Soon to lose her head, and she's not guilty of a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you know who the culprit is, tell us!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Cheshire Cat has all the answers... but doesn't always tell.

I won't tell which exit. There are four pieces of evidence in all. Three are a cinch to find. The fourth is tricky. Big reward if you find them all.\" The Cheshire cat was barely visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we trust him?\" you ask to Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Sora saying anything, the Cheshire Cat instead replied his last sentences before he completed vanished, \"To trust, or not to trust? I'll trust you'll de...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after the Cheshire Cat faded away you see a group of soldier heartless patrolling the forest.

Once you reach the top you see some kind of black portal that seems to lead somewhere else. Without hesitation you and Sora both go in the strange looking black hole and you both emerge down a hole into the room where you both have shrunk before onto the top of the furnace. Although you have seemed to be in the same room you smell a stench that you don't recognize but one that makes you feel uncomfortable. You shudder as your response to the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling that the Heartless have left this room not long ago.\" Sora suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can use that as evidence?\" you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" replied Sora.

They look very similar to the playing cards you've seen people used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to present your evidence before the queen?\" asks the soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better bring your evidence soon,\" said the soldier resuming his duties. You and Sora walk away from the castle and are immediately back into the lotus forest again. You and Sora begin to search the damp dirt floor for any evidence or clues. In the first few minutes of your search, you find nothing out of the ordinary. All you see is dirt and soil. It's like no strange activity has even happened on the ground. Instead of giving up, you go back into searching and look more closely. After a few minutes of your very careful searching, you manage to find a couple of very small three toed footprints imprinted on some wet dirt. You tap Sora on the shoulder to tell him what you have found. Sora turns around and talks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found anything yet?\" asks Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a footprint,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good searching,\" Sora says as he grabs yet another small red box out of his pocket and puts the footprint in the red box. You're now starting to get a bit confused at the many red boxes that Sora puts in his pocket and how he is 'gathering' the evidence. It's probably a magic box, you think. You and Sora have found three pieces of evidence. The fourth piece will prove to be difficult as it seems you've searched almost everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re certainly the best fighter at your town so why not try your hand for the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush past your sister ruffling her hair a bit which she ignores rushing into the bathroom. Your parents have already headed out to the fields and farm to work leaving you only a bowl of cereal and a note wishing you luck in your venture. You eat little unable to contain your excitement and a small bit of dread before tossing on you duster and heading out for the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt starts with a cough before finally building to a roar. It takes you only a few hours to get to the arena that has been constructed on the outskirts of the city. You can see a large crowd has already built and fighting furiously to get inside to see the most interesting thing to happen in the area in decades. You are relieved that you are allowed to take a side entrance instead of battling the flood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you can see nearly a hundred people gathered around talking to each other in excited voices. Almost all of them are muscular and wearing some sort of fighting uniform, almost like something out of a cartoon. But in one corner is a woman who looks drastically different, she is pale shrouded in long black robes with a headpiece that made it look like she had two large black horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a light weight but seemed extremely dangerous all the same. You sign in quickly hoping that you won\u2019t have to fight this woman until later in the finals if ever. When the board goes up you see that you will be in the fifth match against someone named Maleficent. An interesting name, maybe someone is trying to over compensate for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long until the opening ceremony began and you along with everyone else was paraded before the roaring crowd and you get your first glimpse at the towering gold trophy that will go to the winner of the competition. It looks beautiful, almost magical, as if there may be something more to it than simple metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can admire it to much you are ushered backstage where the so the first fight may get underway. The first battle between a black belt karate master and a street thug ended predictably with the karate master winning and the next several fights proceed along the same lines with experience beating youth or rage. This makes you sweat a bit with you lacking a single day of real training and little going for you other than your toned rock hard body. Your fight is next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out to the field onto the arena floor covered with mats to try to prevent to bad and injury during the event. You feel your heart sink to see the woman in black almost seeming to float along next to you looking at you as if you a speck of dirt soon to be brushed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you enter the ring and bow to her saying, \u201cGive it all you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFoolish child,\u201d the woman says scornfully, \u201cYou would not survive an instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starting gong sound and before you can move five black splotches appear on the ground from which crawl five strange creatures pitch black aside from their massive glowing eyes on their disportional heads. Things go silent as Maleficent simply says, \u201cDispose of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures waddle forward and slash at you with sharp claws aiming for your chest. You give ground from surprise before wading into the group stomping on one causing it to disperse into black mist and kick another causing it to similarly explode. One jumps at you claws extended, you grab it flinging it out of the ring before punching another in the face. The last creature sinks into the ground flowing past you and springing up behind you silent as a whisper. You only just duck the attack exploding your foe with an uppercut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile surprised you are still fresh and mostly unharmed, \u201cIs that the best you can do lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Maleficent laughed, \u201cBut why dirty my own hands with you child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a swirl of something black and a massive eight-foot tall horribly fat creature appear before you. You hardly have time to mutter, \u201cHoly-\u201d before the creature swats you with its thick arms knocking back ten feet and winding you.  You stagger to you feet in time to see the creature charge you gut first, you barely manage to leap away as it charges past you. The beast pauses a few yards later to scratch it head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take advantage of its confusion to lead up and punch it as hard as you can in the face knocking it off its feet. While it\u2019s down you yank off the creature\u2019s small helmet and pound wildly at its head until it to burst vanishing into the darkness from which it came.

That, and the bed you were on appeared to be the only furniture here.<br>\r\n\"Your awake now? Good. Today you start learning what we do around here.\" The boy declared, causing you to jump and look at him in surprise. <br>\r\n\"Who...

Once you demonstrate your true power, then we will see what you're potential is.\" He stated with uninterest.<br>\r\nYou would have replied, if a sudden sound caused you to turn back to the doorway just in time to see Xion enter the room. It took only a moment for her to lock eyes with you. She stares at you for a few moments before walking up to you. \"You're that boy I saw a few days ago.\" She stated, recognizing you rather quickly. \"And they told me I was to show you the ropes, is that right, Saix?\" She asked, turning to him. <br>\r\n\"Yes, that is correct.

Damn... I had munny said you wouldn't.\" An unfamiliar voice this time made you turn again to see a tall man with spiky red hair down to his shoulders. He was carrying a grocery sack and had a mock dejected look on his face right now.<br>\r\nRoxas nudged him with a bigger grin. \"Come on, Axel, pay up.\" He demanded, holding his hand out. <br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, fine... Here, take your munny.\" Axel grumped, tossing Roxas a small pouch, one you assumed to be filled with coin.<br>\r\nXion just sighed and shook her head at the entire exchange. \"Boys.\" She stated, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were busy trying to sort everything out in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the whole thing, Xion introduced everyone. \"Right... You guys, this is the new member, Arnoxa. Arnoxa, you already know Roxas.\" He nodded and smiled. \"Nice to officially meet ya.\" He declared, shaking your hand. You given him the gesture, but inch a bit closer to Xion nervously.<br>\r\n\"And this is Axel. He's the one who originally got us together.\" Xion explained. Axel grinned. \"And I'm the one who keeps us together. Got it memorized?\" You nod and step just behind Xion, a move that Axel notices. \"Hey, Xion... You aren't babying him or anything, are ya?\" He asked. Xion started in surprise, but you blushed lightly, unable to say anything to deny it. \"Of course not! Why would you even think that?\" She sputters, her face turning red, though whether from anger or embarrassment, it was hard to tell. \"Well, cause he seems to stick pretty close to you.\" Axel noted.<br>\r\nAt this, she turns to see your rather obvious movement away from her.

Xion giggles some before explaining. \"Yeah. It's called sea-salt ice cream. We all love it. So? What do you think?\" She asks, her earlier embarrassment gone, or so it appeared. \"Ye... Yeah...

Just about every day after work, you, Xion, and the others would meet up for ice cream at the tower and talk. It felt like things would last forever, but one day, Saix informs you of an important mission that will be your final trial before being sent on missions alone. You grow excited because this will mean you can finally prove yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at Twilight Town and begin your search for a Darkside. According to Xion, they were tall, humanoid in shape, and had to be struck in the face or hands to be taken out. It takes a good deal of searching before you catch sight of it. Unfortunately, someone got their information wrong. This one, while it looked much like a regular Darkside, was tinged with a shade of purple and gave off a strong sense of power. Xion swore under her breath and told you to stay back and try to keep out of the way. You nodded, unusually nervous about the creature. You stuck to magical support while Xion did the brunt of the damage. However, Xion was struggling, and you had run out of potions half way through the fight. Xion fell to her knees, exhausted, and you lept forward to pull her away. It was then, the heartless moved to strike. You shoved Xion out of the way and raised your shield in defense, but you were knocked back by the blow and your shield was shattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on the ground, you remember something. In a dream you remember a voice calling to you. \"Power sleeps within you. If you give it shape, it will give you strength.\" This made you search desperately within yourself for what that power was. When you found it, you felt it coursing through your body. You stood up, darkness seeming to gather around you, and you called forward your weapon. However, instead of the ebony shield you were so familiar with, a long, ebony blade appeared in your hand. It was detailed in a way that made you both afraid and drawn to it. (Oblivion has been acquired. Yyyaaaaaayyyyy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no time to ponder this as the heartless moved to strike again. This time, you avoided the attack and lept at the creatures face. In one stroke, you had cleaved its head in two. It vanished in a puff of darkness, leaving a heart that nearly floated away before Xion managed to catch it. \"Whew...... That was close.\" She sighed in relief. You were too busy staring at your new weapon to say anything. It excited you now and you felt a sense of completeness you had been missing with your shield. Xion walked over and asked to inspect the blade. You hesitated, but let her look. She took it in one hand and looked it over. It gave off a bright glow that flashed briefly before fading. Xion grew wide eyed at this and looked at you in wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got concerned at this. \"What? What's wrong?\" She was very quiet in her reply. \"This is a keyblade.\" <br>\r\n\"What's a keyblade?\" You asked curious to know what this was, but sensing that Xion was greatly disturbed by this. You had the feeling she might not be willing to explain.</span></div></div>",

Once we get back and report the creature's demise, we'll go see Roxas.\" She stated, handing you your weapon back and opening the return portal.<br>\r\nYou took it and stowed it away before following her through. The fact that she mentioned Roxas seemed odd to you. While you got the feeling he was a good person and a strong ally, you had never really seen him in combat. Still, you trusted Xion, so you followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived back at the castle and gave your report, not really surprised to find that Demyx was the source for your info. You quickly realized during your time on the field that Demyx wasn't reliable very much for anything. Still, you completed the mission and turned the heart in, glad to be done with the day, however, Xion didn't mention your keyblade, you looked at her, questioningly as she opened the way to Twilight Town and she returned your unspoken question with a tiny shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and followed her through, arriving at the usual spot to find Roxas there waiting for you. He waved. \"Hey guys! How'd it go?\" He asked, cheerily. \"Well enough, if you discount the fact that Demyx got his info wrong on our target.\" You replied with a grin. He chuckled. \"Man... Even when he does get his 'easy jobs' he still can't do them right.\" Xion interrupted here, wanting to get straight to the point. \"Roxas... He has one too.\" He paused at this, looking from her to you. \"Really? Well, lets see it then.\" You hesitated, unsure of what they were talking about, before you realized. He wanted to see your keyblade. You called it to your hand and he whistled approvingly. \"Got yourself one of the good ones, too.\" He stated, holding his hand out. Again, you hesitated, but you let him hold it, trusting him, because Xion trusted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked it over and gave it a few swings, testing it. \"This thing could really do some damage... and you only found out today?\" He asked, handing it back. \"Yes. That heartless almost got us, and if it hadn't arrived, we might not have made it back.\" You declared, stowing the weapon. \"So have you told the others yet?\" Roxas asked, sitting back down. Xion was quick to answer. \"No. I was hoping to talk to you and Axel about it first. Speaking of which, where is he?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm right here.\" Axel answered, stepping around the corner with the ice cream. He passed it out and everyone sat down to eat. \"So what, you have another problem needs fixing?\" He asked jokingly. \"Actually, we have three keys now.\" Roxas answered, causing Axel to look at him questioningly. \"Three keys? Who's the third? I know I'm sure as hell not.\" He voiced, looking at the others curiously. \"That would be me.\" You replied, waving your Popsicle in the air at him. \"Arnoxa? I thought you had that weak little shield.\" He seemed confused. \"It happened during our mission. His shield broke while we were fighting, and when he got back up, he got a keyblade instead of a shield when he called his weapon.\" Xion replied. Axel nodded. \"Alright. So when will you let the others know?\" He asked. \"I was planing for tomorrow. That way we could spend the whole day working out how his role will change, who will teach him about his role, and all that.\" Axel thought about it. \"Sounds reasonable. So which of you wanted the position?\" </span></div></div>",

Besides, he's only ever worked with Xion before, so it'll be good for him to work with someone else.\" You cringed to hear the others agree with this, but you knew that you couldn't be with Xion forever. <br>\r\nAfter the day was over, the four of you met with Saix and you showed him your keyblade. This time, he almost seemed to show a bit of respect. After several minutes discussion, you were given your promotion and your training schedule with Roxas. You looked it over and noted that you would be visiting several different worlds that you hadn't been to before. You got excited and eagerly awaited the days ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Roxas was waiting for you by the portal. \"Alright. Our first job is in Twilight Town. I'll be showing you how we collect hearts and all the enemies to look out for. I also wanna see you in action, so expect to be doing the brunt of the fighting today.\" You nodded, fully understanding what this meant. <br>\r\nYour combat style with your shield had been an even balance of defense and offence. Your physical attacks involved throwing your shield in arcs at your enemies, using magic to ensure it always returned to you. However, now that you had an actual weapon, you would have to adjust your fighting style. You were already working through this in your head as the two of you stepped through the portal.<br>\r\nOnce you arrived, Roxas wasted no time in beginning the training, however, he only demonstrated once how to capture hearts before giving you the reins, so to speak. You were given leadership and told that he would only provide support while you did the bulk of the job. It took you only two attempts before you were doing it right.<br>\r\nFighting was a different matter, however. At first, you tried broad, two-handed attacks, the length of the blade making you believe it had the weight to make it effective, however, you quickly realized that your attacks were much faster than you expected. So you experimented with one handed strikes, and found yourself naturally switching between regular, and backhanded styles. Then, to top it off, you started switching the blade between your hands and discovered your ambidexterity. This allowed for a constantly changing style that easily tore through heartless. By the time you had collected enough hearts, you were very proud of your abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas watched with interest as you progressed. He never really said anything, but you got the feeling that he was impressed with you. When the last heart needed was collected, he congratulated you. \"Very good. You catch on pretty quick.\" He said as you sent the last heart to the castle. \"Now, before we head back, I have one more thing I want you to do.\" He said as he waved for you to follow him. You followed, curious to know what he had planned. <br>\r\nHe led you to a wide open area with very few obstructions. He stopped in the middle of the place and summoned his keyblade. \"I want you to fight me. I want to see just how well you can do with your new blade.\" You were surprised at this. You hadn't expected anything like this from your friend. However, the look in his eyes said that if you didn't fight, he would simply beat you down, so you readied your weapon and prepared yourself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was difficult. You had never seen Roxas fight, so you had no idea how to react until the match began. Things started off with a bang, with Roxas throwing a firaga at you before closing in for melee combat. You managed to avoid the flames and just barely got your weapon up in time to block Roxas' first strike. However, because you hadn't put much power in it, Raxas was able to push you back. What followed was a blur of sword strokes and flares of magic that most wouldn't have been able to follow. <br>\r\nYou knew you were keeping up with him, and had even managed to land a few blows in, and this gave you confidence. You began pushing back, and hard, moving quickly and striking hard. Roxas responded with a defensive stance, but you managed to get him to yield, however, the ease with which he recovered made you believe he had been holding back.<br>\r\n\"That was really good. You really had me there.\" He declared with a grin as he attempted to catch his breath. He took a few seconds to recover before straightening up. \"I had a lot of fun fighting you.\" He stated offering his hand. <br>\r\n\"I did too.\" You responded, taking his hand firmly. \"To be honest, I didn't think I'd do that well.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to know I can count on you to have my back.\" Roxas replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the both of you were ready, you opened the return portal and reported in. After that, you headed to the tower to meet with the others. You got there rather late, but you only saw Axel there. He was already half finished with a Popsicle by the time you arrived. \"Hey guys. I was starting to think you weren't gonna show.\" He waved with a grin. \"Well, I wanted to see how good he really was. That meant sparing.\" Roxas declared.  <br>\r\nAxel turned eagerly. \"So who won?\" <br>\r\n\"I did, but just barely.\" You answered, sitting down. <br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so modest.\" Roxas teased, sitting in the middle. \"You had me hands down and you know it.\"<br>\r\nAxel interrupted. \"So wait... The noob here basically whooped your butt and he's only had his weapon for two days? That's kinda sad, Roxas.\" He declared with only a hint of actual sadness.<br>\r\n\"I went easy on him. You think I wanted to put him out for a week?\" Roxas shot back.<br>\r\n\"Hah! I knew it! I knew you were holding back.\" You threw in, now that your suspicions were confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the time was spent with just the three of you, teasing each other and joking around. Roxas, at one point, went to get ice cream for the two of you, and you stayed long enough to finish it. Axel left once his was gone, and Roxas followed not long after. <br>\r\nYou stayed there another few minutes, looking your stick over. It said winner on it, but you had no idea what it meant. You were just about to leave when Xion showed up. <br>\r\n\"Hey... Sorry I'm late.\" She replied, obviously out of breath. The mission took longer than I thought it would.\" She huffed as she moved over to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were alone, and you were beginning to feel awkward around her. Your eyes kept going back to her, tracing her face and body, to the point where you were only half listening to her. You felt so strange around her, which was odd, because you rarely ever FELT anything. How will you handle this?</span></div></div>",

He stands there and laughs at you at your pathetic attempts to protect her.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" you demand.<br>\r\nHe laughs at you and raises the key and bats you aside with extreme ease, you go spiraling of the edge of the world into the darkness below. You hear her voice whisper one word, a name \"Najil\" (pronounced Na-jeel). You see a light below you as you fall and hear his voice the voice of the mocking laughter again \"My name is Vanitas learn it well because it will be the name of your doom.\" You pass through the light and find yourself in a well light room laying in a comfortably warm bed. The room is decorated by odd little items. the one that caught your eye was a twisted little branch a rare item in the city of gears, as was most nature. As you sit up you feel pain shoot through your right arm, you look at it to see it is tightly bandaged. You wonder where you could possibly be. You remember the battle and the woman with silver hair.<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" you wonder out loud.<br>\r\nYou hear a crash like china breaking and footsteps from the room outside the door. An old lady walks into the room a worried look in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" the Old woman croaks out.<br>\r\nYou nod and keep examining her. She is not your average old woman, she not bent and crippled as you would expect an old woman to be. She was tanned and well muscled and her storm grey hair was tied back into a warriors braid. She wore a leather chest guard and a worn silk dress. She glanced around the room for a long while but eventually her steely gaze returned to you.<br>\r\n\"I know what you fought\" The old woman began \"Their called Nobodies.\"<br>\r\nYou remain silent not sure what to say to the old woman. She continues when you do not speak<br>\r\n\"The small the creature was called a Dusk and the larger on was called a Berserker\" She stated.<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you asked curious about the house.<br>\r\nThe old woman smiles and states \"Your still in the city of gears, and I know who the girl was you fought to save is.\"<br>\r\nYou start and look up into her eyes and say a flare of hope.<br>\r\n\"You stand at a cross roads young man,\"  she states \"You can ether try to return old life or go and save the girl.\"<br>\r\n\"Could I return to my old life?\" you question<br>\r\n\"Who knows,\" answers the old woman, \"It's your choice and few have that ability so don't squander it.\"<br>\r\nWhat will you chose to try to take back your old life or try to rescue the girl those creatures dragged off.</span></div></div>",

You had expected to see an extremly large graveyard but what you saw was a busy city street. The buildings appear to be masoluems grouped togther like houses, though you occasionaly saw someone exit a wooden door by a gravestone. You started to walk towards the gate when you saw the denizens of this world. They looked exactly like humans except for their paper white skin, Black eyes with red iris, and either stark white or pitch black hair. As you pass by two guards talking by the gates there rapiers sheathed and paying you no mind what so ever you over hear something.<br>\r\n\"Did you hear about Emricson?\" The first guard asked the second.<br>\r\n\"No, what about him?\" Questioned the Second<br>\r\n\"Well they say he's tracking some strange creatures,\" Awnsered the first guard<br>\r\nYou walk away wondering if these strange creatures were the Nobodies you were seeking.

You see it is clothed in black with a helmet that has a skull painted on it's head covered by a hood, you then see it's weapon. A massive scyth that seemed to glow in the moonlight. Thats when you heard it a deranged manical laugh that caused the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. As you gaze at the creature on the roof you see out of  the corner of your eye something white come barreling at you. You turn in time to raise your shield so the Dusk smashs right into it.

As it disapears you turn back to the roof but the creature is gone, but thats the least of your worries as more Dusks begin to appear out of thin air.

As you readied yourself for battle you see a light bloom from behind you. Before you turn a ball of fire comes flying from behind you, smashing into a good portion of the Nobodies and destroying them. You turn to see who launched it to see a man with black hair that fell freely to his shoulder blades. He was clearly a denizen of this world. His skin was pale to the point of snow white, his left eye was red while the right eye was green. He wore a black trench coat that stopped just above his ankles, with sleeves that stopped at the wrists. He wore what appeared to be leather cloves withe the fingers cut off at the knuckles. On his chest he wore a gray t-shirt, while he wore cargo pants. He wore black sleek army boots on his feet. In his hands was a silver bow staff. He grinned at you a certain madness in his eyes.

Aros: stand up, you are a traitor to your own organization!!! Saiax: why sould I take orders from you, lowly heartless. Aros: *smirk* thought you'd say that, RISE TWILIGHT THORN!!! Aros yells, and the room fades away, turning into the space roxas fought twilight thorn. Saiax and Axel look around, when a large white hand grabs onto the edge of the platform. Saiax, Axel, and Roxas whatch in fear as the giant nobody pulls itself up behind me.

The sound of glass breaking and the feeling of falling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you take stock of your surroundings again. Your room was... not necessarily barren, but being a family living out in the sticks, you preferred practicality to fanciness(to the constant chagrin of your mother). Your family was one of just a few in a village right on the outskirts of the forest. Your father was the tanner and cobbler and your mother, a seamstress. You had an older brother who was dead set on learning your father's trade and a younger sister who looked up to you like you could never do wrong. She was always begging to learn mother's seamstress work alongside you, and you found it difficult to simply say no. You cared about your family, even if you didn't always agree, and often times you felt like things should always be this simple and easy.<br>\r\nMost of the time, at least...<br>\r\nSometimes, as you wandered the village, you would look out to the forest and wonder, 'What would I find if I actually went out and looked around?' Of course, without the strength to carry a weapon, much less weild one, you never had a hope of convincing your parents that you would be fine for just an hour or two. But still, your curiosity refused to simply sit in the corner of your mind. So eventually, you hatched a plan.<br>\r\nAs one of the few family members capable of reading, you had spent long hours pouring over the few books you could borrow that contained any information on different dangers that lay outside your little village. Books on practically everything, from different insects and where they liked to stay, to animals and their preffered food, to what plants produced food that was safe to eat. Anything and everything you could get ahold of, you read. It got to the point where your parents were openly discussing letting you apprentice to the village elder, so that you might serve as his secretary and assistant. You had something else in mind, though.<br>\r\nYou were only 14 at the time, and not even old enough to be considered an adult yet, but you knew that, in time your family would start pressuring you into getting into a vocation and settling down, even getting married eventually. You knew you had the answers you needed as to how you would survive, but you needed someone to teach you how to defend yourself. The only problem was the tiny village barely had anyone who knew how to fight like a soldier, and you weren't exactly the most fit of your family. Knowing that you would be forced to make a decision soon, you came up with a comprimise. You'd need a weapon of some kind, which meant conviscing the town blacksmith to forge you one, which would be difficult under the best of circumstances, so you'd need some way of earning his trust or buying his services. either way would take time, so your options were limited. You could...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

People in the neighborhood knew and practically grew up with each other. Over the years, nothing much has changed. Time, it seems, became a stand still when you\u2019re there.<br>\r\n\tIn fact, the town itself is going rustic. Improvements have not been made through the years which left it unchanged and uninterested to entice people to live and build their businesses there. Residents either have strong family roots in the place or just wants to live somewhere quiet away from bustling city life, are the ones that stayed despite its bleak appearance.<br>\r\n\tYet somewhere in that quiet little town\u2026 a girl dreamed of something that can change its future\u2026<br>\r\n\tLately, she realized that she\u2019s been sleeping a lot. She didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sign of sickness or something. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with it except that she\u2019s also having some weird dream. Dreams, which you feel is real even after you wake up. Just like last night\u2026<br>\r\n\t\u201cA rod? Not just an ordinary rod but a magical one with an alluring voice that lulls you\u2026As if something like that could happen in reality?\u201d she thought to herself<br>\r\n\tShe was on her way to class and passed by the washroom when a voice suddenly spoke behind her\u2026<br>\r\n\tWhen 16 stars and moons shall pass\u2026<br>\r\nThe time of fate has come\u2026<br>\r\nDestiny waits\u2026<br>\r\n\tShe looked around but no one was there. That voice, it seems so familiar. She stopped by the washroom to freshen herself up, thinking that it must have been her imagination.<br>\r\n\tShe was in the midst of washing her face when the air around her suddenly felt cold. She looked in the mirror, hoping to see a ghost but there was none yet the room temperature was rapidly decreasing.<br>\r\n\tJust then, something cold and wet landed on her nose.<br>\r\n\t\u201cA snowflake?\u201d she wondered when she touched and felt its texture. A second has only passed by when more were falling from the roof.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHuh? Snow in the washroom?\u201d Pretty weird, right?<br>\r\n\tWhen she looked down, the floor tiles have disappeared but ere now replaced by frozen ice, like she was standing in the middle of a frozen lake.<br>\r\n\tA part of her dream suddenly whizzed through her mind and her eyes widened in alarmed when she realized what will happen next. Her guess have not taken too long as the whole floor suddenly cracked and shattered in a million pieces, revealing a deep abyss and you falling into it\u2026<br>\r\n\tA voice in the distance started calling her. In her slumber state, she can vaguely comprehend what that someone is saying\u2026All she could feel right now is that she landed on something soft\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wake me up!<br>\r\n\tThe last sentence was uttered in such an urgent state that woke her up from her fall. Cold and white was the first thing that popped in her mid as he slowly opened her eyes. Snow was falling everywhere and it seems that she landed on a huge pile of it that cushions her fall.<br>\r\n\tIn the distance, she could make out a building or what was left of it, on a closer look. She sought shelter there and was amazed to see that it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary building. In fact, it was like a large ruin of some sort.<br>\r\n\tAnd there in the middle of all the ruins that are now covered in snow lies the mystical rod in her dreams, guarded by what appeared to be three huge statues frozen in ice.<br>\r\n\tTaking a closer look, she realized that each of the statues were animals. To the left, is a white tiger with sapphire eyes that glows despite its stationery gaze; and to the right, is a silver fox standing proud and majestic; gracefulness and subtlety emanating from its motionless form; and in the center was a large black dragon standing quietly in center yet emitting an aura of danger if touched. What caught her attention too is the dark ruby in the middle of its forehead shaped like an eye.<br>\r\n\tCome take me\u2026<br>\r\n\tShe could hear that voice again, enticing her to come forward, though now she could tell that it was coming from the mystical rod that the statues guarded.<br>\r\n\tSlowly, as if in a trance, she walked over to where the rod was not minding those fearsome looking statues, her mind it seems is just focused on the rod. She was just about to take it, her hands inches away when caution (her true self) took place and stopped. The voice spoke again.<br>\r\n\tDon\u2019t run away now\u2026<br>\r\n\tYou\u2019ve been doing that all your life\u2026<br>\r\n\tSo much strength inside\u2026<br>\r\n\tSo little confidence\u2026<br>\r\n\tOne choice\u2026that\u2019s all it takes\u2026<br>\r\n\tThe words struck her, a bitter reminder of her character. So she threw caution to the wind and abruptly held it. The moment her hands touched the rod, aloud cry was heard above the sky, like someone or something is in great pain. The whole area shook with the force of the voice. She was starting to panic as the earth moved at her feet but the rod\u2019s voice stopped her in place, its presence in her mind soothing her. <br>\r\n\tIt all happened so fast, one final cry and then wham! Something cracked then shattered into pieces. The rod suddenly shone so brightly that her eyes were blinded for a moment. Just then, a deep male voice spoke behind her as the blinding light disappears\u2026<br>\r\n\tAt last, I\u2019ve awaken\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It contained strange white creatures, they looked like they wore strange jump suits. \"And these, are the nobodies.\" Yen Sid explained, \"A nobody is a creature of which is left behind when a heart is consumed by heartless. They are made of body and soul. This is due to the fact that when darkness consumes the heart, it creates a heartless. A nobody is the remaining parts left behind by the heart, giving a nobody form, and the soul, giving it life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, confused. \"I don't understand... Why must I do this? What am I here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid closed his eyes, \"You see, child... Heartless are possessed by Maleficent, the evil dark witch. She is using them to consume other hearts,creating heartless. She then summons the heartless on other worlds, so that she can fulfill her goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her goal?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her goal is to take over the worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"Yeah... That's what she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid nods, \"That is why you must be prepared. You must know what you are dealing with, under any circumstance. You are chosen to do this, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, getting the gist of your quest. \"I see... So I have to stop Maleficent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid nods, and the nobodies dissolve. He points to another circle on the floor, which contained holographs of hooded men in long black coats. \"And watch out for the Organization XIII. They only cause trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are Nobodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobodies? But I thought nobodies were those strange white figures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" He pointed at the men again, \"When someone's heart is consumed, they turn into a heartless, which also creates the lesser nobodies. However, once someone has a powerful heart and strong will, the nobody takes the form of the original humans appearance, with only slight changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock your head to the side. \"So... If a heartless were to consume a heart of powerful and strong will, they would still be human?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly... These type of nobodies lack emotion also. They may appear to be normal, but they have lost their hearts. That is why they want more hearts, and that is why you must be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, still confused of your whereabouts. </span></div></div>",

Collecting the opponents' orbs will increase your score, but opponents can also regain their orbs by simply picking them up. There's also a time limit. You must obtain more orbs than your opponent before the given time ends. If one participant collects all 200 orbs within the given time limit, that participant is granted success, and automatically wins the STRUGGLE match.

He scurried through the door, screaming, \"I'm late! I'm late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice echoed, as he ran further and further away.

Three doors for one entrance? What's the point? You thought for a moment, as you started twisting the door nobs in confusion. You regained your focus, and entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into a perfectly rectangular room. It had a small round table in the middle of it, with doors of many diverse sizes that surrounded the perimeter. The door sizes were very odd. Some were smaller than others, wider, narrower, larger, and all sorts of different sizes. You turned the nob of a door to the left that was closest to you, and pushed and pulled, but it wouldn't budge. You tried the same with many other doors, but not a single door would open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a creaking noise from behind you. You snapped your head back behind you promptly, and before you could leap for the door, the door you came from slammed shut. It was locked too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! My keyblade!\" You thought. Your calamitous and corrupt keyblade materialized in your hand, as you said to yourself, \"You got me in this mess, you're getting me out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your keyblade on one of the doors. You tried pulling and pushing it open, but it still wouldn't budge!  It was obvious it was being barricaded by something on the other side of it. You tried it on a couple of other doors, but to your dismay, they were barricaded as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down for a few seconds, twiddling with your thumbs, pondering on your whereabouts, when a door that was slightly opened caught your eye...</span></div></div>",

One, had long silver hair, his bangs flowed infront of his face, almost covering his bright green eyes. One was a girl with red hair, which swept under her ears, and brought out her peaceful smile. One was a very Goofy looking dog; in fact, it looked like something you would see from a cartoon. One was a duck; again, looking as if it came from a cartoon, who knows why.

The young boy dived down graciously, stretching his key out in front of him like a sword, stabbing the shadow in the chest area.

He released an agonizing scream of pain, I could tell the darkness was tormenting him. The boy fell backwards on his back.

You bent your knees slightly, and were in a position for battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazed at you thoughtfully and said in a firm expression, \"Let's end this.\" He glided toward the enemy, and sliced the creature with a powerful blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolted toward the creature so fast it was unreal. But you knew it was real. You knew this was happening. It felt so normal to you, like you have done this before. You sprang in the air so high, but you didn't question the amazing abilities that you had gained. You just continued to help the boy defeat the creature, with your powerful strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last strike was yours, and the shadowed figure collapsed, and crumbled into hundreds of pieces. The pieces vanished in a puff of black smoke, and you knew the tension was over. You had won this battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed at the familiar boy deeply in his big blue eyes, and said, \"Thank you, Sora.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora nodded, and turned around, ready to depart. \"I'll see you again, Anna.\" He said, ready for take off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know I hate that.\" You yelled in frustration, waving your arms at him to emphasis the point.<br>\r\nOnly question is... Who is he?</span></div></div>",

Another wake up call, or to sleep through the whole day?\" <br>\r\nYou paused, noting the time. You became flushed with embarrassment as you replied. \"Of course I don't want to sleep all day... But that doesn't mean you have to do it like that!\" You returned with anger.<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on... How else am I supposed to tease you, Yuuki?\" He grinned and poked you in the side. You flinched away from him and got up. \"Maybe by not teasing me. How about that?\" You retorted with a huff as you brushed the sand off you. <br>\r\nIt hadn't been intentional, but Riku caught a bit of what you had under your skirt. He whistled, which caused you to look at him again, still frustrated and angry at his rude awakening. He still commented, though. \"Cute... I suppose you like teddy bears, then?\" <br>\r\nThat was the last straw. You pulled out your wooden sword and lunged at him. He stepped to the side to avoid it, but you then made a two-handed swing right at his middle, which caught him in the stomach. Riku grunted and doubled over on his knees. \"Wanna say anything else?\" You asked, standing over him. After taking a bit to catch his breath, he replied. \"I think-... I think I'm ok... I got enough.\" He managed to sputter out. <br>\r\n\"Good.\" You put your sword away and walked off, much less frustrated than before.<br>\r\nWhere do you go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walked off, hoping to find Sora and maybe practice fighting again, though Kairi was always up for some fun games in the water.<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you found them leaving the secret place under the tree. They went there together sometimes, and you occasionally teased one or both of them about it, but this time, you were simply curious. <br>\r\nAfter waiting for them to get a decent ways away, you ran up to the entrance and peered inside. It was a bit dark, but you steeled your nerves and pushed aside the branches to get in. If they could do it, then so could you! <br>\r\nInside you found a winding tunnel that led to a clearing with a hole above that let in some sunlight. The tunnel had been bare, but the walls around the clearing were covered with drawings and doodles. You laughed at some of the things you saw, now understanding why they enjoyed so much time here. <br>\r\nThen you noticed the door... It was almost directly opposite the tunnel and was clearly wooden. However, there was no handle, no keyhole, and no window to see beyond it. <br>\r\nYou knew it was a door by the shape of the yellow outline just around it, but that was it. You walked up to it and felt around, thinking there might be some hidden switch or something, but you couldn't feel anything. You knocked a couple times and could hear the faint echo on the other side, which meant it was definitely open space on the other side. However, with no means of opening it, you decided to leave it be.<br>\r\nYou took another look around the cave and turned to leave. However, something made you turn back and look, and when you did, you saw an outline of a keyhole, but larger than any key you had ever seen. You looked at it in wonder, but it quickly faded moments later. You almost stayed to take another look, but decided against it, as you wanted to see if Sora or Kairi were still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside again, you found Sora and Riku in another contest again, with Kairi acting as judge. It appeared to be another race. You jogged over to Kairi and tapped her on the shoulder. \"So they're at it again?\"<br>\r\nKairi only looked over to see it was you before turning back to watch. \"Yep... They were arguing about what to name the raft, I think... Or maybe who gets to be captain, not that it really matters.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I mean, it's not like we'll get too far. In fact, my guess is, we'll finally set out, go maybe two days, and then Sora will be whining about how bored he is or he and Riku will be fighting a lot, which means more work for us, so we won't really get anywhere. And that's <b>if</b> we manage to get out to sea at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's a good point... The oars won't be enough if we hit a bad current or something, not to mention a storm.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\nThe two of you drifted off into silence, just as the boys came rushing back to the finish.</span></div></div>",
