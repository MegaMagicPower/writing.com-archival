Those detectives that nutcase princple called are getting too close to knowing what we are doing. If my weapon was ready i'd shrunk them both to the size of insect and grind them into red stains and until then the director has suspended all progress until he's captured or shrunken and crushed.Amy said.

Nothing spiecal? you say. calm down. she didn't see what you did to that robot. now that was cool. a little scary,but cool.chijinda said. Thanks man. you said lowly.

Amy said. Please just one look at me and he'll submit and beside you always kill the boys who don't litsen. that's not appealing.she said.

Amy said. that's enough you two he's the enemy not you two. the girl with the robe said. arrgh it's bad enough one shrinkie got away,but that i can't have my weapon until m.

Right. The perfect cover. Look around for something. You said. Narue looks around until she sees the hidden entrance. Found it! She said. It looks sealed tight. But there\u2019s a small opening under that I can get through. You said. You sure about that? She said. Yeah. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be in constant radio contact. I promise I\u2019ll be back with chijinda. You said. Narue reluctantly puts you on the ground and you shimmy your way though. Whoa. A very different thing on this side. All this tech. You said. Are you safely across? Narue said via walkie talkie. Yeah. I\u2019m across. These girls are gearing up for world war 3 with all this technology. I\u2019m on the move. You said. You explore the huge complex. Where would I keep prisoners? You said. You keep going when you feel the ground shake. That can\u2019t be good. You said. You look for a place to hide, but can\u2019t find one. No choice. Might be suicidal...... You said. Right when you thought she\u2019d walk by, she stops right in front of you. (This red head has to be low in the ranking.) You thought. She\u2019s looking down right at you. An escaped shrinkee! This is the 8th time. She said. (Eighth? If she thinks I\u2019m the eighth, chijinda could be free.) You thought. I don\u2019t know how you got out or got this far, but this is where your luck stops! She said. If that\u2019s your way of scaring me, it\u2019s a poor one. You said. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re so defiant after you\u2019re a greasy red stain on my shoes! She said. As she raises her titanic shoe over you, you run directly at her. (Come on lady luck!) You thought. Right when her foot came down, you jumped right out of the way. Shit. That was close. You said. You get up and run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever is going on here, I need a pay raise. You said. I thought you weren\u2019t doing this for the money? Narue said. If I knew I was going to end up this small, I would have done it for the money. You said. You keep exploring until you come across a holding cell. This must be where they keep the captives. You said. You squeeze through the bars. You look at the bodies. In terrible condition. You said. You check all of them. You find him, but don\u2019t feel his pulse. Damnit! You said. You quickly pull out a syringe and stab in right in his heart. You better not have crossed over yet! You said. Then chijinda\u2019s eyes shoot open and he takes a deep breath. *pant* *pant* How many does that make? He said. Third time this week. You need to watch it. You almost over the recommended amount. You said. He pulls the syringe out. You got any more? He said. Yeah. 2 more. I didn\u2019t think we need more than three. You said. You might want to phone the headquarters to send us more. With what\u2019s going down, we need them. He said. We need to get out of here. You said. We should get big first. He said. How? You said. There\u2019s a machine I saw on the way in, but we need someone to operate it. He said. Narue could help, but there is no way in here. You said. Give me that walkie. He said. You hand him the walkie. As he talks to narue, to look around. All this tech. What are they trying to achieve with all this? World domination? National security? Start world war 3? What? You said. Ok. I told narue how to get in. We just need to get to that machine. He said. You lead. You said. Just stay close. I\u2019ve seen what happens to people like us. He said. I know. Some red head tried to crush me. Let\u2019s go. Standing still in this place is hazardous. You said. Follow me. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you know which way it is? You said. The northwest area of the A-3 Prep room. He said. You just happen to know that? You said. One of the shrunken guys told me. Said he was going to make a break for it and come back for us. Haven\u2019t seen him since. We assumed he was crushed. Or worse. He said. Did you hear anything about what these girls are doing? You said. No. Not a word. He said. You both keep going until you come across an electric security lock. Shit. You still have the phone? You said. On it. He said. Chjinda starts hacking it. Almost there\u2026\u2026need to bypass one more fire wall annnnnd\u2026\u2026.done. He said. The security locks have been disabled and the fence opens. You keep going, but stop dead in your tracks. Shit! One of them is coming our way and there\u2019s nowhere to hide! Chijinda said. The closer she gets, the more the ground shakes. You both crane your necks just to see her face. To think that you worthless, pathetic specks would make it this far on your own. You almost make me want to respect your base doggedness if nothing else\u2026 If only you didn\u2019t make me ill instead. Unfortunately for you little worms, both those faces just infuriate beyond reason. Either way, I won\u2019t let you take a single step further. On my honor, you had best believe I will crush you all into stains right here. She said. Shit! What\u2019s with her? Man, I\u2019ve never felt pressure like this from anyone! Chijinda said. Just by looking at her, I can tell this isn\u2019t her first time. You said. I don\u2019t lack self-confidence and all, but I don\u2019t see a certain chance we have of taking her down! What do you we do?! Chjinda said. Bring the giant to her knees! You said. You have got to be JOKING, or insane? Or are you mocking me?! She said. If you think you can kill us, the do it!! You shout. You\u2019ll find me made of studier stuff than my society sisters! It would be like moving the ocean! You want to die? FINE! The bottom of my shoes will show you your place! She said. Bring it! You said. You\u2019re going to be the death of me! Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly try to analyze a good spot for attack, but she quickly raises her foot and bring it down with tremendous speed. You and chijinda move out of the way just in time. You both get up to see a shadow cast over you. Move! You said. You both move out of the way just in time again. Shit! You said. Look out! Chjinda said. You turn around to see her kick you. You are sent flying right to the wall. You hit the wall hard and hear a few bones break. Shit! That hurt. You said. For some reason, you feel angry. I refuse to die under a person\u2019s foot!!! You said. With some my mystic force, you bounce of the walls and hit her square in the face. The sudden hit makes her stumble and you land on the ground. Chjinda sees your eyes are red. Hmph! Everybody deserve one, at least. But that was your ONLY time! She said. She raises her foot high up and stomps down with authority. At first, she has a triumphed smile, but notices her foot is moving. What?! She says stunned. Now! You said. Chijinda slices at her leg with enchanted sword and hits both of her legs. The sudden hit makes her bend. Then you toss her foot aside and jump up and uppercut her on the chin. You both attack her legs at the same time. You both are moving in a zigzag motion so she can\u2019t keep up. You both hit her on her leg. Then chjinda toss you up high and you punch her square in the stomach.  Even with all the attacks you two give and she gives, you all are still standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pant* I must have underestimated you both, despite being miserable insects!! But DON\u2019T go thinking you\u2019ve beaten me or anything ridiculous like that! I only have myself to blame for going so easy on you. I felt bad facing you with such domination. Still, it\u2019s a shameful mark on my pride and for that I will never forgive you until you\u2019ve been reduce to a smear under my heel. She said. Don\u2019t count on it! You said. You said. Before round two could start, you all hear ringing. Oh? That\u2019s the high priority call direct from HQ! As much as I want to crush you both into unidentifiable stains, I won\u2019t risk being late on your behalf. Plus, if this encounter head shown me anything, it\u2019s that you both are worthless as enemies! Even if we let you run around as you like, you wouldn\u2019t be able stop our plane in any way. Believe me when I say this, I\u2019ll be finding you again shortly. So enjoy what little time your life has been given for now, miserable specks! She said. She walks right over you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Right then, you\u2019re eyes change to normal and you start coughing blood. Hold still! Chijinda said. He injects you with the syringe. You feel it start working and all your bones are mended. Thanks. You said. Come on. He said. You both keep going. </span></div></div>",

This must have been the guy who left. You said. You both  head to the machine. We can\u2019t operate it from this size. You said. That\u2019s when the ground shook again. Damnit! You said. The ground keep shaking. Shit! Here we go again. You said. Then you both see Narue. Narue! You said. She\u2019s a sight for sore eyes. Chjinda said. Narue. We\u2019re down here! Look down and down move your feet too much. Chjinda said on the walkie talkie. Narue looks down and see you both. Oh! Thank God you two are safe! She said. Narue! This machine can make us big again! Can you operate it?! You shout. I\u2019ll\u2026..try. I wasn\u2019t good with computers. She said. Narue takes a glance at the machine. Ok. I think a press this\u2026..She mutters. The machine hums to life. Ok. So far, so good. She said. You both step in.  Ok. Now I think I press this button and this one. She said. There is a huge surge of electricity as machine activates. Then after a few seconds, the glass door opens and you both walk out at normal size. Shit yeah!  You both said. Nice to be back at my current size. Chjinda said. Narue hugs you both. God to have my two guys back! She said. Yeah and not have to look up at her towering over us. You said. We have to get out of here. You said. Yeah. Let\u2019s quit this place. Chjinda said. You three head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way? You said. I think left. Narue, which way you came in from? Chijinda said. Those stairs on the far side over there. She said. Through that corridor? Ok. Home free. You said. As you make you way to the stairs, you get a bad feeling. Someone\u2019s coming. Narue, hide in that locker! You said. No way! I\u2019m not sitting by while you two get caught and shrunken again! She said. We only have one syringe left. Either for me and chijinda here. We have to use it wisely if we do. You said. ugh. Fine! She said. Narue hides in the locker. You ready? You said. As I\u2019ll ever be. Chijinda said. You both see a green haired coming down the hall and to you both. Please, I\u2019ll have to ask you to stop there and cease your irresponsible actions before someone gets hurt. She said. Well, here\u2019s a surprise. You actually care about our wellbeing? Or is this some fa\u00e7ade? You said. Hmmm, how to answer. I\u2019ll let you two decide. Either way, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you waltz right out of here. Especially after how you slighted senpai. She said. Senpai? I thought we were in America, not Japan. Who the hell calls someone senpai? You said. It\u2019s Japanese to refer to a senior officer. You know, that drill haired bitch who talked down to us. I\u2019ve seen her with others. Chijinda said. Damn. How can stand being around some stuck up psycho for more than a minute? You said. Watch it, man. She\u2019s not one of the regulars. Chijinda said. You\u2019d do well to listen to him. W..While I may have more tact and patience\u2026..and good graces\u2026.then senpai\u2026and not have as a important placement in the big scheme\u2026 You\u2019ll find that underestimating me for my pleasant demeanor is quite the costly mistake!! She said. That\u2019s cute. Now, go play with your dollies. You joked. If possible, I would like to apprehend you both in a painless and cooperative manner as possible. I enve promise to stand up for you in front of the director if you come along quietly. She said. This girl really doesn\u2019t know us. You said. A smart girl like you must know that we\u2019re not gonna roll over like obedient little dogs\u2026just because you\u2019re a bit nicer than the average drone. Not after coming this far and what we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m sure you understand \u2026..uhm\u2026\u2026 Chijinda said. Oh! I am sorry, how rude of me not to introduce myself! I am the Advance Sciences Society\u2019s head of logistics and communication\u2026. Komugi Mizuho. I also hold the honor of being the lowest ranked of the four Heavenly Queens who oversee the society\u2019s operations. She said. Heavenly queens? Talk about ego. So good, they think they\u2019re godly. You said. I\u2026..I did not choose the naming idea myself. \u2026..Senpai did, actually.  Think of us as the head of executives controlling the various departments of the society, and subservient only to the S ranks. She said. Subservient? That just means you\u2019re grunts with more training than the standard drones. You said. It not only serves as a status symbol and to designate the most skilled and contributive members of the society\u2026 It also provides a further foundation of loyalties and gives the lower ranked members ambitions which drives them to their full potential. She said. And traitorous actions. That\u2019s what ambition really leads to. Stepping on other people\u2019s toes and backs must be common around here. You said. Cool it, man. No need to get hot and bothered. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to work very hard to get where I am today. Plus, you need the recommendation of one of the members.  But enough about me. You, I must presume, are chijinda, yes? And you must be his brash, foul mouthed, yet quick thinking and action partner. I\u2018d like to say it\u2019s an honor meeting two accomplished individuals\u2026 She said. Still sounds like you\u2019re mocking us to me. You said.  I dunno. It\u2019d be nice to have some positive reinforcement from some cute girls about now, enemy or not. Go on, give it a shot. Chijinda said. Poke fun with bravado all you like, it seems like we\u2019re at an impasse. She said. Looks like it to me. Only one way to go from here! You said. The old unstoppable object vs immovable force. Do this every time. Chijinda said. Very well, you both seem prepared, and if nothing else, I\u2019ll follow my orders more accurately. I don\u2019t like violet methods much myself, but I did give you a chance!!  She said.  How do you think we got our reputation!? I feel bad about hurting a cute girl, but you\u2019re with the enemy, so no leniency! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both get ready, you see her pull out a mini gun. (A min gun?!? Where the hell she get that from and how can she lift it so easily?! ) You thought. You both go wide eyed when you see it. (We have to get her to fire it first. If we rush her\u2026\u2026) You thought.  Chijinda goes in. Wait! You said.  When chjinda got close, she panics and pulls the trigger.  The stopping power and velocity of the bullet put chijinda down in a second. Shit! You said. You shoulder charge her to the ground. Not today! You said. You pull out the syringe and inject him in the heart. Chijinda takes a huge breath of air and all of the bullet wounds close up. You idiot! You said. You take the gun and swing it towards her. You toss it away slam her into the wall. No! That\u2019s enough. Chjinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re an idiot! Rushing full head? You said. We were both thinking it and it was going to happen. Just a matter of who. He said. Grrrrr! You said. Oooo\u2026 I\u2026I failed. Looks like getting your honor back senpai will have to wait. She said. No hard feelings. Just not in the mood to die or be enslaved today. But I\u2019m not the sort to kill unnecessarily. Chijinda said. Speak for yourself! Bash the bitch\u2019s skull in! You said. No! We don\u2019t kill! That was our policy! He said. Yeah, but this bitch pulled out a mini gun! I say that\u2019s ground rules to do her in! That\u2019s military hardware! You said. We don\u2019t kill! Period!! Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026\u2026Your own kindness might be your undoing one of these days. I will say this. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds. Don\u2019t let beating me go to your head. My standing is the lowest among the four Heavenly Queens, and it\u2019s a sure bet that one of them will succeed where I have failed. One way or another, you two WILL be stopped, you\u2019ll regret not acquiescing to me then. Ignoring the high executives entirely, and as you\u2019ve seen with senpai, the other three are nowhere near as generous am me. She said before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe should have killed her. You said. We don\u2019t do that. We\u2019re not Norton\u2019s team. That\u2019s why nobody likes them. Chijinda said. Narue. Come on out. You said. Narue comes out of the locker.  Is it done? She said. Yeah. Let\u2019s go. You said. You three head up the stairs and into a secret passage. As you follow it, you three see a ladder and climb it. The ladder leads into the computer room of the School. Come on. Chijinda said. You three head through the school and into the dorm the principle has supplied to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So. What do we do? Narue said. Track down director of the organization herself. I always said go straight to the top for the most information. But we don\u2019t know where she is even at. Everyone in the organization idolizes her. I can\u2019t stress how cautious we should be. Either way, our end destination is clear. Chijinda said. And that is\u2026? Narue said.  The deepest and most secure level of the Advanced Sciences HQ. And not the public one either, but the facility spreading underground beneath the entire city and mountain. We break through and keep going through their facilities till we find the most secure, most guarded areas we can find\u2026 And I guarantee that\u2019s where we\u2019ll find our director as well. Chjinda said. I understand, and couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019m right behind you, chijinda! Narue said. Just got off the phone with HQ. Reluctantly, they are sending us more of that serum. You said. Good. We\u2019re going to need it. Chijinda said. Yeah. Also the boss said he was disappointed that one of his best teams need these, and said that he will be reevaluating his confidence in us. You said. He doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re dealing with. Narue said. When will it get here? Chijinda said. A few minutes. You said. Then there is a knock at the door. You open it and see the package. More like right now. You said. You pick it up and open them. Eight of them. Enough? You said. It\u2019ll have to do. Chijinda said. Narue. You hold onto them. You said. I will. She said. Narue takes the syringes. So how do we get into said territory? You said. The same we got out. Come on! Chjinda said. You three head back the way you came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the ladder guys. You said. You climb down first and wait for narue and chijinda.  You head to yur left and find an area with eight computers and a sealed door. His must lead to central HQ. If we go, we can\u2019t comeback until it\u2019s finished. You said. We all know what to do. Let\u2019s do this! Narue said. Alright. Hacking complete. Let\u2019s do this. Chjinda said. The door opens and you all head down the stairs. Look at all the shit down here. These bitches are planning something. You said shocked. I\u2019m with you. This must all lead to something. Narue said.  I know, but whatever it is, let\u2019s make sure it doesn\u2019t see the light of day! Chjinda said. You all start to explore the place. This way. You said. You follow the hallway and marvel at the astonishing machinery. I never admire the enemy, but this shit is of the charts of it being military tech. You said. Yeah. I\u2019d say they are at least 5 years ahead of the military. Chijinda said. Come on. Across this bridge. You said. You cross the bridge and see nothing in site. Shit. Where\u2019s the security in this joint? You said. I think we found it. Narue said. You see a security mech robot clad in purple and black. Another one of these things? You said. We must be headed in the right direction. Chijinda said. Iron queen to command. Message relayed: Elimination targets acquired. Estimated sortie time: 300 seconds. It said. Ohhh, so you\u2019re human in there, huh? Nice toy robot you got there. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not a drone then. Chijinda said. Five minutes? I feel like she\u2019s not taking us seriously. After all the ass kicking and staying one step ahead of them we\u2019ve been doing. You said. Iron queen to command. Stating new report. 180 seconds until successful destruction of targets. Your arrogance and boasting are exactly as my comrades and underlings reported. Your childish attempts at disturbing my calm or causing me to make an mistake by insulting my pride are useless. And even were it not my responsibility to defend this junction\u2026 I would stop you merely to put a halt to reina and madame vice director\u2019s constant ranting. She said. I think we pissed of the little tonka toy here. And like all toys, they break and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s gonna do! You said.  The odds of that are quite unlikely. But by all means, I encourage you to do your best. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(That mech is outfitted with a flamethrower, rocket launchers and other gizmos. I think I see a weak point. There is a soft spot in the waist area. If we can hit that enough times, that suit will shut down.) You though. You see her arm the flamethrower. Get down! You said. You hold them both to the ground as she sprays the flamethrower. You got any fancy weapons on you? You said. Here. I found this on one of the members. A knife that sharpens with each stab and increases damage per stab. He said. You take it. Carbon fiber as well. You said. When she stops, you take the chance and stab tight in the soft spot. (Yes!) You thought. You go for one more and hit it again in the soft spot.  You see here fire laser right at you and it hits right in the chest. Fuck! You said. Chijinda goes in with his katana and hits right across it. Hold still! Narue said. Narue injects you with one of the syringes. Ow! You said.  You feel all the pain go away. Right then, you push her out of the way of a rocket. These bitches are nuts! You said. You and chijinda both attack together in the soft area. No! Priority one command! Suit eject, NOW! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the suit blows up, the girl is ejected out of it. \u2026..Impossible\u2026\u2026Tch. How unsightly me. Still, to think that lady Masque, Executive head of security\u2026..and second ranked of the four heavenly queens would fail so gratuitously to unqualified civilians such as yourselves. She said. Ugh. The ego in them is contagious. You think so highly of yourself that you call yourself \u201cLady Masque\u201d? Halloween is 4 months from now. You said. What, are you horribly burned? You\u2019re not someone I used to know with a grudge or something are you? Chijinda said. SILENCE!! I will not be mocked by imbeciles! T\u2026There\u2019s a good reason I wear this mask!! She said. She has an ugly face. You\u2019ve seen those girls before? Nice body, ugly face. You said. And she has a cape as well. Narue said. Good God! Lady, tell us the truth, it\u2019s just for style, right? I can dig that. And believe me, I\u2019ve seen much weirder things. Chijinda said. And here I thought you considered yourself chivalrous, making fun of a lady\u2019s weakness. She said. I hope you are a lady under that mask. You said. Now, now, no need to get so personal. I bet you\u2019re the cute one all the other girls are jealous of. Although you\u2019re way too serious to enjoy it. Let me guess, you were totally the class rep type before this? Chijinda said. You wouldn\u2019t pay me such compliments if you saw what I have to hide.  You\u2019d be like the others\u2026. She said. And now who\u2019s being unfair? Besides, the real reason for the teasing was just to prove you wrong! He said. Yeah. All that bravado back there? \u201cI am the second ranked heavenly queen! You won\u2019t get under my skin!!\u201d You\u2019re going to say you\u2019re cool as a cucumber? You said. \u2026\u2026\u2026Hahahahahahahaha! Well played, chijinda. Spectacular. I certainly must concede yet another loss. But I won\u2019t let you capitalize on it. She said. I\u2019m not really playing games here, Masque&lt; my demeanor aside.  I just want to get by. The losers should just bow out gracefully. Chijinda said. You should count yourself lucky that I was stuck operating the power armor Reina. Were I using my own strength, you would have lasted less then the few minutes my initial estimate granted you. She said. You\u2019re all make the same excuses. You said. I suppose I cannot refute that right now. But, there\u2019s another problem with your original statement. \u201cThe losers should just bow out\u201d Who said that I lost? I merely wanted to correct the undoubtedly mistaken impression you were under as to why you weren\u2019t dead. I had to do so prior to fighting you hand to hand, you see. Because then you WILL be dead and I will have missed my chance. She\u2019s not done yet! Narue said. Then let\u2019s finish what we started! You said. Enough talk! Have at you! She said.</span></div></div>",

Thinking quickly, you put your arm up and the sword is lodge in your left arm. What?! That should have cut you whole arm off! She said. Temporary reinforced bone. You said. You stab her right in her stomach. Damnit! Next time, it will be fatal. You said. Chijinda comes in right behind you and goes for her leg, but misses. Darn! He said.  She comes at you and attacks you with both swords. You dodge all of her attacks.  Right between a break, you punch her in the face. Ow! That mask is tough. You said. Chijinda comes in and attacks her again. This time, she goes after narue and slices both swords in a z fashion. Narue! You said. I\u2019m\u2026..fine. She said. You and chijinda attack her at the same time. She blocks with both swords. Simultaneously, you both kick her and hit her right on the mask. Narue! You said. Right! She said. With extreme focus and on deadly accuracly, Narue shoots a deadly arrow right in Lady Masque\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh\u2026.You\u2026..bastard\u2026.ngg\u2026. I can\u2019t lost to you\u2026! Why to you people\u2026!! She said. Then her mask breaks. \u2026..My\u2026..Mask\u2026.! Noooo\u2026\u2026\u2026 She said. What\u2019s with her? Fighting tooth and nail one minute, now she\u2019s all quiet and sweating\u2026 Chijinda said. Don\u2019t you see? One eye color doesn\u2019t match the other. You said. T..Tetsuko?! Is that you?! Narue said. You know this girl? You said. Well, not really. I only met her when I was backtrailing you both! She helped me out\u2026.kind of. Now that I think about it\u2026. Tetsuko?! How could you do these things! Narue said. (Damn. Hardly ever see Narue so angry\u2026) Chijinda thought. \u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2026..I told you. I\u2026am the head of security for the Advance Sciences\u2026Society. *sigh* \u2026\u2026..I exist now to protect the ideals of my superiors, and the efforts of my charges. \u2026..And my loyalty lies with them. Tetsuko said. You sound like a robot. You said. I can admire your dedication, and you passion, but I can\u2019t adire those ideals you talk about!! No one committing all the terrible crimes the society is perpetrating deserves someone so loyal to their cause. And your \u201csuperiors\u201d only have worse things in store. I know I maybe don\u2019t have the right to talk as if I know you, but I\u2019d like to. And I know I\u2019m not wrong about you\u2026 Isn\u2019t there any way to convince you to stop and turn back? And if you have any close friends in there, you should ask them to do the same! Narue said. You gotta admit the girl\u2019s got a point. Chijinda said. I don\u2019t see protecting. I see slaving, killing, and tormenting people to who knows what end. You said. Wich means even you have to see the bigger picture here for what is really is, ranting aside,right? Chijinda said. You\u2026.You don\u2019t understand\u2026.. No one could. She said. With what I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t want to understand. You said. You\u2019re not going to blame others for your actions, now are you? Chijinda said. No! That\u2019s not what I meant! She said. Boys! Let her finish! Narue said. Unless you know WHAT we\u2019re doing all this for\u2026unless you\u2019ve heard what the director\u2019s told us, SEEN what she\u2019s showed us\u2026.!! There\u2019s no way I\u2019d stop. Not even CHOOSE to stop!  This might be barbaric to you, and I suppose some of it must be\u2026. She said. Oh, sure. Cause shrinking people down and using them for horrible things and whatnot is the most reasonable way. You said sarcastically.  \u2026.But it should tell you something that I\u2019d do it for my loved ones, for EVERYONE again, if given the choice!! She said. If that\u2019s what you think, then people like us will be there to put a monkey wrench in you plans!  You won\u2019t get away with this so easily! You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we agree to disagree for right now, Lady. You\u2019re free to go. Put a band aid on, get a new mask, or whatever. Chijinda said. Y\u2026You\u2019re letting me go? She said. To hell with that! You said. What did I say earlier?! Chijinda said. People like her don\u2019t change chijinda! You heard her! She\u2019d do it all again, if given the chance! The shrinking, crushing, capturing, all that! There\u2019s only one way to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen! You said. I SAID we don\u2019t kill! Is that understood?! He said. Did you not see what the fuck they do?! Me and you experienced that shit! Do you really want more people to go through that?! You said. What is killing her going to solve?! Chijinda said. It\u2019ll send a message to the rest of those fucked up bitches that this will not be tolerated! I told you on day one that we might be force to break our policy! That some people don\u2019t deserve the comfort of a jail cell! Some people are too far gone, chijinda and that\u2019s what these bitches are! You think they are going to regret what they did?! You think they care about the families of the missing people they just casual crush?! No! Because if they did, then we wouldn\u2019t be here! You saw her intent! You saw the other queen\u2019s intent! They want to kill us, chijinda, and they don\u2019t care how as long as we are dead! You said. And what if we do kill her? She\u2019d died for what she\u2019d believe and that will only reinforce what they are doing is right, which mean more people will shrunken! He said. And that\u2019s why we kill her! If she wants to die for her beliefs, let her! They\u2019re running unopposed chijinda. They\u2019re not scared of us! They\u2019re laughing at us! We\u2019re just letting them live left and right! One of us is going to give chijinda, and it will be either us or them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough! Tetsuko, just go! Narue said. I\u2019ll\u2026..retreat for now, but there will be a next time! She said before leaving. What the fuck has gotten into you both?! Cracking down in front of the enemy?! Narue said. Chijinda knows these girls can change, but just lets them walk away. You said. We\u2019re not helping if we kill them! That will only prove they are in the right! He said. They will NOT change, dumbass! You heard what she said, She will do it all again, if given the chance. And she meant it too. You said. Are we any better than them if we kill them?! Chijinda said. It\u2019ll show that this bullshit won\u2019t stand! Look the families dead in the eye and tell them that their sons or daughters were killed under some psycho fanatic girl\u2019s foot or ass, or worse eaten alive!  And the girl that did it is in jail and not in the ground! You said. Stop it! Just stop it! Narue said as she came between the two of you. You two want to handle the case your way, but we can only do it one way! Before we even take another step further, you two need to cool off and come to an agreement on this. Chijinda, go that! You, go that way! And don\u2019t come back until you two are ready to TALK to each other! Narue said. You both storm off in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2026..dumbass! He just doesn\u2019t get it! You said. You punch the wall in a fit of anger. They don\u2019t change! They NEVER change! You said. As you\u2019re venting, you see one of the committee members. You walk up right behind her and force her to the ground. Where is the director?! You said. Ugh! Get off me!!! She said. She starts to struggle, but you slam her into the wall. I\u2019m in no mood for this! Where is she?! You said. You\u2019ll have to kill me!!  I won\u2019t give up her majesty!! She said. You really want to die for someone who doesn\u2019t even know your name?! You said. She\u2019s shown us what must be done!! What will happen if we don\u2019t!! People like YOU don\u2019t understand! I\u2019ll gladly die for her!!! She said. You were about to snap her neck, but hesitate at the last second. (Maybe\u2026\u2026 Chijinda was right. If they are willing to throw their lives away for this girl, is killing them really going to send a message?) You thought. Go on! I accept death in the name of mistress!! She said. How about you take a long nap? You said. You slowly choke her out until she slips into unconsciousness. Maybe chijinda\u2019s right. Killing them will only make the rest think they are in the right. Jesus. This is what happens when I lose my temper. I owe chijinda an apology. You said.  </span></div></div>",

About how I acted, it was not professional, and\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want this case to be the one that end\u2019s our friendship. I just\u2026..don\u2019t want to be like Norton, who just let\u2019s his people do want they want. Chijinda said. I\u2019m\u2026\u2026also sorry. Having that breakdown right in front of the enemy\u2026\u2026very unprofessional and selfish. I\u2026\u2026let this get personal\u2026\u2026..seeing what happened to all the missing students and how they died\u2026\u2026.and when it happened to us, I felt we were going out the same way and\u2026\u2026..i didn\u2019t want to die to die by someone\u2019s foot or ass. You said. See? So can you two make up? Narue said. You both never apologized for anything you both did, but you two want your friendship to forever. \u2026\u2026Sorry. You both said. So are we on the same page?  Narue said. Yeah. No killing. You said. Good. Now, with that all said and done and you two buddy buddy, we can go on. Narue said. With things patched up between you and chijinda, you all head deeper in the HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. This level looks like it\u2019s going to require at least B level clearance. You said. The deeper in, the tighter the security. Chijinda said. As you look around, you see another prototype security device. Another one?! You said. What\u2019s it doing in a place like this? Chijinda said. This must be where they first developed it. Narue said. They must have tested it on volunteers or test animals before putting in another. You said. That\u2019s it! All the wiring and circuitry on the card scanner back there is connected to the electrical conduits around here!! Narue said. Meaning? Chijinda said. I have an idea! It may sound ridiculous, but bear with me\u2026 She said. Ok. Let\u2019s hear it. You said. Why don\u2019t we shrink you both down again! Narue said. \u2026.I\u2019m sorry. I must be deaf. Say what now? Chijinda said. No, no, think about it! We make you two small again, and then you can sneak through the wiring and vents around here without a problem! I know that\u2019s being optimistic, I\u2019m sure there are defenses, and you\u2019ll run into roadblocks, and no one will be more worried than me!! But they won\u2019t be expecting anyone to WILLINGLY shink themselves just to infiltrate the complex\u2019s security! If you two can make your way into the card reader from within the conduits, you should be able to deactivate or trigger it from within!! Narue said. After the nightmare I went through, I kind swore off shrinking again, but\u2026.. Chjinda said. Maybe if we were just in the vents and not on the ground\u2026.. You said. Plus, there\u2019s always the guarantee that if you need to be reinlarged, we can just do it right here, anytime!! Narue said. She\u2019s right. The only way through is that door, and it\u2019s not opening for us. You said. Yeah, and we\u2019re running out of time. Chijinda said. Good!! Now that that\u2019s decided. Let\u2019s get you shrunk! You can climb into my hand and I\u2019ll take you to the nearest conduit! Narue said.  I get the feeling that you\u2019re a little eager to see us as the size of an ant. You said. Don\u2019t worry! Until both get inside and back to normal, I\u2019ll support you as best I can the whole way!! Narue said. I need to get conformation that you\u2019re not going to play with us while we are that small. Chijinda said. W\u2026W.. What\u2019re you talking about?! Jeeeeez, T..That\u2019s not it at all\u2026.! Hahahaha\u2026..hahahahaha! Narue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two walk right into the machine and narue goes to the console. I need to make a will. Chijinda said. I want you to have my laptop, and don\u2019t be on porn hub. You said. Narue, we\u2019re all set. Just\u2026.fire away! Chijinda said. Ok! Here I go! Narue said. The machine activates and a whirl of electricity is seen at the top of the machine. Then the machine dies down and the glass door opens. Not again\u2026. You both said. Ahhhh! I..It really did make you incredibly tiny! I know we went through this before, but to see it happen right in front of m\u2026 Narue said. Narue\u2026.. I don\u2019t like that crazy glint I see in your eyes there\u2026. Chijinda said. Awwww, chijinda! You\u2019re sooooo CUTE!!! I\u2019d totally adopt you as my pet!! Hehehehe! Narue said. Hey! Not so fast!! I\u2019m fragile at this size!!!  This is why I didn\u2019t want to use the damn machine! Chijinda said. Aww, sorry. I just got carried away\u2026 Do you really hate being handled by me that mauch..? Narue said. Geh..NO!.....no, it\u2019s just.. Traumatic experiences. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d actually enjoy it if you take it easy for a bit\u2026 Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026Reeeally? Narue said. Look\u2026.! I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re serious or giving me a hard time, so can we get on with this?! Chijinda said. Yeah\u2026..let\u2019s. Cause some of us don\u2019t like being left HERE on the FLOOR!!! You shout. Sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to leave you down there\u2026 I\u2019m not doing a very good at keeping me word, am i? Narue said. Narue reaches down and picks you up gently. Let\u2019s do this! Narue said. As narue takes you to one of the open vents, you and chijinda discuss future plans. We might come across one of those queens again. You said. How much of that stuff you have left? He said. A half tank. I didn\u2019t think I used that much. You said. Save it for a dire situation. He said. How much you have? You said. A three/fourth of a tank. He said.   Alright. You should be able to do your thing in here. Narue said. She puts you both in the vent. Good luck! And please be careful out there.  You never know what these witches have in there.  Narue said. Yeah, we got it. Leave it to us! Ok, off into the great unknown! CHijinda said. I prefer to know where I\u2019m going, but to each his own. You said. You both trek into the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both traverse the dark vent, with little to no light. I swear if alien is in here\u2026.. You said. Fuck alien, these animal experiments they have going on male alien look like a stray cat. Chijinda said. Let\u2019s just find the control panel for that lock. You said. You both continue to make your way to the lock. Man, getting darker and darker, we must be getting close. You said. You both keep going until come acros it. There\u2019s the lock. You said. Great, now is it the blue or red wire? Chijinda said.  Chjinda pulls out the blue wire and you hear the sound of a door opening. And we are a go. You said. Should be smooth sailing from here on. Chijinda said. You two were about to leave when you two hear a meow. Is that a cat? You said. Then chijinda pushes you up against the wall. Don\u2019t move or make a sound. He said. You both see a cat, but it\u2019s body is female human and it has fur all over. The cat starts looking around and when it\u2019s on the far end, you and chijinda bolt away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s get out of here! You said. You both run in a random direction until you see light at the end of the pipe. You both make it to the end and are out of the pipe. Way to go, you two! The lock\u2019s deactivated! Narue said. Yeah. Let\u2019s never do it again. You said. Let\u2019s get back to normal size first. Chijinda said. Narue carefully picks you both up and heads back to the machine. Narue makes her way back to the machine and places you both in. Awww, and here I was starting to enjoy this- Narue\u2026.Please don\u2019t even start\u2026 Chijinda said. Sorry, sorry! Alright. I\u2019ll have you both normal in no time!! Narue said. Narue heads to the console. I mean it this time, NEVER shrinking again!! Chijinda said. Amen. You said. Narue starts up the machine and with a few crackles of electricity, the machine returns you both to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for all the hard work. Narue said. We never speak of this again. Now let\u2019s get this over with. You said.</span></div></div>",

Narue said. Red and white. The carpet must be Victorian. Chijinda said. This has to be the deepest level. If the director is anywhere, it\u2019s here. You said. Let\u2019s find her. Chijinda said. Right behind you Narue said. You three search every room for the director. Not in here. You said. That must be the dining room. She wouldn\u2019t be in there. Narue said. With each one, we\u2019re getting closer. Just have to be vigilant. Chijinda said. You all keep looking. This is taking too long. There could be hundreds of rooms. You said. We\u2019ll cover more ground separate, but do not do anything rash. If you find her, you let the others know. Chijinda said. You all split up. You search one room, but the director is not in there. Like trying to find a good person in Las Vegas. You said. You search four more rooms, but come up empty. Shit. If I was director of psycho fanatics, where would I be?  \u2026\u2026\u2026All the way at the back, but which way leads to the back? There are so many paths. You said. You think for a few seconds. The road less traveled. This carpet is Victorian, so it should keep the keep the footprints of those who were recently here. The footprints show that people come and go, but which on has the least? You said. You look at the paths. This one. I count only 3 sets of foot prints while the others have 6. This has to be the way. You said. You head down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going down the hall and come to a sudden stop. Voices. You said. You see three committee guards. Those must be A ranks. Best to wait it out. You said. You wait until the tree guards leave. In the clear. You said. You head down the path and come across some stairs. This must be the way. You said. You\u2019re about to head down, when you see someone come up the stairs. You\u2026..must be his partner. She said. Who\u2026..what are you? You\u2019re more machine than human. You said. Your friend did this to me. He\u2019s the one who stole my membership ID to get into our laboratories begin with. Words cannot describe my humiliation. Unfortunately, Madame vice-director and the rest of the leadership felt the same. They made me the burden of responsibility for his transgression, and as such\u2026revoked not only my own membership and rights\u2026but my humanity as well. I wasn\u2019t against the idea as a whole, however. Rather than seve as a useless experiment\u2026 I requested they test a new biomechanical remodeling twchnique on me so that I might gain the power to get revenge. True, I might be nothing more than the world\u2019s most advance cyborg now, and might even be more cold machine than human\u2026and I might have lost my friends, life, family, and future as well. However, in return, I have regain a far superior position in the new world to come\u2026 \u2026.And few even in heights of the society can ever challenge or look down on me ever again!! She said. \u2026\u2026\u2026.You\u2026\u2026.. You said. Just as I predicted the surprised look is the best gift I can received. You both have conscience and highly developed mora; sense. \u2026.What we are attempting, and what you are trying to stop. She said. \u2026\u2026..Are a sad excuse for a person. I can\u2019t even call you a person. You went through all this just for revenge? Replaced blood and bones for nuts and bolts?! Unlike my partner who would feel regret, I feel sorry for you. Traded your humanity for machinery. You don\u2019t look bad. In fact, you look like you\u2019re enjoying this. You said. I am. Watching you fools and the other pissants in the society, I feel surprisingly little regret for what I have lost or became. She said. You became a monstrosity. Gave up your human rights to become a machine. You\u2019re nothing but a tool for them. I feel no regret for you for what\u2019s about to happen.  \u2026\u2026.Chijinda isn\u2019t here. You\u2019re dealing with me if you want him. Cut me down if you can with all that machinery in you! You said. Very well. I\u2019ll drop your dead body at his feet and when he wonders where it all went wrong, then maybe he will know my pain! And my vengeance will be at and end and I can stand as the world\u2019s deadliest cyborg, and nobody will ever stand in our way!!! She said. You\u2019re going to die knowing that you\u2019ve lost everything!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go right at her, but when you get close, she knees you right in the stomach. This wasn\u2019t no regular knee to the stomach, this was enhanced with cybernetics, so it hurts even more. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll knee; over! You said. You punch her right in the face. (I got her attention.) You thought. She aims her gun at you and shoots a rocket. You duck and it misses. You charge her and rip the gun from her and fired it at her multiple times. You then swing it at her, but she grabs it and she reattaches it. Right before she could shoot it, you force her against the wall and hit her hard in vital spots. With just one punch, she gets you off her. \u2026\u2026impossible\u2026..Even with this lifeless  body\u2026everything I\u2019ve been through\u2026.i still lost\u2026..I\u2026I will remember this as well\u2026.. \u2026..You had best\u2026..remember it\u2026.and me\u2026.as well\u2026.. She said before fleeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go after her, but when you get to the bottom of the stairs, she\u2019s gone. Damn! She got away! You said. You look in a room and see a file with a bunch of reports. This is a priority one documentation! This must have all top secrets in here. The loss of this will cause so much havoc among the brass. You said. You take the file. \u201cHumanity\u2019s Reduction\u201d!! This\u2026..this must be thing these bitches are dying to see come true. You said. Chijinda. Narue. I found something that you both will want to see. You said on the walkie. My location\u2026\u2026Follow the road less traveled. You said. Narue, being able to decipher what you mean, was able to get to you in a few minutes. Chijinda, be the idiot he is, takes 30 minutes to get there. Look. \u201cHumanity\u2019s Reduction\u201d This is their plan. You said. What could it mean? Narue said. I don\u2019t know, but it can\u2019t be good. Knowing with what we\u2019ve seen of them, it\u2019s not good. You said. This is a good find. Let\u2019s keep it just in case. Chijinda said. I also found where the director is. A door that is heavily encrypted. You said. Nothing the hack tool can\u2019t handle. Chijinda said. You show him the door and chijinda starts hacking. In 3 minutes, the doors open. Maybe you are good for something. You said.  Come on. We got a date with the director. Chijinda said.   Wait. We need to show a united front. Whoever this director is will try to make what they are doing sound likes it\u2019s good. You said. You\u2019re right. We can\u2019t let them divide us. Narue said. So we agree. We\u2019re here to stop this\u201d Humanity\u2019s Reduction\u201d dead in its tracks. Chijinda said. With you all on the same page, you three go and stand before the director.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll admit that I may have looked down on you all a bit too much! I don\u2019t know whether to honestly complement or to be violently pissed off. The vice director said. Hm, So you two are the one I\u2019ve been hearing about from madame vice director here. The director said. Huuuh? That\u2019s so weird! If I disposed of one of you, you should be bubbling down in my tummy! Why are you, like, here now, and back to normal size, too?! Erika said.  Wouldn\u2019t you like to know? A detective never reveals his secret. Compare to all the other times my life was on the line, escaping tweedle dumb here is easy as pie. You said.  You base, impudent cre\u2026\u2026. Finish that sentence and you\u2019ll be eating out of a tube!! Chijinda interrupted. Let\u2019s not be unruly. We\u2019re all reasonable people here. It actually a pleasure to meet you in person after hearing about your daring activities in taking measures against us. The director. You have no idea. You said. The pleasure\u2019s all yours, trust me. Chijinda said. Now, now, no need to be that way. I\u2019ve been looking so forward to this. I believe we can be of mutal benefit to each other. The director said. We\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you also. Chijinda said. How the fuck do you think we can cooperate or help each other, considering. You said. Considering it\u2019s a miracle you can string yourself without drooling? The vice director said. No, considering I\u2019d rather die than even think about supporting anything going on here!! Chijinda said. If you want go red head, I\u2019ll be more than happy to put you six feet under! You said. My pleasure! Vice director said. We\u2019re not looking for a fight! Chijinda said. DO try to reign in your enthusiasm. The director said. Sorry\u2026.Vice director said. Keep your head cool. A fight now is something we don\u2019t want. Chijinda said. Fine. You said. And as for your aversion to lending your skills and efforts to our aims\u2026.. Well, how can you stand so resolutely against them when you don\u2019t know much about what they are? The director said. How can you say that?! After everything they\u2019ve been through! Not to mention what you\u2019ve done to this city and its people. Narue said. The gauntlet of death, imprisonment, torture, slavery, playing god, cannibalism\u2026and treating lives like they mean nothing were a good hint. Any of this sound familiar? Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026..You\u2019re upset. I can understand that. Nor do I blame you, with the trails you\u2019ve been through. The director said. Director, you don\u2019t have to\u2026.. Vice director said. No,no, truthfully now, it wouldn\u2019t be an over exaggeration to say that these two have been through heel and back thanks to us. But that\u2019s just the trouble! Instead of a careful demonstration of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, you\u2019ve only seen the worst side of it! With a proper, guided controlled explanation of our grand purpose, I\u2019m certain I could have you come around. The director said. Don\u2019t count on it, but try. You said. You honestly expect us to believe that all the god awful things we\u2019ve seen happening around here are some sort of mistake? We\u2019ve seen what you and your people are doing! Chijinda said. I\u2019m not trying to tell you any such excuses, nor am I trying to downplay the range of our activities and their consequences! I merely believe that once you become aware of our justifications, that even you might come to extend yourself to achieve our cause. The director said. Doubt it. You said. Really? Even if I told you, with honesty, that the fate of the entire world might depend on us? She said. Don\u2019t tell my you\u2019re buying that bullshit?! You said. You can see that him and narue are having a conversation, but in their heads.  In any case, as a promising detective, I\u2019m sure you must have quite the variety of questions you\u2019d like to ask us\u2026 So how about it, then? Is it possible for you to cooperate with us? If you were to agree, I would be more than generous to forgive your\u2026..disruptive behavior up to this point.  The director said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirector!!! These....two\u2026.are too dangerous!! We need to dispose of them t=right here and now! \u2026For the sake of our plan!!! Vice director said. Now, now, please calm down, madame vice director. I\u2019m simply offering them one final chance to make the right decision. A reward for making it this far despite your efforts, if you like. The director said. Th\u2026that\u2019s not my fault, director!! I\u2019m not trying to make excuses! Our security protocols here at HQ were ridiculous, and represented the best elements of our advances! And our entire security force was deployed when they shrunk! For heaven\u2019s sake, they even battered their way through Tetsuko and the remaining experimental test subjects!! Vice director said.  Please, please, settle yourself vice director. I was just trying to joke. Even though none of you could possible conceive of it right now now\u2026 \u2026.I assure you that our purpose, our ends, are sublimely noble, and of the utmost importance.  How about it, will you become allies? Or else I\u2019m afraid\u2026. The director said. Fuck being allies! We\u2019re\u2026. you\u2019re suddenly stop by chijinda\u2019s arm. Do not tell me you are agreeing to this. You said.</span></div></div>",

I really would have desired you as a valuable ally. However, I simply cannot afford the consequences of allowing you to run free, even if there\u2019s no chance of stopping us!  Very well, as you wish vice director, I leave their disposal to you. The vice director said. Chijinda\u2026. Earlier I only reduced you to a meager 1/100th of your normal size. This time however, let\u2019s see you come back when I shrink you all the way down to 1/10,000th!!!  As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see, this newest model, our portable shrinking device, is quite a bit more powerful than the previous version. That\u2019s right, shrink down to the size of your fellow germs\u2026and desperately struggle against the mites and lint, in the forests of dust bunnies\u2026in the world of this rug for what little remains of the rest of your pitiful life!!!! The vice director said.  As the vice director aims at chijinda. You quickly move and break her arm, which makes her drop the gun. The shrinking ends now.  Then you all here a bell gonging. What\u2019s that bell sound? You said. Director! The time has finally come. I told them to toll the bell when the final turning diagnostics and preparations for Operation: Humanity\u2019s reduction were complete. The vice director said. Very good. Well then, as planned, shall we head over to \u201cThe Tower\u201d ourselves? The director said.  The vice director and Erika leave. If you\u2019re really whole hog on stopping us then you\u2019ll have to make sure to make it all the way through \u201cThe Tower\u201d. Of course, that\u2019s IF you can make it there alive\u2026. Hahahaha\u2026.!! She said. You think we\u2019re just going to let you out? You said. You still have my little friend behind you to worry about. She\u2019ll be your opponent this time. Until we meet again. Maybe\u2026.  The vice director said. Then she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl comes in. How many of you creeps are crawling outta the woodwork?! Who the fuck are you now? By the looks of it, one of those four queens you call yourselves. Heh, you look like the sort who gets off on being called mistress Chijinda said. Weeell, aren\u2019t we rude. If you must know, my name is Kanon, the third ranked of the society\u2019s four heavenly queens. And you\u2019re chijinda and his brass partner, yes? I\u2019d like to say the pleasure\u2019s all mine, but it doesn\u2019t matter since you\u2019ll be dying here. Let\u2019s just conduct ourselves to the task as elegantly, and cordially as possible. Crude as it may be. She said. Drop the bullshit. You\u2019re not the nice kind. You\u2019re the trashtalking and belittling kind. You said. Seems like they\u2019re not all dumb as I expected. Comparing me to these spoiled, egotistical brats? You\u2019ll see that we\u2019re like night and day! Do you know what I do here? I\u2019m the executive head of special operations, counterintelligence, and making prominent people disappear or clam up when they become a problem. I don\u2019t believe in pretty language, ideals, privilege, and certainly not the bullshit so man of my others,\u201dcomrades\u201d here o. She said.  You sound like a wonderful and stand up gal. Chijinda said. She sounds like the girls I know who joined the street gangs as soon as they hit high school\u2026 Narue said.  I whip? Are you a dominatrix? To each his own. You said. So what are you here for then? Chijinda said. Are you crazy? Blind? The control, recognition, and power might have something to do with it, duh!! Let me put it to ya this way: Here, I can be myself and do whatever I want to whoever I want in the name of the SOCIETY, and be good at it too! I can take anything, get anything, and stick it back to all the people that piss me off. And all I have to do is take out the society\u2019s dirty laundry. Handle all the nastiest work no one else wants a part of and make sure no one outside finds out until it\u2019s too late. And erasin\u2019 them if they do. And like I said, I\u2019m very good at my job. No one can outplan or outmaneuver my snealy little plots. Even the director uses my strategic planning, and so do the other queens and heads!! That\u2019s how I get ahead,y\u2019see! Kanon said. Really? You think you\u2019re that smart? We\u2019ll see soon. You said. So\u2026basically, you\u2019re a dirty bitch overcompensating for some inferiority complex? At least you\u2019re easier to understand then the others\u2026 Chijinda said. Ohh, now \u2018you\u2019ve gone and said it, ASSHOLE!! I am EXCEPTIONAL dirty bitch, and don\u2019t forget it!!! She said. Well, at least she\u2019s honest with herself\u2026 for better or worse\u2026 Narue said.  Listen pricks. As you might have guessed, pretty much everyone else here hates my guts, the upper brass and other queens included.  And NO ONE hates my guts more then that arrogant, stuck up, psycho cunt Reina!! And yet\u2026here I stand, only a few spots down from the top of the whole shebang, nasty old me, looking DOWN on everyone. Now class, why do we think that is, hmmm everyone? Kanon said. You\u2019re gonna tell us anyway. You said. It\u2019s because I\u2019m THAT good, fuckwads! It\u2019s because regardless of how much they want to spit in my eye, they NEED me! And that\u2019s all that matters. Results are far more important then methods any day. Goddamn morons if you can\u2019t see that! Let me tell you something good. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve figured out, the four queens aren\u2019t just head execs. We\u2019re also rated on our combat skills\u2026.. Gotta hold the homefront and all,hehehehe\u2026..!! Technically speaking, I\u2019m actually ranked lower than I should be!! After all, while I play along with them\u2026 \u2026.I don\u2019t exactly fit in, and can\u2019t hide my true colors all that much, right? Pft, not like want to. So they keep me down at the bottom. Bet yer ass Mizuho\u2019ll be prompted above me one a\u2019 these days too Not like ANY of that matters when the \u201cNew World\u201d comes soon and I\u2019ll be a goddess on the earth!! Heeheheeheeheehee\u2026!!  Anyway!! The point is that don\u2019t expect me to go down easier just cause you got past gatling girl and little miss Masque!! So, you ready to funking do this or what? Kanon said.  I\u2019ve been ready since we wanted to barrel past you and get them! I was just waiting for you to shut the hell up! Chijinda said. L\u2026Listen!! It\u2019s not my fault everyone else around here rants or monologues!! That shit\u2019s contagious!! A..Anyway! Fine by me!! Bring it! I\u2019ll rip you to pieces and then beat what\u2019s left of you with your own limbs!!! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith extreme precision, she hits you right in the leg. The sudden pain almost made you kneel over. (Jusus! I didn\u2019t think a whip could hurt so much!) You thought. Chijinda also feels the sting of the whip. Narue quickly sidesteps her attack with ease. Taking the chance, you get in close and hit her hard on the face and stomach. With ease, she hits you with a barrage from that whip. Timing it just right, you hold up your arm and the whip wraps around and you pull her towards you and you punch her right on the nose. Now! You said. Chijinda attacks with a precision and narue punches her so hard that you thought you saw a tooth fly out.  (That look in her eyes\u2026.. Is narue\u2026..) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Ngg\u2026!!.....Well, shit\u2026!! That bitch Reina\u2019s\u2026.gonna tear me a new one\u2026. Kanon said. All that trash talking, down the drain just to lose to us. You said.

You interrupt her with a hit to the head. Take a long nap. You said. She was just stalling us. Chijinda said. Come on. We can probably can up. You said. As you and chijinda rush ahead, narue picks up that portable shrink device. This will come in handy later. She said. You and chijinda follow the trail, but are stop when a hatch won\u2019t budge. Damnit! Hatch won\u2019t move. Chijinda said. There\u2019s little we can do on this ladder. We have to find another way. You said. But we\u2019ve been all over campus. He said. Maybe we need to get off campus. You said.  You, chijinda, and narue head back to the campus. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I thought you said we need to be off campus. Chijinda said. I did, but I need something first. You said. After a few minutes, you see a truck drop a box at the gates. There it is. You said. What\u2019s in it? Chijinda said. The good stuff. Make sure their contraption doesn\u2019t work. Let\u2019s go. You said. You three head off into the forest behind the school. I had HQ pull a few strings to get us aerial recon. Turns out there is a way to the tower. Through this forest and through a cave. You said. Where do they get this shit from? Narue said. They must have friends in the military. Chijinda said. Ok. Here\u2019s the cave. For better or worse? You said. To the end. Narue said. No other way. Chijinda said. You three head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah. This looks like a gauntlet. These bitches really know what they are doing. Chijinda said. I know. Let\u2019s go. Narue said. Chjinda. Wait. You said. What? He said. Has narue ever used\u2026..you know\u2026\u2026it. You said. Once. She\u2019s a completely different person. That sweet innocence is gone. She turns into this fighter who has little remorse for anyone but the closest to her. He said. I think she might have used it again. I saw this look. A look of coldness and unfeeling. You said. She rarely uses it. Just in very dire situations. What about us? You said. Only if we have to. This stuff is killer on the body. Chijinda said. You two coming? Narue said. Yeah. You both said. You three traverse the huge maze complex until you come across tanks. A\u2026..Are those the new M2 Bulldogs?! Chijinda said. The ones with the 155 mm turret that fires AP, HE, and a built in flamethrower? You said. Yeah. Plus think hide armor that can withstand anything. This is a tankers dream right here. Chijinda said. The damage this behemoth could do. Just one of them can wreck a city. You said. You both are nerds\u2026..Narue said. But we\u2019re your nerds. You said. These girls are definitely got the whole world war dominance thing. Let\u2019s go. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you past the tanks, you get a very ominous feeling. One that makes you shudder. What is it? Narue said. You two go ahead. I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026catch up. You said. Did you have another one of your episodes? Chijinda said. \u2026\u2026yeah. Not a good one. Not good at all. Something about this certain spot. Just go. You said. Don\u2019t take too long. Chijinda said. Him and narue climb up the ladder. This spot. Why\u2019d I just have that feeling standing here? Unless\u2026\u2026 You said. (That only happens when something very bad is going to happen.) you thought. You open the package and take out the c4. You place it on the wall and arm it. This feeling better be right. I\u2019m not getting another one of those. You said. You head up that ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. This place is like a palace. A fountain and all that. You said. Yeah. Very regal. And a indoor pond. Chijinda said. Let\u2019s just stop whatever they are doing, ok? You said. Let\u2019s. Chijinda said. You three find a flight of stairs and go up them. There could be multiple floors. Who knows how big these thing is. You said. We\u2019ll climb all of them, if we have to. This operation stops dead in its tracks. Chijinda said. We just have to do what we\u2019ve been doing from the start.  Putting a monkey wrench in their plans. Narue said. Yeah. I\u2019m just saying we don\u2019t have a quick exit plan. You said. Quick exit? Death. Chijinda said. Ok, ok. Quit giving me the third degree. You said. You three keep going up. This has to be at least the eleventh floor. You said. Good. My legs are getting sore from all that climbing. Narue said.  Come on. Up ahead. You said. Shit. Company. Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInconceivable! There\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve scaled this Tower alive\u2026.! But listen to me, always going on like a broken record. For all your futile tenacity, it doesn\u2019t even matter! The device will be ready to activate in a matter of moments!! Like I told you, you\u2019ll always fall one step behind in the face of true genius!! The vice director said. \u201cTrue genius\u201d? Please. You can\u2019t even kill two people who were the size of an ant. You said. I assure you. If I came across you, you\u2019d be a stain on the ground! The vice director said.  Chijinda! I think I\u2019ll have to change my opinion of you! I know we\u2019re enemies and all, or whatever\u2026 \u2026.And you WERE really cute when you were tiny. But if you want my number, I\u2019d, like, totally go out with you sometimes when this is all over.  Erika. Said. You\u2019re a dumbass. That is the definition of true genius? You said.  IN ANY CASE! We have a little time to kill, so I think we\u2019ll spend it killing YOU!!  You should be overwhelmed with gratitude for the honor of being chosen as our playthings! As you street rats might say: Let\u2019s do this, Erika!! The vice director said. Like, roger that madame V-D!! Erika said. They both get in powered armor mechs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(We have to go full on right out the gate. With the stim, I can easily break those suits.) You thought. You activate the stim. Your eyes turn red. (He\u2019s using the stim. I did say use it in dire situation.) Chijinda thought. You attack the vice director and make a solid dent in the armor. (The armor\u2019s reinforced. Doesn\u2019t matter. Keep attacking and the dent will make a hole, that hole will make the suit rupture, and the rupture will make them come out of these things.) You said. You hit the suit with a solid kick. The director fires a homing missile. You grab the missile and throw it back at the suit. Chijinda! You said. Right! He said. He attacks, but is stopped by Eirka\u2019s flamethrower. You attack the vice director\u2019s suit again and this time, the dent becomes a hole. The suit starts to go on the fritz and the VD ejects. (Yes\u2026.) You thought. You block a roundhouse kick and force her to the ground. She shoves you off her before you could hit her. Right then, Erika fired knock out gas. Luckily, none of you were hit and smelled any of it. Swap! Chijinda said. You go and attack Erika\u2019s mech suit. T close, she impales you with a retractable sword. Not that easily!! You said. You pull out the sword and grab the arm and toss the mech to the ground. You break it open and pull out Erika. You\u2019re turn! You said to narue. You and chijinda double team the vice director, while narue handles Erika. You and chijinda make quick work of the director and narue has little trouble with Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026. I can\u2019t believe\u2026bggg\u2026\u2026I lost so badly. I\u2026.WON\u2019T believe it\u2026..!! And\u2026.to ch\u2026.chijinda of all people\u2026.! \u2026..You\u2026.just\u2026..wait and see\u2026..thought\u2026.i\u2019ll have\u2026..the\u2026.last laugh\u2026\u2026The vice director said. Take a seat, vice. You said knocking her out. You too dummy. Chijinda said to Erika. Then your eyes turn to normal. Alright!! We\u2019ll grab them later, but for now we have bigger fish to fry and going by what the lady said. We don\u2019t have time! Let\u2019s go! Chijinda said. You two go\u2026\u2026I\u2019m hurting all over. You said. Just hold still!! This will get you on your feet! Narue said. No! I\u2019m already at my limit with those. There is no time left! Just go and stop that crazy bitch! You said. But\u2026..! Narue said. I\u2019m still under the effects of the stim, the healing will kick in. Just go before it\u2019s too late!!! Narue! He\u2019s right. Come on! Chijinda said. You better not be dead when I come back. Narue said before leaving. While they go and confront the director, you wait out the healing. The pain and the gaping wound doesn\u2019t go away for about ten minutes. Then the healing effects of the stim finally kick in. Finally. I don\u2019t know how I survived ten full minutes of bleeding out, but I did. You said. Then you see chijinda and narue jump down the ladder. Get up and run! Chijinda said. Then the whole tower shakes. What the fuck!? You said. Then you see a giant fist break through the wall. What the shit!? You said. I said RUN!!! Chijinda said. You, chijinda, and narue run all the way down to the ground floor. What\u2019s going on?! You said. The director lost it! She shot herself one of those things and grew to gigantic size!!! Chijinda said. You\u2019re shitting me?!? You said. No! I\u2019m not. Chijinda said. Through here. The same way we came in!! Narue said.  You three head down the ladder.</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s no telling how long we have before she gets to town and start playing Goddess! Chijinda said. And leave you two behi--!!! \u2026What\u2019s are you two going to do? I\u2019ll go if you at least tell me you have some sort of plan. We\u2019ll head back to that hanger and take those bulldogs. Remember? That will buy time! Chijinda said. No way! That\u2019s too reckless! And it\u2019s impossible anyhow! There\u2019s no way even a tank could last five seconds against her!! She\u2019ll just stomp you flat, like a tin can\u2026.!! Narue said. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019ll take more than a titanic schoolgirl to take us out. Speaking from experience. Chijinda said.  Narue, do it. We\u2019ll make it happen! You said. If\u2026.If you\u2019re gonna go that far than you better not let me down! Alright! You can count on me! And\u2026.good luck! Narue said. Narue quickly leaves. Let\u2019s go, man! Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough here! The tanks are through\u2026\u2026 What the fuck are you bitches doing here?! Chjinda said. Horrible timing. And in a lace that\u2019s about to crumble. You said. Hahaha\u2026.!  No, I think this is the perfect time! We\u2019re going to ensure you\u2019re stopped here and now! I will not allow you to interfere with the director any further, under any circumstances! Just\u2026..look at her. Such a grand apotheosis\u2026.! I never even imagined! Is THAT how we all appeared to you shrinkies? Incredible! Truly a fitting form for those who deserve to stand atop the world\u2019s order! Like a goddess descended from high\u2026.! If there ever WAS a woman I\u2019m envious of, it could only be our director. If you\u2019ve truly ruined all our plans, and DAMN you for that, I must convince her to let me join her!! Just imagine, the entire world, spread out at our feet!! All man and nature\u2019s accomplishments paling at our stature! Reina said. Join her?! You must be out of your\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t even finish. You\u2019re glorious, righteous leader has fucking lost it! Nothing to her matters right now! You said. She\u2019s trashing everything that moves! Chijinda said. Damnit. It\u2019s getting worse out there! She\u2019s wrecking everything! You said. Put aside our damn differences and worry about the real problem. We\u2019re all dead if we don\u2019t get outta here now!! Unless you want to be buried under a million tons of rubble! Chijinda said. In the immortal words of someone or other, why the fuck should I care? It\u2019s just an early taste of what we were aiming for anyways. Oh, sure, we might not have gone speshit and obliterated anyone, even with the power tripping I know I was planning on\u2026 I always said she was repressed. You can only be little miss calm and polite for so long before you blow a fuse or two\u2026. She\u2019s earned some relief! Kanon said. You are demented beyond help. You said. Besides, I actually agree with Uzumaki over here for once, which is a fucking miracle really Kanon said. I believe I\u2019ve told you a thousand times NOT to cam that, you bitch!! Reina said.  That\u2019s not the point here!!! It\u2019s strange. I\u2026I never cared about the goals around here at all\u2026! Kanon said. You\u2019ve made that crystal last time we meet You said. BUT\u2026.now that it\u2019s come to this, I find myself assed if I\u2019m just gonna let everything go to hell in a handbasket. Certainly not cause of YOUR sorry ass, dipshit. I just decided for myself that I wanna see this new world they\u2019ve been gawking about. Kanon said. That, or we finally beat some sense into your ass. You just want your ass safe so it doesn\u2019t get stomped. You said. And don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten. I still owe you for our little throwdown in the audience chamber. Kanon said. I thought you wanted to lose there. As long as you bought time? Chijinda said. There\u2019s a difference between stalling some shitstains to buy time and getting your ass kicked for shits and giggles!!  Kanon said. So, you admit we kicked your ass then? You said.  Laugh it up while you can, forget ganging up on you, I\u2019m SO GONNA RIP YOU A..... Bring it! Your head will be bashed against this wall! You interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s quite enough of that, all of you. We\u2019re wasting time. I actually DO want to reduce the damage to the city as much as possible. But I won\u2019t risk leaving you two unchecked again. You;ve cost us too much, and I\u2019ve come too far to step back now. You can apologize again to narue for me, and I\u2019ll even admit that things have gotten WAY out of control over time. Tetsuko said. Heh. Seems like someone is back with a new mask. You said. I\u2019ve never opposed you or the others, and I still support our mission, but we\u2019ve condoned things that make some of us quite a bit hypocritical! Mizuho said. Indeed. There\u2019s way too much riding on our shoulders to turn back at this point. I\u2019ll continue to do what I\u2019ve always done. Perhaps you\u2019ll be able to rest easily knowing you\u2019ve influenced me to take a far greater hand in the future in protecting ALL our charges\u2026 \u2026.Both large AND small to the best of my ability. I give you my word that our new world will live up to the spirit of its creation. That all its citizens will be safe from blights so many of my companions have inflicted until now. Unfortunately, I cannot see the birth of our new world occurring with your deaths. A final sacrifice I\u2019m willing to grant. Lady masque said. It\u2019s sad, but I agree with her. I\u2019ve prepared myself, and I know you\u2019ve prepared yourself from the start. If I thought there was any possibility of talking you out of this opposition, I\u2019d take it. But we both know there isn\u2019t. But that goes for you as well, Senpai! I don\u2019t want to faction our society at such a crucial point\u2026.! \u2026.But if there isn\u2019t some serious policy changes then I know I and the others will do everything we can to stop the rampant abuse. Even if it means standing against you and some of the others. Why, with all the inexcusable acts we\u2019ve commited, it\u2019s no WONDER we have people like them trying to stop us. Mizuho said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all\u2026\u2026 Well! In any case, we can have as many discussions as we like about such important matters at a LATER time. Reina said. Maybe you all didn\u2019t hear me! What\u2019s more important, settling accounts here, or LIVING another five minutes! We NEED to vacate the area, NOW, or all the fighting in the world will be a moot point!! Chijinda said. Don\u2019t waste your breath, chijinda. They simple fact that they are standing in front of us shows that they are still on board with this stupid plan of theirs, and stopping us. We should have killed them when we had the chance. You said. With all four of us Heavenly Queens allied against you as one, we\u2019ll have all the time in the world to make a leisurely exit once you\u2019re dealt with! We may not often cooperate, but when we do, NOTHING can stand against our combined talents! Reina said. Right back at you! You said. Now we\u2019ll have you enjoy a taste of that power to your heart\u2019s content!! Let\u2019s go!! Reina said. If you think mere numbers can stop us, try it! Let\u2019s show \u2018em what real teamwork is! You said. Let\u2019s! Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you could do anything, Kanon\u2019s whip wraps around your feet and she pulls you towards them. Then Reina hits you with a shield. The sudden impact sends you back. You ok? Chijinda said. Swell. Get down! You said. You push chijinda to the ground to avoid being shot by the mini gun. Jesus. Chijinda said. The whole ground starts to shake. This building going down. We have to go. You said. We can\u2019t. Remember? He said. Be ready to run. You said.  You press the detonator and the charge you planted on the wall explodes and causes some rocks to collapse on them. Now. You said. You and chijinda both head for the tanks. These should give us an edge. Chijinda said. You go in one. I\u2019m taking to the roofs. You said. You crazy? Chijinda said. Yes. It\u2019s going to take time to get there. I\u2019ll distract her while you pound her with this behemoth. You said. Desperate times. Ok. Chijinda said. You head to the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the city. Shit. She\u2019s already tearing the place apart. You said.  Then you see a Humvee pull up and out steps a five star general. General Tomkins. You said. Yes sir. She\u2019s wrecking the town. The men are ready to take this bitch down. If they fail\u2026\u2026. Arm the nuclear weapons. He said.  General. You\u2019re dooming everyone to death. Especially the army men and women. You said. Someone get this civilian out of the combat zone! He said. Two army soldiers take you by both arms. Get off me! You said. You hit them both and take the general\u2019s cell phone. Mr. President. I\u2019m one of the detectives doing this case. You need to pull out the army. You said. This is a matter of national security. He said. No. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s some crazy bitch who didn\u2019t get her way. Me and my friend have experience with this. You said. You have experience with this? He said. Yes. Beating them to a pulp. We can handle this ourselves. The army will get in the way and more people will die. If we fail\u2026\u2026 Then drop a nuke. You said. The president remains quiet for a minute. \u2026\u2026Put the general back on. He said. For you. You said. He snatches the phone. But sir, he\u2019s just a kid. How much experience could he have? \u2026\u2026But sir\u2026. \u2026..Understood. He said. Pull everyone back. Let him and his friend at her. He said. But sir\u2026.. Did I stutter? Move it, private! The general said. Get lost. You said. The president also said to give you whatever you need. The general said. All I need is a rocket launcher and a trip up to that tall building. You said.</span></div></div>",

This building should be stable, and this hv 11 should work. You said. Chijinda. You ready? You said on the walkie talkie. Yeah. Tell me where you\u2019re at. He said. 3rd street. You said. The street with the internet caf\u00e9? He said. Yeah. You said. On my way. Just keep her busy. Chijinda said. She is gigantic. But so was goliath and he was killed by a stone. You fire the rocket at the director. The rocket hits her, but it shows little progress. She turns around to see you on the rooftop. That little soldier there\u2026. Is that you? Hahaha. This is laughable. It\u2019s like an ant taking on an elephant!! What can you do against me now?! Diplomacy has come and gone. Won\u2019t take a minute to erase you from this earth. Because at THIS point, I\u2019d love to savor that feeling! She said. Yap while you can. The bigger they are, the harder they fall! You said. You fire another rocket, but shows no damage.  Hahahaha! Your pathetic attempt to cause me harm is shameful. She said. She covers the distance between you two in one step. Good God\u2026\u2026! You said. I\u2019m going to enjoy this! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire another rocket at her, but still no damage. She raises her fist up and brings it down. You jump out of the way just in time. While you scramble to reload, the director simply plucks you. You are sent right into an ac unit. That hurt\u2026.. You said. You get up and fire again, but still no results. Fuck\u2026. You said. Then you see something explode on her head. The explosion causes some irritation to show on her face. I\u2019m here! Come on, man! Speak to me! Chijinda said. I\u2019m here. You said. That little toy down there\u2026. Chijinda, is that you down there? Great. Now I can send you both to the afterlife together! She said. You go through me if you want him!!! You said. You fire again, but no damage done.  You little gnat\u2026.. You\u2019ve been the biggest thorn in my side. She said. She smashes the building at the base. If I don\u2019t kill you, the fall and falling rubble will! She said. Get off that building! I\u2019ll take care of her!! Chijinda said. Chijinda fires the 155 smoothbore HE shell at her. It did little damage, but got her attention. The building starts to crumble. You run and jump to the next building just before the one you\u2019re on crumbles. Did you get off the building?! Come on man, speak to me!! He said. You just lay there in a haze. Right then, you can hear laughter. Then you see something coming at you. You come out of your haze and move. Shoot. One second late and you\u2019d be a stain. She said. Fuck you! You said. You fire a rocket at her. Right at the same time, Chijinda fires and AP Shell. The blast makes her have a reaction. She grabs her arm in pain. Chijinda. Flamethrower! You said. On it! He said. Chijinda speed up and fires the flamethrower. This has an astonishing result. The fire makes her back away a little. We got her! You said. Don\u2019t get smug because you caused me some pain! I\u2019ll return the favor 5x over!! She said. Chijinda! Aim high! You said. Firing HE! He said. Chijinda fire and you shoot at the same time. The impact cause her to lose balance. She\u2019s coming down! You said. The director\u2019s right arm smashes through the building you on. Not good! You said. You jump off the building and land on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see the director is on the ground. Then her eyes shoot open. You!!! She said. She slowly rises to her feet. I\u2019ll personal see to it that you\u2019re an unrecognizable stain on the pavement!!! She said. Before she could go through with her threat, chjinida rolls up and uses the flamethrower. Chijinda hopes out and tosses the rubble off you and injects you with a syringe. Ow! You said. You pull the syringe out. That hurts\u2026.. You said. Then you both see the director fall over again and she starts shrinking back down. We did it\u2026. Let\u2019s go. Chijinda said. Hey, are you alright?! Don\u2019t die on me that easily after all that. Chijinda said. He\u2019s about to use another syringe, but you stop him. Not for her. You said. hahahah\u2026.. I\u2019ve been completely ruined\u2026. It\u2019s my total loss no matter how you look at it\u2026. Don\u2019t bother. I\u2019m already too far gone. And why do you think I\u2019d want you help anyway? Aren\u2019t we mortal enemies? Really\u2026. Are you that much of a softy, or don\u2019t tell me, some sort of \u201cmanly\u201d code of yours\u2026 She said. You can\u2019t pay for all your crimes dead. You said. The easy way out is not happening, lady!! Chijinda said. Can\u2019t\u2026\u2026argh\u2026..argue with that\u2026.. She said. What the fuck are you two doing here? You said. Aha! \u2026.OMG director1 Like, are you alright? I can\u2019t believe you TOTALLY trashed the city!! You\u2019ve\u2026.uhm, you\u2019ve looked better, y\u2019know? And I was sooo, like \u201cGirl Power\u201d! When you were all giant and I thought you were gonna win, and all. You\u2026.gonna be okay\u2026right? Please tell me you\u2019ll be okay\u2026 You know I\u2019m not all into the whole, like \u201cWorld domination\u201d thing like you and mia are. Waaahhhh!! I don\u2019t want this!! I don\u2019t want you to go!! I just want you, and me, and mia to be friends is all!!! I never wanted anyone to get hurt\u2026. But, like, there I go being all stupid again, cause I\u2019ve killed tons of people, right? Erika said. \u2026.Erika\u2026.I\u2019m sorry\u2026. I should have done better by you. I\u2019ve been\u2026.well, I suppose selfish might be an understatement\u2026. With what you\u2019ve been forced to do\u2026. But, do cheer up, Erika\u2026.madame vice direc\u2026. Mia will be needing you to support her through what\u2019s to come\u2026. And believe it or not, I think YOUR smile\u2026means even more to her than hers does to you\u2026 The director said. How dare you do such a thing to our director?! To her plans!! Her years of work!! Everything we\u2019ve invested into this!!! I\u2019ll never, ever, Ever forgive the two of you, not in a million years, not if you come crawling to my feet, not for anything, anywhere\u2026I\u2026.I\u2026 .!! Vice director said. \u2026Please, mia, just stop right there\u2026.! It\u2019s\u2026..It\u2019s fine now. Maybe\u2026 It\u2019s even better this way. The director said. \u2026..I\u2026oh, what have they DONE to you\u2026? These injuries\u2026We\u2026We need to get you help immediately!! Vice director said. Please, just let me talk\u2026 And listen, TRULY listen, more than you ever have to me before, bless your heart. The director said. I\u2026know how hard it will be for you to accept. P\u2026Perhaps you never truly will, but\u2026. I wonder how I couldn\u2019t see it before. W..we\u2026.were wrong. Not in our passion, not in our motives perhaps. But whar we\u2019ve done\u2026. What I started, Mia\u2026. I\u2026..Was wring. The director said. Finally\u2026. You said.  It\u2019s so funny. After being so desperate and driven, and so angry even for so long\u2026 \u2026.Now that it\u2019s come to this. That I\u2019ve been stopped, that I\u2019m clinging so tenuously tol\u2026life\u2026. It could never had worked. None of it, not even for a second. You were total correct. The both of you. What was I creating\u2026.? A dictatorship? A theocracy with me as patron diety\u2026? The whole world, Humanity, changed to suit MY petty whims\u2026. Just as petty as those we were trampling on\u2026 The director said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDictatorship more like\u2026\u2026Let her have her piece. Chijinda interrupt. In the end, I was really just trying to stop the world which had me and everyone I cared about suffer\u2026 \u2026. Getting back at it like some spoiled child by trying to deny that world the right to ever exist. Be honest, Mia. It\u2019s the same with you. You wanted the power to strike back, to be more than the world insisted you were\u2026 And even all that\u2019s probably gussying it up in far more graceful and colorful terms than our baser reasons really deserve. Whatever drove us to all the acts we\u2019re responsible for\u2026 Whatever judgment awaits\u2026. \u2026.Are you really going to insist, to yourself if no one else, that we were justified, that our cause was really selfless in the least? The director said. M\u2026.Maybe\u2026.. I don\u2019t know\u2026..! I\u2019ll be first to admit I\u2019m conceited and selfish, and sure there was a ton of things that appealed to me, but\u2026.! I wanted to win for you!! I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s right OR wrong if it\u2019s what you wanted! You gave me everything, I\u2019d be nothing without you! Any world we could have created and shared would have been wonderful to me, even if it was wrong\u2026 Even if we have to face the consequences here\u2026. PLEASE hang on\u2026.!!! The vice director said. Well, miss director? I think it\u2019s about time you shared with us what exactly where you hoping to accomplish with all this\u2026 Why\u2019d you have to go and ruin so many lives, including your own and that of your friends here\u2026 This could be your last chance if you\u2019ve got any desire for me and others to understand your legacy, for better or worse. Chijinda said. Are you serious? You want to hear her story? You said. I just want to know what she was trying to accomplish with all this. Nobody would go through all this trouble for nothing. Chijinda said. This bitch is crazy, alright? And you want to encourage her by telling us why? You said. The least. Chijinda said. </span></div></div>",

Where to start\u2026.? Well, my real name is\u2026.Miku. A poignantly selected identity. Just one of a countless number of things I share in common with dear Mia here. For you see, and here I\u2019m certain you may think I\u2019m just having fun at your expense again\u2026.but that\u2019s actually where I come from. A time about 200 years hence from this continuum point, to be precise. Excuse me, if I don\u2019t provide you with a surname. It should be quite dismaying should you or someone else attempt to locate my forbears\u2026..in a play to prevent my coming into existence in the first place. Miku said. She\u2019s from the future? That explains it. You said. Please\u2026..Please. I know you probably think I love to hear myself go on and on, and perhaps that\u2019s true, but\u2026 \u2026..Please just allow me to continue uninterrupted. Else\u2026I may never get the chance to finish, and thus you to hear it. She said. Spare us your life story. We\u2019re not interested. You said. Calm down. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn our future, several crises such as environmental pollution, such that it has ravaged our once pristine world\u2026.. as well as dramatic population increases which had almost lethally crowed livable space....and surpassed survivable boundaries of co-existence for societal spheres, had progresses far beyond the critical point. Despite all of our unbelievable advances in all fields, nothing could be done.  And furthermore, as has always been our want, people seemed more interested in clinging desperately to their own slice\u2026.than they did aiding each other or doing anything to remedy the rapid declining global situation. Due to the previous generations\u2019 ignorance and sloth, a war, THE war, worse than anything anyone ever could have imagined\u2026..finally broke out in competition for the last of the world\u2019s dwindling resources. It was like the apocalypse. All of humanity\u2019s hatreds, bigotry, greed, and self-interest boiling over in a self-destruction pageant of death and destruction\u2026.. Our centuries of progression were laser focused on the tasks of seizure and annihilation of everything of any value. We weren\u2019t eradicated or sent back to the dark ages, though maybe that would have been better\u2026 \u2026..No, but cities and entire peoples were wiped from the maps, along with a fair amount of what was being warred over in the first place. I was VERY young then, but would still prefer not to go into much detail if you wouldn\u2019t mind terribly. Suffice it to say, it was a living hell that was considered a miracle to survive\u2026\u2026and I\u2019ve literally spent years trying to not only forget it and most of the aftermath, but actively erase it from the history books. \u2026..What was left of the world\u2019s surviving people after the catastrophe was itself reduced to only about 1/20 within the blink of an eye. As for the earth itself, well, thanks to the devastation wrought to the ecosystem\u2026.the remaining arable, or for that matter, non-desolate or considerably survivable land was reduced to a minimum. Likewise, the conflict and its holocaustal aftermath acted like a sieve, prospecting and refining the worst aspects of Humanity\u2019s remains. Everyone turned on another. Those not fortunate enough, and I use the term lightly, to remain in one of the still standing metropolises\u2026..either eked out a miserable existence on the dregs in the wilderness as prey to the elements\u2026.or else as pry to the many bands of raiders and brigands who seemed happier reverting to a more\u2026.feral\u2026lifestyle. haha\u2026..either that or they gladly joined the ranks. The cities were no better. Hotbeds of corruption, lurid hedonism, and the disadvantaged masses being controlled by the privileged few\u2026 Who grasp the fa\u00e7ade of holding onto power\u2026 The only way for one of the non-elites to remain somewhat safe from all this was to find a \u201csponsor\u201d in the bourgeois willing to support them. Naturally, ths only happened when the wretch in question could provide some service or specialty tha was rare or advantageous. My father was one of the lucky few. A gifted and accomplished researcher before war\u2026..his skills were sought by many for the potential weapons, luxuries, or other unreasonable wasres their despicable minds imagined. He was\u2026.a wonderful man, cursed into the wrong epoch. And, as you may have seen, I inherited his genius, perhaps moreso\u2026..a fact he thankfully was able to concel even as he raised and fostered my talents. Instead, in what was perhaps the greatest defiance he could muster\u2026\u2026.he resolced to take advantage of them and, lying and manipulating their interests as long as he could\u2026he set out to complete what had been his life\u2019s work before the world had been reduced to so much charnel and chaff. She said. Time control. You said. Right\u2026.. I watched, helpless to stop him and not having the heart to interject as he poured his lifeblood into completing his obsession. It cost him his life in the end I know, though I was no longer there for that\u2026..he completed his prototype \u201dtime capsule\u201dand, with no sure way to know if it would work\u2026..loaded it with as much technology and as many supplies as he could before sending me off on my own. We had been discovered by that point a\u2026.and\u2026.there was little time for hesitation\u2026.if you\u2019ll pardon the pun\u2026..Suffice to say, I\u2019d let my father\u2019s work go to vain\u2026..and perishing with him, perhaps worse, or else trusting myself to his vison and whatever horrendous fat its failure would bring me. Not really a choice at all, I suppose. I took the leap of faith\u2026 carrying mine and my father\u2019s dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, thanks to Mia I passed into this era, two centuries removed from the nightmare I knew. So peaceful and bright compared to our own time. So full of life, and people, and happiness\u2026 When my father sent me back from that hopeless world\u2026 He was only concerned with my safety, and ensuring that I lived out a happy life in better days. He didn\u2019t share in, or even know of my hopes and fevered dreams of altering that hell\u2026by changing its past to prevent it from ever occurring. Like father, like daughter. Perhaps my single greatest creation was my unique fixation with altering the world\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d course. One which, I might add, only grow exponentially as I witnessed a humanity taking everything it was blessed with for granted. I\u2019ve come to realise I also couldn\u2019t help but see them as the same humanity who\u2019s \u201csins\u201d lead to the future so many suffered through. But\u2026having lived through the result, and seeing the beginnings of the environmental and population disasters right in front of my eyes\u2026\u2026.there was no way I could just sit back and do nothing about and still live with myself. She said. And this was your grand idea? Shrink humanity?! You said. Dude, let her finish. Chijinda said. No! I\u2019m done listening to this psycho bitch! Saving humanity is all dandy and shit, but the method is the problem. Shrinking people down to the size of ants and then you and your cohorts be seen as gods! That is what she wanted! She didn\u2019t want to save humanity, she wanted to enslave it. You said. \u2026\u2026.I guess I do deserve some criticism for all that has happened up to now. Not\u2026..everyone would see it as clearly as me. Though I had hoped for people too. Miku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026Chijinda. I have one final request. Though you both have succeeded in putting a halt to our plans for now, your future as I\u2019ve told you is dark and uncertain. Regardless of how you and the world might judge my ends, the fact remains that if left unchecked\u2026.the future is still damned to an age of misery I\u2019d like to think is still less preferable to any history I would have crafted. Therefore\u2026.i want you to succeed where I, again, failed. \u2026..Take up my cause, and my society itself\u2026.and change this world\u2026.of ours for the better. If you agree\u2026.I\u2019ll turn over all my knowledge, technology, people, and\u2026.resources to your care, to do with as you\u2026..see fit. Miku said. But\u2026.!!! Chijinda said. Remember\u2026..there\u2019s no such think\u2026.as evil power. There are\u2026.only the will and\u2026.intentions of the one who wields it\u2026. \u2026.You\u2026.seem to have the\u2026utmost confidence in yourself\u2026.and your unwavering resolve\u2026so don\u2019t fear making my tools your own\u2026 \u2026.Additional\u2026.if you would take Mia here on with you\u2026and Erika too of course\u2026in her prior role as your second in command\u2026 \u2026.Besides her exceptional capacity as a manger\u2026.as well as her own expertise\u2026.I\u2019m certain the others will all\u2026follow suite\u2026. \u2026..With her help\u2026.you\u2019d be able to keep things running\u2026.smoothly in the transitional period\u2026.that\u2019s sure to follow\u2026 Miku said. \u2026.But\u2026But\u2026.Miku\u2026.are you certain\u2026.? I mean, I don\u2019t\u2026. Mia said.  \u2026.Oh\u2026.hush now, Mia\u2026.. \u2026It\u2019s plain as day that you hide admiration\u2026.if not some sort of feeling for him\u2026 Miku said. \u2026.That\u2026.This is hardly the\u2026 Mia said. Mia\u2026..deny yourself as long as you\u2026can\u2026.but would you really see our\u2026.dream die so easily\u2026? \u2026.When standing by his side\u2026..you might bring it to an\u2026even more fantastic conclusion\u2026\u2026than ever before. \u2026.Just imagine what he can do\u2026.with your guidance and\u2026 \u2026.Our means at his disposal. With us rather than against us\u2026 \u2026.If you must\u2026.consider this\u2026.my final request to you as well\u2026.I would see you happy\u2026.more than almost anything\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright!! ALRIGHT!! I\u2019ll do whatever you like Miku, just stop saying such grim things!! You\u2019re NOT going to die here!! \u2026.That\u2019s it!! Miku!! Your original time capsule, the one that brought you here! Its systems are designed to function as a stasis and preservation pod!! It\u2019s the only reason I was able to keep you alive in the first place!! We\u2019ve repaired it\u2026.but we ruled out further time travel. Mia said.</span></div></div>",

The death, destruction, al that means nothing to you? You said. If the future is as bleak as she said\u2026.. Chijinda said. IF?!? We\u2019re basing this off of an IF. What happened to the guy from earlier who said that the only way out was death? You said. That guy is still there. But look around. If this is anything like she said\u2026. Chijinda said. Two hundred years from now. We\u2019ll be dead by then. And do you even think that anything she said about the future is true? She could have easily made that up. You said. You can\u2019t make that shit up on fly. Chijinda said. So\u2026.all the shit we\u2019ve been through. You said it yourself that you would stop this. You said. And we did, but there\u2019s going to be different methods to what we do. Chijinda said. And what would those methods be? Destroy every single city in the US with a power trip giant bitch?! You saw how they acted, what they\u2019d do. You\u2019d subject an entire city to that? You said. Like I said: New methods, rules, and all that. He said. And what about me? Would I be included in this ordeal? Or would I just be some guinea pig and slave? You said. Just like we were when we were against them, we\u2019d be side by side against the world. Chijinda said. Work with the people who tried to kill us. They showed little remorse when we were small, and they still not showing any! You said. Look. Nothing is going to change between us. You\u2019re still going to be the same old you. He said. Nothing\u2019s change? Something did change. And apparently it was you. You want to be head of these bitches? Fine, lead them down a path you want. But use that tech to attack a city. You\u2019re going to regret it. You said. Why are you being a stickler? The world could be like she said. And we\u2019d still be partners and friends to see humanity survive. Chijinda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.You have change. If saving humanity means shrinking everyone down or enlarging and wrecking a city, I won\u2019t no part of it. And as for or partnership and friendship\u2026..You said. You pull out your gun and hand it to him. Next time you see me, shoot. Because I sure a fuck will shoot you. And them too. And you know I will. You said. You walk away. Wait\u2026. Narue said. You look back at your former friends, shake your head in disgust and keep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back to HQ and go see the boss. Well? He said. Chijinda and narue have allied with enemy. Miku\u2019s talked him into and narue followed suite. She let out this sob story about two hundred years from now humanity will be on the brink of annihilation, and he bought it. You said. How do you feel? He said. I don\u2019t know how to feel. We went together and left separated. \u2026..Professionally, he\u2019s just another enemy. You said. It\u2019s a shame to have lost narue and chijinda. What were your last words to him? He said. That if he ever saw me again, shoot me. Because I would shoot him without question. You said. A unnerving, but common thing to say to people who betray those they know. In your earlier report, you said that the tech the society had was past that of the military? How so? He said. The technology to shrink and enlarge people or objects. You said. A dastardly invention. He said. I thought you might have liked it. You said. I might be immoral, but even I know when the line is cross. But enough about me and your former friends. Let\u2019s talk about you. You have shown outstanding performance in the field, which has caught the eye of someone high up with our military friends. And he has an offer for you. General. He said. You see General Tompkins walk out of the darkness. General\u2026. You said. I\u2019m sorry to hear about your betrayal, but we have matters to attend to. Taking down a giantess is a rare feat. In fact not even rare. That\u2019s something special. And that\u2019s what you are. He said. What are you getting at? You said. We have a secret branch of Special Forces that only the president and me know about. They are called the Section. They are a last resort should the US fall into disarray. The president and I talked it over after you and your former friend took down the giantess. He said. \u2026\u2026.You think this a good time for this? I just lost two people I thought I knew. You said. I know personally how betrayal by someone close feel. The emptiness, lost, the trust that is broken, and wondering if you can ever trust again. Under normal circumstances, we\u2019d wait a while, but with a new head, this needed to be done. So do you accept? He said. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.What\u2019s my first assignment. You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Staten Island<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re standing on top of a building. After going through the wringer for Section, you\u2019re an official member of Section. The group has no official outfit, so members wear what they want. You\u2019re black beanie with brown overcoat, and marine boots, with a mask that has flame on the lower part. You look at a building on the far side. That\u2019s the building. A lot of traffic to and from. We suspect that is where they are setting up. A male voice at command said. You look and see some society members at the entrance. So this has to be the place. You know, this is a team mission. It would go a lot easier with them. The man said. You remain silent. I\u2019ll take your ominous silence as a no. They\u2019re on standby if you need them. And, I know it\u2019s not my place, but I\u2019ve known them for a long time. You can trust them. He said. You hang up. You make way down to the entrance. Halt! Identify yourself! One of the society member said. You walk up to them both and grab them both by the neck and easily break their necks and continue to walk through the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a whole different thing on the inside. There\u2019s a fountain, indoor lake, and the like. Just like the tower. You look up and see a security camera. You look directly at it and then move on. You take a flight of stairs up. At the end of them, you walk down a hall and come across 4 guards. Intruder! One said. All four surround you. Surrender! You\u2019re surrounded! Another said. They look just like the last time you saw them. You quickly grab one, make her shoot another, and then use her as a shield as the other two shoot and you shoot back. You push the girl to the ground. Hmm. Laser technology from those bulky pencil like weapons. The man said. You keep going until you hear a voice. I know you can hear me. The voice said. You recognize that voice. Been months since we last saw each other. Things have change as you can see. And I see you have to. I\u2019d like to see you in person again. And so would someone else. The voice said. You continue down the hall. Looking in one room and another, but come up empty. You go up another flight of stairs. Then you come across a security robot. Intruder detected. Protocol engaged. Detain if possible. It said.  The robot starts to shoot non-lethal, blunt tip bullets. You walk right up to the robot as it fires and place an emp chip on it. The robot short circuits and shuts down. Robots too? The man said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps and are suddenly something binds your feet and you fall down. Well, well. An intruder. The person said. You remember that voice. A weirdo, but an intruder still. The voice said. The person walks right in front of you. You look up to see Kanon. Alive and well. A real freak of nature you are. She said. She puts her foot right on your head. This is where shit stains like you belong! You have a name? She said. You say nothing. The silent type\u2026\u2026. In a way, I can sort of respect that. Luckily, I get to torture your ass until you break!! Then you\u2019ll sing like a cannery!!!She said. She goes for a kick, but you grab her leg and push her away. Silent AND strong. At least this won\u2019t be snooze fest. She said. You get to your feet and stare her down. The bet part of this is I get to rip that mask off your face when I\u2019m done! She said. Kanon. The voice said. B\u2026Boss. She said. No harm is to come to him. The voice said. But\u2026\u2026 She said. Your time will come. As of now, you are needed elsewhere. Some\u2026..sensitive information has escaped. You said. A\u2026As you wish. You got off lucky, mysterious man, but I will rip that mask from your broken body!! She said. Kanon then runs away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must have been one of their elites. I assume you two have meet before. The man said. Then you hear static in your headset and then it clears up. Ex? Is this getting to you? Cynthia said. You remain silent. Come on Ex. It\u2019s been months. Say something. She said. You still remain silent. *Sigh* At least let us be there with you. We\u2019re a team. She said. Yeah. This is a team effort. John said. Doing this alone will only result in more pain. Not physically, but mentally. Bowman said. Then the static returns. I need your undivided attention. I know we had different ideals. I know our differences split up the team, but you saw how I told Kanon not to harm you. That shows that I still see you as an equal. I have always seen you as an equal. I\u2019d be lying if I thought you weren\u2019t going to be on board, but I thought you would. Our friendship and partnership is severed and I know you can\u2019t trust anyone anymore, but what if I can rebuild that bond and make it tighter than ever? Ask yourself, why did we join the agency to begin with? To make the world a better place a little. Maybe a demonstration well help. And then, maybe, you\u2019ll see. The voice said. Was that him? The one who betrayed you? Ex, you can\u2019t go to him alone. You\u2019d be walking in a trap. Cynthia said. You end the transmission and keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way through the hall and go up another flight of stairs, but it leads to an empty, but the room has three opening that look down at the city. Look down at the city and imagine this. The voice said. The city is suddenly in ruins and you see the street is littered with destroyed cars and crumbled building. The world that was told to come. People turning on each other, death and destruction in the air. Now imagine this. The voice said. Then the city turns to this pristine utopia. People getting along, life, happiness, no wars, no fighting for anything. A world were people have what they need and want and then some. Which one to you seems better? The voice said. Then the normal city is back. You walk back down the stairs and into the main hall. He\u2019s coating his words. With all this, I\u2019d rather live in hell than his utopia. The man said. Then something is shoved in your back. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make me kill you. The voice said. You also remember that voice. Elbow the girl in the face and stun her. You see it\u2019s lady Masque. Why can\u2019t things be done without violence? She said. Miss Masque. Like I said with Kanon. He\u2019s not to be harmed. The voice said. But\u2026\u2026! You know this man! He\u2019s to be stopped immediately! She said. He\u2019s NOT to be harmed!! Any act of aggression against him will be seen as disobedience! And there will be consequences. The voice said. U\u2026.Understood. Why are they still treating you as an ally? You blatantly rejected our offer. You should be terminated on the spot!!! She said. Miss Masque!! Need I remind you what the consequences will be?! The voice said. No! \u2026..He will not be harmed!! She said. You just stare her down. I will have something to say about this. And you!! Don\u2019t think that mask hides anything. I know why you wear it and you gave me hell about mine. Let me tell you this. We are many. You are one. No one\u2019s coming to your aid this time. She said before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI assume you know that one. The man said. Ex. This is ridiculous. What are you trying to prove in there by yourself? That you\u2019re tough, suicidal, still around? We all know about your past. What you two did was all over the news. We all have seen it. What are you trying to do? Cynthia said. This is something personal. The man said. He\u2019s going to get killed, Jacob. And we just sit by and watch like it\u2019s a movie? She said. I can\u2019t stop him. I said this required a team, but he went on by himself any way. Jacob said.  This is personal to him, Cynth. John said. He\u2019s looking for answers for some kind of question. Bowman said. Whatever it is, he\u2019s going to find it with his objective. Jacob *sigh* Ex\u2026\u2026just be careful. And if you ever do talk and feel like talking about it, we\u2019re here for you. Cynthia said. </span></div></div>",

This door will open for you in due time. I can\u2019t wait to see you soon. The voice said. With that being said, you back off from the door and head off to your left. You traverse the long hallways until you come across that shrinking machine. You take a picture of it with your phone. This is the machine that shrinks people? The military is still working on invisibility tech. Jacob said.  When you turn around, you are hit by something hard. When your eyes refocus, you see it\u2019s that drill haired bitch. You!! Of all the people who could have stumbled in, it had to be you!!! She said. She is absolutely seething at the sight of you. I\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t care what he said!!! Killing you was, and still IS, what the old director wanted!!! And I WILL grant her wish!!! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came at you, you trip her up and she lands face first on the ground. When she gets up, you can see the rage in her eyes. You\u2026..!!! Treating me as some nuisance!!! I\u2019ll kill you with my bare hands!!! She said. She attacks you again, but you just trip her again. Grrrr!! Stop toying with me!!! She said. You simply side step her and she hits the wall with extreme force. Why you!!! You think you can just ignore me?!?! Like a snot nose kid?!? She said. You don\u2019t even acknowledge her and pull out your phone. Arrogant, puissant!!! She said. She pulls out one of those portable shrink devices and aims at you. Let\u2019s see how you fare as the size of an ant!!! She said. She fires the gun right at you and everything goes hazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of disorientation, you regain your focus. You look around to see the shrinking has happened again. Then the ground shakes violently. You look up to see Reina has a smug look on her face. Still feeling arrogant? Try and ignore me now while I tower over you!!! She said. All you do is sigh. Last time, you got off easy. This time, I won\u2019t stop until you\u2019re a red stain on my shoes!!! She said. She raises her foot over you and brings it down with speed and force. With a smile of satisfaction, she thinks she\u2019s killed you, but when looks closer at the ground, she sees you standing next to her foot. You!!! She said. She tries again and gets the same results. You can\u2019t run forever!! You\u2019ll tire out and that\u2019s when I\u2019ll take my time with killing you!! She said. She tries multiple times to crush you, but keeps coming up empty. In all the confusion, you get away from her. He\u2026..He got away!? Coward!! Only a coward runs from his fate! The only way back to normal is this machine, and only way to use it is through me!!! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to get away from her and make it back to the main entrance. You thought you were done with all this shrinking shit, but it keeps coming back like the common cold. So. This is what it\u2019s like to be this small? If not for built in face cam, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. Jacob said. This is out of hand!!! Jacob, where is he? I\u2019m going in for him. Cynthia said. Cynthia, you\u2019re being rash. Jacob said. No, I\u2019m stopping him from being killed. She said. He\u2019s there for personal reason. I told him this required more people, but he left anyway. You know what he\u2019s dealing with. Jacob said. He\u2019s not dealing with it in a heathy way. Stay right there. Cynthia said. Completely disregarding her, you keep moving.  You go up go down another hall and notice no small security robots are patrolling. You go further down and stop when Jacob rings you. Cynthia\u2019s on her way. She\u2019s damn stubborn. I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. If you want to look at her eye to eye and not eye to feet, I think you should get back to that machine. Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the ground starts to shake. You hear the sound of a whip, which means only one person. You said. You see Kanon coming is blocking your way. Why is he still showing him favoritism? He took the deal, and his dumbass friend didn\u2019t. Yet he wants no harm to come to him. Ugh. What did the director see in him? I know that they used a cheap tactic to escape from us. If it was me, I\u2019d have both of their heads mantled over my fireplace. Well, it\u2019s good it\u2019s only one of them now. So he should be easy to handle. She said. You have to get past her somehow. You get close, but not close enough for her to notice you. Ugh! If only I found him as a shrinkee, I\u2019d make sure he\u2019s never seen again. He did have a mouth on him, which to some degree I can respect, but I\u2019m not going to give him that much credit. If I could have one more go at that jackass, just one more go\u2026\u2026 She said. While she\u2019s ranting, you think about your options. Going between her legs would be a horrible idea. She\u2019d spot you easily. The gap between the wall and her is too narrow, plus, all she had to do is more her foot slightly to the left and hold it there for a few minutes and you\u2019d be cleft in half. With those two options gone, that only leaves one option. You go straight to her. Argh! I had him right where I wanted him. When will he realize that his friendship with him is over? Kanon said. As she looks down, she sees a small figure in front of her. I\u2026..is that who I think it is? She said. She gets a closer look. Oh my\u2026\u2026It is! Oh man! This is so funny! She said. You still remain silent. And here I was talking about if I could get you and if I found you as a shrinkee. Seems like I got my wish!! \u2026\u2026.Do you know what I do with shinkees? I make them \u201cdisappear\u201d How it\u2019s done is completely up to me. And knowing it\u2019s you, killing you seems like a good option. Unless\u2026..She said. You don\u2019t like where this is going. \u2026\u2026you swear your loyalty to me. You kneel and worship me like all the other shrinkees do. She said. This has just proven that these bitches have gotten crazier over the months. Hmmm. I take that silence as a no. But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you the chance! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches down for you, you move out of the way and make your way down the hall. He\u2026He got away? And he made it look so easy too? Can\u2019t believe this, but he\u2019s gotten better in a short time. Kanon said. Escaping from Kanon is no easy feat. I thought I might have to intervene. You have change. I just hope things haven\u2019t change between us. The voice said. You go through one door and find a stockade of battle mech suits. You take a picture of all the mechs.  This stuff is far ahead of the military. I don\u2019t know if I should be impressed or scared. Jacob said. You head back out and make your way back to the machine. Those photos you took are incriminating. A threat like this right under our noses. The president will be getting them shortly and tell us where to go from here. In the meantime, you should get back to normal size. Jacob said. On the way back, you hear the sounds of a mini gun firing, which can only mean one thing. But you\u2019ll deal with her later. You keep going. Turns out, Reina is still there. If there is one thing she is, it\u2019s determined. You need to get to that machine. When you get close, she starts to get irritated. Grrr! I know you\u2019re still around!! You have to come back unless you want to be a bug forever!!! She said. She\u2019s fuming. She\u2019s so hot under the collar that she wouldn\u2019t know you snuck by. You move quickly. You\u2019re halfway through when she almost crushed you. The sudden gust of wind sends you flying back. Annoyed, you get back up and try again. This time you make it to the machine. You pull out your phone and hack the console controls and activate the machine. When Renia finally notices what\u2019s going on, the machine activates and turns you back to normal size. You step out of the machine to see her even more angry. You!!! Just\u2026\u2026..YOU!!!! You\u2019ve made a mockery of me for the last time!!!!!! If it\u2019s the last thing I do on this earth, I WILL KILL YOU!!!!!!! She said. You shove her against the wall with force. You better make sure I\u2019m dead, or I\u2019ll find you and watch the light drain out of you!!!!! She said. Before you can do anything, a hail of gunfire breaks out. You back up to avoid being hit. Senpai!! Mizho said. I didn\u2019t ask for your help!!! This is between him and me!!! Reina said. You shouldn\u2019t be taking this so personal. The plan is still in motion. She said. Argh!! You better believe I have every intention of killing you!!! I will erase you!!!!! She said before scurrying off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can tell that you have an astonishing effect on senpai. It isn\u2019t easy to make her look like a fool. And she\u2019s not use to it. Mizho said. You take one step and she fires her mini gun. I\u2019m not afraid to use it this time. Things have change. But gunning you down isn\u2019t the way. Fighting you by myself will only end badly for me. I know why you\u2019re here. He talks about you nonstop. He says a special bond is between the two of you. He says no harm is to come to you. That he has a way to reform the friendship you two have, but we have our own plans as well. We still have a score to settle. It will be settled before the plan begins. You\u2019re alone against the world. This time, we won\u2019t be stopped!! She said before running away. They sure o like to ramble on and on. Jacob said. You head back to the main entrance and see the metal doors are\u2026..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doors are now open, which can\u2019t mean anything good. Come in. I\u2019ve waited long enough. The voice said. You walk into the dark halls. I\u2019ve counted the days since our departure. The days seem to past by slowly as I wondered where did everything go wrong. We stood firmly against the society and then we broke up. We saw differently on things, but this thing drove a wedge between us that wouldn\u2019t budge. The last thing you said to me was that you\u2019d shoot me if you ever saw me again. Does that still exist within you? I\u2019ve seen your violent tendencies when you came in here. You can kill an enemy, but can you bring yourself to kill a person you called friend? The voice said. As you move through the room, you notice that the room is strangely huge. Then you see Renia is standing there. I\u2019m not letting you take another step!!! One of us isn\u2019t leaving this place alive!!!! She said. Then you hear a whip a crack. You hold up your arm and a whip wraps around your arm. You pull and Kanon towards you and punch her. You duck a blade going for your head. You kick Lady Masque back and use her as a shield to block bullets. You shove her back right into Mizho. Grrrr!!! Arrogant, little shit!!! Kanon said. What does he see in you?  Lady Masque said. They are former friends. Mizho said. Friends or not! I\u2019m killing him!!! He\u2019s made a fool out of me for the last time!!!!!! Reina said. No sly tricks to hide behind this time!!! I\u2019m ripping that mask off your broken body!!! Kanon said. I\u2019ve said it before, you ARE alone here. Lady Masque said. I\u2019ll have to apologize to him later. Mizho said. You won\u2019t escape this time!!!! Let\u2019s go!!!! Renia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou side step Reina\u2019s attack and trip her up. Then a whip wraps around your legs and you fall to ground. You see lady masque jump and holds her sword downward. You roll over and she misses and her sword is lodged in the ground. You quickly cut the whip and stand back up. You see Mizho aiming her min gun. Thinking quickly, you toss a smoke bomb at her. *Cough* *Cough* \u2026..Can\u2019t \u2026\u2026see!! She said. You plant her ass on the ground and disable the mini gun and slam her into the ground. Then you dodge a double blade attack aimed for your chest. You grab both lady masque and reina\u2019s heads and bonk them together. You grab the whip as it hits you and pull it out from Kanon\u2019s hands. You crack it and aim at her feet. Hey! She said. You aim is just above her head and hit her right in the forehead, which leaves a scolding red mark. OW!!!!!! She said. As Mizho gets up, you wrap the whip around her and put her next to Konan. You do the same for Lady Masque and Renia. Then you toss the whip away. Hate to admit it, but he\u2019s gotten better. He\u2019s making us look like amateurs. Kanon said. This is the second time I\u2019ve lost to him!! How does he do this?! Lady Masque said. He and chijinda were this good, but he\u2019s gotten better. He\u2019s too good. Even for us now. Mizho said. No!!!! I refuse to acknowledge him as an equal or better!!!! Someone like HIM better than the Four Heavenly Queens combined!!! You think you have us?! I will NOT go down to you of all people!!!! I\u2019ll see you dead for this!!!! Renia said. She pulls out that device again, but this time, you were ready for it. This\u2026.. Will be your end!!! She said as she aimed at herself and fires at her and the others. Senpai!!! Mizho said. You expected them to shrink, but what you see next sends a chill down your spine. Instead of shrinking, they grow to the same size as the old director did. Senpai\u2026..What did you do?! Mizho said. The same thing the director did! I had a different version built. That explains the large room. It was built this huge so they could move around freely at this size. So this is what it\u2019s like to be this tall\u2026.. I could get use to this. Kanon said. This was a rash move, Renia!! Lady Masque said. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re not enjoying this. This is what we were promised to begin with. Just in a change of order. Renia said. Promised, but denied cause of two people. One right in front of us. Kanon said. This is against what we planned. Mizho said. The plan is still going. He just won\u2019t be a part of it. Renia said. He hasn\u2019t move an inch. Little shit must be scared of us towering over him! Konan said. Ex. I\u2019m finally here. Where are you? I need to know so I don\u2019t step on you. Cynthia said. Things have just gotten bad. Just surrender. It doesn\u2019t have to end like this. Mizho said. No. He had his chance. He dies now! Renia said. That\u2019s the easy way out. He needs to suffer. We make him our toy/ slave. Kona said.  We can discuss it IF he\u2019s alive. As of now, I\u2019m taking this advantage. Lady masque said.  Still think you have a chance?  At this height, you won\u2019t hurt us! Reina said. If you just kneel, we\u2019ll take that as your sign of surrender, and we\u2019ll go easy on you. Kanon said. Being talked down too is insulting. \u201cDie on your feet than live on your knees.\u201d Is what your grandfather always said when he came back from service. You know this is going to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cynthia pov.<br>\r\nThis place is big. I have to find Ex. Even though he doesn\u2019t speak, I know he\u2019s hurting on the inside. He won\u2019t say it. He\u2019s still young. No one at that age or any age should experience the pain of betrayal. I better watch were I step. He could be anywhere. You said. Just a quick heads up. You\u2019re not going to take advantage of his size, are you? Jacob said. No. He\u2019s still a human being. Normal size or small. I wouldn\u2019t dare make him do anything demining or anything at his expense for my pleasure. Plus, he\u2019s been through enough already. Being that small is just insulting him. You said. Ok. Just wanted to clear the air. He said. Better watch where I step. He could be anywhere. You said. You head for his last known position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is all the tech they have? It is far ahead of the military. And all this was for what? To prevent a future dystopia? Not after all the lives were lost when that girl wrecked an entire city. You said. As you go around looking, you check carefully where you are stepping. Ex. Are you here? How small did they make him? You said. Cynthia, I really think you shouldn\u2019t be there. Jacob said. He has no one to rely on. The one he called best friend betrayed him, and now he has nobody. At the very least, he needs one friend. You said. It\u2019s not that. One, Bowman thinks you might crush him under your feet. Jacob said. If that is another crack that my feet are big, I don\u2019t want to hear it. You said. Nobody said anything about your size 14 feet. You\u2019re not the only one trying to get Ex to open up. You saw what they are capable of on that news. He said. And who put her in her place? The chopper saw them both. But Ex stood for what\u2019s right. World peace is fine, but doing it like this isn\u2019t the way. You said. If I didn\u2019t know better, I think you\u2019re looking up to him. Despite the age difference. Jacob said. I\u2026.might admire him a little, but I like what he stands for. As for him in particular, I just don\u2019t want him to think there isn\u2019t a good person in the world. He\u2019s already thinks he\u2019s alone. You said. So you do like him. Jacob said. \u2026\u2026.A little. You said. As for the other thing, well, you\u2019re just going to see for yourself. Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep looking, you start getting worried. Jacob. Can\u2019t you see through his head cam? Just tell him to stop wherever he is. You said. I\u2019ve been trying, but something\u2019s wrong. I can\u2019t connect to it. It must be damage. Did you\u2026\u2026 He said. You frantically look at your sneakers, but see no bloodstain. No. I didn\u2019t. You said. You think he might be in trouble? Bowman said. Cynthia. Jacob said. I\u2019ll find him. Nobody should die in a place like this. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov<br>\r\nYou hit the wall hard. You can barely stand and your mask is cracked. This was way past your expectations. You knew this would be difficult, but not this difficult. You never cared if the odds were against you, but these odds are way too high against you. There was a slim chances you would come out on top, but that chance is getting more and more slim with each passing second. This is too good! All that confidence out the window. Renia said. I didn\u2019t want to beat him like this, but\u2026\u2026. Lady Masque said. And you thought this was a bad idea! Kanon said. You manage to get to your feet. You know you can\u2019t win this. Discretion is the better part of valor. There\u2019s no escaping us this time!! Renia said.  Any would be infiltrator always has an escape plan. You take out four cans of tear gas and toss it right at them. With each one exploding close to their faces, the effects blinds them, covering your escape. </span></div></div>",

Dear god! What happened? She said. \u2026\u2026.we need to go. You said. \u2026..Jacob. I\u2019ve found him. Get the medical supplies ready. We\u2019re coming home. She said. You never thought you\u2019d be happy to see blondie here. Cynthia puts her arm around you and takes you back to the hideout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace up when the alcohol is applied to all your cuts. Then Cynthia puts on the bandages and a arm sling. Jesus. What happened in there? Bowman said. You showed them your face cam which recorded it all. More of that damn tech. John said. That kind of weaponry in their hands spells disaster. Bowman said.  All of their technology is years ahead of the military. Shrinking and growing. Jacob said. What did the president say? Cynthia said. He said that tech like this in the hands of people like that can\u2019t be good. He wants it all destroyed. Jacob said. Good. Because we really can\u2019t let tech like this be in anyone\u2019s hands John said. Plus, the army is on readying just in case they decide to attack. Don\u2019t know what they can do, but better than letting them have their way. Jacob said. \u2026\u2026..Hey. Just in case worst comes, will you be able to do what you said? Cynthia said. You said you\u2019d shoot him, but you still feel a connection of friendship towards him. \u2026\u2026\u2026.Time will tell. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a remote location<br>\r\nYou saw how he ran. He doesn\u2019t stand a chance. We should go forward with the plan! Mia said. \u2026\u2026.The fact that they had to grow to massive size just to have an edge shows that he\u2019s more than just a problem for them. \u2026\u2026..Plus, I gave explicit orders for him not to be harmed. There will be consequences for disobedience. Chijinda said. You know how he is. He starts fights and runs from the ones he can\u2019t finish! Mia said. Run? You really think he turned tail? No. He didn\u2019t run. He got the information he need. Chijinda said. Information? What information? Mia said. He didn\u2019t fight to kill or survive. He fought to see their fighting style. Now that he knows it, he knows where to hit them. He\u2019s going to win next time. Chijinda said. But\u2026..why would he do something like that? Mia said. We were detectives. We gather all the evidence before doing anything. And he got his. Chijinda said. Then\u2026\u2026Then you must know how dangerous he is to us as of now!!! Let me go after him!!! I promise he won\u2019t be a problem!!! Mia said. No. Chijinda said. B\u2026.But\u2026\u2026!!! Mia said. We\u2019ve always had our differences on things, but we overcame them because our friendship was stronger than ever. He must still feel it. Our friendship is still there. It\u2019s not broken, it\u2019s bent. And he must know this as well. Chijinda said. But he said he\u2019d shoot you if he saw you!! Mia said. He did, but he won\u2019t. Trust me. He won\u2019t pull the trigger. I\u2019m still hoping we can see eye to eye. Even if the plan is under way, no harm to him. Period. Chijinda said. Then\u2026..then what do we do about him? Mia said. I already have it under control. Chijinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night time approaches, you look out the window. \u2026\u2026.Chijinda. You said. You feel the need to go back. As the moon reaches its highest point, you come to a decision.  I got to go back there. But first\u2026\u2026 You said. With your good arm, you make a call to the president. Mr. President\u2026\u2026\u2026 I know it\u2019s late, but I need a favor. And the general won\u2019t authorize without your consent. I need some\u2026..insurance. You said. <br>\r\nYou manage to make your way back to the building. The door is wide open. They must be expecting me. I won\u2019t disappoint. You said. You head inside and see the heavy metal doors are also open. They are expecting me. You said. You go right through them and head deeper into the complex. As you traverse the place, you come across a tank with some blue liquid in it that is hooked up to the wall. When you look in it, you see Miku. The director. If you just went about this the right way, you wouldn\u2019t be in this tank. You said. I\u2026.guess if things were different\u2026.. She said. How did you speak if your mouth didn\u2019t move? You said. This is the time machine I came in. The technology my father had made it so this machine can broadcast the user\u2019s subconscious voice. She said. So are you alive? Or dead? You said. Somewhere in between. The more pressing matter is why are you here? It\u2019s not to check my well-being. She said. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not. But since you are able to talk through that machine, you wouldn\u2019t mind telling me a few things. You said. I knew you\u2019d have personal questions since what you doubt what I say. *Sigh* What would you like to know? She said. If you\u2019re from the future, tell me something only someone from the future would know. You said. There\u2019s no stuck up famous people. She said. Ok. I\u2019ll take that. Was shrinking everyone in the world your only idea? You said. I had more, but none would be as effective as shrinking people. She said. Ok. Did you mean to split me and chijinda up? You said. No. That was between you two. As I said, everything I said was genuine. She said. More like a backup plan. You went from wanting us to help to trying to kill us. You said. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say my emotions took over. Everything we worked for up in smoke. She said. And you turn into this giant bitch who wrecked half the city. You said. I can\u2019t make up an excuse for the lives I destroyed. But whatever I would have done would have been a kindness to what would have come in the future. She said. Yeah. Being the size of an ant and worshiping you and your croons as god. I\u2019d take my chances with the detrimental future. You said. Everybody\u2019s inclined to their own opinion. She said. We\u2019d never be friends or partners. World peace is what we both want, but this isn\u2019t the way. You said. Then you hear approaching footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see chijinda. Good to see you after so long. It\u2019s only been months, but it feels like years. He said. \u2026\u2026.Time goes by slowly when you loss someone. You said. Here. He said. He injects a syringe into your arm and all the pain is gone. You tear the sling off your arm. You still have those. You said. Kept what I had. He said. Where\u2019s narue? She\u2019s tired herself out with some\u2026..distribution. He said. Where\u2019s your lackeys? I thought they would be with you? You said. I told them this was between friends. He said. \u2026\u2026..You still think we\u2019re friends? You said. We must be. You said you\u2019d shoot me when you see me again. You haven\u2019t shoot me yet, so we must still be friends. He said. Then as a \u201cfriend\u201d, you need to keep the queens on a leash. You said. Everyone here was under explicit orders not to hurt you. Anyone who disobeyed faced severe consequences. Queens or not. He said. You expected them to listen? They know me. They willingly disobeyed. You said. I know. I thought they would listen. But enough of the pleasantries. You came here with a purpose. If you still feel I need to be shot, so be it. He said. The right thing would be to do it, but for some reason, you can\u2019t do it. \u2026\u2026Stay away from Staten Island. You said before leaving. Then Mia appears from the shadows. He didn\u2019t do. She said. He knows our friendship is there. The plan goes forward as scheduled. Chijinda said. Are we really going to stay away from Staten Island? She said. When the plan is under way, we do. He said. But the plan requires\u2026\u2026 I know. Chijinda interrupts. We stay away from it until it\u2019s the last city. Then we take him off the island. He said. This would go a whole lot smoother if- I will not here off it! Any harm to him or worse comes will result in severe consequences! Chijinda interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back to Staten Island and back to the hideout. You look out the window and up at the moon as it shines brightly in the midnight sky. You\u2019re so deep in thought that you don\u2019t hear Cynthia coming in. \u2026.. I thought you wanted some company. She said. It\u2019s something I need right now. You said. I\u2026.saw you leave. Did you do it? She said. \u2026\u2026.I couldn\u2019t. As much as I try to deny it, our friendship is still there. I wanted to end it all right there, but I just couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t look him in the eyes and shoot him between them. You said. So\u2026\u2026.what do we do? She said. Well, if I had one of those growth gun, I\u2019d grow you, and you and your large feet can go stomp everything and everyone there out. You joked. Ha ha ha. Pick on a girl\u2019s weakness. Must feel so manly. She said. Calm down. I\u2019m just picking. But you are one of the few women I\u2019ve seen with feet bigger than a tractor. You said. You know, I can kick pretty hard. She said. hahahaha. You got to let me have a little fun. You said. My feet are not going to be the butt of your jokes. Plus, I told you I\u2019m shy about my large feet and I get enough of it from Bowman. She said. Relax. Bowman\u2019s just pulling your leg. You said. Back to my original point: What are we going to do? She said. We wait. It\u2019s the only thing we can do. You said. Just wait? She said. We can\u2019t do much. I told chijinda to stay away from Staten. Just trust me. You said. You must know what you\u2019re doing. Ok. We wait. She said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few months later.<br>\r\nAlmost every city has fallen prey to the society. Cities turned to ghost towns, people trying to stay alive, and the society\u2019s plan in motion. Society in the US has fallen. People taking what they can while still alive, turning on each other or groups fighting for what they think is there\u2019s. This isn\u2019t the hell the director described, but it\u2019s the hell people are living in now. Section has been activated. Its mission is to return order to the society of the US.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re walking the desolate streets of Manhattan. Cynthia. I\u2019m near where you said to be. You said. Great. What we\u2019re looking for is in the building you\u2019re facing. She said. This run down shack of a corporate building? You said. Yes. It should be in there. She said. Watch out. I wouldn\u2019t expect the building to be abandoned. John said. How do I know if I come across anymore of us? You said. Look for people who look like they are on a mission. Cynthia said. Is there any way to tell how many are there? You said. We have no idea how many of us there are. For all we know, our next door neighbor could be a part of Section. Bowman said. Real funny. What was the protocol if there we came across other agents? You said. There is none, but anyone who shoots an agent is marked as rouge and runs the risk of termination. John said. This shit better be worth it. You said. You head into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a mess. Things really went to hell. You said. You take the stairs up three floors and kick down the door. You make your way past all the cubicals and kick down another door. You see some scavenge supplies and a make shift bed. Someone set up shop here for a while. Must have bailed. You said. You see what you are looking for. There you are. You said. You pick up the folder and flip through it. Should be everything here. Cynthia. I found the folder with the files. On my way back. You said. Good. Be careful. We can\u2019t fly you out without attracting attention. She said. I\u2019ll be ok. You said. You scale back down to the entrance. As you reach ground floor, you feel the ground shake. That can\u2019t be good. I don\u2019t have time to play with you today. You said. You head back to Staten Island. You walk across the bridge and past the barricade. You know this won\u2019t stop them, Jim. You said. Still makes people feel better that\u2019s something is between them. He said. You also past Hillary who keeps count of supplies. Anybody new come by? You said. A family of 5. They came here with the clothes on their backs. She said. They were in a hurry. Lighten up. You said. We can\u2019t take in every person or family that comes across. Supplies are starting to run low. She said. Didn\u2019t Rufus come back with a horde of supplies? You said. That only lasted mere hours. She said. We\u2019ll get more. You said. You make your way to the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go inside and give the folder to Cynthia. Thanks. With our satellites offline, these had to be done the old fashion way. She said. Why didn\u2019t you just ask me? I know everything about them. You said. Which is good, but I need to see what we are dealing with. She said. She flips through the files. So. This is what they look like? Who\u2019s the one in the mask? She said. She goes by the name Lady Masque. You said. If she wants that name, fine, but why the mask? She said. Her eye colors aren\u2019t the same. She said. Oh, I see. So Kanon, Renia, Mizho, and lady masque. Our informant died for this information. It should help. She said. Where\u2019s John and bowman? You said. Helping people around here. I assume you heard from Hillary? She said. She told me about our supply situation. You said. Ok. Then you don\u2019t need to hear it again. She said. I\u2019m going back out there later. You said. Again? For what? You said. Those four right there. This time, I will beat them. You said. You need rest. You\u2019ve been out there nonstop. You exhausting yourself is only helping them. She said. And let them have their way out there? Nah. You said. *Sigh* At least let me go with you for support. She said. No way. This is between me and them. You said. Come on. Let me help. You\u2019re only helping them by doing this alone. Didn\u2019t you and chijinda stand up to them? She said. Barely. One by themselves, we can handle. But all four together was too much. Even for us. I got a way this time. Trust me. You said. Just\u2026\u2026watch yourself when you come across them. She said. Then the ground starts to shake. Damnit! Those tremors are getting closer and closer each day. It won\u2019t be long before they\u2019re at our doorsteps. She said. They\u2019d have to cross the water first, and we have a nasty surprise for them when they do. You said.  All this to prevent a dystopia. It\u2019s too much. She said. I\u2019d take my chances with the dystopia. You know what they wanted in return? To be idolize as a god. I worship no human being. The only time I get on my knees is in church. You said. The people who are out there ducking and dodging them must be in some sort of hell. She said. Let\u2019s just hope they have some knowledge. Did you hear the rumors? You said. Of people actually believing in their ideals? It\u2019s the most talked about thing on the streets. I also heard they are recruiting more into their ranks. Let\u2019s just hope it stays a rumor. She said. I hope so to. I\u2019m needed out there. You said. I going to be busy for a while, but call if you need me. She said. Will do. You said. You exit the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look around and head off into the town. While walking, you see John and Bowman chatting with the locals.  You two heard? You said. About the rumors? Yeah. John said. You think it\u2019s true? You said. In a time like this, I think they are. Bowman said. I heard that as they go, they rebuild a city. A local said. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult. With all the zealous people they have, they\u2019d finish in weeks. You said. Yeah. Staten Island\u2019s the last bastion that stands in their way. John said. I\u2019d rather live in squabble than under someone\u2019s heel. Bowman said. Heel? A local said. Yeah. For their glorious effort of stopping the dystopia to come, they want to be worshiped as liked the Gods of Olympus. John said. Fuck squabble. I\u2019d rather be dead. I\u2019m not worshiping a bunch of school girls who have an inferiority complex. Another local said. Do they really have the tech to grow and shrink? Another local said. They do. They use growth more than shrink now. You said. I don\u2019t care how big they are. They can be ten thousand feet tall, I still won\u2019t worship them. A local said. At least some people see though all that glitter. John said. I\u2019m going back out there to see if what you said is true about these cities being rebuilt. If it is true, then our problems have doubled. You said. You want us with you? Bowman said. No. It\u2019ll be quicker alone. Plus, someone needs to stay and watch the place. Those tremors are getting closer. You said. The barbarians will soon be upon us. Bowman said. I\u2019m not scared of no giant sized school girl! We\u2019re not going to make it easy for them. A local said. In fact, that\u2019s what we do. John, Bowman. Ask everyone around if they want to stay or go. Get rid of any turncoats. That way only the real people stay. You said. On it. John said. You leave Staten Island.</span></div></div>",

As you go, you see over turn cars, fires in trash bins, and a few rotting bodies either beating up or full of bullets. Not a good life to live, but way better than kissing their asses. You said. You keep walking until you feel the tremors. Close by. Not today, you psychos. You said. You walk around for about two hours until you go up on a rooftop. That city out there\u2026.. You said. You zoom in with your camera. The rumors were true. They are building cities as they destroy them. Who knows how many they have in the past months. Our problems just doubled. You said. Then you feel multiple tremors. Shit! You said. You travel back down. The tremors are getting more violent. Damnit! You said. Then they stop. You breathe a sigh of relief. Until a giant fist comes through the wall. Luckily, you were just out of the way of it. You hide behind a counter. You peek out to see an eye looking in. A red eye, and you know who that belongs to. Then the eye goes away. Kanon\u2026\u2026 If that sadist finds me\u2026.. You said. You run back down a flight of stairs until another fist comes through the wall. This bitch\u2026. You said. This time, she starts to feel around. Her hand smashing into the walls, leaving cracks in them. One of her titanic fingers nearly brushed against you. You hear her huff angrily and retract her arm. You quickly run down all the stairs and out the building. Before you get out of sight, you take one look at her. She\u2019s the same as she was back at the school. Wonder if she\u2019s acted out any of her fantasies? You said before leaving. You head back to Staten Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there and head past the barricade. Hilary. You\u2019re still here? You said. Like I\u2019m going out there. This place may be a dump, but it\u2019s better than being someone\u2019s servant. She said. Weren\u2019t you s secretary? You said. Two completely different things. She said annoyed. Then John come to you. Hey, we did what you said and finally got a number. He said. So how many? You said. Five hundred people decide to leave. He said. Out of? You said. Out of the thousands who are still on this island. With the thousands here, five hundred leaving shouldn\u2019t be that bad. You said. It shouldn\u2019t. Means less ungrateful people tuning tail. Bowman said. And more supplies we can hoard. John said. And a huge pool of people for them. But I\u2019ll try to look on the bright side. Nice job. You said. It was an even number of men and woman. The woman I guess hoped for that amazon feeling. And the men wanted to be their slaves or whatever they do with us. John said. Any children? You said. A few families took their young ones and left, but some teenagers and preteens stayed behind. He said. Good. They shouldn\u2019t suffer for their parent\u2019s decision. We should make sure the trap works. I saw Kanon prowling out there. Those rumors about them building cities are true. Look. You said. You showed them the pictures you took. So they are building cities as they go. Bowman said. Who knows how many they have. John said. Right. Things are going from bad to worse. Like those giant bitches weren\u2019t enough, who knows what they have in those cities. You said. For all we know, they could be massing an army of giant size woman OR men against us. John said. The society\u2019s all female. They wouldn\u2019t dare grow a man unless for personal pleasures. But nothing is stopping them from massing a regular size army. With all the resources they have and the huge pool of people we basically gave them, they run unopposed. The army can\u2019t do anything against them. Not while these bitches are that tall to the point of picking up a tank like a toy. And let\u2019s not forget other agents. You said. He\u2019s right. Other agents could sympathize and join them. Thinking that is better than living on the streets. We\u2019re on our own. John said. So what do we do? Bowman said. Give me some time. I\u2019ll think of something. You said. Hey, if this is about him and you can\u2019t do it, let one of us know. I\u2019d be more than happy to shoot. John said. Thanks, but this is an issue between us. This is going to end. One way or another. You said. You head back into hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours go by and the tremors fluctuate. They\u2019ll be at our door soon. Cynthia said. I know. Pressure\u2019s on. You said. You look out the window, when suddenly hear the computer go off. A video request. Cynthia said. Accept it. You said. When she did, you see Narue. Narue\u2026..You said. It\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re alive. I was worried. She said. \u2026\u2026.What do you want? You said. I know I\u2019m the last person you want to see, but I\u2019d like to talk to you, in person. She said. Hold on. You turn your back on him. Left him all alone in the world. And now months later, you want to know how he\u2019s doing. You have some- Cynthia. You interrupt. No. She\u2019s right. I should have reached out to you as soon as you left, but I was torn between two friends. She said. You made your choice, narue. You\u2019re ok with all this giantess and shrinking shit. You said. Please\u2026\u2026just let me speak to you. I just want to talk to you in person. She said. There is no way- Fine. You interrupt. But\u2026\u2026 Cynthia objects. Thank you. She said. You close the window. She\u2019s going to hurt you again. She obviously doesn\u2019t care about you. Cynthia said. I can\u2019t get any lower. Plus, I\u2019m also concerned for her. When she gets here, you treat her with respect. Understood? You said. \u2026\u2026I do. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the evening<br>\r\nYou hear a knock on the door. You open the door and see narue. Nothing about her has changed. She still looks the same as she did back at the school. Good to see you. In the flesh. She said. \u2026..Get in here. You said. You walk her into the living room, where she gets hateful glares from John, Cynthia, and Bowman. Beat it. You said. Come on. Bowman said. I\u2019m a shout away. Cynthia said before leaving. Lovely bunch. Narue said. Narue places her hand on your face. It\u2019s only been months, but it feels like years. She said. Of all people narue\u2026\u2026 You said. Please\u2026\u2026I wanted to stick by the both of you. I didn\u2019t know that you two would split up over this. She said. Well, we did.  I thought if anyone would stick with their morals, it\u2019d be you. You said. I did. It was a difficult decision. Chijinda gave me the choice to leave. She said. And what did you chose? You said. \u2026\u2026I just want us to be a team again. She said. How many have you killed? You said. Killed? She said. You heard me. How many? You must have become a giantess and destroyed cities with the two airheads. So. How many? You said. I\u2026\u2026chose not to do it. She said. So you didn\u2019t kill anyone or hurt them? You said. Besides the queens, no. I wanted to personally hand down the consequences when they hurt you. That\u2019s what friends do. She said. \u2026\u2026.You really think we\u2019re friends? You said.  The fact that I\u2019m still sitting here without a gun to my head shows that our friendship is still there. She said. \u2026\u2026You\u2019re right. But I couldn\u2019t hurt you. You said. Listen, I still have your interest at heart and so does chijinda. We all want to put our differences aside so we can be friends again. I\u2019m willing to do anything if it can save our friendship. That\u2019s why I stayed in the first place. Even if it means never seeing you again, I just want our friendship to last. She said. \u2026..Anything? You said. Yes. I don\u2019t care how degrading or humiliating. If it makes you feel better, I\u2019ll be your personal punching bag. She said. \u2026\u2026Ok. You want our friendship to last?  Then you go back there and you feed me every scrap of intel they have. You said. Then our friendship is back? She said. It\u2019ll be a start. You said. Ok. Just be careful. The queens are on the war path. Narue said. Get going. You said. Narue leaves. You trust her? Cynthia said. \u2026\u2026.I do. You said. </span></div></div>",

Those bitches are rampaging like there\u2019s no tomorrow. You said. You look around. To think this used to be a loud and busy place. No it\u2019s home to squatters. You said. As you look at the wreckage of one building, you get the feeling that you are not alone. You look behind you and see two people aiming guns at you. (Scar-Hs. Only spec ops get those. They must be with Section.) You thought. What are you around here? The guy said. You don\u2019t feel those tremors? I\u2019m trying to avoid those bitches. You said. Heh. Aren\u2019t we all. They been at this nonstop. Like they are searching for something or someone. The guy said. They are destroying cities. What could they be looking for? The woman said. Shit if I know. I just know that they are not stopping any time soon. You said. Then the tremors intensify. We can\u2019t stay out here any longer. We can continue this chat somewhere safe. You said. Are we really going to show him were we stay? The woman said. No time to debate it. Come on. The guy said. He pushes back a few loose boards and opens the double doors. In here. He said. You and the woman quickly get inside and the man closes the door.<br>\r\nOk. We should be safe. The man said. This place isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s a good hideaway. The woman said. In times like this, anyplace that is safe is home. You said. I guess. Hey. Aren\u2019t you that kid from the news? The woman said. You heard? You said. It was plastered all over every major news network. Even in other countries. The man said. I was hoping it would just stay local. You said. How a routine investigation turns into a fight against a giant school girl? The man said. Bitch wanted to prevent a dystopia and her brilliant plan was to shrink everyone in the world and have her and her goons idolized as gods. You said. Like being worshipped? He said. Yeah. And these are no ordinary school girls. They are tough bitches. They had tech that can shrink and grow people. If that kind of shit got into the wrong hands\u2026\u2026You said. I can tell you this: I\u2019m not getting on my knees to anybody. The woman said. Nice to know some people think like that. You said. Aren\u2019t they of Japanese descent? The man said. Yeah. After all that shit went down, I did major research on each of them. Not a lot of information about them. Speaking of information, you two have names? You said. I\u2019m Carl. This is Ashely. The man said. You two with Section? You said. Yeah. Been on the move since day one. Hard to live with gigantic school girls trampling every city in sight. Ashely said. They just keep going. It\u2019s as if they are looking for something. The man said. Me. You said. Why would they be after you? Carl said. They are with the Society. They have a vendetta against me. You said. They explains a lot. Carl said. They are strong. And fighting together\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a death wish. You said. You must have something to use against them. Ashley said. I do. You said. Right then, the tremors stop. Are they gone? Carl said. The ground just stop shaking. So they must be\u2026\u2026 Ashley said. You peek outside. Not in sight. You said. Just as soon as you turn away from the window, a fist comes through the wall. Shit! Get away! You said. Carl starts to frantically shoot at the hand. The hand suddenly retreats. Ok. It\u2019s gone. He said. Uh\u2026. I don\u2019t think our problems are over. Ashley said. You and Carl turn around to see an eye looking in. You toss up the middle finger and it goes away. We have ten seconds. You said. You three race back to the entrance. You and Carl force the door open and you three run out into the streets. Damn. She\u2019s bigger than I thought. Carl said. Come on. I can\u2019t deal with you two in harm\u2019s way. You said. Don\u2019t worry about us. Go give them the business! Ashley said. If we go at it, it\u2019s going to get violent. Not here. Plus, it\u2019s not time yet. You said. You three head through a few alleys and when you deemed it safe, you fired off a flare. Someone should see that. You said. As you three wait, you can feel the ground shake violently. That bird better have the pedal down! You said. The ground feels like it\u2019s about to split open! Carl said. Then you see the helicopter. Over here! Ashley shouts. As the chopper lands, you let Carl and Ashley go first. They are right behind us! Get to flying! You said. The pilot ascends into the sky and before it flew to safety, you catch a glimpse of them. Bitches. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a twenty minute flight, the chopper makes it back Staten Island and lands on the makeshift helipad. You three jump off. Nice little set up here. Carl said. Staten\u2019s the last bastion of safety people have left. With those rampaging witches out there. You said. How have they not found this place yet? Ashley said. They\u2019re knowledge of America isn\u2019t conclusive. Either that or Chijinda didn\u2019t tell them where I am. You said. It ain\u2019t pretty, but it\u2019s better than ducking and dodging those girls. Carl said. Make yourselves at home here if you want. We have a lot of space since we routed out some people. You said. I can live here. Ashley said. I\u2019ll see you two around. You said. You head off to the apartments. Hey, Cynth. You still at it? You said. Yeah. Your so called friend Narue sent me the blueprints of the growth gun. It\u2019s amazing what these girls were able to build. If only they used their tech for good. She said. They think they are. You plan on building one of those things? You said. Wish I could. It would be the perfect edge we need, but I need to be in one of their labs to do that. She said. That won\u2019t happen. Ever since Miku, their underground labs have been cave in. They would just rebuild it all again, but I don\u2019t know where. You said. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. We have other plans. The president, who is currently in his underground bunker, is negotiating with other world leaders for assistance. She said. Let\u2019s hope someone says yes. You said. I saw the flare you fired. By my estimate, they could be here within a few days. Maybe even by tomorrow if they work overnight. She said.  They are not getting here. I have a plan. Just trust me. They will not siege this place. You said. I hope so. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on, you try to relax. Still tense? John said. Yeah. How do you relax knowing five gigantic bitches are coming? You said. Who said it would be just them. What if the Vice director and her stupid friend decide to see this personally? Bowman said. They wouldn\u2019t. Mia would only show if this would be a big problem. You said. You sure that trap will work? John said. Positive. If they try to cross the waters, they will go rushing back to land. You said. If you say so. Just try to calm down and have one of these. John said. He hands you a Beer. Budweiser? You said. Yeah. It helps me. John said. If you say so. You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cynthia look out into the distance. The ground is shaking lightly. By my judgment, they will be here either in 12 hours or tomorrow at best. She said. We\u2019re running out of time. The president better negotiate fast. You said. A few countries have already agreed to step in, but some are still holding out. The president doesn\u2019t want foreign boots on US soil unless they are going to help out. She said. They better decide or they won\u2019t be anyone here left to save. You said. I don\u2019t trust anyone unless they are born in the US, but some foreign aid could be helpful. She said. Any aid would be helpful. You said. It really would be. Nothing to do but feel out the tremors and make sure everyone is safe when they get here. She said. Hopefully by then we get a ticket out of here. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are only hours away. The tremors are getting more and more violent. Cynthia said. Damnit! Why is the president dragging his feet? John said. He wants to make absolutely sure that if foreign soldiers are in the US, they are only there to help restore it, not bring it down even further. Some countries are asking for things in return for help. Cynthia said. The president is trying to save face while at the same time asking for help. You can\u2019t have it both ways. Bowman said. How far out are they? John said. By our calculations, only a few hours. Cynthia said. The president needs more time. Time in which we don\u2019t have. John said. They need to be delayed. You said. Who\u2019s going to slow down titanic school girls? Cynthia said. Me. I\u2019ve fought them before. You said. You said that when they are together, they were difficult. Plus, they are 10x your size. Cynthia said. I\u2019ve got it covered. The president needs time to negotiate with other world leaders. By the time they reach an agreement, we all could be dead. You said. You said. As much as I don\u2019t like it, he\u2019s right. The commander in chief needs as much time as he can get. Bowman said. And he\u2019s the only one with any experience with these bitches. If anyone, it\u2019s him. John said. \u2026\u2026.If you go, I better damn well hear from you. I\u2019ll be fine. Just stay here and tell me when the president has the help. You said. You leave the building. Cynthia, you can breathe now. He\u2019s gone. John said. I know! She shouts. Why don\u2019t you just tell him you have feelings for him? Bowman said. One, the age difference. He\u2019s like what\u2026\u2026(Insert age here).  Two, we\u2019re only hours away from impending giantesses who want nothing more than us as servants. Three\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026..What if he doesn\u2019t show me the same feeling as I show him? She said. Just tell him. The worse it can get is \u201clet\u2019s just be friends.\u201d John said. You really don\u2019t understand woman. If we have deep feelings for someone, we want to be more than friends. She said. Cynth. If you don\u2019t tell him soon, you might never get a chance again and wonder \u201cWhat if\u201d for the rest of your life. Bowman said. \u2026\u2026.Fine. I\u2019ll tell him if\u2026\u2026.when he gets back. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it past the barricade. Jim. That barricade stays shut tight. You said. Don\u2019t worry. Tighter than Alcatraz. He said. If I don\u2019t come back, you know how to operate the trap? You said. Yeah. I\u2019ve been learning how in my spare time. He said. It\u2019s a deterrent, not an attack. Ok? You said. I know. He said. You then make your way to Manhattan.<br>\r\nAs you make it into Manhattan, the ground is shaking violently. It took me at least almost an hour to get here on foot. They could cover that in mere minutes. They only reason they haven\u2019t found it is because they\u2019re also hitting cities as well. You said. You look at the tube attached to your arm. A quarter left in there. Need to conserve as much as I can. But first\u2026..i have to find them. Just follow the violent shaking. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through Manhattan, you can tell you\u2019re getting close. Almost there\u2026.. You said. As you trace the tremors, you get the feeling that you are not alone. You turn around to see three people pointing guns at you. (Their guns are different, but I can tell they are with Section.) You thought. You must be him. One guy said. I\u2019m him. With these tremors getting worse, I\u2019m the least of your concern. You said. Actually, you are our concern. Another guy said. Just from him saying that, you know how this is going to end. Sold your fucking souls to the devil and now you\u2019re his plaything. You said. Blunt way to put it. Our mistresses want your head, and we\u2019re here to deliver. Another guy said. Just tell me this: whose boot taste better while you\u2019re licking it? You said. Our job is to restore society. Our mistresses are doing just that. With cities rebuilt and all. And all they ask is for our obedience. Another said. Live in a better world at the cost of my self-respect and false god? Pass. As you point your gun, you can feel the ground shake. You were ready to fight a two on one, but it wasn\u2019t one of the queens, it was narue. Heh. Never thought I would be happy to see her again. You mumble. Touch him and it will be the LAST thing you do! Narue said. Feeling lucky? You said. Alright. Alright. Today\u2019s your day. Come on boys. The middle guy said. The three of them leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you hurt? Narue said. What are you doing out here? You said. I thought the best way to regain your trust was to help. Although me growing was spur of the moment. She said. Spur of the moment or because you wanted to? You said. \u2026\u2026I don\u2019t blame you for still hating me. She said. I don\u2019t hate you. I\u2019m just disappointed that you of all people would turn on me. You said. I was caught between my best friends. Chijinda\u2019s always been right when it comes to his guts. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you. I should have left with you on that day. She said. Well, you didn\u2019t. You apparently want to be worship as a god as miku said. You threw away our friendship and my trust for what? To have people think you were god himself? Have people bow at your feet? You said. I don\u2019t want any of that! I don\u2019t want to be lauded as a god! I don\u2019t want to be lauded as anything! I just want to be your friend again. She said. \u2026\u2026\u2026Ok. You\u2019ve been doing good with the information. Let\u2019s see if you are worthy of my forgiveness. Topple these building. And don\u2019t ask questions. You said. Narue quickly pushes over the high skyscraper building like they were a stack of cards. Add more to the pile. You said. Narue topples more crumbling buildings and the rubble piles up on the pile. After a few minutes, the pile reaches past narue\u2019s knees. All the buildings in this area. Now for the kicker. You said. You pull out a lighter and toss it on the pile. The lighter hits something flammable and the whole pile catches on fire. You might want to shrink back down now. You said. You and narue head back to Staten Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the bridge, narue has shrunken back down. You both past the barricade and head into the hideout. I\u2019m back. You said. Were you able to\u2026\u2026.. What is she doing here? Cynthia said. Apparently, she\u2019s had a change of heart. You said. I don\u2019t expect to be accepted right away. I know how you all feel. Just give me a chance. Narue said. How far away are they? John said. As deep as we were in Manhattan plus that burning pile in their way, at least a day. Narue said. Check her for a wire. Bowman said. Narue willingly submits to a pat down and body check. After the pat down and a body check, which she only said you were allowed to do, no wire was found. No wire. She\u2019s clean. You said. She remains in eyesight. Cynthia said. We\u2019ll see where you stand when it\u2019s time. Bowman said. I stand by my friends. Something I should have done a long time ago. Narue said. We\u2019ll see. John said.</span></div></div>",

They won\u2019t move at night, even though it\u2019s more tactical to do so. You said. You shouldn\u2019t have let her back into your life. People like her are only going to hurt you again. She said. I wish I could agree. I\u2019ve known her for so long. If I\u2019d turn my back, I\u2019d be just like her. You said. You deserve better than that. Someone like you shouldn\u2019t have a friend like that. She said. You get the feeling that Cynthia is avoiding trying to say something. You trying to say something. You said. I am\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026.I know there is an age difference between us, but I don\u2019t care about that. Every time I see you, I get this feeling in my stomach. My heart rate increase. Every time you smile, I smile. When you\u2019re sad, I\u2019m sad. Your conviction, your wiliness to stand against everyone who follows the bandwagon, to stand when everyone else abandons. I won\u2019t let those demented school girls get their hands on you. I want to say this before they get here. I love you. If this is our last moments, I want them to be in your arms. She said. Cynthia\u2026\u2026 You said. \u2026\u2026Just be with me for tonight. She said. With the moonlight shining on you both, you two kiss each other and lay down in each other\u2019s arms. (So this is what happiness feels like? It feels so good.) She thought. I will protect you. Cynthia whispers in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning. You wake up to see Cynthia still holding you. Even in horrible times like this, love still finds its way into people\u2019s hearts. You said. You thought this would one day be you and narue, but it seems life had a different plans for you. After thirty minutes, John comes busting in. Hey! We have\u2026\u2026\u2026 Uh\u2026\u2026.do you two need some time? He said. That\u2019s none of your business! What do you want?! Cynthia said. The president said help is coming. John said. How much help? You said. Most of Europe and even Japan is sending over their carriers to help ferry people away. That\u2019s good! Everyone could get out of here! You said. Yeah, but\u2026\u2026..we have a problem. He said. What kind of problem? You said. You have to see. He said. You and Cynthia get up and follow john and you see Chijinda. He was here when I got up. Wanted to see what you wanted to do. Joh said. Good to see you\u2019re alive. Chijinda said. You of all people should be the last person to show your face around here! I should just- Cynthia! You interrupt. Why are you here? You said. Narue told me you were here. He said. I told you! She just want to see you hurt! Cynthia said. It was not about hurting him. Chijinda was always a horrible liar. He came here of his own free will to talk to you. Narue said. About what? You said.  Heh. You know, the one time I try to plan ahead, it blows right up in my face. He said. Wait. You planned on this? You said. Well, not all this. You saw how devoted they were. They would have just stared up somewhere else and stared some sort of Neo organization. He said. And you were going to tell me when? You said. I figured you knew. I said I wasn\u2019t down with all this, but you running off made it clear to them. These bitches have unlimited resources. But since I was in charge, well\u2026\u2026.let\u2019s just say they are on a limited supply now. You said. So wait. Turning on me, making me feel like shit was a part of that? You said. No, that was icing. But it did help. You kept the queens occupied so they wouldn\u2019t be spying on me and narue. You giving them a headache was the perfect distraction to undermine all of their progress. He said.  So all that tech is gone? You said. All of it. Operation Humanity\u2019s reduction or savior never existed. He said. Even the shrinking and growing tech. John said. All gone. All that\u2019s left is the queens and Mia. He said. Speaking of that red head, where is she and her puke haired friend? You said. Even I don\u2019t know. She was up and gone one day. All that\u2019s left is the queens and anyone who believes them. He said.*Sigh* I don\u2019t know whether to be angry that you used me, or happy that you all of a sudden got so cunning. You said. So\u2026..friends? He said. Aww\u2026..what the hell? Approaching giantesses are coming and I have people I trust by my side. Friends! You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ground starts to shake. Shit. They\u2019re closer than I thought. Bowman said. How far out are those birds and carriers? You said. At least ten minutes. Cynthia said. We have at least two before they\u2019re here. Chijinda said. (Time to put the plan into action.) You thought. To your positions! We practiced for this! You said. As bowman, Cynthia, and john get to there positions, Narue and chijinda stay behind.  One last time? To the end? Chijinda said. Not this time. Get to the docks and wait there. You said. No way. We still have unsettled issues with these bitches. Chijinda said. We do, but I\u2019m solving it. It\u2019s going to be hot. You said. Meaning\u2026..? narue said. Just trust me. Get to the docks. You said. Narue hands you one of those growth guns. This is how I got so big in the first place. Use it when needed. She said. No promises. Go! You said. Narue and chijinda head to the docks. All alone, you pull out your cell phone. Mr President, sir. They are here. You said. I can feel the ground shaking here in D.C. He said. Is the nuke ready? You said. It is\u2026\u2026 Are you sure you want to do this? Nothing will survive this and I\u2019m not asking you to do this. He said. I won\u2019t let them have their way. I\u2019m not worshiping some school girl for every day of my life! You said. \u2026\u2026Understood. I\u2019ll wait for your passcode. He said. And don\u2019t hesitate to push that button, sir. By the time I say it, I\u2019ll be the only one left on Staten. You said. \u2026\u2026..You served your country well. He said before hanging up. These bitches need to die. One way or another. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback. Months earlier in the white house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt won\u2019t work, Mr. President. Even seal team six won\u2019t be successful. I\u2019ve seen these girls. If push comes to shove, they will just shrink them and that\u2019s it. You said. Isn\u2019t there anything we can do? Are we that helpless? He said. Bested by a bunch of school girls. The general said. If we roll an army of soldiers up on them, they would just shrink them. These bitches are methodical. They are willing to do ANYthing to protect Miku. You said. But there has to be something. We can\u2019t just sit back and let them shrink or grow things willy-nilly. He said. Well\u2026..there is one thing, but it\u2019s going to require appeasement. You said. Appeasement? The general said. Look. Before you jump, hear me out. We let them do what they want. You said. Let them? They both said.  Look, if we send in a force to kill all of them, they will only get killed themselves. And if we do manage to stop them, they\u2019ll just set up somewhere else. We\u2019ll literally be at this for years to come. And their morale won\u2019t falter. It will only strengthen it. You said. \u2026\u2026.What\u2019s your plan? The general said. Nuke. We drop a nuke on them. You said. A nuke? That was my idea in the first place. The general said. We can just up and drop it on them. As devastating as it would be, they would just rebuild in a matter of days. But here\u2019s my plan. Staten Island becomes they place where we drop it. I draw them their and on my signal, you drop a SR 17 on them. You said. But what about all the people there? The president said. They\u2019ll be gone. Because our commander is going to go hat in hand to the other world leaders for help getting citizens out of there. You said. That\u2026..sounds like it will work, but if everyone leaves, they\u2019ll know something is up. He said. Which is why I\u2019ll stay behind. I\u2019ll keep them bust why the nuke is drop. When I say Queen\u2019s mistake, you push that red button. You said. So wipe out a heavily populated island to kill these girls? He said. I know it\u2019s a stretch, but with all of their resource going into this, they\u2019ll only be able to do this once. And plus, imagine your sons, daughters, and grandchildren all living under someone\u2019s heel. Force to worship someone as god, and be used for their pleasure. I know what they\u2019ll do because I\u2019ve seen it happen. We\u2019ll be nothing but toys to them. You said. The president and general remains silent. \u2026\u2026..Call them off. Call them all off. Move all armed forces to bases out of the US. The president said. On it. The general said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash back ends. <br>\r\nAll their plans will go up in smoke today. I\u2019ll take them hell and personally present them to Satan myself. You said. As you come to terms with what your about to do, the ground shakes violently and people screaming. Time to bury this society. You said. You head outside for the coming onslaught.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can see people running and getting ready for what\u2019s coming. As the ground shakes, you momentarily lose your balance. You regain your balance and call the president. Is the nuke ready? You said. Yes. Its target is Staten Island. Just waiting on the passcode. He said. Ok. You have the frequency of my headset? You said. All secure. He said. Ok. Don\u2019t hesitate. Push that button. We won\u2019t get another chance like this. You said. \u2026\u2026If there was any other way or if I had known\u2026\u2026 He said. You didn\u2019t know, sir. This was right under everybody\u2019s nose. Be ready. You said before hanging up. You head to the barricade. Help\u2019s on the way, Jim. You ready? You said. I lived through gang wars. I won\u2019t fall so easily to a bunch of girls. The trap is juiced and ready. He said. Ok. As soon as all of them step into the water, flip the switch. Wait. Where\u2019s Hilary? You said. Right here. She said while holding a gun. I thought you\u2019d be the farthest from here. You said. I\u2019m not going to bow down to some girls who have an inferiority complex. As much as love the good, carefree life, I\u2019m not worshiping anybody just to live that life. She said. Heh. Ok, people. Let\u2019s show them we won\u2019t go easy into that silent night! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ground shakes violently, Cynthia comes beside you. We do this together! She said. I have visual on them! Someone shouts from the roof. John. How much time we have left? You said. Eight minutes! He said. We have to hold them for eight minutes! They know I\u2019m here and will be hell bent on getting me. You said. They\u2019ll have to go through me first! Cynthia said. Then the queens come in sight. Jim! You said. I know! He said. One by one, they enter the waters. Now! You said. Jim flips the switch and a surge of electricity courses through the waters. Electricity can be seen on the surface of the water. All of your hopes paid off and the queens are significantly hurt by this. It\u2019s working! Jim said. Wait! I see movement on the bridge! Hilary said. You look and see people running across the bridge. Wait a minute. Jim! Keep that door close! You said. How are they? Cynthia said. Agents like us, but they work for the soon to be fried queens.  Keep them out! You said. Everyone who has a gun open fires on the agents on the bridge. Don\u2019t let them get to the switch! You said. As everybody fires, you keep your eyes on the queens. What you see is shocking. Slowly, but surly, they are trudging forward. Shit. We can\u2019t stay here for long. You said. The support is five minutes out! John said. Hold them back! You said. As the gunfire fires back and forth, the queens get closer and closer. They\u2019re too close! Fall back! You said. Everyone at the railing falls back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back into one of the buildings. Bowman! You shouted. Just from the gun fire, we lost more than 15 people. He said. Shit! Where\u2019s the others? You said. Cynthia is keeping an eye on your friends. John is keeping check on that support. He said. Ok. Keep those people back! You said. You and bowman cover people who are running back. After 2 minutes past, the ground shakes. They\u2019re on the Island! A man shouts. Gunfire won\u2019t do shit against them. The trap was supposed to hold them until support got here! Bowman said. They\u2019ll kill everybody to get to me\u2026\u2026 You said. You hold the growth gun narue gave you. Bowman! Coordinate everybody who\u2019s fighting. You said. What are you going to do? He said. I\u2019m going to even the odds. You said. You shoot yourself with the gun and jump out the window. As you hit the ground, you can feel your body expanding. Everybody who was running suddenly stops when they see you at your new height. So this is what it\u2019s like to be this big. You said in disbelief. After a few seconds, Bowman tells everyone to keep moving. With this new size, you confront the queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! You looking for me? You said. A little surprised, but they remain confident. You haven\u2019t changed anything! Kanon said. You think you can handle someone the same size as you? You said. I\u2019ll defeat you to restore what honor you took from me! Lady Masque said. Honor? We\u2019re in America! Not Japan! Here, we fight to win! Keep your honor shit in Japan! You said. Hmph. Whatever hope you have will be gone when this is over! Reina said. You think that? Then prove it! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go on the offensive and attack. Using your environment to your advantage, you smash Kanon\u2019s head through the tall building. You block a high kick from Reina and leg sweep and stomp right on her stomach. How do you like being under someone? Not good, is it? You said. That\u2019s when you put your arms up and block a sword and it gets lodged in your arm. You and this stupid sword! You said. You knee Masque in the stomach and she kneels over. You manage to dislodge the sword and shove her face into the ground. That\u2019s the taste of failure! Taste like dirt, doesn\u2019t it? You said. He\u2019s completely owning them. John said. No. This can\u2019t be their full power. He said together, they were unbeatable. Bowman said. Maybe he was exaggerating. John said. No. Even though the name is egotistical, they wouldn\u2019t be called the Heavenly queens for nothing. They must be\u2026\u2026 Oh no. Stop fighting! It\u2019s what they what! Bowman shouted. (Something isn\u2019t right. Last time, they didn\u2019t hesitate. But why did they just let me do this to them?) You said. While in thought, Reina suddenly knees you in the face. While reeling, Kanon uses her whip and unleashes a barrage of whips. Just as the last crack hits, you grab the whip, pull her towards you and punch her right in the face. While recovering, Lady Masque attacks you right in the leg. When she comes back, you were able to grab her sword, push her away and throw it at her, but she grabs it as the handle comes in reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start panting and fall on one knee. Tired already? Reina said. I still have energy to burn. Kanon said. So that was your plan. Wear me down so that I won\u2019t be able to put up that much of a struggle. You said. At least you\u2019re not dumb. Kanon said. Just proves that you can\u2019t beat me without underhand tactics. You said. Not our fault you fell for it. Reina said. Heh. You\u2019re not the only one who planned for this. You said. Suddenly, jets start to fly by. You look and see helicopters and a troop carrier near the island. About time. You said. You think these flies can stop us? Reina said. Not stop. Delay. You said. You fire the gun at you and you shrink back down to normal size and you make a b-line to the docks while foreign jets keep the queens occupied. You get there and help direct people going on. Come on. Everybody get on board! Small families on copters, huge families on the Japanese carrier! You said. As you, john, and bowman direct the loading of people, the ground is shaking. Is that everybody on the island?! You said. Yeah. We lost more people than we expected, but everybody\u2019s on board! Bowman said. Come on! We\u2019re next! Cynthia said. As the chopper lands, you ask narue for the last syringe. Here, but why now? She said. Don\u2019t ask. Get on. I\u2019ll be on the next one. You said. Incoming! John said. A spinning out jet crashes right next to you. Just go! You said. Ja! The pilot said. The helicopter flies off. All forces, pull out, repeat pull out. You said. You look and see all the copters and the troop carrier start to fade into the distance. Then you hear the jets fly above and out of sight. Just me\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s end it. You said. You shoot yourself again with the gun and grow back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey. No more interferences. Just you and your goons and me. Like it should be. You said. No mercy! Reina said.  Bring it on! You said. </span></div></div>",

Ex will decide when we land. Cynthia said. After a thirty minute flight, the chopper lands on a US naval carrier. Everyone jumps off. When the next chopper lands, no one is on it. Where\u2019s Ex? Cynthia said. He wasn\u2019t on the chopper? John said. Shit\u2026.. Taking it too far. Chijinda said. Everyone sees a mushroom cloud in the distance. That can only be done with a nuke. Bowman said. Wait! He didn\u2019t! Cynthia said in a panic. Oh dear god\u2026..Narue said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Staten Island.<br>\r\nYou can feel the effects of the serum wearing off. You have deep cuts and lacerations all over your body. You slump over on a building that creeks when you do. You were about to inject yourself, but you toss away the syringe. Then you see the queens. They are just as hurt and tired, but to a lesser extent. I hate to\u2026..but I must give you credit for lasting this long against us. Reina said. I\u2026.told you\u2026..you\u2019d\u2026..lose in the end. Kanon said.  Like I care\u2026\u2026. The person you were hounding is in front of you. Who deals the fatal blow? You said. Me. To\u2026..redeem myself\u2026\u2026for making\u2026.a mockery of me\u2026..back at the school. Lady masque said. Don\u2019t\u2026\u2026make it\u2026..quick either. Reina said. Make\u2026\u2026him suffer. Kanon said. Such\u2026..brutality\u2026.. Mizuho said. As Lady Masque gets close, you whisper the passcode. Acknowledge. The president said. What\u2026..did you just say? Lady Masque said. In the face of true genius, people like you\u2026..will always be one step behind\u2026\u2026. Hahahahaha\u2026\u2026\u2026. You said. Then you all look up and see an SR nuke in the air. You\u2026\u2026bastard!!!!! Kanon said. I told you. You\u2026..won\u2019t have\u2026\u2026your way. You said. Then the nuke hits the ground and the explosion covers the entire Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the carrier. <br>\r\nWe\u2019re going back! Cynthia said. Nothing could have survived that. That was a SR 17. The admiral said. An SR 17? The phoenix bomb? Bowman said. That\u2019s right. The explosion is fire based. Right as the mushroom cloud forms, a fire 5x hotter than napalm is released. It burns everything and anything it touches. A person would be reduce to ashes in just mere seconds. The admiral said. But\u2026..there\u2019s a chance, right!? Cynthia said. The chances are 0.00001% of survival. If someone survives the explosion, the fire would kill them. He said. How long does it take until the fire dies? John said. The fire can\u2019t last long if isolated by water. The admiral said. I want to be on the first chopper in! Cynthia said. I can\u2019t authorized that. After the fire dies, an international forces is going in to make sure the job was done. The admiral said. After 20 minutes, the fire dies down and multiple choppers fly and land in on Staten Island. Cynthia runs straight into the comms room. If they don\u2019t find him alive\u2026\u2026.! Cynthia said. Cynth, calm down! You\u2019re getting worked up. John said. After a 15 minute wait, the teams report nothing. Nothing? They found nothing?! Cynthia said. Nothing. And it was a well done search. The admiral said. Well, tell them to search again, damnit! Cynthia said. Cynthia, it might be time to face fact. Bowman said. No! He wouldn\u2019t just up and die like this! She said. Actually\u2026\u2026.it was his idea. The admiral said.  His? Everybody said. Yes. His firsthand knowledge and experience of them was great. He knew nothing we could do could stop them. To him, the only thing that would stop them was the SR 17. The admiral said. Jesus\u2026.. John said. Cynthia\u2019s eyes start to well up with tears and she breaks down. If I knew this would go down\u2026.. Chijinda said.  So\u2026\u2026what happens now? Bowman said. Try and rebuild the US and try to get back to our lives. The admiral said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 months later.<br>\r\nYou take in a huge gasp of air and open your eyes. *Pant* *pant* I\u2019m alive. But where am i? You said. You look to see you\u2019re in an underground complex. This looks like one of the science committee\u2019s lab. You said. You get off the operating table. You see you are back at your normal size. My skin isn\u2019t crispy, so that\u2019s a start. You said. Up already? And here I thought I had to pray for you. A voice said. You look and see Mia coming out of the shadows. You? Of all people\u2026.. You said. Hey, I\u2019d be a little grateful if I were you? I didn\u2019t have to save you. She said. You? Why? We hate each other. You said. I didn\u2019t do it for you, I did it for Chijinda. He was an utter wreck without you. She said. Heh. So you do like him. As much as you try to hide it. You said.  I already regret my decision of dragging your sorry butt out of that burning city. She said. I never asked you to save me. You did it out of your heart because you couldn\u2019t stand to see chijinda like that. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at him. You said. ........So? She said as her cheeks turn red. Thought so. So you didn\u2019t do anything to me? No chip in my brain or anything like that? You said. As much as I would have loved that, I, reluctantly, just left you as you were. Although, you did heal faster than the others. She said. Others? You said. You look and see the queens at their normal sizes and badly burned and scared. Them too? You said. I might be second in command and carry myself at a higher level than other, but i know these girls on a personal level. She said. Yeah, sure. So are they going to live? You said. Not likely. Unless\u2026.. She said. Unless what? You said. Unless you give them that shit you are taking. She said. Give the girls who wanted to kill me that? Why should i? You said. Because of your sense of morality. You killing in a fight is one thing, but you can\u2019t sit back and watch someone die. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go up to each one of the queens and can see they are badly burned and their breathing is low. They have minutes at best. Mia said. As much as you wanted them dead, you feel a need to help them. (Am I really going to help these bitches?) You thought. You pull out the syringe. Four of them, each one gets 25%. You said. You in inject each one of them with the syringe. Hmph. And you were giving me shit? She said. Because someone who shrinks and crushes people for a few chuckles has no morality. You said. You see the queens start to heal, but only to a degree of them able to stand up. That was quick. Mia said. The effects are instant. You said. One by one, the queens get to their feet. Ugh\u2026\u2026My head hurts. Kanon said. \u2026..The last thing I remember seeing was this flood of fire\u2026.. Lady masque said. You got your croons back. I\u2019m outta here. You said. Hold on\u2026..You think I\u2019m going to let you leave?! Reina said. Watch it, drill hair. I only gave you 25% of a full dose. As you are now, you won\u2019t last long. You said. Saved\u2026..by someone like you\u2026\u2026Masque said. Unlike you five, I have a conscious. And don\u2019t think you own me, Mia. You said. Your words, not mine. She said. Yeah? Mark this! I better not see high or low of any of you! You said. You find your way out of the complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. Seems like the rebuilding\u2019s underway. Time to see America. You said. As you walk down the street, you see a lot of construction work being done. Time to find Chijinda. You said. You know where he would be. You head to the HQ. How in the world did this building not be damaged? You said. You head inside and see the place has few people inside. You make your way through the building and head into the Boss\u2019s room. Hmm. Seems like we have ghost. He said. I\u2019m not a ghost. I\u2019m very much alive. Thanks to some unexpected help. You said. From a former enemy? He said. You bet. So has chijinda come crawling back? You said. His intentions were noble, but he could have done it a different way. He said. A vague yes? You said. Yes. He came back. Narue was devastated with the loss of you. I lost contact with her four months ago. He said. Probably wants to be alone. So, where does this leave me since people think I\u2019m dead? You said. Well, since the whole giantess thing, the president has built a force to deal with it, but they have no one with firsthand experience. He said. I see where you\u2019re going. But first get chijinda in here. You said. He\u2019s already on his way. He said. Aschijinda enters he\u2019s shocked to see you alive. How\u2026\u2026When\u2026\u2026What\u2026\u2026?!?! He said. Just breathe dumbass. How: Mia\u2019s help. When: five months ago. What: I\u2019m alive. You said. Does that answer, chijinda? The boss said. Well, yeah. But\u2026\u2026I never thought about what I\u2019d say to make you forgive me. He said. Relax, jackass. We both had the same goal. Just different ways to accomplish it. You said. So\u2026\u2026friends again? He said. You extend you fist. You know what this means to me. You said. A symbol of trust and camaraderie. Chijinda said. You both bump fist. As heartwarming as this is, there is still the task at hand. The boss said. Don\u2019t worry boss man. I\u2019ll take that task force. Come on chijinda. We got recruits to screen. You said. You both leave the building. Heh. Like nothing ever happened in the first place. It seems a true friendship can survive anything. He said.  </span></div></div>",
