A gentle shake confirms the tank is full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment you consider your options.  The sparker is hung nearby, but no one would be surprised to find a new hand is a clumsy hand.  Breaking the lamp might gain you the moment you need to change your fate and regain control of your destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting your mind firmly to the chosen path, you slam the lamp against the main mast, sending oil streaming down the ancient wood and across the deck.  Before anyone can react, you grab the sparker and light the oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds a fire blazes around the base of the main mast and across a portion of the deck.  The captain screams out a string of profanity, but you don't stop to listen.  Grabbing a nearby spar, you leap to him and slam the hard wood on one side of his brow.  With a satisfying crunch, he falls to the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalleye jumps up to defend his Captain, jabbing forward with his fillet knife extended.  Slamming the spar down on his wrist brings another loud crack of breaking bone and sends the knife skittering across the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you know the whole deck is alive with activity.  A small number of crewmen have risen to aid Walleye and the Captain, but the vast majority have risen in mutiny.  Some shots ring out amidst the screams and cries of pitched hand to hand combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long there is nothing left but the groans of the wounded and the crackling of the fire.  Most of the Captain's supporters are dead, a few lay among the wounded, and at least two of them have leapt overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your spar in triumph, you lead the men in a cheer and then quickly organize them into two groups, one to care for the wounded and one to put out the fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It won't be an easy life, sailing the Seven Seas while cleaning fish, but you're willing to give it a try... \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe words of an old Steely Dan song cross your mind: \r<br>\n\"Well, the danger on the rocks has surely passed... \r<br>\nStill I remain tied to the mast...\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Could it be that I have found my home at last?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou're starting to believe you have.</span></div></div>",
