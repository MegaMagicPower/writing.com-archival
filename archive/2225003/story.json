            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You leave the party and start to make your way back to your new home. As you walk your mind starts to flash back across the day you\u2019ve had; breakfast with the family, packing all of your things into dad\u2019s car, saying goodbye to your brother and sister. Then there was the long drive with your parents, arriving on campus and moving your things into your room. Lunch with your parents followed, and then the borderline emotional goodbyes. You knew you wouldn\u2019t see them for at least a few months. You thought about the rush of emotion after they left. The understanding that you\u2019d finally made it. University. It was big and exciting and new, but also completely terrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t the chance to meet all of your new housemates. Ted has been the only one so far. A pretty well-built athletic guy who came across as pretty narcissistic from the way he talked about himself. You just knew he would\u2019ve been a jock at school. Either that or he wants people to think that he was. Anyway, he got ahold of you before you\u2019d met any of the others and convinced you to go out on your first night. There were rumours of first night house parties going on somewhere off campus and he sounded pretty keen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you went with him. You figured it wouldn\u2019t end up being the worst thing in the world. That is, until you lost Ted in the first 15 minutes. Although, that doesn\u2019t seem like that big a loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours at this party that you were becoming less and less excited about as the nights marched on, you checked your phone. A few missed messages from friends and from mum, and then with it\u2019s last dying breath, your phone told you that it was just past midnight. It\u2019s screen went off and you decided to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brings us to now. To you walking back by yourself. Midnight isn\u2019t by any means the latest time to be leaving a party. You know that you\u2019ll be out much later than this in future. It was your first night, though. The end of your first day in a place far from home and you just wanted to get to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets and buildings looked different in the dark than they had in the day. You\u2019re not totally sure if you\u2019re still following the right streets. You would have checked your phone to see if you were heading the right way but, of course, it died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for a while longer before a bright light came over you. For a moment you thought it might\u2019ve been a street lamp, but this was too strong. It got brighter and felt closer and more intense all the time. You couldn\u2019t tell which direction it was coming from. Your eyes started feeling heavier and heavier and then, as though a fresh wave of tiredness was washing over you, they closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes pull slightly apart but quickly snap shut again. The light above was dazzlingly bright and you feel like you can\u2019t open them again. Voices sound around you but you can\u2019t make out any of what they\u2019re saying. They sound distant and distorted, but there\u2019s definitely more than one of them. Slowly, you try to open your eyes again and just about manage to make out a few silhouetted shapes around you. That\u2019s all they are to you, however, and your eyes slide shut once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you hear one of the voices say, \u201cgood luck Subject Zero,\u201d before you fade out again. It\u2019s probably your brain playing tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open and you find yourself gazing up at the ceiling. It takes you a few seconds to recognise it as your new ceiling in your new bedroom. You eyes dart from side to side and take in the new room, filled with your belongings, in the glorious morning sun that\u2019s spilling through your window. You push yourself into a seated position and scratch your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I get back?\u201d you whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think hard, trying to work out the mystery but making no progress. You climb out of bed and walk across the room to your mirror. You take a moment to stretch before you look at your reflection to see what damage the night before had done. When you do look in the mirror, your jaw drops. You see yourself, but you\u2019re further away from the mirror then you thought you were. At least, you\u2019re reflection is. You look back and see someone on your bed. Who is that? You look down and almost scream. Your arms, your legs, your whole body; it\u2019s there, but it\u2019s see-through. It\u2019s all a shimmering light blue and you can see through yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at your bed. The person who was there is still there. It\u2019s you. Your own body is lying there completely still aside from its breathing. Your hands rush up to your face and go straight through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the mirror. You can\u2019t see yourself in front of it. Only your body. You take a deep breath and walk over to where your body is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d you say, kneeling down beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no response. You wave your hands in front of your body\u2019s face and get no response. You reach your hands down and attempt to grab yourself. Before you can properly grab, you feel yourself being pulled forward. You don\u2019t get a chance to resist as you\u2019re pulled into yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world blurs around you as you fly into yourself and then suddenly feel the bed underneath you once more. You breathe deeply and suddenly and sit up in bed. Panic-stricken, you run your hands over your now physical self and look to the mirror for confirmation. You\u2019re you again. You can see yourself moving and your reflection copies all of your movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall back against the headboard of your bed. Was that real? Did that happen. Curiosity comes over you. What if you can do that again? You spend a few minutes thinking and trying to concentrate, though you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re concentrating on. You clench you\u2019re eyes really tightly and then hear a light thud from behind you. You open your eyes and look back. Below you now, your body has slid down into a lying position on the bed. Wait, down. You\u2019re floating above yourself. You can fly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your hands. They\u2019re transparent yet again. This time, you don\u2019t feel as panicked. Excitement starts to creep up on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis could be fun,\u201d you say to yourself as you turn back towards the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float over towards and, once again, can\u2019t see yourself as you are. You\u2019re completely invisible in the mirror and your body is slumped on the bed a few feet behind you. The possibilities start to race through your mind. First things first though, who actually are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Ethan Evans, 18 years old, average height, brown-haired white guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Courtney Evans, 18 years old, slightly shorter than average, brown-haired white girl</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay, so the story is based around a main character who gains the ability to pull their spirit (or ghost) out of their body at will. In ghost form, they can:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) fly around<br>\r\n2) jump into other bodies<br>\r\n3) pull other people\u2019s ghosts out of their bodies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t have to pull a ghost out before jumping into a body. In that event, the new ghost has full control and the original ghost has no memory of what happens. If a ghost who isn\u2019t the main character is pulled out of their body then they can pull ghosts out of bodies and jump into bodies just like the main character, but only the main can leave the body they\u2019re in at will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does also stretch to animals, but within reason. Humans can jump into the bodies of dogs and cats, but an ant\u2019s body would be far too small etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, I hope you guys enjoy. And do feel free to add your own chapters!</td>",
