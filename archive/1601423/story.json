She silently wove her giant form through the trees with practiced ease, careful not to disturb even a single leaf. Kayva had been a giantess for several years, after a spell her master tried went wrong. Kayva knew magic like every other elf, and spent many years learning to use her skills from a secretive and powerful master.  Under her master\u2019s tutelage she also learned a rare magical art known as Dreamweaving. Kayva knew how to use magic to enter and alter a sleeping person\u2019s dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a giantess, Kayva was unable to wear clothes. Mainly because the cost of making such garments were far beyond her reach. All she wore was an arm band made from black ropes she made from a net that humans used to capture her once. Since she was so big Kayva needed a larger supply of food than normal sized elves. Many edible plants in Auran grew to various sizes, plenty being large enough for dragons that roamed the land and for Kayva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of giantess is Kayva?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Thoom' 'thoom' 'thoom' They began runing but Kayva had reached them too fast for anyone to escape, with elven speed and grace her hand shot out and grabbed two young males she tilted her head back and swollowed them. \"Mmmmm...\" She thought  for a moment \"They tasted...\"</span></div></div>",

But now she was the one in power, and she loved the feel of it. And she felt that feeling the most when she felt a tiny person\u2019s blood oozing from beneath her foot, beneath her butt, between her breasts, basically from almost anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight Kayva was easily able to locate a victim.

What an unfortunate accident,\" the elf gushed in mock sympathy. \"But I'm afraid you're in my way.\"<br>\r\nThe man struggle against his constraits, slowly craning his neck to see the full scope of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, can you get me out of this mess? I'll reward you,\" the man said, looking her in the eye. He didn't seem scard at all, Kayva thought disappointedly. This wouldn't be nearly as fun as it would be to a helpless, gibbering victim, but it would satisfy her for the night. That and the fact that he couldn't possibly have anything of worth to interest her, she reasoned, taking another step closer. The ground around the man shook with the tremor of her footfalls, but still he stood his ground, knowing he couldn't move anyway so he should at least look brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, insect, but nothing you can provide intrigues me,\" Kayva announced, leaning over to tear the man loose from the snares. <br>\r\n\"What have I done to you?\" the man huffed, writhing in her grip. \"I've done nothing wrong by you!\"<br>\r\nThe elf giantess blinked, amused by both his desperate movements and confusion.<br>\r\n\"Then I guess that would truly make you pray, would it not?\" Kayva pondered, tilting back her head and dangling him over her mouth.</span></div></div>",

Melody had tried to teach her the good ways of life, and even Kayva had not been a minster around her. However, at the age of fourteen she'd been off by herself and discovered the pleasures of torturing those smaller than her twenty-six foot self. After the goddess had had her fun, she knew she would be in huge trouble if anyone found out. So she ate the only evidence, the unfortunate victim. And man, he tasted good. When she had turned fifteen, Jessica had run off from her home and those who were beginning to suspect her evil ways. So what, a few drifters disappeared overnight. So what, a few people from the surrounding towns had simply vanished without a trace. Jessica had traveled across the mountains surrounding the valley, and the desert beyond. As good measure, she also swam across the ocean. It was large, and had taken her three days straight. The first day on the new land, she had been too exhausted to do anything but sleep. The next day, she had, for the first time, explored her evil. A small, isolated village had been near her landing spot. With a grin, she approached the idyillic village. Five hours later, it didn't exist.<br>\r\nThis morning, Jessica lay in the ruins of last night's fun. Her sizable rear was crushing the town hall, and stuck between her huge breasts were some soldiers she had saved for later. Unfortunately for her, her movements during the night had crushed them.

But now it was time to go, and she walked off and left the survivors to themselves. 'If there are any survivors,' she smirked, and felt a body fall from her ass. She looked around the forest for some leather clothes. Jessica liked to rampage in the nude, but otherwise wore a revealing bra and thong made from dozens of cows. These were draped across the remains of the outer wall, and she slipped them back on and walked into the woods. She wasn't sure what to do with her day, only that someone else had to suffer for her amusement. She was about to doze off in a sunny glade when she heard the rattle of pots and pans from a nearby road. The giantess got up, and stealthily approached the travelers. There was a small convoy of traders going towards the destroyed town. Normally, Jessica could make a group like this last for a few days, but she wasn't in a patient mood. She leapt from the trees, planting her feet on the lead wagon. The merchants looked up, too stunned to speak for a moment. She snatched the leader, and shoved him down her cleavage until nothing but his head was poking through. Then, she moved the two mounds of flesh closer together until he was nothing but a smear. She smiled.<br>\r\nThis murder snapped the others into action, and they scurried around below while Jessica laughed at their struggles. She caught three unlucky souls beneath her foot, killing them relatively quickly. A bull lowed in fear, and she plucked the beast up effortlessly. Jess thought it would be a good morning snack, and chewed it up like a huge piece of beef jerky. Someone had gotten a crossbow, and the first bolt caught her by surprise. She almost coughed up the mangled cow before swallowing it properly. Angry, she looked for the one who had disrupted her meal. He was a smaller man, and was frantically reloading the weapon. He never got a second chance. In a flash, he was off the ground and in her ass. This was her preferred method of execution for those who had insulted her. Otherwise, she would have happily used him as a toy for the front and maybe have let him live. But now, she was serious. Jessica clenched her rear, and she heard him cry out as his bones snapped. It also moved him closer to her asshole, which often claimed as many victims as her just plain crushing them. She closed her cheeks again, illiciting another howl. Now she could feel the man's feet brushing her hole, sending pangs of joy shooting through her. It grabbed on like a hungry animal, and slowly pulled more of him in. He struggled desperately, only arousing Jess more. His fighting was ultimately useless, as one arm was broken and the other slipped and got trapped by her butt. Soon after he was completely inside her, and gone forever. The remaining merchants had wisely fled, and Jessica was disappointed in letting her anger allow people to escape and tell others of her. She considered pursuing them, or just destroying the nearby villages.</span></div></div>",

The first few months had been particularly difficult; still stuck in her normal elf mindset, she'd often approach villages for help, only to be chased off by the human inhabitants screaming cries of \"monster\". Distraught, the outcast elf giantess decided to give society what they wanted. They wanted a monster. They were going to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an untold number of victims crushed beneath her massive frame or sent down her ravenous gullet, Kavya's mindset had served her well. What were once simple rumors and legends to humans and elves soon became all-too-real experiences as Kayva played the roll of giantess to the letter. Well, almost. Though she had taken great joy in snuffing out those beneath her, there was one thing she had never tried: slavery. Ancient tales told of giants and giantesses capturing whole villages, forcing the survivors to serve them in totality. To some, it was a fate worse than death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKavya, more experienced then she's ever been, decides that it is time to make her move. That leaves her with another dilemma. Where to strike? Attacking a small human settlement would provide the most slaves, but leaves her liable to getting captured once more. Going after a hunting party is an option as well, a rather good one, considering there's less risk involved. A third, less practical option involved the river. She could take to the waterways, searching for isolated boats and their equally isolated crews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she pick?</span></div></div>",

As a seasoned hunter of humans, she knew they were crafty and deadly despite their small stature compared to her. It would be safer to track and capture a dozen or so out on a hunt. They would be equipped to hunt boar and moose, and probably not have the discipline of the trained soldiers towns big enough to suit her would have. And Kayva loved swimming, but really didn't want to interfere with the boats along the numerous river ways. Sleepy watchmen in crow's nests were one of her favorite midnight snacks. And even if the hunters would know the woods almost as well as she did, Kayva was sure she would be able to subdue them without having to kill too many. The thought they might actually be able to resist her never entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunting party she eventually found was one of the larger ones. She hadn't come through this section of the realm in almost a year, and people had forgotten the constant terror of wondering if a giantess was lurking just beyond the treeline. But then, Kayva mostly came right out and crushed things if she was serious about someone dying. But this party still kept some precautions from the days she'd frequented this town. Each night several guards kept watch, and carried crossbows that looked more lethal than the ones she'd last seen them with. And the leader was obviously a veteran woodsman. She was mildly concerned when he called a day's break and went off by himself. Kayva had had some trouble keeping up with him as he went off through the dense forest, and almost stepped on him when she found him again. Thankfully she was paying close attention. If she could kill him and make it seem like an animal did the deed, she would avoid causing a panic among the rest of the group. But she was the only thing that would crush someone flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva spent another few days after finding the party double-checking her observations. A mistake would be embarrassing. Not pouncing into the middle of them at night and devouring all the hunters was surprisingly difficult. It had been almost a month since she had last ransacked a village, and she hadn't been able to safely eat any lost travelers since before she'd started shadowing the hunters. Deer and boar were good enough, but Kayva had a special taste for humans. But finally she decided the time was right. After a successful boar hunt, the group was in high spirits and spent a night getting loudly drunk. If they had done that when she had visited before they would have become her feast in minutes. But she let them have their fun. To their credit, they did remember to post sentries before falling asleep. Unfortunately, the sentries also fell asleep. And Kayva was especially good at picking off the sleepers. She let herself drift into one of the sentries' dreams, altering a few things and startling him awake. He reached for his spear, thinking he had heard something nearby. Kayva was very close, but in the opposite direction from where the sentry was looking. He woke his two partners, and the approached a dense cluster of trees with spears poised. The first to wake stepped a few paces ahead, and lunged into the thickets jabbing wildly. His spear point bit into bark and leaves and vines, but no giant elves. He turned around to tell the other two guards of the false alarm. But instead found himself face to face with two giant feet. He slowly looked upwards, until his eyes passed Kayva's sizable bust and reached her predatory grin. One watchman was crushed beneath a foot, and the other traveled down her throat with a *gulp*. The final sentry tried to sound the alarm, but Kayva silenced him with one swift movement of her foot. Now the camp was hers for the taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess savored the tasty lump in her stomach, still struggling a little. Then she began to return to the camp, still silent as a shadow. She passed beneath a rocky bluff, above which the mountainside was dotted with caves.<br>\r\n'This might do as a lair', Kayva thought. The dim embers of a fire were visible through a break in the trees up ahead, and Kayva went over all the responses to different situations she had thought up during her hunt. She was going over how to deal with heroes when something landed softly on her back. She thought it was just a squirrel of other small animal, and went to brush it off. That was when it sunk a knife into her shoulder. She fought against crying out in pain, knowing that would ruin everything. The thing on her back was as nimble as anything she had ever seen and easily jumped around her darting fingers. It jabbed her with the cold steel again and again. Kayva realized she might be in mortal danger, and did the only thing she could think of. She toppled over backwards, hoping her tormentor would be crushed under her. No such luck, but down on the ground, where Kayva could use her full size the fight would be over in seconds. A shadowy figure tried to dart from between her thighs, where he had fallen. Fortunately for Kayva the fall had injured him and he tripped over a damaged ankle. She quickly snatched her would-be killer off the forest floor. It was the leader of the group, as she had expected. He still struggled and fought, but knew it was over. Kayva did him the respect of quickly squeezing the life from him for giving her a real scare, instead of slowly crushing each bone in his body for coming close to hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her silent scuffle in the trees, the seizure of the camp was easy. She merely burst into the clearing, accidentally crushing one sleeper, and woke those who weren't already alert with a wicked laugh. The first hunter to reach for a crossbow was smashed to a pulp. When the giantess didn't start slaughtering everyone else, the survivors listened when she told them to not move. And just like that, she had her first slaves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kayva's brief experience with slaves was not a happy one. She found some caves that would make an ideal giant monster lair, with smaller caves nearby. Now all she needed to do was find something for her new slaves to do. This was a bit difficult, she would normally have her fun with them and move on and that was simpler than trying to hang on to the tiny people. She set them to cutting down trees, just to pass time and think about a final plan. But then one of them ran off, and she had to make sure he died horribly to scare the courage from the rest of them. That was the highlight of her day, and she wiggled her rear end a little, giggling. Maybe she'd put another one up there, just to drive home a point. But the next task, building her furniture, was a little harder. None of the hunters were carpenters and it showed. They couldn't even make a chair for her! She would have crushed the team assigned to making it, if a falling log hadn't done most of the job for her. But now she was down to only about six people. And no matter how much of a pain they were, Kayva was going to see her new quest to the end. And that meant returning to a village to gather more victims. Before she left she sealed her surviving slaves in a cave, leaving them the food and water to live on until her return. Then the giant elf departed for their hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey was uneventful. The townsfolk had sent out some scattered search parties, but they were barely even noticeable as they crunched beneath her feet or struggled down her throat. Kayva had forgotten them by the time she stood outside the village. It had changed little, although the walls were thicker and more guard towers stood watch. The farmers still fled much too slowly when she approached, and she easily snagged a few for a warm-up snack. The thick stone walls stood before her, thicker but not taller. The giantess stepped over them, then though better of it and stepped back outside. Kayva smashed through a tower, spilling stones and defenders to the ground below. But even is wasn't enough. She strode over to the main gate, a heavy wooden and iron slab. She lay down before it, crushing panicked farmers and dwellers who made their homes outside the wall. Kayva shifted her breasts back and forth, crushing out all resistance beneath her. Then she placed a hand on the door and pushed. She could barely feel the soldiers inside trying to hold it shut, while some soldiers tried to reach over the wall and smack her head with their weapons. Crossbow bolts and arrows pattered uselessly off her back. With a final shove, Kayva forced her arm through the door and flung it aside. An array of spearmen stood behind, waiting to push her back. Kayva wriggled forward, squeezing her massive frame through the smaller mount of the door. Her waist got a little stuck, but Kayva kept straining forward until her ass pulled through, raining stretched of the parapet down her backside. The iron-clad defenders felt wonderful falling off her back and under her legs. She moaned slightly in pleasure when a couple very unlocked soldiers fell down her crack, their fighting ineffective against her sheer size. She supposed they must have eventually fallen out, but her attention was needed elsewhere urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of spearmen decided to rush Kayva and push her out while her torso was still within easy spear reach. Kayva crawled forward regardless. When the spears met up against the soft flesh of her breasts they pressed in, some even drawing small rivulets of blood. But they still weighed a tremendous amount, and no wooden shaft could withstand such pressure. One by one, the spears snapped off and the wall of flesh flowed over the terrified soldiers. Finally Kavya stood to her full height, brushing bloody smears of soldiers from her chest. Before the evil elf got fully into the swing of rampage, Kayva reminded herself of her purpose. She checked herself, walking straight to the main hall, crushing no more than two dozen inhabitants on her way there. Her feet made short work of the stone and wood structure, and Kayva looked down at the town. People milled everywhere like a kicked anthill. For a giantess of her size, the metaphor worked. Eventually, the people noticed her lack of destroying everything and quieted for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better! Now, I'd like to present a choice for the direction of your town. Join me as...hmm...volunteer laborers for life,\" Kayva said, smiling mischievously. \"Or give me what I really want and let me finish you off here! If you choose to live, head outside the walls and form a neat and orderly line. We'll be departing in five minutes, anyone still inside becomes entertainment and snacks!\" the giantess announced imperiously. When she was done, she strutted out. As an act of decency she only marched through a single guard tower on her departure. And in five minutes, she had pitifully few snacks and the next few days would be very boring.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kayva was in the highest of spirits as her band of settlers marched through the woods back to her encampment. The journey took almost the entire day, as the humans couldn't hope to match the elf's speed and the elderly among them only made things worse. But, being an elf of her word, Kayva did not send the slowest to her belly. By the time the group made it to her camp, night had curled its fist tightly around the world. Frustrated after a long day of not a whole lot to do, Kayva wanted to get to work on ruling right away. Unfortunately, her humans couldn't see as well as she could at night and required far more sleep than the magical being did. With great reluctance, she swept clear a small patch of ground for the villagers to sleep on. She also released the six hunters trapped in the caves, and almost felt warmed as her snacks greeted their loved ones with tears of joy. With her form practically glowing with happiness, Kayva hastily uprooted some trees to construct a makeshift wall. It was ugly, but it was tall. Gently pacing over to the walls of the cliffs, she lowered herself to the forest's floor. She sighed contentedly as her body came into contact with the soft, tingly earth. This was perfection. Quietly she nodded off, contemplating the size her empire would grow to and the multitudes it would ensnare. As a final bonus, a small band tried to sneak off towards morning's first light. Kayva heard them quite easily trying to scale the leafy branches of her walls, and made the most of her hunt. When she returned, the sadistic elf kept the terrified villagers from sleep with the escapees' tortured screams and her own giggles of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the last fun Kayva had for weeks. No one else tried running, so she had to hunt animals for food. Half the time her slaves seemed incapable of doing anything with a sliver of proficiency. They barely managed to construct a real wall to pen themselves in, even with her doing most of the heavy lifting. Their own accommodations went up well enough, so she didn't have to worry about one of them falling sick and killing the rest. When it came to constructing things like furniture to her size, they suddenly lost all competence. Even after eating two foremen and splattering another across her entire body, not even a wooden throne existed to show Kayva's dominion over this rabble.  When her frustration and bloodlust teamed up, it was almost enough to overcome her desire for rule. She needed to kill in larger numbers than would be tolerated by her slaves. But since she had subjugated the only village for miles, that would be difficult. Kayva almost decided to call the whole thing off and fill herself with men, but a better idea popped into her head. She knew the humans as selfish and ruthless beings. If nothing else, they'd help her to save themselves. As the sound of tools resonated through the growing clearing under the noonday sun, the giantess overlord called the people together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they were awful at constructing a throne, a large central meeting area was well within their reach. Kayva loomed over the crowd beneath her, toes almost brushing the front rows and her shadow obscuring the sun for many of the people. She glared down menacingly for a moment before beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As many may have guessed, your goddess isn't very pleased with your work. Despite the mercy showed you, even the most rudimentary tasks are beyond you. And I am not a patient elf. If a problem persists for too long, I crush it.\" Kayva punctuated this last point by planting her foot on one of the wooden shanties. It exploded in a cloud of wood splinters and dust. The villagers looked worried.<br>\r\n\"You are a problem. But I don't want to throw away my hard work, however much fun it would be to...shove handful after handful of your writhing bodies in my mouth...feel you pop under me...crunch you to pulp...or make you beg for death while performing more sensitive tasks,\" she purred, her eyes gleaming maliciously. She used her dreamweaving to send each person gathered below a suggestion of their death at her hands. They seemed on the verge of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" A mite squeaked from within the crowd. She whipped her head towards the speaker, her lips spreading to reveal shining-white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a suggestion? I hope not, because you'd fit perfectly between-\" Kayva began, but the man fought on through whatever nightmare she'd planted in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A merchant came to our village every new moon. He brought some supplies we couldn't get ourselves. He usually has a group of twenty or so with him...\" The man continued, voice quivering under her gaze. Her grin grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you have a solution! Congratulations, you get more time to work on your image for me. Thank this young...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oleg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oleg, for your lives.\" She plucked Oleg from the ground, and brought him to eye level. He screamed in terror. \"Stop your tears, I'm not going to eat you. Yet. I need someone who knows where this morsel is. And you're the only one.\" Kayva pulled on the black roping around her arm, and slipped the tiny man under it. He struggled for breath as she practically sprinted through he forest. But even at her speed, she moved with the noise of a ghost. The loudest sound was oleg's struggled breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those hurt, don't they?\" The elf commented. She didn't much care for his response. \"They hurt as much as the sticks they jabbed me with when they caught me. Although I don't think it hurt as much as getting torn limb from limb by an angry elf. And it definitely didn't hurt as much as being chewed and swallowed. That hunter's screams were proof enough for me. In fact, I think it was his pain as much as his flavor that gave me a taste for meat. Elves don't eat meat. But my kind isn't like me either. And they taste just as good as you do. Just a little bonier,\" Kayva monologued. Oleg seemed duly terrified, but mesmerized at the same time. She laughed to herself. If she really wanted, she could have conquered the village with her breasts instead of her strength. Human or elf, it was all they ever noticed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moonlight played over the ruins of her conquered village. She loosened the net just enough for Oleg to talk. He wheezed for a moment. Then weakly gestured up a dirt trail leading west. Just before she tightened the rope again, he coughed \"Wait!\" She raised an eyebrow, her eyes chunks of ice impaling the tiny man strapped to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you. I can make you normal.\" The elf's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know about me?\" She asked, her voice a low whisper and far more menacing than her threats earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dreams. When you sent them, another skilled with magic might go back inside your head as they come out. But I'm an alchemist I could-\" Kayva angrily jabbed a fingertip into his chest, driving the air from his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I don't like this? This power, this terrifying presence, the slaughter? I wouldn't give this for the world. A pathetic being like yourself might think I wanted to \"fit in\". No, no. I want to rule. I want people to run at my name. I want to kill, to crush, to devour, to destroy,\" Kayva nearly panted. She would have fun with that merchant. But first, she untied the struggling alchemist. She let him fall to he ground, but only from a height that would maim him. He screamed in pain. Her eyes glowed like fires as he looked up at her towering form. One massive foot raised itself above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that wouldn't be enough for you. You like going into my head? Well here it is!\" Kayva lowered her foot and felt for Oleg's fragile consciousness. She forced herself into it. A being of her power against a mere human, it was no contest. It was like a rowboat being smashed by a levithan. Oleg made a sound she'd never heard from a human before, convulsed, and subsided into insane gibbering. The elf smiled, and stalked off. His mind shattered and body ruined, the wolves would do for him. She had a convoy to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't more than a few minutes jog from the town. It was close to thirty people, clustered around five wagons. Kayva was too excited for subtlety, she charged straight into the group. At her speed, no one had a chance. One moment the night was quiet, the next the guards at the front were smears beneath her. She fell to her knees and let her momentum carry her forward. Her thighs buried the troops at the front, and her gash consumed the first wagon, turning horses to glue and making kindling of the vehicle. Any passengers barely had a chance to scream before they were crushed against her. Laughing in joy, she toppled forward. Two more were crushed by her stomach and breasts, and panic burst among the remaining travellers. One brave soul tried to stick her in the side with a spear. She looked at the pinprick, and wrapped her fingers around the man. She gripped too tightly for him to scream as she sent him to her mouth, and down to the abyss of her stomach. Many tiny shapes scurried around her, trying to help those trapped under her or making a break for the treeline. Her reaching fingers found all of them, and her gaping maw greeted them. Some were instantly ground to mush, while others had the pleasure of dissolving slowly while chunks of their comrades rained down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva lifted herself from the wreckage dripping blood, gore, and the products of her excitement. Her tummy throbbed happily with the struggles of the tiny mortals. Two wagons remained, and she could hear at least a few more humans cowering nearby. The horses struggled to flee, but they were bound tightly to the wagons, and didn't pull with enough unity to move. Her feet savor end their treats, teasing them before ruthlessly smashing them. No human lasted the night, the rest becoming victims of her passion. Her womanhood swallowed as many as her mouth, and remembering earlier pleasures even sent a few up her rear as a finishing touch. Kayva had never known such ecstasy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the night's fun, Kavya passed out. When she awoke in the morning, everything seemed much brighter. Her worries had melted like the caravaneers she had eaten last night. She moaned happily, feeling a few feeble kicks from her tummy. A groan if a different kind came out of her when she rolled onto her back and she felt struggling from somewhere lower. Her fingers plunged inside herself without hesitation, working the survivor with slender digits. Giggling at the sensation of the tiny man fighting her from inside, Kayva worked herself back into a shadow of her former frenzy. Her giggled became sighs and finally a sensuous moan. She felt the walls of her pussy tighten, squeezing her fingers and the man together. He crunched and broke, muffled screams escaping from her lips. She laughed as his broken form slid from her dripping wetness. He seemed unaware of anything but his own pain, so she doubted he noticed when she lifted herself up and lowered her soft bottom onto his broken body. With a final squeak and a pleasant squishing sensation, he died under her. Satisfied, Kayva looked down at her body. She was covered with blood, grime, and other relics of the night's fun. She stood to her full height, scratching her backside and dislodging a couple corpses. As they landed among the flattened wagon train with a splat, the elf laughed one more time. Then she strode off through the woods, back to camp. She was too tired to be stealthy, and moved through the forest like a massive boulder. Two deer paralyzed by fear as she burst into a clearing served as a satisfactory breakfast for the woman. She paused for a moment, slightly more awake as the chunks of meat worked their way down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should do this more often,\" she murmured to the trees around her. Then she resumed her journey back to camp, moving with her usual grace and lightness of foot. As the caves came into sight, Kayva thought she didn't want to terrify her people too much, after all they had given her this wonderful night. Smiling like an idiot, she quickly scurried deeper into the forest. There, one of the many waterways that cross-crossed the landscape flowed swiftly by. Kayla stepped in and shivered, goosebumps running along her smooth skin as the cold water brushed her feet. She crouched down, layers of blood and juices washing off her and flowing away downriver. Finally, she lay down completely, only the very tips of her breasts breaking the flow of the water. She gazed up at the sun through the water, savoring the dappled sunlight through the canopy. A few minutes later, the elf emerged from the water as the image of innocence, no hint of the caravan's fate betrayed by a stain on her skin. Dripping water, she retuned to land and walked softly homewards. But Kayva sensed something was wrong as soon as she approached the camp. Even before she could see it, the usual sounds were absent. At first her rage swelled up in a towering inferno. If she found them lounging about, she just might have another day of fun ahead of her. But then concern took over. Not for them, but for the work she'd put in to capturing the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she emerged at the edge of the clearing, her fears were realized. The walls had been obliterated and the ramshackle huts were in ruins. There were bodies everywhere, and long trails of blood marked the ground. But the bodies were completely flattened, and the ground was scarred by ling, curving indents. Kayva didn't know of anything else but her big enough commit these acts of carnage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out, my tiny ones. Don't die in the frozen desolate, cave away from the sun's warm embrace,\" a soft voice flowed like honey from a jar, somewhere to Kayva's left. Silently, she turned and gazed up along the cliffs. She inhaled sharply. There, flowing along the walls of the ridge, was a woman her own size, with raven hair falling in a cascade down her back. Her skin was the color of the desert sands Kayva had once visited with her master. But from the waist down, skin turned to scales of a golden-brown shade specked with islands of black. Kayva watched her gesture into one of the caves, and out emerged a trio of tiny people. They gazed up at the woman, incapable of breaking away. As the elf moved sideways to get a glimpse of the newcomer's face, she saw a kind smile radiating its own light down at the villagers. Her eyes were their own pools of molten gold, beckoning those beneath her to come closer. Two barely even struggled as slender, clawed fingers plucked them gently from the ground and flew them skywards. The third looked on helplessly as her coils wound tightly around him, but carrying him higher with each ring so he wasn't buried inside them. She laughed gently, and then opened her mouth wide. Two deadly fangs, not easily visible at first, pointed at her two captives. She released one and let him fall forward. Whatever spell had been on them was broken, and the three instantly began howling in terror. But in a flash, the woman's head darted forward and snapped the free-falling human in half. Kayva saw the lump slide down the woman's throat. The other prisoner received the same look Kayva had given many travellers just before they had become her special treats. Sure enough, he soon found himself at waist level and staring at a different pair of lips. Kayva enjoyed watching his demise, even though the way it meshed with the snake-tail was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally moaning in pleasure, the woman turned to her last victim. He begged and pleaded, which only spread the naga's mouth into a wider, more unpleasant smile. Finally, she began to coil herself tighter and the begging gave way to screaming, then crunching, then silence. She loosened herself and the lifeless corpse dropped and was crushed as she descended the cliffs almost vertically. Now receiving a full frontal profile, Kayva saw the newcomer was very well endowed, and covered in a similar coat of what she had been wearing before her dip. The naga didn't know she was there, so Kayva let her return to the ruins of the village before emerging from the treeline. Then she called out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you!\" The naga quickly whipped around, and Kayva found herself transfixed by those two eyes, and the pattern of white-blonde streaks through her hair, which seemed to rise up into a diamond-shape behind the snake-woman's head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still hypnotized by this giantess, Kayva watched with a kind of detached fascination as she slithered towards her. Each second she swam deeper and deeper into her eyes, any tension in her muscles gently releasing until she thought she just might topple over. A hand reached out in friendship, and Kayva stepped forward heavily ready to take it. At this the other woman smiled, her slim face acquiring a soft glow. But there Kayva saw small strips of flesh stuck between teeth, the remains of her villagers, and the spell was loosened. The elf's eyes roamed over the other. Blood on her fingers, bodies crushed between cleavage, a hand sticking out of <i>there</i> ,and buckets of blood caked along her scales. She shook her head, freeing herself of the other woman's influence. With a shriek the naga darted forward, fangs out. If Kayva had been a second slower her neck would have gained new ventilation and all her hard work would have been for nothing. But she darted to the left, closer to the cliffs. The snake bit down on empty air but recovered before Kayva could strike back. She darted out of the elf's reach, and slowly circled her opponent. Kayla cautiously watched back, turning with the other's movements. The naga's eyes, once warm and welcoming had become cold and calculating. Taking in Kayva's every weakness and analyzing every movement for the tiniest opening in which to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva waited until the naga was between her and the forest, then took a step closer to the cliff. 'Better to give her only one direction to come from,' she thought. She didn't get to take a second step, as it dove for her again, this time silently. Kayva easily sidestepped her attack, and went to take a swing at her head. But in mid-step, the serpentine coils wrapped around both her legs and forced them together. The elf fell halfway through her swing with an earthshaking impact. Kayla felt more of the tail wrap around her body, and rolled onto her back in the hopes of making her attacker fall too. The naga easily stayed upright, and perched herself directly above Kayva while she crushed her tighter and tighter. She cried out in legitimate pain, something she hadn't felt since she had been a much younger and smaller elf. And she felt scared. Maybe this desert-dweller would be able to do what no human had been capable of doing, and end her reign of terror. With a cruel laugh, her claws slashed at Kayva's and left four long gashes along her cheek. Crimson blood welled against her alabaster skin. However, Kayva seized at the serpent's arm with a speed the new girl could envy. She looked confused when her hand stopped its upward swing. Although her muscular tail exerted strength the elf couldn't hope to match, Kayva had the advantage in upper-body strength. She yanked the naga forward, delivering a solid hit to her gut. The tail loosened on her legs, and she fought to free them. The woman clawed desperately at Kayva, but the elf was too enraged and terrified to feel it. She kept hitting and hitting, each blow loosening the tail the tiniest bit. Finally, the naga seemed on the point of collapse and Kayva managed to kick her legs free. Wrapping the snake in a tight squeeze, she flipped over. Now straddling the other giantess, she went to aim more blows at her battered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga had plans other than dying too. With a hiss, she spat venom at the elf. Probably corrosive enough to melt even armored knights, it only burned slightly against Kayva's skin. Her master had early on taught her to enchant herself against fire and acids, and these spells had only grown stronger as Kayva had grown. But the pain bought an opening for the serpent. Her tail whipped around and sent Kayva flying off her target. She managed to regain her feet just the moment the other woman did. After another momentary showdown, Kayva broke and ran for the trees. The naga raced after her. Waiting for the brush to fully obscure her, she waited for the snake. It didn't take more than a moment for her to come crashing into the trees. Kayva went to tear a solid oak out by the roots, but faster than imaginable there was a naga twisted around he trunk. After a moment of groaning as she pressed tighter against it, the tree exploded under the tail's grip. As it came tumbling down, Kayva rolled backwards, smashing more trees out of the way. Seeing a tree chopped down for construction purposes, she grabbed hold of it and emerged from the tumble. The two giantesses confronted each other, one hurtling through the air and the other firmly planted on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva swung the tree, striking the other woman's face. The tree broke on impact with the naga's face, and she fell with a cry of pain. She slid limply forward, coming to rest against a tree. Weakly, she flipped onto her back to see Kayva, face gripped by anger, holding a splintered stump. The elf lifted it over her head with a cry of victory, and was about to drive it straight through the defeated naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" She pleaded, holding a hand over herself in a warding gesture. Kayva paused, tree poised over her head. Her chest heaved up and down, and she panted heavily. Both fighters were bruised and bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed my humans. You tried to kill me. And most importantly, you nearly succeeded. Now explain to me why I shouldn't impale you and wear your scales as a cape!\" Kayva yelled down, cheeks flushed with rage and streaked with blood. The naga cowered lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, what would you do if you came on to an under ended settlement in the middle of the woods? Are you honestly telling me you wouldn't have a little fun?\" She asked weakly. Kayva thought of her evening, and grunted. Taking the fact that she wasn't already run through as encouragement to continue, the serpent spoke on.<br>\r\n\"When I saw you, I didn't know what to think. Everything I've ever met has tried to kill me on sight. And here I was confronted by something my own size. Have you ever squared off against a mountain giant, or a dragon? Mountain giants are as dumb as the rocks they live in, but they're strong. And dragons are smarter, which only makes them more dangerous. I wouldn't have tried to kill you unless I though you would have tried to kill me first,\" she finished. Nervously, she lowered her hand and sat up a little straighter. Kayva's face softened a degree, and she let the tree fall with a thud. She reached out a hand to the fallen snake, and pulled her upright when the scaly, clawed hand grasped her soft palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayva.\" The elf said warily. The naga let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia.\" She said, smiling warmly. Kayva tensed for a moment, but didn't feel like she was being hypnotized. \"Don't worry, if you can see the fangs then I'm not trying to pull you in,' Nadia said quickly, the smile dropping from her face.</span></div></div>",

But she didn't trust the one who had just tried to kill her enough for that. So she figured she'd do the next best thing, go for a swim in the waters of a nearby river. It was warmer, lazier, and far larger than the one her earlier bath had been in, and was rumored to have special healing powers. Of course, the humans that went there believing that could usually count on some predator devouring them during the forest night. Kayva hadn't put in an appearance here for quite a while, but she would gladly reacquaint herself with the lazy river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders tensed as she heard scales rasping along the forest floor behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you? It's been too long since I had someone to talk to,\" Nadia said. Her voice still had a certain musical quality, even if it wasn't quite as charming as it had been when she was hypnotizing someone. Kayva almost rejected it out of hand, but softened. She hadn't had a real conversation for years. She might occasionally tease a morsel she found alone if she was bored, but that was hardly a conversation between equals. Smiling, she looked back over her shoulder at the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? I'm going for a dip, why don't you tell me how you came up here. And also about,\" the elf gestured to the massive body, \"how this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia grinned at the pointing fingers, then launched into her story.<br>\r\n\"Well, nagas are usually about twelve to fifteen feet tall. The women get taller and do most of the fighting. I had a clan in the Eastern Deserts, the 200 of us ruled most of the oases running through the center. The humans mostly left us alone, but they kept spreading farther into the sands. Every few years growing up, some would become a serious trouble and there would be a fight. Our collection of warlords' skulls grew, and we'd get a year or two of rest. My first fight was pretty close to my growth. Some new tribesmen had decided they wanted our dominance gone, and took a few water spots during a sandstorm. Our own human...allies, or slaves if you want to be realistic, decided to help us. They weren't friendly with this group. Twenty of us and thirty or so of the best scouts from the men went to reclaim a well along a major road between settlements. But instead of the 75 barbarians we were supposed to meet we found close to 180 warriors. They were a fresh group, but still numbers were a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still a wonderful fight,\" Nadia said, eyes focusing on something far away and long ago. \"We waited for a sandstorm to brew up, it didn't take long. Then we stormed the camp. At least twenty died before they knew what was happening. And then it was just hand to hand. I had no idea how any of my brothers or sisters were doing. I just charged through. We were armed with scimitars, good for slashing while running. These humans had little experience in fighting, and seeing something twice their size moving so fast was enough to make most of them break. It was barely even a fight at that point. I fell off a dune, kicked by one of the camp's horses, and landed in five of them. I remember the glee on their faces, the triumph when one swung his sword down at me. I thought I was dead. But the weapon just bounced off my breastplate, barely leaving a scratch. Then it was my turn to laugh. I decapitated two instantly. Another was a decent swordsman, I had to fight his two friends off with my tail while trying to keep this one from gutting me. I finally managed to knock his sword away and cracked his neck. At this point the other two had run. I managed to skewer one with the scimitar. The other I chased down, and caught him in my coils. It was such a rush, having that much power over something alive! I was cruel, but don't regret it. If I had asked, he probably would have thanked me when I finally crushed the breath from his lungs. I felt like a goddess. Five dead, all by my hand in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the storm died down. Everyone was dead. There was no one left. Well, there was one. A human the equivalent my age from one of our subject villages. He was wary of me, and not without cause. I was scared he would go for me the minute my back turned. But we both saw there was no point. Our first job was to survive. The troops hadn't brought much water, as we thought we'd have a secure well an hour after the start of battle. But the first thing the invaders did was poison the water, turning it a filmy green. Our own home was a three day walk. So we started walking. And we walked. For three days. We both weakened, him first. Humans are not an animal well suited to heat. I made the mistake of trying to carry him the last day. All it did was wear me down. I got within ten miles of the village, I could practically see the sand-colored tents and hear the voices of my people. But I collapsed, this human boy clutched against me. I thought we would both die. Then one hand came to rest on his neck, almost by accident. I could feel his heartbeat, and liters of liquid rushing through him. He knew as soon as I did what was going to happen. At full strength he may have been able to fight back. But I just lifted him and tore out his throat. The first swallow of food in days, his flesh was delicious. And rivers of blood, salty, refreshing blood, poured down my throat. When he was dry I left the body in the sand and trekked home. My conscience twinged remembering what I did! but I was alive and that mattered more to me at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I had killed the son of our community's sorcerer. We are not good at magic. Humans can be, not as good as elves, but they are passable. He saw me come crawling back, drenched in blood. It must have called to him, he greeted me at the edge of town with the rest of the village. But he almost instantly gave a howl of anguish and charged me. I instinctively smacked him away, sending the fragile man flying. I collapsed then and there, at a word spoken from him. My own people let him do this, he must have had a good reason for assaulting a returning warrior. He didn't kill me outright, he said that would have been too easy. Instead he \"cursed me with a bloodthirst the blood of a hundred thousand sons could not quench\". That's when I blacked out. I don't think he knew what he had done. I awoke a moment later, my stomach screaming for food and my mouth as dry as the desert that held my body. And the whole village stretched out in front of me. I was driven out of my mind. I rose up, and saw I was this enormous size, but I didn't care. All I saw were tiny things that could fit in my mouth. I know that damned wizard went first. I got to feel his body get impaled on my fangs, then sent him to join his son. Probably as revenge for what I did next, and blamed him for. I ate every single living thing in the village. Human, naga, camel, horse, cow. Everything. And when I was done, my stomach bulging with meat, I was still starving. It was lessened, but still pressing. I must have killed most everything in the desert in a week. Now there's nothing left there. So I went roaming. For years, going from place to place. Learning to ignore the hunger, and learning to enjoy what I've been cursed with. I think it's worked. I'm not really guilty, or even sad that I ate my people. A necessary step for personal growth, I like to think,\" Nadia grinned sheepishly. Kayva was slightly impressed at her ruthlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all. And I thought I was a monster!\" She laughed a high, elvish laugh. \"Then it's only fair that it's my turn now,\" Kayva said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By now the pair had reached the edge of the river. Trees grew denser closer to a source of fresh water, while vines and creepers hung in thick nets from the upper branches. Thick foliage made peering deeper into the jungle impossible to idle viewers from passing boats. The two giantesses, however, could look down through smaller holes in the growth higher up. When Kayvan judged it to be clear, she waded out of the trees and into the water. She sighed dramatically as warm water washed against her legs, another few steps bringing it up to her waist. She turned and called to Nadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, the water's fine!\" Nadia emerged from the trees, eyeing the lazily flowing river. Slowly, she let herself go deeper until she stood even with Kayva a few dozen feet upstream. Gently, she splashed water over her bruises. Kayva sat down, water covering her up to the top of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you how I came to be what I am while I just...lie here...and enjoy the moment,\" the enormous elf said, closing her eyes and tilting her head back. Nadia looked on, running her hair and face through the water. With a deft motion, she sent most of the water cascading out if her hair. The limp strands hung flatly down her back or over her shoulders, draping themselves over her breasts. When she looked back up, Kayva was looking on elfishly. Nadia smiled back, equally mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was a young elf, barely out of childhood I-\" she paused, tilting her head sideways. A distant thrumming came from upstream. In a moment, her face turned from contentment to the focused look of a predator, particularly one faced with quarry it might have trouble brining down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dwarves. We need to get out of sight,\" she said. The naga paused a moment, and then heard what her counterpart had. She nodded and quickly shot out onto the bank. Kayva chose to make landfall on the opposite shore. She quickly melted into the trees, her footprints barely visible as shimmering puddles of water on matted bushes. Kayva hated dwarves with a passion. More advanced than humans, and twice as brutal. She didn't encounter them often, as they preferred the mountains to her forest habitats. They enslaved any race they encountered, and sent them to work in mines far from the sun's warmth. Although, she thought, she couldn't really complain about them as slavers anymore Kayva thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes focused upstream as the ugly dwarven boat chugged around a bend in the river. It was a squat, square affair made of dull iron and boasting two stacks pumping thick black smoke into the air. A rhythmic beat came from its heart, propelling it forward without oars or wind. Humans wouldn't be able to match this technology for years, if ever. Tiny figures, as thick and wide as the ship they crewed, paced back and forth across the deck. They wore elaborately painted armor and wielded small hammers. Weapons mounted on the ship offered protection from hostile vessels. Kayva was fairly certain they could protect against a giant elf too. She was more tha willing to let this quarry pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her eyes drifted over to the far bank, and her heart caught in her throat. It was painfully obvious that something huge had recently came out of the river, Nadia's tail carving a swath of devastation through the shore's growth. And sure enough, even the dwarves, lacking perception as they did, saw this. The ship ground to a halt and an anchor fell overboard. Smaller rowboats descended from the sides, and a party of ten went off to investigate. Kayva knew their weapons to be deadly and their armor not easily punctured. To make matters worse, they had sent one clad completely in a suit of iron with a power source like the boat. His strength would be far beyond the other dwarves', and would carry weapons deadlier than their gunpowder monsters. The elf only hoped Nadia had the sense to avoid them, and watched them disappear into the jungle after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed in terrible calm. Kayva was getti anxious, and was trying to think of something to do. Cross anywhere, and she might end up cut off or discovered by the dwarves. Wait, and the enormous snake would feel the dwarven fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by cracks and pops from across the river. The dwarves had met something alright. Kayva sat quietly, waiting to see what would happen. More cracks with more urgency. The dwarves on the boat pricked up, more bubbling out of the hold like bees come to defend the nest. They clustered around the far railing, trying to peer into the jungle. A small group of ferns rustled, and out burst several dwarves. The ones on the boat called out, but only panicked gibbering greeted them. Kayva was too far away for her elfin ears to pick out anything, but they seemed scared. Also, only six had come back. They reached the beached landing boats and began frantically pushing them back to the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the trees began to shake angrily. With a blast of broken branches and leaves Nadia shot onto the bank, her face twisted in rage. Several fresh gashes ran along her face and blood trickled from cuts on her stomach. She clutched in one hand a dwarf, in the other half a dwarf. Seeing the party escaping, she squeezed her victim until her fist closed and blood spurted out from between her fingers. Then she dropped the corpse, his armor looking like crumpled paper. The other half a dwarf she hurled at the boat anchored out in the river. The crewmen flipped out as it landed and sprayed innards across the deck. Then the naga rushed forward. Two slower dwarves found themselves suddenly underneath tons of woman as the serpent moved against those in the boat. Her claws found one, puncturing him through the middle. With a look of glee, she spread her fingers and the dwarf flew to pieces. The other two tried to aim their rifles, but more grasping hands found them first. With barely any delay they vanished down her mouth, two lumps barely visible working down her throat. Now she squared off against the dwarf in his suit. With a laugh, she advanced on him. He held out an arm and fired some projectile at her, but it ricocheted off her scales. Smiling much wider, she bent over until her face was only inches from the faceplate. Nadia opened her mouth and hissed a shot of her acid on him. The iron smoked, and steam shot out of melting containers. Kayla heard muffled screams as he danced around, acid slowly working its way towards him. Cackling, Nadia finished the doomed dwarf by smashing her breasts down on him. Pulling away, she left two craters in the damp earth and a pulped mess in the left one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no survivors left to worry about, the dwarf ship opened with everything it had. Cannons hurled iron balls at the shoreline, and gouts of flame leapt out wards towards the naga. Instead of running, however, she dove straight into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!\" Kayla exclaimed as the ripples in the water tracked her friend's progress. After a moment of hesitation, the elf burst from cover and charged into the water. Confined to legs, she couldn't match the naga's grace in the water. Each movement sent sprays of water flying through the air. Even so, the sailors were only focused on the one giantess and so didn't see Kayva coming until too late. With another outcry of surprise, some turned around when she was almost on top of the vessel. They quickly ran for the weapons on her side, but with a wordless noise of exertion she reached out and swept her hand along the edge. Guns, dwarves, and anything else in the way went flying into the water. Their armor prevented them from swimming, and her churning legs did for many of them. The rest sunk to the bottom, waiting for the water or her mashing feet to end their lives. On deck, she tried to smash as many of the tiny forms as she could. Her flat palm left behind smears of dwarf, or partially compacted warriors almost saved by their armor. Without any big guns, they were as helpless as the humans. Kayva's blood pounded in her ears. Now this was exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullet whipped past her ear, nipping the lobe. Angrily, she found the shooter hiding behind a cloud of smoke. Her fist rushed down, erasing him from existence and cracking the deck. She was shocked that it held. Now that the immediate danger had passed, Kayva took more exquisite pleasure in killing. Her hands brought victims to her mouth, depositing them onto her tongue. Her teeth expertly cut the armor away, sometimes taking pieces off with it, and she tasted the rich earthy flavor of dwarf. They settled comfortable in her stomach. Another couple found themselves deposited on her breasts. She laughed as they struggled to get a grip on her wet skin, their cold armored hands making her nipples pop out. Then they slipped into her cleavage, and she mashed them together. The deceptively soft mounds of flesh crushed the stout armor flat. She moaned as warm blood trickled and bones snapped against her body. She heard another laugh, and saw Nadia looking at her from over the deck of the ship. Kayva blushed for a moment, but then the naga dropped more dwarves between her own boobs and pressed them together with her elbows. The pair giggled uncontrollably as screaming gave way to cracking, and then silence. Splashing in the water died down as any thrown overboard sunk to the bottom. Breathing heavily, the pair looked at each other and almost burst into laughter again. But then Kayva punched through the ship's deck and exclaimed triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I found!\" She said, her hand rummaging around inside. It pulled up a group of people, chained together and squealing in terror. \"Lunch!\"</span></div></div>",

The two giantesses had beached the slave ship, giving them time to inspect their catch on their natural element. Nadia's claws carved through the wooden deck and let her pry it off like the lid of a can. And suddenly exposed below was a pit filled with tiny bodies. They shielded their eyes and gazed dumbly up at the sun, taking a second to grasp the shapes gazing down at them. Then worried murmuring rose from the cargo hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all skin and bone!\" Kayva exclaimed in disgust. \"We went through all that for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they sent us so many,\" Nadia purred, her long serpentine tongue running over blood-red lips. Most of her cuts had stopped bleeding and were washed clean by the river, but she still looked beat up. Kayva wondered if the naga could heal at the extraordinary pace she could. Neither bore signs of their earlier fight, so it was probable. Now the snake-girl reached into the ship, deftly plucking one slave into the sunlight. With a rattle of chains and shouts of dismay, a few more came flying upwards with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, they even packaged them together,\" Nadia laughed. Kayva's own mouth watered at the sight of the squirming bodies despite the dwarves melting inside of her. She grabbed an unfortunate, a tattered man covered in grime and clothed in filthy rags. Six more were bound to him. The elf wrinkled her nose at the smell. She looked to her friend, but her hands were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you eat them like that? They're filthy!\" Kayva exclaimed. She dunked her hand underwater, submerging her meal. When they were pulled gasping from the water, she judged them ready. Holding just the tip of the chains the elf closed her mouth around all of them at once. She held up a finger, signaling Nadia to watch. The other stared on in amusement as inside her friend's mouth a small struggle took place. With a final gulp she pulled the chains out, intact but empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TADA!\" She cried, clanking the chains around in a celebratory wave. Nadia laughed and clapped. She circled around to the opposite side of the boat and lay down, her tail trailing off into the river. She pulled out another chain of slaves and began working her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I was promised a story,\" she said imperiously, through a mouthful of people. Kayva sat down and stretched out, feeling the water lap against her feet. She grabbed a handful of captives, bringing out five or six chains of people. Holding one and depositing the others on her stomach, Kayva thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be the local magician's apprentice. My parents were killed in a raid by humans when I was a baby, and he took me in. I'm not sure what his relation was to them, or if he was just the only one who was willing. He taught me some basic spells, silencing footsteps, camouflage, sharpening the senses and things. That took me till I was around nine to master. But he put a price on anything beyond that. A price all magicians had to pay in order to really, truly LEARN their craft. Being nine, I went along with what he said. I let some of his experiments that required a live subject take place on me. He made me stronger physically, something I really appreciated in winter when we had to chop wood. He made me more resilient, like a human knight but without the bulky armor. Those were a couple of his successes. His failures, well...he made me crueler, more savage, made my body reject the fruits elves need to survive. I had no friends after it was learned I had to KILL to eat. But that was fine. The elf children feared me, and I certainly helped them in this regard. Oh, I was an evil little one,\" Kayva chuckled at the memories of various kinds of torture on her playmates. \"By the end I think my own master feared me. He tried to kill me, but the spirit he summoned to do the job merely cursed me with the gift of immortality. At least, assuming someone doesn't kill me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, my...games...with the other elves went too far. As I was just growing into my body, I learns other spells that could be worked. I had lured one of the elf boys back to our cottage. He thought we would be doing an activity more to his liking, but the spirit that had cursed me offered other benefits to an ambitious little girl. Except it wanted a soul. My master walked in right as I pulled the heart from the boy's chest, ripped open with these fingers...\" Kayva held her delicate fingers in front of her eyes, wiggling them. They selected another row of prisoners and fed them into her mouth. Chewing, she continued. \"He couldn't stop it, but he could make sure it never happened again. He walked out and I finished. The spirit cheated me, but I didn't know it at the time. It promised me protection from death at another's hands. Two nights later, I awoke to its shaky voice...'the contract has been fulfilled'. And then the room exploded. My master had worked his most powerful magic, and the spirit had saved me by weaving it into my body. To contain it, my form expanded. I was heartbroken at first. How could I practice all the painful fun I had learned at this size. But I found other ways soon enough. My first-\" Kayva heard small shifting and muffled noises from the other side of the boat. Sitting up, irritated, she went to see what the naga was doing during her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm boring you just say it, I don't need to-oh...\" Kayva stopped, blushing. Nadia gazed back, eyes wide and smiling with embarrassment. Her fingers were working a chain of slaves into her womanhood while two more were wrapped in a figure-eight around her breasts. The ground beneath her was soaked, with water, sweat, her own fluids, and the blood of the humans she'd placed under her back. Nadia raised herself up, a slight redness rising in her own cheeks. Two linked slaves dangled from her waist, the rest screaming and popping inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your story wasn't boring, I just found something a little more, interesting, at the moment,\" she said. The two stared at each other a moment, Kayva turning to face her friend. She leaned in close, slaves spilling off her stomach and onto the ground. Nadia's slender arms reached around the elf's back and pulled herself against Kayva, her firm breasts pressing against the other giantess's, the cold steel chains and wriggling slaves sliding down between the mammary valleys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'd like to make it more interesting?\" Kayla suggested with a laugh, and pressed herself tighter against the other giant. The people caught between them were crushed with barely a notice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is time for Kayva to practice her own brand of piracy. The land of Auran, dense with an untold number of uncharted rivers and lakes, lends itself well to aquatic assaults. One river, the Sutra, is a particularly bountiful hunting ground. Situated in a long stretch of no-mans-land between two mid-sized villages, many a ship have met their ends there, dashed upon craggy rock face lining the shore. No one would be surprised by the disappearance, making those ships foolish enough to travel the waterway at night an especially vulnerable target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne short trip through the forest later and Kayva finds herself at the Sutra's stony shores. The jagged stones, shooting upwards from the water's edge, conceal her form well in the darkness of the night. From this vantage point she waits with a hunter's patience, discerning the value of each passing boat. An endless streak of dinky merchant vessels plague the the rough waters of the Sutra, polluting her hunting ground with their unsatisfying presence. As the night drags on, the number of ships begins to trickle down, eventually leaving the river empty of all activity save the occasional vessel. Lesser hunters would have jumped on these easy targets, content with their meager prize. Kayva was no lesser hunter. There was providence in patience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around 3 hours past midnight, her instincts pay off. A boat, far larger than the earlier ones, emerges from the darkness. A pair of etched in crossbones on the galley's black sail sends their message plain enough: they're pirates. At a glance, one might think them too dangerous a target, but Kayva knew that the element of surprise is all she needs. Once the ship passed by her hidden embankment, she begins her pursuit, diving into the icy, silver waters of the Sutra, the rough waters helping to cover her noisy entrance. She holds still, observing the boat for any sign of her sighting, but the boat continues its lazy pace. With a few powerful kicks Kayva propels herself forward, quickly reaching her target. Though obviously capable of simply smashing the ship with one quick motion, Kayva curiosity gets the better of her. She decides to investigate the ship first, intrigued by the illicit vessel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up, the captain's quarters. Located in the ships hind quarters, Kayva quite easily locates the ornate windows of his office. Placing her hands on the end of the ship, she concurrently utilizes a spell to lower her weight, allowing the massive elf to raise herself without bringing the stern crashing into the water. Peering in, she finds the scraggly-bearded captain passed out on his bed, with a busty whore on each side. A visible look of disgust paints her face as she imagines what debauchery these disgusting humans must have partaken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can mess with the idyllic scene, a loud groan escapes from Kayva's stomach. It seems that during her extensive hunt, she had forgotten to grab something to eat. Ever the improviser, she comes up with a plan in an instant. Utilizing her dream-weaving ability, she enters into the Captains dream, placing thoughts of an enemy attack. The nightmare successfully rouses the captain from his sleep, sending him flying from his seat in a rage. He rips his sword from the wall, holding the hilt with a death grip as he rushes onto the main deck to \"save\" his crew, leaving his \"companions\" behind. The remain sleeping on the bed, stuck in a deep slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two now isolated, Kayva decides to help herself to some meat snacks. Pressing her lips against the window sill, she lets her snake-like tongue loose. With great care it slowly glides across the room, carefully avoiding any furniture as it makes it way to the targets. Like an octopus grabbing its prey, the tongue wounds itself tightly around the whores, pressing the curvaceous forms together like a bundle of sticks. Now secure, her tongue violently snaps back, pulling the unfortunate women into her waiting gullet. After briefly savoring their salty bodies, she sends them to their end with a powerful gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger now satisfied, she drops back into the water, planning her next step. How does she want to collect the slaves?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m just as kind and tender-hearted as any normal size human or elf maiden. And I won\u2019t hesitate to defend myself. So Tiny, what are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lying down on the ground, Kayva made a spell for dreamweaving to get inside the man\u2019s dream. As she focused on her mind and spell, she fell asleep as well and got into the man\u2019s dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlace of the man\u2019s dream was somewhere in human town. Merchants shouting for their goods and foods to be sold in the market, children who are running here and there with their friends with joy, bars, ordinary houses but looked warm, crowds. Friendly atmosphere of humans were all gathered in his dream now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva was normal-sized human in the dream and wore clothes as well. Clothes were a little bit worn, but also providing the feeling of old, people\u2019s friendly mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was attracted by all of these things, forgetting what brought her inside the man\u2019s dream. Then she came up that she should do her work to make the man open his mind to her. In other one\u2019s dream, Kayva could find where the dreamer was. When she found him in the market, he was just wandering around enjoying the delighted noise and atmosphere of the place. He doesn't look like the one who was yelling and screaming in less than a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva approached to the man and talked to him. \u201cUmm.. hey! Don\u2019t you think we have seen each other before?\u201d she pretended to be not sure about it. The man answered \u201cumm.... I don't think so. Sorry..\u201d. She noticed that he was really shy when he answered to her. Obviously he is at the opposite side of the type that follows girl\u2019s trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found his response was cute and said \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fair enough.\u201d<br>\r\nThe man said \u201cWell then... can I go now?.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing\u201d Kayva said. She reminded him of where he is. \u201cThanks for saying that I am the best one among our kind.\u201d<br>\r\nThe man was really confused, saying \u201cUh... Excuse me?\u201d After that, Kayva revealed her sharp ear and said \u201cNow, do you recognize me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was surprised to see that. And slowly, he came up with things that he and Kayva experienced before getting into dream. Kayva said \u201cAlthough it was just a dream, I was glad to see the scene of your kind\u2019s lives, like we belong to different species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I doing now? What is all of this?\u201d He wondered and Kayva told him what is dreamweaving, and why she did this to him, and this is for making him trust that she is not hostile to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I don't know what to say, but... It was a good experience with you, and.,. I can say that you are not going to eat or crush me... uh.. right?\u201d <br>\r\nThe man answered while scratching his head. \u201cOf course not. Maybe it depends on how you behave for me?\u201d The man felt a little bit nervous, Kayva said \u201cJust a joke, no worries.\u201d Kayva made a spell again to get out of dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey woke up from the dream. The man felt this giant elven girl is nice one, since she didn't do anything while he was sleeping, despite that she had a chance.<br>\r\nKayva said \u201cNow you understand what I tried to do.\u201d The man said \u201cYes, totally.....! umm.. the most vivid dream I\u2019ve ever had. And I didn't expect this kind of magic is possible.\u201d<br>\r\nKayva smiled at him and he became shy again just like he did in the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad that I had a good time with you. But now I think I should really go now. It is late night and I should go home\u201d The man said. Kayva was worried about it and told him \u201cWell, I think it is not a good idea. You might not be safe with your size. Like if you ever get to meet big animals or dragons, it won\u2019t be good for you. Especially for dragons, I can handle against small ones, but big ones will be even trouble for me as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and continued her words, \u201cYou can stay with me, and I will go back to my place. If it is fine with you.\u201d The man thought a little bit and said, \u201cI think you are right, I will follow you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she lifted up the man, grabbing him tenderly, and started heading towards her place. And they arrived..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will keep you as toy until you become useless\u201d She said while giggling and pretending to be an evil girl. The man\u2019s face became pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he tried to run away from her but just a few seconds later, Kayva blocked the path by stomping the ground in front of him. The man said \u201co..oh...no....please.. this c..can\u2019t happen. Please j-just let me g-go.. I w..want to be  safe and l..want t..to liv..\u201d while he was stuttering. Even before the man finished his word. Kayva grabbed him and lifted him up stretching her arm up on the air as high as she can reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe view that I am providing you seems to be so beautiful isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kayva said. The man began to tremble his body while he was being so high and this giant elven girl could drop him onto ground whenever she wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she put him on her arm. Then he slipped down from upside to downside on Kayva\u2019s arm. Although it was a short time, he was afraid to fall onto ground meanwhile Kayva won\u2019t let him crash into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hold the man\u2019s legs with two fingers and the man was hanged upside down in front of Kayva\u2019s face. Then she said \u201cHmmm... I don't think you are funny one for me. You don't show me any kind of funny response. I think I can make you more useful by this....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head back a little bit then brought the man right above her mouth. Then she opened her mouth and pretended to put him inside her mouth. <br>\r\nThe man almost cried and yelled \u201cNoooooo! Please! I want to be alive and go home! Don\u2019t eat me! I can be your slave if you want! just don't kill me please please,,,\u201d with desperate and scared tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stopped what she was doing, moving him away from her mouth and put him on the ground. Kayva giggled and said \u201cThat was funny enough to satisfy my desire for fun. I am not going to eat you nor hurt you. Why would I do that?? I just needed someone who can play with me\u201d while she couldn't stop giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man still almost lost his entire consciousness even after he became safe. He was trembling and shaking while watching Kayva with the eyes which were filled with fear. Short time later, Kayva thought, \u2018Wait.. did I do too scary prank for him? I didn't mean to make him scared as much as this. It might have been too shocking for him I think..\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not a puckish one at all. But after spending long time being a giantess, she got nothing to enjoy. It was fair for her to be puckish sometimes as well.<br>\r\nBut still, she is the most merciful and kindest one even among normal sized elves. That is the reason why she got to recognize that this one was too excessive just for her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva reached out her hand carefully and slowly to the man not to make him frightened. The man trembled harder as he saw giant hand which was at least 2 times as big as the man\u2019s height was approaching to him. And he tried to move himself away from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva said \u201cLittle mate, I am sorry if my silly joke was too excessive. No.. I should say again.. it was too excessive for you to consider that as a joke. I just wanted to play with someone. I am not a threat to you. I didn't mean to make you be scared like this. You are completely safe now.\u201d in soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand reached to the man. She patted his back and tried to make him relieved.<br>\r\nHe gradually stopped trembling and took a deep breath to make himself be stable.<br>\r\nAfter the man was relieved, although still frightened by Kayva\u2019s size. He said <br>\r\n\u201cT..Thank you for s..showing me mercy..\u201d<br>\r\nKayva said \u201cno not at all. I shouldn\u2019t have done that kind of nasty things. I am still sorry and I should say thank you for that you are feeling safer now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kayva said \u201cYou can leave , you can stay here with me. Choice is yours. Don\u2019t feel pressure\u201d<br>\r\nWhile she felt a little bit saddened and the man noticed it.<br>\r\nThe man then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can imagine that some part of my stories changed into your flavor.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI.. I will stay here..! I..If I am staying with s..someone who showed me me..mercy, it is a good thing no doubt!\u201d The man said. Kayva felt like he considered her as if she was an evil goddess who gave him a chance to be alive. \u201cI didn't mean to harm you. It sounds like I really wanted to enjoy your taste. Just don't worry about it.\u201d Kayva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really ok about staying here with me?\u201d Kayva asked carefully, making the man feel that he could do whatever he wanted. \u201cYe.. yes. This is completely my decision. D...Dont worry! I enjoy w...walking around and feeling the na..nature of trees, song of bird, and quietness\u201d Meanwhile the man was worried, he answered in this way not to make this giant angry, since for him, he was completely in the panic until in less than a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock that he felt was still affecting him, the reason why he tried to maintain current \u2018stable\u2019 situation, not changing it too rapidly in front of that giant.<br>\r\nKayva couldn't be sure about his answer. But anyway, since it was his choice, and she will let him go whenever he wants, she answered \u201cAlright, if you feel in that way, you made me feel nice as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just sat there. Then the man asked, \u201cB.. By the way, have you re..really used humans as toys..?\u201d Being curious and trying to get to know about her. \u201cOf course not. It was just a part of joke\u201d Kayva answered. The man exhaled as he got to know that this girl is not as evil as he thought. \u201cAlthough I often wonder how humans taste like.\u201d She added one more sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt cold sweat was running on his body a little bit. Watching the man\u2019s nervous facial expression, Kayva said \u201cKidding, never. Even if I know the taste of your kind and it is on my favorite list, I won\u2019t take your kind as my meal\u201d, trying to be friendly with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing in this deep forest? I mean it is night and this forest might be dangerous if you ever get to encounter things like dragons, which I can handle easily for you though.\u201d Kayva asked it because she had experienced many years on this forest and knew the life of forest.<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to wan...wander around away further than normal place. Like.. I can think deeply without worries when nothing is bothering me.\u201d The man answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she assumed that he wanted something to refresh himself on his routine, she asked \u201cHave you ever seen our kind then?\u201d Since she haven\u2019t seen humans that much neither. The man answered \u201cUmm.. no not at all. Like.. unless I..I didn't recognize that you have s..sharp ears like those, I must have been th..thinking you are just big no...\u2018normal\u2019 human...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little bit weird touching her ears. \u201cWell then... I feel like you got a chance to feel those things that make you feel excited.\u201d<br>\r\nKayva said. \u201cAre you still afraid of me?\u201d she asked shortly, but asking in the mild way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man answered \u201cNo.... never..! umm... maybe..I am.. sorry I don\u2019t know how to answer\u201d. Kayva thought this man is still terrified by her, noticing it by his ambiguous and shuddering answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wanted to show him that he can trust her, she grabbed, lifted the man up and hugged into her chest gathering two hands on the spot where the man is hugged.<br>\r\nAt first, the man was nervous. Then short time later, he felt a little bit embarrased and thought \u2018Am I being cared by someone who is giant and other species? I don\u2019t know if she has another bad intentions. But I just feel relieved and treated well. I just want to be in this kind of mood.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva said \u201cIt doesn't matter how you feel about me, but one thing is sure, I won\u2019t harm you at all no matter what happens, I promise. Feel safe here\u201d while she showed warm smile to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lives of human was really more cruel than ones Elves can experience, despite that human\u2019s life is way shorter than Elves one. They often fight against each other, people who they trust like family or friends can be bad people or foe as well, and even in same community people can do nasty and rude things from small to large against others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally they are wasting their short lives by piling up their negative things on minds while the time is not enough even if someone\u2019s life is full of joy and good things. The man\u2019s fear was getting disappeared. Since the man had lived his life that is similar to others, but maybe a few hard times existed which might be minor for others but hurtful for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt that even though this giant elven girl met him for the first time in her life, she is showing him the real caring mind, trying to make scared counterpart by her feel safe. He felt breath of cry was coming up to his throat. Since even intellectual existence could be gentle like this, and the fact that his life was saved by that too. Tear started coming out of the man\u2019s eyes while he was thankful to Kayva and everything he held in his mind bursted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are kind and generous one to others, something I haven\u2019t experienced for a long time from others outside home. I recognized you in our world\u2019s way and thought my life would be ended today as soon as I encountered you, thinking you would do horrible things to me just for desire before you cut my breath. I am sorry for judging you without thinking about it. I am happy to survive and got to know there are still hopes that kind ones are around this world\u201d watching over Kayva\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said \u201cEverything is ok my little friend. I just want to say that you don't have to worry about anything, including the fears you showed me while I did silly pranks to you. You didn't do anything wrong, I did. You can put down whole heavy things down now. I got you, I got you. She caressed the man while he kept crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting moonlight in the middle of night, whole things in Auran got calmed.<br>\r\nThe man asked Kayva to let him be on ground and Kayva carefully put him down slowly, grabbing him with two hands tenderly before she release him.<br>\r\nHe stopped sniffling gradually and she waited until he finally finished it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he seemed to calm down himself, she watched the man and smiled. \u201cIs it better now?\u201d Kayva asked. And the man smiled back as well and nodded slightly. \u201cYes.. Thank you. And... I can say that I am not afraid of you anymore. Actually you are the best one...!\u201d the man answered. <br>\r\n \u201cThen.... are we friends from now on??\u201d Kayva said it to make the atmosphere bright and refreshed. The man answered \u201cYes, of course you can...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva asked \u201cWhat is your name if it is ok for you?\u201d The man answered \u201cMy name is Jonas! It will be easy to remember.\u201d <br>\r\nShe repeated the name \u201cJonas.\u201d She said while memorizing it with her heart and mind. \u201cIt is mild and gentle name, I love it, and I already memorized it, don't worry!\u201d Then Jonas asked, \u201cUmm, then.. it is my turn I think! What is your name my g..giant... elven friend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was asking, he tried to call her in friendly way, but using the word \u2018giant\u2019 sounded a little bit weird. Then Kayva giggled and said it is ok and funny.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Kayva, do you think it is easy for you to remember Jonas?\u201d She answered, being curious how it sounded like for him. He was in thought for a short moment without answering. Then he answered \u201cKayva, your name sounds mythological and mysterious, but also friendly. I like your name as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva was joyful and enjoying this moment since she really didn't have chance to talk with human being deeply. Although she occasionally talked with her kind\u2019s people, not with human beings. Since they always get scared by her whenever they watched her and ran away, or they are hostile and tried to attack her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny plans for this night?\u201d Kayva asked since she got nothing to do after finishing her meals but just wandering around forest. Jonas said \u201cI am completely free now. We can come up with what to do!\u201d They talked a little bit on this topic and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A young elf maiden with long yellow-bronze hair was walking towards him. She had no clothes on, but the fog seemed to collect around her private areas, protecting them from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cSeymour. Do you have a name or just a very fine figure?\u201d Seymour asked. The elf smiled, \u201cWhy thank you. My people know me as Kayva; though among your people, I\u2019m commonly known as \u2018The Twilight Huntress\u2019.\u201d Seymour stepped back in shock, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not possible. The Twilight Huntress is just a legend.\u201d \u201cDragons and elves were supposed to be legends, but both races existed.\u201d Kayva said stepping closer and smiling, \u201cBut if you need proof, I can easily give it to you.\u201d She was then enveloped in a cloud of green smoke. A gust of wind blew the smoke into Seymour\u2019s face. The smoke stung his eyes, making them water. When his vision cleared he could see Kayva\u2019s gigantic ankle at his eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva giggled before saying, \u201cI think this should remove all doubt. Now don\u2019t go thinking that waking up will save you, I\u2019ve already found you back in reality.\u201d She knelt down so she could see Seymour better, who was pale with fear. \u201cNow don\u2019t be too afraid Seymour. I may hunt your kind, but I like to think of myself as a fair person. I\u2019m going to give you a chance to get away free as a bird.\u201d Kayva said soothingly. \u201cWhat kind of chance?\u201d Seymour asked nervously. \u201cJust a few simple challenges, three challenges to be exact. Should you succeed you win your freedom, but should you fail even once\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sure you can guess.\u201d Kayva replied, grinning mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeymour wasn\u2019t sure what he should do. He always heard that elves were an honorable race that didn\u2019t break their word, but Kayva wasn\u2019t exactly a normal elf. He decided to take the chance; Kayva\u2019s challenges were the only way that guaranteed a possibility of living through this ordeal. \u201cVery well, what are these challenges?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\nThe first challenge was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At her spell\u2019s command twelve-foot tall walls of rose plants rose from the ground. \u201cA simple maze. I hope you don\u2019t mind roses; I just like them a great deal. The smell, the delicate petals, I think they\u2019re nature\u2019s perfect flower.\u201d Kayva said as she set Seymour down in the center of the maze. \u201cRoses are a very fine flower.\u201d He agreed. Truthfully he didn\u2019t care what plant Kayva used for the maze, all that mattered to him right now was surviving her challenges. \u201cNow, your challenge is to find your way out of the maze before time runs out.\u201d Kayva said as an hourglass appeared in her hand. \u201cReady\u2026 Go!\u201d she said turning the hourglass over then disappearing in a cloud of purple smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeymour dashed madly through the maze. Apparently Kayva did indeed want him to have a chance since the maze did nothing to hinder him. Eventually he came to a long and wide corridor, and saw the exit at the other end. He started walking towards it then saw it was starting to close, meaning his time was running out. He ran as fast as he could then dove through the opening just before it closed. Seymour got onto his knees and started brushing the dirt off his short when he heard someone clapping. He looked up and saw Kayva, at human size, leaning against a tree applauding. \u201cVery nice Seymour. That dive at the end was spectacular.\u201d She said before helping up to his feet.<br>\r\nThe next challenge?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she snapped there was a bright flash of light, when Seymour could see again he was on a gigantic chess board. Either the board was huge or he had been shrunk since Kayva was gigantic again, lying on her stomach across the board. There were several tiny flashes as the pieces appeared; to Seymour these pieces were life sized. The black pieces on Kayva\u2019s side were like the sculpted pieces Seymour was used to playing with, but the white pieces on his side seemed almost too lifelike. Since no king piece appeared around him, Seymour took its place, but he still couldn\u2019t get over how his pieces looked so real. \u201cYou like them? I\u2019ve always enjoyed creating my own humans in dreams.\u201d Kayva asked noticing his stares. \u201cThese are actual people?\u201d Seymour asked in surprise. \u201cTo an extent, these pieces are designed to follow your orders through the game. I doubt your games back home allowed you to be part of the action.\u201d Kayva said smiling, \u201cWhite goes first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeymour started by sending the pawn in front of his queen forward one square. Then Kayva made the same move, except she moved her pawn forward two squares. \u201cIs there any particular reason my pieces are so\u2026 alive?\u201d Seymour asked. \u201cThe only difference is how they\u2019re captured. If mine are captured they\u2019ll disappear when you order a piece to that square.\u201d Kayva replied. Seymour was curious what would happen when one of his pieces were captured. \u2018I\u2019d better find out now with a pawn rather than later with a more powerful piece.\u2019 He thought before ordering the pawn he moved last turn forward again. When Kayva took the pawn and replaced it with her own, she didn\u2019t set it to the side as Seymour expected. Instead she dropped the human chess piece into her mouth and swallowed it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These ones won\u2019t actually kill or hurt you, but if you receive a \u2018fatal injury\u2019 you\u2019ll \u2018die\u2019 and lose the challenge.

He encountered many puzzles along the way; such as doors that would only open if the colored squares that decorated them were arranged in the right pattern, and a floor tiled with stones with elfin runes and the only safe way across was to step on the stones that spelled Kayva\u2019s name.<br>\r\nAfter evading several more traps and solving numerous puzzles Seymour made it to a large room. At the back he saw an altar with a large purple gem. His first instinct was to rush for the gem, but he remembered what Kayva said about a temple guardian. Instead he carefully stepped into the enormous room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Seymour entered the stone door closed behind him.

He made his move, placing a pawn one square forward then waited for Kayva\u2019s move.

There is no reason for us to wait, lets go and see what might be at her place.\u201d Kayva said. \u201cNow?\u201d Varon asked as Kayva lowered her hand. \u201cYes, now.

Varon carefully lifted the book from its hiding place then returned the bed to its original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva sat outside, patiently waiting for her brother. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d she asked eagerly when he finally emerged from the tree house. \u201cI found this,\u201d Varon answered holding out the book, \u201cIt may be your master\u2019s journal. If so, it may hold the reason she ventured away after the accident, and how we can set your life in the direction you want to go.\u201d \u201cI know where I want my life to go: I want to have a child; whether by returning to my original stature or by finding others with this affliction, or what have you.\u201d Kayva said. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got in here.\u201d Varon said before opening the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a journal, everything in here was written by Jassami\u2019s own hand,\u201d Varon said as he scanned through the pages of the book, \u201cThis might be something, this entry is from the day after your accident. <i> In many ways it pains me to write today, after what happened to my young apprentice Kayva. I had no idea that my experiment would go so askew. Now she stands nearly as tall as the trees, naked as the day she was born. I know not why the gods chose for this event to occur, but I owe it to my apprentice to at the very least find a way to reverse my mistake or a way to ease her transition to a new life. I set out for my quest at dawn, I will return once I\u2019ve found the secret I seek.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe returned so she must have found something.

The dragon elder was most helpful, she told me-</i>\u201d \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d Kayva asked. \u201cIt\u2019s these strange words, I can read the letters but I have no idea what they say.\u201d Varon explained, \u201cWait there\u2019s more words I can read beneath them. <i>I wrote what the dragon elder told me in the ancient language of the mystics using elf runes.

It was soon clear that, as her master said, it was indeed a sensitive subject. When Varon finished Kayva spoke, \u201cI think I see how this might work. But I\u2019ll need the help of another elf or a human.\u201d \u201cHey Kayva. I know you\u2019ve talked about having a child for several years, but have you ever thought about which gender you\u2019d want your child to be?\u201d Varon asked.

I doubt it. I may as well be living in the middle of the forest, no one notices me. Why because I\u2019m too scared to do anything worth noticing.

She screamed in fright when she saw that it was a massive hand. After her scream, the hand beckoned to her, to get her to come outside. Savina wasn\u2019t sure what to do, but decided it was probably wisest to go out rather than make who or whatever owned that hand come in and get her. She went out her back door and wandered past the edge of the forest and was amazed at who it was that beckoned her out. \u201cMiss Kayva? This is, unexpected. To what do I owe the honor of your summons?\u201d Savina said gazing up in awe at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not nobility Savina; you can talk to me like any other elf.\u201d Kayva replied with a good natured smile. \u201cSorry, did you want me for something?\u201d Savina asked. No matter what Kayva said she was still amazed, Kayva was a legend amongst the elves and she was right here speaking to her, a loner that barely anyone knew was alive. \u201cWell, I was using my Dreamweaving magic some time ago, and I saw some of your memories.\u201d Kayva said. Savina felt disappointment settling in; she didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s what brought me to you.

I\u2019m an adult among our people, so I can\u2019t be adopted. Not that anyone would probably notice or care.\u201d Savina said, turning away to hide her shame. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean like that Savina.\u201d Kayva said quietly. Savina turned back to Kayva, an expression of confusion on her face. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is\u2026 to take you into my womb and eventually\u2026 eventually give birth to you.

She had never bothered to measure herself exactly; but knew well enough that an adult human was about as tall as her longest finger. Certainly at first the experience had been enthralling; she had felt empowered, and excited to use that power to help people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then they had become afraid; her master unable to turn her back. Despite all assurances of her good intentions, Kayva had eventually found it best to just leave. She had been wandering the great forest for years now, completely alone except for in her dreams. Tonight did not look like it would be any different, she figured with a defeated sigh; her long tapered ears drooping down from where they protruded from her unkempt mane of fiery red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrodding onward she looked up to spot the massive tree growing in the crook of the hills she approached, a smile finally gracing her lips as her angular green eyes took it in; making her feel for a moment almost normal. The positively titanic dragon trees were rare even in the all but endless great wood; but Kayva knew by heart where many of them were. They were one of few things large enough for a dragon to roost in; and large enough to grow fruit worth their time, and by extension, for Kayva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling up to the tree with a saunter in her step she reached up to grab one of the, to her, low hanging fruit; an ovoid, ribbed thing with a skin of mottled gold. Swallowing the saliva that had built up in anticipation of her first good meal in a week, Kayva opened her mouth to take a bite when the crunch she had been expecting preceded her doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking she lowered her hand and glanced about, hearing what sounded like chewing from the far side of the tree. <i>Wonderful,</i> she thought to herself, <i>another godsforsaken dragon.</i> She rarely bumped into them; since they were oft out hunting at night, and even then most were amicable, but some had decided to fight her over \"their\" fruit, and the scarred clawmark down her freckled cheek was proof enough that they were trouble even for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva, however, was not about to be scared away from a meal. Setting the fruit down and clenching her fists, she rounded the tree, ready to smack the stupid lizard square in the nose, but stopped with a yelp of alarm at what she found instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man leaning up against the tree likewise jumped, dropping the fruit he was holding as he beheld the woman accosting him. \"W-whoa, what...\" He exclaimed, forcing his back up against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva's hands fell to her side as she stepped back, dumfounded, \"uh-uhmm...\" was all she could manage. She stared at him stupidly; taking in a thin, athletic frame; not entirely well hid by the silken green trousers and open-fronted vest he wore, baring his chest and abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-eye's up here miss,\" he joked, moving his own from the shapely, freckled, totally naked woman that had appeared so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the elfess' gaze traced across his pointy chin and it's small patch of golden hairs, past his lips and nose and finally met his blue eyed gaze, her next breath heavy as an electric tingle ran up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own ears giving an excited flick, the male elf runs a hand through his short shock of golden hair and smiles more naturally, \"Umm...this is unexpected. U-umm, my name is Telthis, umm, miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I err, ah, umm, Kayva!\" She finally managed to reply, shaking her head, suddenly so very conscious of her frazzled hair and its cargo of leaves and broken twigs, of her scar and her nudity, \"M-my name is Kayva...I...you're...big, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, an astute observation, Kayva,\" the man replied, \"I umm...it looks like you've been this way longer than me...are you...stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course I am! My master tried this stupid spell and...I've been wandering the woods scaring off everyone for...\" She gave a small whimper, \"...too long, far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh hey, now, it's alright...\" Telthis responded with a start, eyes full of worry as he reached out a hand, cupping her chin and running a thumb gently across her scar, tilting her head back a little to meet her gaze; \"...I...\" He began, but Kayva interrupted him.</span></div></div>",

She paused awkwardly and fumbled words; trying to remember how to speak quite right outside of her own head, but in the end managed. Telthis listened intently to her story, his arms slowly tightening protectively around her as she related her ordeal; surviving in a wilderness not really up to the task of supporting her, naked and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some tale,\" He says softly as she finishes, \"You're something else to tough it out so long, I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" she said with a blush, turning her head slightly away; trying to keep a handle on herself but not sure how well she was succeeding. He was the first man she'd seen in years, and his attractiveness, she was sure, was not simply a play of the light or her company-starved mind. Still, she knew so little about him, and fought down the growing fascination, even desire, brewing within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you are you...stuck like this too?\" Kayva asked curiously.</span></div></div>",

And finding those kind of sweet fruits requires her to put more effort on it than when she hunts for creatures that provide meat like Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayva said, \u201cThis is literally masterpiece.. How did you get these kinds of fruits? I mean they are everywhere but elusive. It takes more time for me to get them than just hunting.

For me they are the most delicious ones that I have ever tried.\u201d As soon as Zanika finished her talking, Kayva\u2019s face became shocked and frightened. \u201cWha-What? No way! I have never tried them. And I won\u2019t do it in the future neither. They are just different species but they also think, they feel emotion, they speak, and they know what life means to them. It is even beyond barbaric to be honest for you to eat them..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZanika laughed and answered \u201cCome on I was just kidding haha, although I don't care about them much, I don't eat them neither. I just wanted to check out how \u2018barbaric\u2019 you are as a warming up\u201d Kayva sighed with relaxed mood, and gave Zanika a little bit smile too. Then Kayva\u2019s stomache growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just forgot what was our final purpose. Sorry about it. Let\u2019s enjoy \u2018small\u2019 snack as the giant elves who are isolated from others\u201d Both of them laughed. Kayva said thanks to Zanika and started putting fruits into her mouth. Zanika just watched her while holding a grip of fruits in her hand. Kayva paused precious fruit buffet for a moment and asked Zanika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, by the way, have you ever talked with someone since you got big like this? For me, everyone just ran away from me. Even if I told them that I am a gentle and mild elven girl just like normal ones, they didn't even try to listen to me then just ran away...\u201d<br>\r\nZanika answered \u201cNeither have I. Since I have experienced whole things that you said, I havent even try to interact with them. Especially for me, I don't even remember if I was even normal size. So I don't have any senses or shortcut to get through trying it.\u201d Kayva became a little bit gloomy, but shortly the bad mood is gone, as she met another her \u2018normal\u2019 friend and had gorgeous fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished their snack, they just looked up the night sky of Auran, full of shining stars and galaxys. There was no cloud, no fog, but just clear sky. Nothing they have to talk for now, since as a giant elven, two girls just enjoyed meal and were chilling themselves watching the night sky while feeling mild wind on their face.<br>\r\nZanika said \u201cI love this kind of moment, plenty of food, good landscape, no anxiety.\u201d \u201dExactly\u201c Kayva answered, short but firm agree to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring peaceful moment, they heard that something was rustling in the grass near them. Seems that it was only one. \u201cWhat do you think that is?\u201d Zanika said. \u201cWe can check it out since it is just one or two of them.

Despite being over 200 years old, she was a teen in her people's standars. \"Immortality seems so dull if there is nothing interesting to do\" she thought again, not noticing that she was walking towards the edge of the forest in the south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder\" she said to herself as she noticed where she was \"what would happen if I venture to the outside world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves didn't interfere with the rest of the world, nor did they have relations with the younger races. Being the oldest race created by the gods They considered themselves superior to the rest of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla however had always been curious to know what was going on beyond the edge of the forest, as none of the little people ever entered their woods out of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla steped out of the forest and approached the shore of the great river that divided the Elven realm from the rest of the world<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed doubtful for a moment, but then a smile came to her lips \"Who cares\" she said as she stepped into the river, which was very deep for the little people, but only came to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the other side of the river she decided to head towards a village of hobbits that was located not far from here, she knew where it was for at nights she would climb to the highest trees and stare at the lights of the little village, always wondering how the little people lived their lives, and now she was about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile there was a conmotion on the village for Hobbits rarely received visits from the other races and three strangers had come today, two men and a dwarf.<br>\r\nThe leader of the small group was a knight of the sacred order in the Gondor, the mightiest and noblest kingdom of men. The other man was a barbarian from the wild lands in the far north and the dwarf came from the mines in the great mountains in the south<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have come all the way here looking for a companion of adventure\" said the knight to the hobbits \"The great sorcerer of my kingdom has said that here we would find someone that would help us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to continued but was interrupted as one of the hobbits turned pale and screamed \"g..gg..giant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeyla went to her knees as she reached the edge of the village and smiled gently \"How cute\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthere was a general panic as hobbits started to run. Keyla was a gentle creature, as all her people were, but she couldn't help but feel playful after seeing their reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"awww. are you frightened??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted when a voice called to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall not harm any of these innocents\" said the knight as he took his swords and stood between her and the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shortest was the dwarf, who had a long red beard and red hair. He carried a big ax as a weapon and all his body was covered in a heavily looking armour. One of the humans  was a young man in his late  20's, he had long blond hair \"which was extremely rare among her kind\" and clothings that seemed to be made for the harsh cold in the far north. The last man, who seemed to be the leader of the group, was a man in his early 30's He had short brown hair, wore a nice dark blue uniform with a symbol in the chest and a long black cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer people never had the need to use weapons, as their size and magical abilities were enough to protect themselves from any attack from the outside world, so it was the first time in her life that Kayla saw them \"They must think I am a threat\" she thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the legends of my people are true then\" whispered the barbarian to the dwarf \"Elves really do exist on this part of the world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf answered \"Apparently so... but I thought they never left their forest realm across the great river\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla was aware that they really were not a threat to her but decided to play just a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such brave little people...aren't you afraid of me??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight answered \"I am a knight of the sacred order from the great kingdom of Gondor, and I took an oath to defend the helpless against any threat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kayka giggled  \"A knight... even among my people we have heard tales of the brave knights\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible\" asked with confussion the knight \"As far as I know no one has ever entered the woodland realm of your kind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla laughed and said \"The trees, the birds, the wind can talk to us\" she explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really necesary??\" she said as she pointed at the sword the knight held \"I thought Knights knew how to treat a lady... if the stories are true, of course, of the gallant knights in the human kingdoms...I know more than a few elven maidens have whispered dreamily as we heard the strange tales of the brave knights\". She caressed her long black hair and sat on the ground \"I am not here to harm anyone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight seemed doubtful for a moment and the seathed his sword, his two companions fallowed his example but remained alert<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me my lady\" he said as he bowed to her \"But one must always be prepared for anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla asked \"What are the three of you doing here, so far from your homelands\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf answered \"We are on a mission, and were told by a great sorcerer that on this adventure we would need the help of a fourth companion, a hobbit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
