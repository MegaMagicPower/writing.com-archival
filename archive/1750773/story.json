Well, that is not true at all, but doing dark stuff at night just has the right atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs cliche as it was, it was in fact a dark and stormy night, but the winds were mostly calm in the forest where Marie was. It was a sight, a teenage girl, almost boringly average in most respects such as hair, figure, and clothing, alone in the forest at night with a stormy background. The only odd thing about her was the dirty and beat up sack she carried on her back. Many would say that she was incredibly unsafe right then. But Marie would disagree, she had never felt more safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she stumbled upon the tree that she had heard about, an old willow that would seem more at home at a swamp than the forest right outside of town. The bark was full and black, leaves were a color in between jungle green and hospital gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie took out a straw doll, with a face too dark to see. She held it up to the tree, and then with a mallet and nail produced from her bag, started to drive it into the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Whack* *Whack* *<b>WHACK</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third strike the doll was stuck to the tree. On the other side of town, Adam was startled awake, by a pain in his heart, accompanied by the crash of thunder. Almost instantly, the pain went away and he collapsed back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the tree, Marie took out an identical second doll, and what she did with it right then is unknown to everyone except her and the willow tree. </span></div></div>",

The response you got was wolf-whistle, which shocked you even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got onto the football field, where the rest of cheerleaders was. You need to wake up, this can't be real! They all approach you and the cheerleaders who basically kidnapped you here. You don't want to be here, you're looking for a way out, but there is none.<br>\r\n\"Amanda, what is wrong with you?\" The girls curiously look at you, with you being slightly below their eye level.<br>\r\n\"She's fine!\" Jocelyn exclaimed. \"Let's begin with our training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you partake in forming a pyramide against your will, something feels wrong. Brianna climbs up and stands on your hand, but something is unbalanced and all of the pyramide comes crashing down.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asks the head cheerleader, coming your way.<br>\r\n\"Amanda couldn't hold me up... high... enough?\" Brianna starts angrily but then slows down in confusion. She seems taller. All of them seem to be taller. A lot. You're on the breast level with all of them.<br>\r\n\"Amanda, what's wrong?\" Head cheerleader grabs you, as you see yourself shrinking further down. You just want this all to end.<br>\r\n\"She's shrinking, girls!\" Jocelyn shouts in excitement, as you're now looking far up to their faces, about half their height. You can't wake up. This is a nightmare. Why do you deserve this? You're beginning to cry.<br>\r\n\"Hey Amanda, you okay?\" Brianna asks you, and as she puts her big hand on your small shoulder, you feel yourself shoot downwards, swallowed by your clothes. All the cheerleaders start talking between themselves, as Jocelyn pulls you out of your normal-sized clothes.<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, looks like we've got a doll in our cheerleading team!\" All the girls start laughing, as you try to do your bezt to cover up your naked body with the one hand you have free, seeing how Jocelyn holds you up by your other one. You're crying and feeling totally humiliated. Jocelyn puts you onto her other hand and commands you to cheer for them.<br>\r\nYou're feeling an unknown force move your doll-sized body and make you shout, as you're crying at the same time. All of the cheerleaders are laughing at you and you can't do anything with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you finally manage to wake up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Holding your trembling hands up for examination, they look different now. Slender and refined, the nails tipped with a perfect pink gloss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at how girly it looks.

The contents clatter over the surface spinning in every direction. A purse landing with a chiming clunk, as the coins inside shift. Your eyes are drawn to the lipstick that shouldn't be there. Looking at the mirror, and your reflection you decide the lipstick is the least of your problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep part of your mind tells you that you're cute. The changes started when you found that note. A note you dismissed, suddenly feels a lot more significant. You find it scrunched up and unfurl it, spreading it out on the counter top.

Certainly not girly girl. A hope that this is some kind of trick... or a delusion fills you with hope... a faint hope, but you need to find out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing nervously towards the door, you listen intently, for approaching footsteps. Despite not hearing anything, you still feel unbearably nervous, as you unbutton your blouse. The idea that the illusion, the delusion will shatter if you examine it closely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping the blouse away, you cup your new bust. It's warm in your hands, the nipples pressing into your palms, and heavy too. You hadn't expected that. You hadn't expected to your shoulders to feel lighter when you cradled you bust. Letting 'the girls' go, you feel them shift and settle into position. The pull at your shoulders confirming their reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/468e1c16297396f918094e87ad2f02e2/tumblr_pel1mteqzg1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/468e1c162973...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your shoulders, you set them in motion. They move like they're real. Although the angle is off-putting, it's easier to watch them shimmy and sway in the mirror. A smirking smile forming, as you still rather like the look, even though it's your bust you're admiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you sigh, wishing you could do more than admire that body. But... well, you aren't really equipped to do much. Your skirt bulge-free, apart from the rounder, fuller arse your hands keep running over in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sigh turns, to a gasp, as your hot breath drifts over your chest. Your nipples stiffening in protest, it takes you a moment to realise it's your own breath that caused it to happen. A laugh of relief spilling from your lips, as the mystery of the stiffening nips is solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acoustics of the bathroom, or your relief makes it sound higher, girly, ... more a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggling laughter cuts off, as you feel like another slice of your past life has been cut away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of your eye, you see a difference in the note. New words have appeared at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be embarrassed, it IS fun. Don't be ashamed of your body... Embrace it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers run over the words, as if expecting them to smear, the ink must still be wet. But, it remains streak free, the new addition as dry as the original message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think about it, you feel... something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingle... an itch... beneath your nipples. They crave your attention, the need to be mauled, tweaked, twisted building. You try cupping them, covering them from the chill bathroom air. But it isn't enough, just intensifying the frustration, you tighten your grip. A little relief, granted, but you feel the need for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the temptation, you allow, you force your hands away. It feels like a wrench to fight the urge you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in punishment, the tingling itch intensifies. You watch shocked into immobility, horrified, as they grow. Your crinkly nipples spreading wider, growing in sensitivity and size. Your breathing coming in ragged gasps, as it pulses in waves, swelling a little larger with each moment. You shake your head in denial, as it takes a few moments to realise... It's not just your nipples... Your bust is swelling larger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat 'super curvy' <i>threat?... promise?</i>, seems to be coming true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/7170c287d71f0590a7e2580603c1cdb9/tumblr_pel1mteqzg1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/7170c287d71f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts race, as you think about the rest of it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you going to be a 'girly girl'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does 'girly girl', actually mean?<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nWill you love pink?<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nWill you be submissive, and sweet?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to work out what it means to you.

Humiliatingly, not a fair comparison with your own, and turn to face the bank of lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe items you'd scattered over the counter surface now visible inside the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"C'mon Evie.... we don't have a routine without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the centre of the display....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the main draw....\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like a wall of cajoling voices driving you towards the door, towards joining them. A sense of pride, of importance, of necessity fills your thoughts. As the bustiest, naturally, you'll draw the most attention, and be at the centre. They'll all benefit from the attention directed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much to hide the smile on your face, you pull the jumper over your head. It's a squeeze to hide the girls under it. Your hips shimmy from side to side, as you pull it lower. Until it reaches the short cheerleader skirt.</span></div></div>",

You whirl around to find only empty stalls. Whipping back around, she's still in the mirror. A mocking smile now spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new world.\" Marie says with a broad, gloating smile. You still jump when she puts her hand on your shoulder, as you feel it, too. Instinctively repelled, you brush it away with your new crimson clawed hands only to discover it's not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she senses your distaste and removes it with a patronising smirk on her face, of an insincere apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world of back-stabbing bitches, and snide compliments...\" she pauses until your eyes meet in the glass, \"Eva E-cups...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands slipping around your torso. Seeing them in the mirror, she cradles your bust. Her thumbs brushing back and forth across your nips. Looking down, as your breathing becomes more rapid and shallower, your excitement obvious, you see only your heavy bust and deep, deep cleavage. Maria's hands not visible in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice whispering inches from your ear, \"Obviously, you're a bigger girl than that... but it rhymes, and it's memorable for those who're jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, kissing your earlobe, \"Perhaps you prefer <i>'Udders' </i>Jenkins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as she stops her teasing caresses. Hands withdrawing, you see them either side of your head, as she's taken a step backwards. You resist the urge to glance to either side, knowing you'll see nothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need some stabilisers... some help getting your footing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain speared through Eva's temple, as a flood of memories flashed in. Adam was still buried deep, and felt just as real, fully in control. But a parallel set of memories intruded. She could recall events from Eva's life, her battle not to be dismissed as merely eye-candy. To be taken seriously, academically, or in sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her athletics attempts failed, with her bust being too obtrusive for most sports. She recalled the oppressive crowds that came for her try-outs, so much male attention she didn't want to, couldn't handle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff the sports field, the looks were obvious, leering and deeply uncomfortable. The 'compliments' just as depressing and crude, lewd and beyond threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life as Eva was objectification from the boys, and dismissal, contempt and envy from the girls. Adam felt a wave of sympathy for the most isolated new student in school before remembering he was her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, it's your big night.\" Mirror Marie whispered, \"Prom night.\" Before vanishing from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restroom door crashed open, and a gaggle of chattering students entered. Captivated by their own conversation they were blind to Eva until they almost crashed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-cups...\" was offered as recognition, or apology for her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low flurry of giggling coming from a couple of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preening...\" another snidely offered, as if that were a crime. Eva's anger flashed higher, it wouldn't hurt so much, if Gracie hadn't put so much effort into her appearance too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/70/9d/d2709d343de312a2fec17f7a0d10c443.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/70/9d/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Adam, Gracie was your gold standard. A girl you wanted to date, but with an aura that seemed to surround her. She was too intimidating, reaching for her would only earn you sneering disappointment, and burnt fingers for reaching for someone so hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though you couldn't forget, or forgive her shallow insecurity. Her eyes going to your bust, lingering their, contempt on her face, but a hint of envy in her eyes. She wanted some of what you had... if not a full load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, was Jill, in her LBD, and just as impressive and intimidating as ever. She casually bumped you aside, with a hip check. Totally unnecessary, given the space available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/bf/e3/54bfe3a6ca1597eefcf334c663d07049.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/bf/e3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lacked Gracie's confidence, and arrogance, but sensing your attention, after she forced her way forward, she fakes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/85/ed/0585ed7227a17460e317020ac8d5c7dd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/85/ed/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not have certain 'charms' but at least I can tell what shoes I'm wearing, without having to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter felt more like cackling, as they finished their preening, and left you alone once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opens once more, you get a blast of music coming from the main hall. Knowing you can't stay here the entire night, you straighten up, and square your shoulders, ready to face the world. Unfortunately, that just makes your bust almost leap out of the dress, and makes you too aware of them, and even Marie recent teasing attention.</span></div></div>",

Only now sure that he's in the right toilet, so surely you must be in the wrong one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calm isn't helped by the way you grasp at your skirt.

Not emotional feelings, that wasn't a problem for now. No, it was just how different this body felt. Starting up from the bottom, there were some things like smaller feet. That was to be expected with an overall smaller body. Your legs were shaped different, and you could tell from the way the wind felt on your naked legs that any sort of body hair you had before this insanity was long gone. Then your crotch\u2026 something you really didn't want to describe. The words that described it were empty and flat, something that no man, no matter the disease, should have to admit about his groin. Flat also summed up your stomach and waist pretty darn well. Something that took me a moment to notice was the incline that your waist created as it became your hips. It was an hourglass figure, a distinctly girly trait that would have any male high school student salivating if he caught a glimpse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of things that would have high school boys salivating; you had two more, your breasts. Now, you were a guy of all work and little to no play.  You knew absolutely nothing about our pals across the gender pool, but you knew that this chest of yours was nothing to scoff at. You have heard girls gossiping among themselves, wishing for a larger chest size. This would be what they would wish for. Maybe it was because they were unfamiliar and your mind was over exaggerating their size, but the seemed bigger than what should be required. This was especially true given your less than tall, heck, less than average statute. They messed with your balance horribly, and it wasn't good that you noticed that even when you were standing. Who knows what chaos they would wreck on your movement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one good thing you could take away from visual assessments (something that  you will admit took longer than it should have) of your chest, it was that, no matter how freaked out about/emphasized their size, even you could tell that, while unusual, their size wasn't physically impossible, nor was it anatomically impossible. In fact, in all honesty, their weren't anything truly insane, even though  you were short, it was still completely possible for me to have these\u2026 things at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final straw about all of this was how you were dressed. You were in a extremely revealing outfit that showed off your massive chest and youthful legs. It was extremely erotica and made you hyper aware of your femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dicandiafashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/women-s-sleepwear-2013.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dicandiafashion.com/wp-conten...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your mom calling for you to come downstairs to get ready, what do you do?</span></div></div>",

Even now lying on his... No! her back the girls were impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding women shuffled backwards, as Adam's gender reversal was clear. Sitting upright, she took in all the differences. Her arms were skinny and useless, topped with slender fingers. Those fingers ran down her flank, not wishing to brush against that bust. As if touching the girls would somehow make them more real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath caught, as she felt the swell of her hips. Images filled her mind of the size of ass she now had too. Sitting upright on her knees, Adam took in her long back hair brushing back and forth against her shoulders. Cradling her bust as best she could, it filled and overflowed her too small hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA firm push from behind send her crashing forward. Only a simple pillow cushioned her impact from landing on her tits. Unsure how sensitive they were, Adam was relieved, then shocked.

Though none of the other girls appeared in the least surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam barely had time to squeak in surprise, as the four girls descended. One taking each of her arms, pulling it straight and holding it down. Wriggling as much as you could, was enough to lift your shoulder an inch or two, before being pulled back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the other two girls that really shocked you. As you felt blows rain down on your rump. A rapid fire spanking with one girl for each of your expansive new ass cheeks. Shrieking and thrashing, the surprise turned into arousal, and finally pain as the blows continued. Humiliatingly the pain turned back into arousal as you felt your ass warming with the attention. Tears flowed freely, as you begged and whimpered, pleaded and threatened in the brief respites between assaults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs kicked wildly, but hit nothing. Eventually even that futile outlet was blocked as one of the girls sat atop them. Another brief break from the humiliating bare handed spanking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, she only confirmed she was blessed with an ass that was as generous as her chest... her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the wardrobe, Adam surged to her feet. Desperately she went over to get something to wear... Anything to wear, as long as she wore more than the silky dressing gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping the door open, she saw the cavernous interior. All filled with clothes that'd fit her new body.

She was left without any distractions from her new body, new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to the bed, Evie collapsed onto the bed. Her bust bouncing heavily, painfully from the sudden movement. Instinctively, her hands went to cradle the girls, and stop their movement. Looking away from the open wardrobe, and the array of clothes there. Her eyes settled on the picture on the bedside table. It was one of herself, a past forming for Evie parallel to Adam's memories, she frowned as she took it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked cute. Oh, Hell, no!

And one more check between her legs confirmed, there was some nothingness; not really but she was definitely no longer a man where it counts and something very female was sitting on her chest now. And now she could see that also her room was quite different now: Before she didn't notice pink wall (which is quite likely)\u2026<br>\r\nNow she had to react to her mother\u2019s calling and she tried to sit up, where she found out that her whole body gravity and balance is different now to what she used to have as Adam\u2026<br>\r\nOf course she did not feel any kind of comfort in her new female body and skin.<br>\r\nNow she also realized once more that whatever she is wearing was very much not the boxers and loose wife-beater she went to bed in yesterday night. Her underwear now was tight and light and a bit form fitting. Her new longer hair was tickling the back of her neck, and she stretched her arm so she could brush it \u2026 away\u2026out of her face and view!<br>\r\nThere was also a bounce on her chest.<br>\r\nHaving the pressure from her mom she now finally got out of bed and ran over to a mirror that I was absolutely sure did not exist before. The room was almost identical to your old one, except the pink paint.<br>\r\nAgain what she saw in the mirror nearly gave me a heart attack. Standing there nothing else but a girl.<br>\r\nEven the pressure of showing up with mom she took some more moments to examine her new self:<br>\r\nStarting up from the bottom, there were some things like smaller feet. That was to be expected with an overall smaller body. Your legs were shaped different, and you could only imagine how they would look naked: But one thing is sure, these are some nice pair of sexy legs!<br>\r\nThen your crotch\u2026 something you really didn't want to describe. The words that described it were empty and flat, something that no man, no matter the disease, should have to admit about his groin. Flat also summed up your stomach and waist pretty darn well. Something that took me a moment to notice was the incline that your waist created as it became your hips. It was an hourglass figure, a distinctly girly trait that would have any male high school student salivating if he caught a glimpse of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of things that would have high school boys salivating; you had two more, your breasts. Now, you were a guy of all work and little to no play. You knew absolutely nothing about our pals across the gender pool, but you knew that this chest of yours was nothing to scoff at. You have heard girls gossiping among themselves, wishing for a larger chest size. This would be what they would wish for. Maybe it was because they were unfamiliar and your mind was over exaggerating their size, but the seemed bigger than what should be required. This was especially true given your less than tall, heck, less than average statute. They messed with your balance horribly, and it wasn't good that you noticed that even when you were standing. Who knows what chaos they would wreck on your movement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one good thing you could take away from visual assessments (something that you will admit took longer than it should have) of your chest, it was that, no matter how freaked out about/emphasized their size!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He kisses each of the girls once on their cheeks. They blush at the attention, and doubtless their own thoughts and wild imaginings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mark...\" you hear the cooing tone of adoration in Barbi's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No private performances before the big event...\" she chides him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can have a private performance afterwards.\" he winks lewdly, as if that were needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face you, he adds, \"You can join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs down your spine, as you see yourself as one of the disposable girls that the players use and abandon. Simply there to be a conquest, and a boast in the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chill settles in your stomach making it freeze, as you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind that studly, jock expression, you see the mocking amusement in his eyes.

It did seem to have more bulk then usual, but you brushed it off as you being parinoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to start working on your own exersizes, but as soon as you get in position to do some burpies, your coach, coach Barns, aproaches you guys. He's a bit overtanned, has oily black hair, and is wearing PE clothes that are a bit to tight. Despite his apearances, he is one of the most likable teachers in the entire school. He's very charasmatic and relatable. When he aproaches he has an upset look on his face \"Sorry guys, looks like today we have to do the state mandated gym test\". This news recieved a pradictable groan from its audiance. \"Ok guys, I know\" Barns continued \"Lets start with the sprints\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your turn came up and you got into position and noticed that you felt a bit lighter on your feet.

Gloat semi-succesful, you get ready to do situps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh Adam?\" Daniel, who was holding your legs asked. \"Yah?\" you responded. \"Since when did you start shaving your legs?\". You looked at him like he was joking, but low and behold when you saw your legs they were completly shaved, and upon closer inspection you noticed the rest of you was as well. You were about to draw conclusions from this, but then you noticed that coach was about to start counting, so you quickly get down to do your situps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished your situps you looked at yourself you realize that, in addition to previously mentioned symptoms, you looked alot thinner in some areas, in such a way that a rare few rude may say you have a feminine figure, and Daniel was right earlier when he said you hair was long because now it seemed to cover your forhead at the front and go decently far down your neck in the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased of this information gathered you...</span></div></div>",

Finally, your chest, to your horror, started expanding, pushing your shirt and making start to feel tight at the chest area.

Messy brown hair came down to slightly past your sholdiers in the front and the bottom of your sholder blades in the back. You had a beutiful feminine face, with long eyelashes and a smooth chin. You have B cups (how you know, you don't know), and you're very skinny all around.

She wasn't used to seeing them from this angle. But <i>the girls</i> looked big. Bigger than average. Certainly bigger than she liked. Desperately she hoped it was their unfamiliarity, her fear that was making her see them that way. That she was imagining them bigger than they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart still pounding in her chest, and blood pulsing loudly in her ears. She snatched the wallet from the nightstand. Even it looked slightly different, with trembling finger she opened it. She saw the driving licence there, behind a plastic window, a cute girl stared back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve Gardner\", along with her age, address and other details.

She steeled her nerves, readying herself against the contents. As much from fear, as curiosity, she plucked the bra from the drawer. Turning it over in her hands. The cups looked massive, and swallowing a wail of fear she read 32GG, as it's size. It slipped from her numb hands. But she continued onwards, dressing feeling like putting on armour, or a disguise. Eve wanted to mask her femininity with as many clothes as possible.</span></div></div>",

Just a dull, male chest. His racing heart slowing at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands rose to his shoulders, pressing against bare flesh. Another confirmation, no long flowing raven locks, just his familiar scruffy cut. Relieved, but still too harassed to sleep, Adam allowed himself to fall back, and bounce against the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft feminine groan of protest, came from beside him.

The roiling emotions from before are still there, but now subtler and in the back of his mind deep within his subconscious. Adam appeared to be in class with Mrs. Wilson, the hot literature teacher. She's teaching something about The Raven and talking about Edgar Allen Poe when Adam noticed something was off. He looked down to see all his clothes were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Mister Jenkins?\" the dream Mrs. Wilson asked, interrupting her lesson and eliciting laughs from the entire class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Where are my clothes?\" Adam asked curiously getting another uproarious bit of laughter from the peanut gallery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Wilson rolled her eyes at him, \"Forgetting to get dressed is against the school code.\" She scans the room and points to Elizabeth Makelroy who prefers \"Eliza\". She's the only real goth in the whole school. She was tall for a girl, about 5'10\" very thin as well, which suits her just fine. It makes it easier to wear her elaborate corsets and skirts. Even the people who make fun of her have to point out just how much effort goes into those outfits she wears... and she wears them all day every day. \"Eliza, you have spare clothes do you not?\" If Adam was more awake he'd have noticed a teacher calling a student by a nickname... that doesn't usually happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza smiles broadly \"I do.\" Adam felt a sudden overwhelming urge to be clothed at all costs, punctuated by Eliza taking his hand and pulling him towards the Girl's restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um that's the girls' room.\" Adam protested weakly even as his hand shoved the door aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to use the girl's room, silly.\" she says and Adam couldn't remember his objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's room at least in this dream smelled of perfume and lavender. The usual features of a bathroom was still there but it seemed overwhelmingly just \"nicer\" than any men's or boy's room he's ever been in. Eliza produced a dufflebag from somewhere and hands over a pair of jet black panties with almost neon purple lace around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wear these...\" Adam says in a monotone... something told him even he didn't really believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what I have... Try 'em you might like them.\" Eliza offers again. The roiling emotions from before start building in Adam's mind. Slowly pushing to the fore... Adam HAS to look as black on the outside as he feels on the inside. And without another word snatched the panties and slides them up his legs... not really questioning why Eliza has panties that seem to fit him. \"There you go. Don't those feel nice?\" She asks slowly rubbing the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Adam says in a daze... The emotions seem to die back to the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to wear panties don't you. Not just in this dream but instead of any silly boy underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not just panties, you want to wear black goth girl panties. Maybe with skulls or bleading hearts on them.\" She smiles \"Soft... lacy panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssss...\" Adam says even more dazed.</span></div></div>",

We're going to the beach today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here Iz,\" you say. It was then that you noticed your new voice. \"What the hell?\" you asked with big eyes. You then looked down to see bare breasts on your chest, which happened to be hairless now. You grabbed them and felt your hands on them just as you felt them on your chest before. This meant that they were real. You reached under your covers hoping that you wouldn't find what you thought you would. Unfortunately you found the mound of a girl instead of your penis. \"I'm a girl,\" you say the shock evident in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister looked at you funny before saying, \"I should say that of course you're a girl and to stop pretending but, you're actually shocked that you're a girl.\" She peered closer at you then said, \"You look like Adam would if he was a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Adam,\" you said looking at your sister desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you turn into a girl?\" your sister asked evidently believing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said with your head in your hands. \"All I know is that I went to sleep last night and woke up with a pain in my heart and my body on fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you yell or get anyone?\" your sister said sitting on your bed and placing a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in too much pain to do anything,\" you explained shaking your head. \"I think I might have passed out from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well being in pain would make sense with your body transforming,\" your sister said in a thoughtful tone. She then sighed and said, \"Well since you don't know how this happened I'm afraid you're stuck as a girl for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to be a girl though,\" you say tears starting to run down your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have me and mom to help you,\" your sister said. \"You won't have to blunder your way through being a girl. Plus you don't have to be girly, you could be like me. Now you should probably pick a new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA name bubbled into your mind and you couldn't stop yourself from saying, \"Annabelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a nice name,\" your sister said with a little smile. \"Now let's see if your clothes changed.\"</span></div></div>",

From your position on your bed you can see many dresses, skirts, and blouses hanging up. \"I guess your clothes did change,\" your sister said shaking her head. \"You have tons more dresses than I do. Let's see if you have any pants.\" After looking through your drawers she said, \"Well you have a couple pants, which you can tell are feminine, and some leggings in here. You also have a few bikinis, teddys, nighties, sleep shirts, and nightgowns. Of course you have panties and bras as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you said rubbing your head. The pain you woke up with had diminished when you said your name was Annabelle but it was still there. \"Perhaps I can go buy some pants that don't look feminine.\" As soon as you said that the pain in your head increased. \"Ow!\" you said grabbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" your sister asked coming over her voice full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just this damn headache I woke up with,\" you said through clenched teeth. \"It was subsiding but then just came roaring back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" your sister said clearly thinking. After a few moments she said, \"I have an idea. Say that you'll buy pants that look feminine and don't think about buying ones that don't look feminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hunch and want to see if I'm right,\" your sister said in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not sure what she was getting at you said, \"Alright I'll buy feminine pants.\" Once that was said the pain diminished again and you said, \"The pain's starting to go away again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pain started going away when you said your name would be Annabelle,\" your sister said as if she actually knew that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that whatever transformed you into a girl wants you to be female,\" your sister said with a sigh. \"At least what it or they think of as female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked almost yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that if you deviate from what it or they think of as female you'll get a headache,\" your sister said going back over to your dresser and pulling out a bikini. Coming back over she handed it to you and said, \"Put this on. If I'm right your headache should all but disappear, if it doesn't disappear entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I be putting on a bra and panties?\" you asked looking over the bikini. If you remembered what colors your crayons had been then the main color would be coral and it had flowers on it. The bottom had ties on both sides and the top wasn't tied at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are going to the beach today and it's easier to put it on here than it is to change at the beach,\" your sister said with a smile. Once she said that you noticed the strap of her own bikini going around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown you look at the bikini in your hands and say, \"But I don't know how to put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the bottoms you just pull on like underwear,\" your sister said with a little eye roll. \"As for the top I'll guide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm kind of naked here,\" you said with a little blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can already see your breasts and you'll have to be naked around other girls besides me when we shower after Phys Ed,\" your sister said seeming to grow a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I go to school like this?\" you asked spreading your arms out. \"And if you're right then I won't be able to use Adam for any of my school work without getting a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to calm down Anna,\" your sister said using your new name. \"I know you've been a bit distracted by what happened so you haven't noticed a couple of things. First your calendar now has Ps on certain dates about a month apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have periods?\" you asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to relax,\" your sister said putting a hand on your shoulder. \"According to your calendar you still have twelve days before your period starts, and if it's anything like mine and mom's it won't be heavy and you'll hardly feel the cramps. I'll teach you how to use pads and tampons a little later so you're prepared. Now I'm sure you still have that headache so get your bikini on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted your sister to leave but she did have valid points so you got up and slid the bottoms on. With her guidance you were able to get the top on as well. As soon as you did the headache almost went away. You were wondering what else you had to do when you noticed your bladder sending urgent signals. \"I've got to piss,\" you said heading towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget that you need to sit to pee now,\" your sister said as you started toward the door, \"and you'll need to take some toilet paper and pat that area since a bit of pee will remain in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you said as you entered the hall. The bathroom was just about right across from your room so it didn't take long for you to get in and lock the door. You lifted the lid on the toilet, pulled your bikini bottom down, and sat on the toilet. As soon as you did your bladder released. It was a little strange peeing as a girl. The sensation was almost the same except the feeling of pee leaving your body was closer to your legs and between them. Also once the pee left the slit in your dick before that was it, now the pee was going past skin folds after leaving. Strangely it wasn't an unpleasant experience like you had expected it to be. Once you finished you did what your sister said and patted the area with some toilet paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished washing your hands you heard your mom ask, \"Why didn't you tell me you had joined the cheerleading squad Iz?\" It looked like you needed to make a decision. Should you go right out or let your sister talk to your mom first?</span></div></div>",

She is a full fledged girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know he couldn't have gotten that type of surgery,\" your mom said a hint of anger in her voice. \"I don't appreciate you lying about something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a lie though,\" your sister said in that voice she uses when she's accused of lying but is telling the truth. \"Go look at the family photos and you'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" your mom said the anger still in her voice. \"Hold this while I go check.\" You assumed that she handed the uniform to your sister then you heard her go downstairs a bit of anger in the sounds of her footsteps. At first you wondered why your sister would suggest looking at the family photos but then you remembered your clothes and calendar changing, perhaps the family photos did as well. It wasn't long before you heard your mom's footsteps come back up though there was no anger in them anymore. A moment later she asked, \"How is this possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" your sister admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the pictures have changed,\" your mom said and you could hear the shock in her voice. \"Adam is gone from them, replaced by a girl. I even checked Adam's birth certificate and that changed to Annabelle, that was going to be your name if you had come out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now you knew why your name is Annabelle now. You decide that it was time to come out of the bathroom and reveal yourself to your mom. Taking a deep breath that's what you did to see your mom holding a picture and what you presumed was your birth certificate. At the sound of the door opening your mom looks up with a bit of a shocked expression on her face. \"Hi mom,\" you said blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how this happened?\" your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure there's a reason for it happening,\" your mom said. \"Do you have any idea what that reason might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment before saying, \"Well there's been a rumor going around at school that I've been using girls, treating them like sex objects. Perhaps someone believed that and did this somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be,\" your sister said nodding. \"Do you get a headache if you think about having sex with girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour headache had disappeared and you really didn't want it to come back, but you were curious if you could think about having sex with a girl. Once you imagined it the headache came roaring back. You grabbed your head and said through gritted teeth, \"The answer is yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about having sex with a boy,\" your sister said a bit of guilt in her voice. Once you did and the headache disappeared again she said, \"I'm sorry Anna, I didn't know it would be that bad. Though it does seem like some girl did this as a punishment or as a way of stopping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever the reason it seems like you're stuck as a girl,\" your mom said with a slight sigh. She looked at your sister and said, \"I'm guessing you helped her with her bikini. Did you get her sizes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's extra small or small in Juniors and her bra size is 32A,\" your sister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" your mom said nodding. \"Now I know the plan was to go to the beach today but, I think a spa day for the three of us is in order. How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather go to the beach,\" your sister said crossing her arms. Of course being who she was it didn't surprise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then it's up to you Anna,\" your mom said looking at you. \"Which do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty sure that you wouldn't get a headache from going to the beach so that wouldn't be a deciding factor. Did you really want to go to a spa though?</span></div></div>",

The elementary school wasn't that far off, the high school however was located a rather fine distance from your current home. After having put up with two years of long commutes, your parents had let you move to a small one-room apartment. It wasn't really like living on your own, seeing as you went home every chance you got. Your family also sometimes visited you from time to time, either just someone checking in after work or to leave some leftovers for you to reheat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also gave purpose to the thought of not having to get up because someone else yelled at you too. Normally you'd stay at home on a weekend, but your parents were currently attending to a wedding of two of their friends. Your little sister was with them, as she isn't old enough to stay at home by herself. You therefore saw no point in going home to an empty house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staying in the cross between being asleep and awake, you finally got your eyes open. At first you just saw a multicolored blur. Your eyes quickly adjusted to the lighting of the room as you looked out the window were you could see a slim dash of sunshine pertruding from the closed (but not exactly lightblocking) curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you till now to realize that you felt a tad odd. Not nauseous, not even ill. It didn't however take you long to connect the feeling to your odd sensation last night. You sat up, squinting as your head still felt heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's going on with me today?\" you thought. It wasn't until this point that you finally decided to look down, to which your gaze was met by a feminine figure sitting on the edge of her bed. You were a girl.</span></div></div>",

You knew that this was real, but how could it? You were a girl. A GIRL. Over the course of one night you have somehow ended up as a member of the opposite sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now standing up, looking down at your body.<br>\r\nA slim figure, slim arms and long hair, also not forgetting the obvious bulges portruding under the t-shirt you had worn to bed. You were afraid, there was no point in denying it. Then came the biggest shock that you had somehow managed to repress up till this point. Without looking, you tucked your hand inside your underwear, and ... nothing. Whatever had happened, however this was possible; you were definetely a girl where it counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down again, anxiously thinking of an explanation to this. You waved some hair out of your eyes and got a glanze of your hands. Your slightly smaller, feminine hands. You walked into your bathroom and went up to the full body mirror that was placed on the wall opposite of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face was staring back at you. Brown eyes, long hair, cute nose, soft skin and feminine lips. Walking closer to the mirror you gently stroked the outlines of your face, mimicked by the face in the mirror. You took a few steps back again and looked at your whole figure, starting from the head down. There was no trace of an Adam's apple on your throat. Your hair stopped an inch or two after reaching your shoulders and the shirt you were wearing, despite being a bit baggy, still reflected the feminine curves and hourglass figure you now possessed.<br>\r\nYou were wearing boxer shorts which the night before fit you without a problem. The cotton underwear had remained skintight against your body but now gave away a lack of content in the front, also followed by a slightly different appearance as a result of your change of figure. Your hips were alligning with the curves on your waist and were a bit wider than before. You gave a slight turn and found that your bottom had also given the obvious perception of the shape of a female's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad this been any girl on the street, she would've been pretty cute. To wake up and find yourself having turned into this girl however, gave you a different perception of this situation. This can't be happening.</span></div></div>",

You remember that your parents were about to leave for some of their friends for a wedding\u2026today.<br>\r\nObviously in a rush and about to leave your mother said: \u201cHi honey. Have you had another thought and decided to come over? Karl and Betty would love to see you again after so many years. They already told me that they would love to the young woman you have turned into\u2026Just slide in your sexy little black dress and come over, if you leave now you can manage to arrive in time for the ceremony\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a shock as you understand by the words of your mom, that she must think that you always have been a woman\u2026<br>\r\nHiding your shock, you tell your mother that you will decide in the next couple of moments and send her a text message, you really need some minutes to think.<br>\r\nThen you ended the call and reflect the situation and you remember the sentence of your mother where she said something about Karl and Betty would love to see the young woman you have turned into.

Your mind kept expecting to feel something there, yet the flatness of your crotch was eminent. It was like experiencing a phantom limb.<br>\r\nYour mind was full with processing what was going on. Finally you came to a stop. You need to jump into a dress and join some wedding! But you need to be sure about one more thing: You were about to check if your ID had changed. If it had, other people were most likely to not even remember that you were ever a boy.

But this is on purpose, since you remember some of the glances from men you received yesterday at the weeding. You are lucky that nothing more happened\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that also nothing serious will happen today at school, you tie your hair back and then set off to school..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walk you arrived at school and step inside the old brick house style building:<br>\r\nThe very moment you stepped through the huge entrance area you saw Nick, your best friend. Normally as a boy you always share the way to your school, but today he was not present at the usual meeting point, so you went alone\u2026<br>\r\nYou wanted to discuss with him for not showing up, but the same moment it hits you, that you better should not do the same, because you realized from the previous experiences with your parents, the wedding and more, reality had changed dramatically around you.

Because you usually wear baggy clothing of normal jeans and I never realised how good it looked because you are normally dressed by the time I get here and when we are at the gym we go our separate ways and do our own thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just say \"OK then just wondering\"... And Amanda I can look and I wouldn't touch as I would feel wrong... I mean don't get me wrong you've got a nice arse and body but we've known each other for to long to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow you know Rob has a different girl each week but it seems you are not one and that you've known each other like when you were male since kindergarden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back into the living room after washing the pots and said \"so whom was you last conquest\" you go on and Sat's a girl from class he had last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou says \"you know your problem is you hide your body I mean it's really nice, fit and healthy but the thing that intimates guys is you don't back down and you've got brains\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and sat not forgetting I'm a black belt in kick boxing...

You stared blankly at the pile of clothes that Hannah left when she was visiting you. \"Guy clothes... or girl clothes...?\" You stared at your body and thought \"Man, I must be losing my mind\" and picked up the jeans, along with the underwear and the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm going to be stuck like this I might as well dress like it until I understand what's going on\". The different underwear design lay itself firmly around your body. The feeling of putting on female undergarments and having them fit like a glove was odd, to say the least. It was like the feeling of it being comfortable made you feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched for the jeans. Putting one leg in at a time you could feel it getting into place as  you pulled them up to your waist. The flatness in the groin-area becoming more eminent as you did so. Buttoning them up, you put on the shirt and socks and just stood there, now fully dressed in female clothing.</span></div></div>",

On your way to the kitchen you walked across the mirror in the hallway. You took a few steps back, looking at your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl, averagely length and with hair just about reaching her shoulders was staring back. The bright blue jeans sitting tight against her skin, showing off the curves of her hips and legs. The shirt wasn't as tight, but it too showed off the feminine traits of the upper body. Your face resembled that of your usual self, although noticably more feminine.<br>\r\nNo doubt the girl was pretty, it was just a shame she was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to the kitchen and made yourself a sandwich for breakfast. While eating you began thinking. You didn't know what was going on, or if everything was going to go back to normal tomorrow. However had a feeling that you couldn't pass off the \"I'm Adam's girlfriend\" fiasco forever. What if anyone found out? What would your family say? What even would you tell them? \"Oh hey, yeah dad it's me, Adam. You know, the girl in the skinny jeans\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you think it'd be best to just stay low. Make it through today without losing it, have a good nights sleep and think it over tomorrow.<br>\r\nHow fun going to school like this.</span></div></div>",

Emma looked at you with an expression that obviously meant \"Go on then, tell her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a nod as a late response to Olivia's question. \"Let's sit down\" said Emma, and made a gesture towards the couch.

I'm Adam\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, grinning and said \"Alright, what's the gag?\"<br>\r\nEmma was looking serious, making Olivia's grin shift into confusion. \"I'm not lying, Olivia. He seriously is Adam. I don't know how, but he just woke up like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Emma, people don't just magically transform into the opposite sex. It's not possible. If this is a prank or something you're not doing a very good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you said, sounding more confident in your voice as you stood up. \"What would prove to you that I'm really me?\" ... \"Or well, Adam.\"<br>\r\n\"Well first off, how did you say it happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Emma looked at each other. \"It was Marie\", Emma said. You continued. \"I just woke up like this. I have no idea what's going on and it's freaking me out.\"<br>\r\nThere was a slight tremble in your voice. She took her eyes off you and looked at Emma. \"What do you mean it was Marie?\"<br>\r\n\"I overheard them talking in the hallway. I don't know the specifics, but I heard her say it was her.\"<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n\"Apparently, it's some sort of sick payback just because I dumped her\" you said, crossing your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia raised her arms to the two of you as a sign to be quiet. \"Okay, let's - for the sake of this conversation say that what you're saying is true-\" she paused. \"Can she change you back?\" Your arms fell to your sides. You looked down at your female body, the long hair falling into your eyes as you did. \"I'm not sure, but I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need more proof.\" she said looking torn between whether to believe it or not. \"Hey girl-Adam, say something only you would know.\"<br>\r\nThis was like the conversation with Emma in the girl's bathroom all over again. You thought for a second, then said \"You have a crush on Dan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's face went stale. \"You like Dan?\", Emma said shocked. \"I.. haven't told anyone about that aside from Adam.\" She walked over and looked at you closely.

You removed the tight denim pants (with a bit of struggle) and picked up the black leggings instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected it to sort of be of the same type. Way too tight, shaping itself to your body, way too obviously \"there\". Instead, you actually found them to be rather comfortable. The smooth fabric against your hairless legs was pretty tight, but not uncomfortably so. You looked in the mirror. You looked pretty cute. Your hips were wider than your usual body. The sway of the curves matched that of the clothing. The slightly elastic fabric sort of tracked your movements, giving off the sensation that you were basically wearing nothing at all. You found it to be a nice feeling in comparison with the rough and tight jeans you had been sporting so far. Not that the jeans were bad, but it was nice to let your legs \"breathe\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of hated how okay you were with wearing these.<br>\r\nYou moved on to the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were less elastic. They weren't denim, they were some sort of cotton. They were gray, with two strings in the front to tighten the waist. The rim of them had a white lining to them. \"Must be some sort of gym-shorts\" you assumed. At least it looked like what some of the girls at school wore during gymclass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed the leggings and put them in a new pile on the side for stuff you deemed \"okay\" to wear.<br>\r\nYou began pulling the shorts up and turned back to face the mirror. At least they looked good on you. Which you weren't so sure you liked.<br>\r\nThey stopped a little under your butt, outlining the middle part of you body. Though they weren't as tight as the jeans or the leggings, they clearly outlined a V-shape in your crotch to remind you of your change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's it going in there?\" you heard one of the girls shout.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I suppose\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Find anything yet?\"<br>\r\n\"Leggings weren't half bad. Don't make me look too masculine, though\"<br>\r\n\"That's the point, sweetie\" they laughed.<br>\r\nThey had never called you sweetie before. Adam, yes. Jenkins, yes. Sweetie? That was a first.

Have fun!\" she said, leading you into the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you were. A high school girl, with your friends, at the mall, shopping clothes.<br>\r\nYou held up one of the dresses. It seemed more every day use rather than something you'd wear to prom. You sighed as you began to unzip your jeans and remove your shirt. You looked in the mirror. You still think you were pretty cute for a girl. Which sucked. It didn't exactly make you feel very masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the dress, glanced at it and pondered for a minute. Do you step into it? Do you put it on from the bottom and up? Eh, I'll just try something. You put it on, managed to fit it over your breasts and then tried pulling up the zipper. It was a white sundress with little blue flower on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got something on?\" you heard from outside.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you replied.<br>\r\nTo your surprise Emma just barged in.<br>\r\n\"HEY, a little privacy please?\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Keep your panties on\" she said as she glanced at you. You hated that. That's what Marie said when you confronted her this morning. Emma however wasn't like Marie. Emma said it with a smile, a sparkle in her brown eyes. \"You look pretty cute\" she said.<br>\r\nYou acknowledged that it was a compliment, but you didn't know what to think of it.<br>\r\n\"How does it feel?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Breezy\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was. It was more open and free than any guy clothes you had worn. Nothing that hindered movement. It felt pretty good, to be honest. If you ever got back to normal, maybe you should invest in buying a kilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" she smiled, stroking the white cotton fabric.<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I don't think I'll be able to find anything truly comfortable looking like this\"<br>\r\n\"Just give it some time. You're still new to this stuff! You'll like it eventually, I promise\"<br>\r\n\"Let's hope I don't have to stay this way long enough for that to happen\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Hey, try on the skirt. I'll head out while you change\" she said as she left the dressing room.<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the dress and once again found the long haired cute girl staring back at you in her underwear. You picked up a loose red skirt and slid it up your legs. Not bad.<br>\r\nFinally nothing tight or revealing. It felt breezy, it felt sort of good. It looked pretty good as well. You didn't have anything on your upper body aside from the bra, but still. The dress was kind of tight in that area, lining your waist and revealing cleavage in your chest area. A regular skirt could be matched with basically anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you heard. \"Should we send in something else?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For crying out loud, Olivia.<br>\r\n\"Why, would I have to wear one of these?\"<br>\r\n\"Eventually, you're going to have to start coming to school. There's gymclass at school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hoping I didn't have to be stuck like this for so long people would start to question the sick-at-home thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think probably every guy has at some point been curious what it would be like to be a girl for a day. You know, not in a weird way, just thinking of how it would be different. The thought has probably crossed girls minds as well, no doubt. Standing there now, being a girl for the second day in a row, picking up different kinds of clothes was weird. It was a combination of male curiosity as well as a sense of reluctance. Just because the thought of how being the opposite sex would feel on some rare occassion (I'm a male teenager, don't judge me) it didn't mean I actually wanted to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rummaged through the small pile of different bathing suits. Nothing too girly, I thought. I picked up some bikini's, putting them back as I had no idea how you get the bra-part on. I pulled out a black one piece bathing suit and held it out in front of me, stepped in, and pulled it up. The straps over my shoulders, adjusting what needed to be adjusted and took a step back. Fit like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I've mentioned loads of times already, my physique was drastically different. Thinner waist, more shapely, extra filling in places, you know?<br>\r\nAnd lack of.. filling, in other places. The fabric going around that area covered everything as well, went up around the back and sort of stopped mid-back as the shoulderstraps begun forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think this is one of the things I had (admittedly) been curious as what it would be like to wear. Felt good, I admit.<br>\r\nDo I like having to wear this stuff? Nu-uh.</span></div></div>",

After a while they thought I had gathered up enough pants, tops, skirts, dresses, shirts, bras, panties and so on to make it through a while. Of course it wasn't enough if I were to be stuck like this forever, but it was a start. It was also on the verge of being too generous for my bank account. The stuff I had piled up was nothing too fancy either, just your everyday stuff. At least according to Emma and Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got me thinking, what would I do if I woke up a boy again? I'd have a bunch of girl clothing lying in my wardrobe. That would probably have to require some explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we made our way to the register, they proceeded to pay for some stuff they picked up as well. They didn't seem too embarassed that I was there with them. We were friends, of course - but I was still a guy at heart. This was the first time me or any of the guys had been with them as they paid for newly acquired underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my turn now. I walked up to the woman sitting at the register. She was probably in her late twenties, smiling at me as she scanned each of the items. I know I don't look my usual self, but I was still waiting for some sort of reaction. \"Excuse me sir, but I think you're in the wrong aisle!\" Instead she just smiled at me, told me the total and handed me the bags.</span></div></div>",

I  walked over and took a seat in the desk chair. There were some sketches on the table. Olivia was quite good at drawing, actually. I remember back in school when she used to draw portraits of people. I myself didn't really, as they say, have \"the gift\". Most of what I drew looked like regular stickmen.

Waking up looking like this scared the life out of me. It's gotta be weird for you too, right?\"<br>\r\nEmma snorted. \"Yeah, of course.

She waved and told me to call either of them if something was up. It was pretty cool to have this kind of support from two of your closest friends whom you would expect to be a little more taken aback by all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got home I found that Jacob had indeed left the backpack hanging on my door handle. Thankfully someone else hadn't walked along and snatched it. Then again, who'd want to steal a bag of homework?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door, put down the bag in the hall, kicked off my shoes and put the bags of clothes in my room. While I put some leftovers in the microwave for dinner I poured everything out on my bed and started sorting the items. I was gonna have to make additional room in my closet. I pulled out a bunch of clothes I obviously didn't have need for right now. Boxers, for example. I left everything there was space left over for. I didn't have a humungus stash of girl clothes, so there was no need to empty the whole thing. The pile I no longer needed, I crammed into a compartment above the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put in the newly acquired arrays of panties, jeans, leggings, tops, bras, dresses and skirts, folding everything neatly as I did. Okay, maybe I was a bit too much of a perfectionist for a guy when it came to sorting my clothes, but I'm not really a guy now, am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hoping no one else would find a reason to look in my closet. This would take a biiit of explaining, regardless if Adam was here or not. There was a *ding* coming from the kitchen, which meant dinner was ready. I pulled out the plate and sat down in front of the TV. At least my appetite hadn't diminished. Quite the contrary, I felt quite hungry. It had been a hectic day.</span></div></div>",

Felt nice to just lay back and relax.<br>\r\nLater I got up and did the dishes. I sniffed my armpit. I could probably use a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was gonna be a big step. It would be the first time I'd be completely butt naked. I wasn't even sure how to clean... certain things. I got into the bathroom and lost the jeans, the underwear and the top. I wasn't even wearing a bra as I hadn't acquired one until today. I stepped in and saw my own reflection on the mirror above the sink on the opposite side of the room. My hair was a bit messier and dirtier than yesterday. I had no idea how to manage this length. Heck, I didn't even own a comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had goosebumps all over because of the chilly room, but as the water started drippling I suddenly found myself falling into relaxation in the cozy warm shower. Alright, this wasn't so different, I thought. Just water dripping in different places, I thought. It occured to me that I still had guy shampoo. It didn't really matter to me personally, but it was slightly odd to have this cute girl smell like a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to use like three times the amounts of shampoo I normally do. Usually I just grab a click and rub it in and let it run off. Since my hair was so long now it all just became a tangly mess with the hair at the furthest down my shoulders missing out on a lot of the action. I mean, I was washing my hair, it wasn't rocket science. It was just more troublesome than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI covered the rest of my body in soap and let it rinse off. This was the first time I had fully had a feel of things, so to speak. My skin was wayy softer and certain attributes were shaped differently. My butt and hips for example had a more portruding shape and I really felt how my waist was much slimmer, bending inwards to that stereotypical hourglass-y figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out of the shower and dried myself up. The hair now looked like a tangly bush. I did my best trying to straighten it out but it wasn't easy trying to compensate your fingers for a comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMental note: Get shampoo. Get a comb. I opened the bathroom cabinet. \"- Also, get girl deoderant\" I thought and closed it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was closed of course, but I still carried the towel wrapped around me. Now placed higher up to cover extra body parts that hadn't been a problem before.<br>\r\nAs I went into my room I opened the wardrobe and tried to pick some new outfit. I now had more to choose from than my sisters jeans. I didn't know until today how many different styles of female underwear there were, not to mention the materials they came in. Boyshorts, hipster, string, briefs, bikini, thong. Of course I hadn't gotten everything, I just picked out stuff that didn't seem too overly feminine or too uncomfortable. No thongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up a pair of bikini-styled panties and pulled them up. It perfectly cupped my anatomy and the flatness of my groin as it also covered my butt. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was just a regular white plain one, but I had no experience in putting one on and pondered whether I actually needed one. I decided to at least attempt to put one on as I had nothing better to do. So far so good. Getting the straps over my shoulders and the cups on my breasts was nothing compared to hooking the darn thing in the back. It took several attempts before I finally heard the click of it being set in place. I again stood in front of the mirror and adjusted it a bit before pulling out a top of the same color and putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male part of my brain liked the look of this girl. Cute outfit and pretty cute looks, aside from my long brown hair that had now dried and was pointing in almost every direction. It hadn't really occured to me before how I had the opportunity to see a cute girl in her underwear whenever I wanted. Of course it was a different thing when the girl was indeed yourself, but still a pretty good thought. </span></div></div>",

It was beige and had a bit rough fabric and no elastic waistband. I went a bit back and forth, staring at the couple of frilly bras sitting there on a shelf. I'd just be at home, so there wouldn't really be any need for it, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, I had no idea how to even put one on so I might as well make an attempt as I have nothing better to do tonight. I picked up a pink lace one and shivered as I put the straps over my shoulders and tried to get my breasts to fit into the cups. It was surprisingly painstaking to hook the back. I'd had girlfriends so it wasn't my first time seeing a bra, however I didn't feel experienced enough to do it from this point of view. \"Got it!\" I exclaimed as I heard the slight click of the clasp.<br>\r\nThe bra was surprisingly helpful. It eased on the weight of my breasts that had previously just 'hung freely' and constrained them in the girly chest-piece. I chose a tight white t-shirt with a v-neck to go on top. Aside from the drying mess that currently was my hair, I didn't look too shabby. I looked a bit in the mirror, turning different angles to check how the outfit looked. This wasn't as much for the sense of fashion as it was male curiosity of seeing a pretty girl in these clothes. It hadn't quite occured to me how I have easy access to see a cute girl in her underwear (or whatever clothes I wanted, for that reason) at any time.</span></div></div>",

It was. Hello boobs, I thought as I sat up. I stretched, went to the bathroom and did my thing, ate some breakfast and continued on as if nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had forgotten my phone on the table the previous night and noticed I had received a text from Emma only five minutes ago asking if I plan on going to school today.<br>\r\nI did not want to go to school today. However, it might be better to pull the bull by its horns instead of hiding until my parents got home from their trip and found out I had been playing sick. I texted back a \"yes\" and only a minute later there was a knock on the door. As I looked through the peephole I discovered that it was in fact Emma. She must've been close to my place when she received my text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must've lost track on time because I hadn't even gotten dressed yet. I opened the door a tiny smidge and said \"Can you wait outside a sec? I'm still in my underwear\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't care\" she said. I cared. I didn't want her to see me walking around in panties. \"Don't be such a baby\" she laughed and before I knew it she had let herself in. I quickly grabbed a pillow and covered my chest. \"EMMA! A LITTLE PRIVACY PLEASE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, or wait- what was it? Emelie? it's not awkward for a girl to see her friend in her underwear, relax. Just go get dressed and we'll go.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I didn't remove the pillow. I just snuck into my room and began putting on the skirt and top again. I walked back out. \"No bra?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Sh*t\" I said, looking down at my chest. I walked back into my room. It was easier this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I asked what's going on with your hair?\" She ran it through her fingers \"It's a mess\". <br>\r\n\"Plus you smell like dude\" she said. \"I don't have a bunch of feminine hygiene products, Em. We just bought clothes, remember?\"<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm gonna have to teach you a lot, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her palm in one of her pockets in her jacket and pulled out a ribbon. \"Turn around\" she said. I did as I was told. I felt my hair being pulled back as she did something to it. A minute later she stopped and said \"There! Go look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made my hair into a long thick braided ponytail. \"Thanks\" I said. I probably don't think it came out as thankful as it should have. It looked better now, of course, although a comb wouldn't have hurt either. It just kept dawning on me how girly I actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go now?\" she said.<br>\r\nI nodded.</span></div></div>",

There were a mixed array of girls here. Sofia was a senior, Juliet was in her first year. There were some familiar faces and some I don't recall meeting before. I knew of course the usual ones from my own class. Elaine, Pam, Johanna and Amy. Marie was thankfully not here. She had her own group of friends.<br>\r\n\"Emelie, huh? Emelie what?\" Sofia asked.<br>\r\n\"Jenkins\" I said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're related to Adam then?\" said Pam.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" I hadn't thought this thing through. Same last name, I obviously couldn't lie and say I was my own girlfriend. Great job dingus.<br>\r\n\"They're cousins\" Emma filled in, sounding surprisingly convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nice! So you're going to start our class, then?\" Pam asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Olivia showed up. She had clearly been running. I don't really get how she can live this close to school and yet almost always arrive right before school begins. \"Hey!\" she started, breathing heavily between words. \"Oh, I see you've met Emily?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup. How do you know her?\"<br>\r\n\"Em and I took her shopping yesterday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she didn't have to go around and say that, I thought.<br>\r\nThe bell rang shortly after and the crew disbanded.

All eyes were on me. \"Hello\" I said, gently brushing my arm and removing a stroke of brown hair from my face. \"My name is Emelie Jenkins.

Now it's suddenly Emelie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, he remembered\" I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, you said you were Adam's girlfriend. Now, you're apparently his cousin. Do you agree with me when I say that this doesn't add up?\"<br>\r\nI looked away. I stayed silent.<br>\r\n\"Yesterday you were here with his backpack to 'get his homework'. I offered to do it for you, but when I got there, his apartment was locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Michael were standing behind me. \"We're Adam's friends. We just want to know what the heck is going on, so spill it, who. are. you?\"<br>\r\nI didn't know what to do. I looked around, Dan and michael still behind me, arms crossed. I couldn't just run off. Not that I was afraid they were going to beat me up or anything, but I saw no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's Adam\" a voice came from further down the corridor. It was Emma and Olivia.</span></div></div>",

He doesn't even have male genitalia yet he's got more balls than any of you\" Emma said. Olivia burst out laughing.<br>\r\nI flashed a grin. That line stomped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys looked at each other. They knew I was the only one (well, up until now) who knew that stuff.<br>\r\n\"So it's really you, man?\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n\"It's really me.\"<br>\r\n\"You're pretty hot\" Dan said.<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" I said.</span></div></div>",

Tagging along to buy panties and crop tops?\" They laughed.<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it\" I didn't find this as amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind him\" Olivia lay her arm around my neck. \"Just ignore them. You're on the winning team now!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but are you saying girls are better than boys?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course we are\" she said, still her arm around my neck as if she was waiting for me to back her up.<br>\r\n\"You people can't even pee standing up\" Dan said.<br>\r\n\"Coming from the guy who's probably seen more romantic comedies than me\" she said, getting a haul of laughter from the rest of the table. She was obviously teasing him because she had a crush on him. She didn't know it, but I knew Dan had a crush on her too. It felt kind of nice being all out in the open with this now. No more sneaking about, no more secrets. My closest friends knew. That was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So 'Emelie', seriously. Being a guy is way better, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh you can't ask her that when she's only been a girl for like two days\" Emma yelled.<br>\r\nI cut in. \"Actually, not everything's that bad\" I said, making both the girls smile.<br>\r\n\" - I'll probably have to change clothes in the girls changing room now\" I said and winked at the guys.<br>\r\nEm and Olivia both slapped me in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking!\" I said.<br>\r\n\"Oh you're laughing now, Emelie Jenkins, but you weren't laughing yesterday when I made you put on a bathing suit\" all of the guys burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\"Actually, she thought it was pretty comfortable\" Emma said to make things even worse.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know I was joking about it earlier but I had no desire to step into the girls locker room. I hadn't even packed any clothes to go with it.<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're all going to see your bathing suit soon\" Jacob smirked. I punched me in the side. My heartrate was going up. I asked how long it was till then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 15 minutes\" Dan said as he looked down at his wristwatch. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have any gymclothes\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest I think the guys found the realization of my physical appearance a bit intimidating. They didn't really say anything, as if trying to ignore the fact that their friend now had a bathing suit. \"You might make it if you run, Emelie\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I didn't have a choice. I left school and made my way back home. It took five minutes at this pace. I hurried to my bedroom and put the skintight one piece in a plastic bag along with a towel and put it back in my backpack. I think it even had the price tag still on. I wasn't in the height of physical strength to begin with, but in this body I noticed a slight hint of exhaustion that came sooner than expected. When I got back to school I had a little over five minutes to go, my heart pounding as I opened the door to the local gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther students were still entering the different locker rooms, so it appeared I had still made it on time. I could see the guys up ahead and was almost on a verge of joining them before I felt Olivia tugging on my shirt. I sort of forgot I was a girl now. I looked over at the men's room in longing as I was being pulled into my own doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any tips?\" I whispered to Olivia. <br>\r\n\"Haven't you ever been in a locker room before?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but this isn't my usual locker room\" I said.<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you guys do it, but we usually change our clothes before we go in\"<br>\r\n\"Great. Thanks\" I responded.<br>\r\n \"- But if I catch you staring at me while changing I will punch you in the face, got it?\" Olivia pointed a finger threatingly at my chest.<br>\r\nI nodded respectfully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It looked like the guys dressing room, only mirrored. The entrances are right next to each other, but the girls showers are on the right side, the lockers on the left, and so forth. It might be my imagination but it might also be a tad cleaner. At least it didn't reak as much of sweaty socks. My plan was simple. Find a place as far away from everyone else as possible, change quickly and walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backpack was swung across my shoulder as I made my way through the small stream of girls and settled for a place on the far right with a wall of lockers on the opposite side, as if to shield myself from the view of the others. - And to avoid a potential punch in the face if I happened to see Emma or Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness I was flat down there right now. I was in a room full of hot girls my age who were beginning to remove their clothes in order to fit into their bikinis and bathing suits. Had I not been so nervous (or a girl myself) I would've been the luckiest guy in the world. I was pulled back to reality as a close thud eminated from the bench on the opposite side of mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" a girl said as she put down her backpack. \"Why are you sitting here all alone?\" she said. I knew her as one of Marie's friends. Patricia. She was a bit of a tomboy, but she was harmless. She had black hair and ripped jeans, often wearing a checkered shirt.<br>\r\nI didn't have time to answer before she started unbuttoning her shirt and said \"You want to stay a bit out of sight as well?\"<br>\r\nI nodded.<br>\r\n\"You were that new girl right? Emilia or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Emelie\" I said. I was sitting on the bench hugging my knees.<br>\r\n\"Ah, nice to meet you Emelie. I'm Patricia\" she stretched out her arm to greet me.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Patricia\" I said, even though I'd been in her class for the past two years.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be shy, girl. I'm not embarassed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obviously referring to me still not unpacking my stuff or even taking my shoes off. I tried to avoid her gaze by turning around as I, too, began slowly undressing. <br>\r\nIt appeared as if Patricia knew anything about what Marie had done to me, so I didn't hold any grudges against her. Marie wasn't exactly that stereotypically evil girl herself, even though it might sound like it. I mean, I'm standing in the girl's locker room because of her. When we dated however, she was just like any normal girl. Cute, outgoing, nothing that said \"If you ever dump me I'm going to curse you and turn you into a girl\". Speaking of which, where was Marie? I hadn't seen her at all today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had my shirt off and tried to unhook my bra. Still turned towards the locker. \"Uh, you need a hand?\" Patricia asked as she saw me fumbling around trying to get it open. \"No I'm good\" I said. She took a step closer and swiftly just snapped it open. \"There you go.\" she said. I felt embarassed over how poorly I was at being female. \"I usually just go without one for that same reason\" Patricia said with a smile. I had the towel covering my whole body as I sat down trying to get my pants and underwear off without showing anything off. It probably looked a bit weird, but I didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped into the bathing suit and pulled the straps over my shoulders. I was fully dressed, but I still felt completely nude. I knew I was currently in a place only populated by girls and no one was ogling me for 'that' reason, but I was soon about to follow everyone else out to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked out the teacher hadn't shown up yet, so everyone was sitting on the benches outside the locker rooms. I sat down between Olivia and Pam, just staring down at my own body to avoid glances from the boys. I don't know if anyone actually paid me any attention, but I didn't want to know if they did.<br>\r\n\"See, that went fine\" Olivia patted me on the arm.<br>\r\n\"What went fine?\" Pam asked me.<br>\r\n\"You know, new kid at school, locker rooms?\" Olivia replied for me.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Emelie. You seem like a cool girl, although a bit quiet\" she said and smiled at me. I forced a smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon class!\" a voice suddenly echoed from the other end of the pool as Mr. Steinberg walked in. He was a muscular man in his late 30's, hair shaved down to little stubbles and wearing black shorts and shirt. He wasn't as tough as he looked, actually he was a favorite among students. \"Anyone missing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam Jenkins\" shouted Dan from further down the line. Mr. Steinberg crossed off my name on a piece of paper. \"Aaaalright, anyone else?\" he looked up. Patricia raised her hand. \"Marie Wilson. The flu\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's why I hadn't seen her today. Coach Steinberg crossed off another name and turned to face the class again. \"Okay eveyone, this class I just want you to swim 10 lines and do some diving tests. Nothing major as today's class has to be cut short. I'm going on vacation in exactly 45 minutes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then, move it!\" he shouted as all students got up from their seats and began jumping into the water.</span></div></div>",

I had never been in a class full of people wearing a one piece bathing suit ready to go swimming before. I looked down at the pool, watching my shivering reflection as I took a deep breath and jumped in. The water was kind of cold. The water went up to my shoulders as I landed on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the water, the bathing suit stuck to my skin even tighter and I really couldn't tell if I had accidentally left it with me as I jumped in or if I was still wearing it. I swung my wet brown hair back and began walking to the end of the pool, preparing to start the obligatory laps. I was splashed in the face by someone. Michael and Jacob dived up. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young lady\" Michael started as he shook his hair after leaving the water.<br>\r\n\"Hello\" I said, arms crossed in the freezing water.<br>\r\n\"You really are wearing a one piece\" Jacob laughed.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" I said, shortly.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it like, uncomfortable, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to say. It actually wasn't. This wouldn't have been much less embarassing if my guy friends weren't mocking me and constantly reminding me that I was no longer male. \"It's alright\" I said.<br>\r\n\"I don't think Emelie is very talkative right now\" Michael told Jacob.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither. Well, see you later girl!\" Jacob shouted before once again diving under the surface.<br>\r\n\"Listen, don't take it too hard. We're just joking.\" Michael said and lay a hand on your hand before joining Jacob under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remained still by the edge of the pool for a while until Mr. Steinberg whistled in my direction and said \"Hey, new girl. Let's see some swimming!\"<br>\r\nI nodded, kicked off and dived under water. I sort of missed the feeling of swimming trunks that sort of floated around a bit like a yellyfish under water. At least you knew they were there. Swimming went pretty well, though. Surprisingly well. I hadn't been there for long before I was done with my ten laps and were free to do whatever I wanted. I just basically tested stuff out. Checking what different swimming techniques and positions were different when you were a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing under water was pretty cool as you were sort of \"weightless\", just floating around. My flat groin making itself pretty eminent as I was kicking with my legs while diving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, we all hit the showers. This was an awkward bit I hadn't anticipated. I had to get nude here. There were no drapes between the showers, but rather just one big open area. I didn't make eye contact with anyone. I just closed my eyes, dropped the one piece and walked into the warm water. \"I can do this\" I thought. \"It's just a shower. Ignore the fact that I'm standing in like with like ten other naked girls right now\"<br>\r\nThat last bit didn't help. Thank goodness I was a girl right now and not a boy, or it would've been pretty clear what I meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna wash your hair?\" someone said next to me. A voice I recognized as Pam's. I still had my eyes closed. \"Nah, I forgot my shampoo\" I said.<br>\r\n\"That's okay, you can borrow mine\"<br>\r\nA hand stretched out in front of my face with a yellow bottle of shampoo. I didn't look in Pam's direction, just said \"thanks\" and began washing my hair. At least now I wouldn't smell like a dude, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, I wrapped the towel around my waist and walked back to the bench where I had left my clothes before. I put on the underwear again, struggled a bit before getting on the bra and made my way out, trying to not make too much eye contact, or.. otherwise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You make your way down the stairs your skin sensitive to any of the shifts against the fabric.  Your mom\u2019s voice asks, \u201cYou alright sweety?  You look a bit pale.  Do you want to stay home or do you need to go to the doctor?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I am okay just a bit achy.  I am starting to feel better already.

It was her birthday and she\u2019d break up with you if you didn\u2019t give her the present you purchased for her.  You ate half your scrambled eggs while your mom kissed the top of the your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need me let me know.

Then putting your dishes in the dishwasher.  You enter the bathroom starting the shower.  Stripping free of your clothes you touch your chest.  It is bare.  You had a bit of chest hair.  Must of rubbed off in your sleep.  Disappointed at losing one of your developing points of manhood you entered the shower.  As the water warmed and flowed over your skin soothing away the dull ache.  Soaping up sent a quake throughout your body when you touched your nipples.  The intense afterglow lingered.  You regretted the need to leave but you needed to get going so you completed washing up and exited the shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing a long strand of hair from your face as you returned to your room.  Must need a haircut you thought.  You pulled on some underwear along with jeans.  They felt loose so you used a belt.  Pulling it tight you found it going to notch beyond your normal one.  You needed to bulk up not slim down.  Maybe you need to stock up some powder to help you bulk up at the gym.  With a t-shirt and an long sleeved shirt on top.  You grabbed your book bag and headed to school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey handsome you know what day it is?\u201d  Cindy Simmons strutted up to you at your locker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly the birthday of the most beautiful girl I know.\u201d  You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood answer.  I love what you have done with your hair.  It looks adorable long.\u201d  She said as she twirled a lock of your hair.  She put on a pouty face, \u201cDid you get me anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is here.\u201d  Pulling a small wrapped package passing it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy tore at the wrapping quickly revealing an ornate music box.  \u201cI love it.\u201d  She opened it and it played a sweet melody.  She hugged you tight kissing you with her moist lips.  The school bell alerted you both that you needed to head to class.  She flounced off.  A stomach cramp hit causing you to stumble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feeling okay Adam?\u201d  Marie asked walking up with a malevolent smile.  Your neighbor and friend since childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little out of sorts.  I am sorry that I flaked on you to go out with Cindy.  You\u2019ll understand when you start dating a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater under the bridge.  Come to me if you need me though.  You are my best friend and I will be there for you no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cSorry I haven\u2019t been a better one to you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your body continues to feel off.  You can\u2019t put your finger on it.  It is like your insides are moving about within yourself.  An odd sensation but you didn\u2019t want to ruin Cindy\u2019s birthday by going home sick.   You entered history class focused on the lessons.  Your mind wandered think about going shopping with Cindy.  Smiling thinking checking out what cool styles they displayed.  You could pick out a cute outfit.  Pausing thinking about it for a minute\u2026outfit for Cindy.  That is what you meant.  A ringing bell brought on the next break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out you met with Cindy taking her hand in yours.  She asked you as you walked, \u201cYour hands are so soft.  Have you been using the lotion I gave you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStammering out, \u201cYes.\u201d  Trying to remember for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good.  Hand care is very important.  What say we do a makeover after school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be awesome but do you think we can get an appointment?\u201d  More excited than you felt you should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelipe adores me he\u2019ll do it for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the thought of football practice came to mind.  Dejected you said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.  I have football.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I have cheerleading and I am skipping it.  Its my birthday so you have to do what I want.  That way I\u2019ll do what you want.\u201d  Cindy leaned her lips in close as she spoke before she pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nipples stiffened with the stimulating exchange.  \u201cOkay.  It is your birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeee this is going to be fun.\u201d  A peck on the cheek your reward.  You treasured these stolen moments between classes.  Class passed uncomfortably.  It felt like a weight pressed on your head.  You noticed heading out of class your pants dragged along the floor.  They fit earlier didn\u2019t they?  You could hem them.  You were handy with a needle.  Your mom taught you how when you broke your leg.  Another disconcerting realization hit as you noticed the cuffs of your outer shirt extending beyond your wrists.  I need to dress better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the locker room to prepare for gym class you changed your ill fitting clothes.  Class ended up going poorly, your coordination all over the place.  Doing badminton this week you couldn\u2019t return a shot.  Your reach and speed all lacking to what you are used too.  After class stripping off your t-shirt your chest appeared puffy.  Dismissing it you put on your pants that changed into capris.  They fit tightly against your skin.  Your t-shirt a tank top and over shirt thinner fabric now with buttons on the wrong side.  You couldn\u2019t leave in your gym clothes so you dressed wondering who might be playing these tricks on you.  Marie must be getting back at you.  Whatever she\u2019d have her fun and get over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving class Cindy surprised you not commenting on your attire.  \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay to skip cheerleading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoach Jeffries is cool she\u2019ll understand.\u201d  You respond without thinking.  Did she ask about you cheerleading?  No you must of misunderstood.  \u201cDo you think I should get highlights?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I think that is tacky.  What say we cruise the mall after?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d  Today\u2019s prospects improved drastically with this idea.  Together they entered the chemistry lab.  Having Cindy as a lab partner made this your favorite class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like your shorts.  Are they new?\u201d  Cindy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you noticed how your capris crept up into shorts.  \u201cI don\u2019t remember.  You really like them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am always telling you that you should show off your legs.  They are shapely and smooth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as nice as yours though.\u201d  You noticed your clean shaven legs.  Something was off but a fog prevented you from knowing what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.  You are the best.  They are great.\u201d  Cindy stretched out her right leg displaying it.  It produced no titillation for you.  Only appreciation as you might a painting or statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strain came to your shoulders.  The weight of the bulges on your chest built.  Your undershirt pulled up exposing your taut stomach.  No longer a defined six pack you\u2019d worked hard for.  Your top shirt became riddled with holes as it turned into a mesh layering piece.  A complementing tank top that displayed your developing bust.  Your shorts tightened pressing into your crotch.  No pain followed because of a vacancy where your former manhood once held sway.  Neither you or Cindy picked up on these changes.  What magic controlled your fate altered reality to fit its defined norm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting class Marie caught sight of you.  You waved at her as you approached.  Marie\u2019s confusion clearly displayed, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d  Her eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time together lately but that isn\u2019t nice.  I am Anna Jenkins your friend.  Cindy needed me more lately since she lost her boyfriend and it is her birthday.  You should be a little considerate of that fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dawning hit Marie, \u201cYou\u2019ve got breasts.\u201d  Incredulous at what she saw before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy swayed up, \u201cThe best in the school.\u201d  Her words triggered your breasts too swell into a set of oversized melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a football player.\u201d  Marie stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shook her head, \u201cI admit Anna has an excellent flexible body but football?  What are you smoking?  She is too short.  She is a cheerleader.  Though I imagine she wouldn\u2019t mind being tackled by a few of the players.\u201d  Giggling at that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of simultaneous changes happened.  Only Marie took stock of them.  Your outfit altered as your undershirt molded itself to your hefty boobs.  A bright scarlet bra to complement your thong underwear.  Your mesh shirt filled in taking on the school colors.  Accompanied by your shorts fusing together softening into a skirt to match.  You dwindled in size till you found yourself tilting your head up to your friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie blinked a few times trying to wake up.  \u201cI gotta go.\u201d  She turned and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her problem?\u201d Cindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is having a hard time adjusting to us being friends.  She doesn\u2019t have a lot of others so it hurts her that we have hung out so much lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe needs to get over that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been neglecting her lately.  What say we all go shopping this weekend?  She is really great when you get to know her.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d  Cindy sounded unconvinced.        </span></div></div>",

She had no idea that meant turning him into a girl, and a total bombshell cheerleader at that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school the first thing Marie tried to do was find the old gypsy and ask her for a counter curse. However when she returned to the old antique shop she had found days earlier she was shocked to see it was no longer there. In fact the store itself was gone it was an appliance repair shop and looked like it had been there for years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do? The curse had altered her reality...Marie was the only one who remembered Adam as he was now. Everyone else just saw Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Marie remembered something. Her necklace...It was a locket that carried picture of her and Adam on their first date. She had never shown it to anyone...Opening it up she saw it was still the same. Somehow unaffected by the reality change. If she could still remember that day maybe Anna could too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie rushed over to Anna\u2019s house and saw it looked almost the same. When she knocked on the door Anna\u2019s mother answered who looked the same as she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there Mrs. Smith is Anna home?\u201d Marie asked hoping she was still here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Marie yeah but she is leaving soon on a date. I\u2019ll go grab her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as Anna came downstairs as Marie gasped at how Anna looked now that she was fully changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had huge boobs. They also perfectly rounded and very perky with no sag. She was really short only 5\u20192, but very curvy with an hourglass figure with side hips and a perfect tear drop butt. Her blonde hair was down to her waist and tied up in nice ponytail. She was wearing a dark red mini dress and sexy black heels as she was finishing up her makeup and putting on earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Marie what\u2019s up? I\u2019ve got a date with Brad in like 20 minutes.\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she mean Brad Kingsley? He was the second string quarterback right after Adam before the reality change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Anna...This isn\u2019t right....you aren\u2019t right....I\u2019ve done something horrible and I\u2019m trying to fix it. I got jealous and angry and ended up casting a curse on you. It was meant to make you worse at football so you would spend more time on me but instead it backfired and turned you into a girl!\u201d Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna just stood there looking at Marie with an odd stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarie...are you feeling alright?\u201d She asked obviously not believing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook here! This was us in our first date at the carnival we went to the Ferris wheel and shared ice cream!\u201d Marie said showing Anna the locket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna looked at the locket it was like her mind was suddenly lifted...There was this cloud...this block around her mind that was slowly being lifted as strange memories began flooding back to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that in a snap Anna blinked as she looked around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarie.....what\u2019s going on here? Why...why do I huge boobs?\u201d Anna said looking down to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam! You are back! Well...at least in mind...\u201d Marie said happy as she hugged Adam...or...Anna...</span></div></div>",

Adam said, \u201cExplain to me what is going on.\u201d  Marie nervously told all about her misadventure with magic.  Then into how the shop disappeared.  Adam lay back his tresses falling about him.  \u201cSo what I am hearing is that I am screwed.  Literally, in all likely hood if I go out with Brad freaking Kingsley.  I mean he is the hottest of the hot.  My loins ache for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam!  Think about what you are saying.  You are a man.\u201d  Marie said worried about losing him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam said, \u201cI lack the required equipment to be called a man.  I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019d do this to me.\u201d  An internal struggle brewed inside when they drifted from remembering Adam.  The locket might be all that remained of his former self.  Falling into the role of Anna felt natural, even right.  \u201cMaybe I am supposed to be Anna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no don\u2019t think like that.  I know that we decided that being friends was best but you should be a man.  That is who you are.  You carried me across Carson\u2019s creek to protect my new shoes after the spring dance.  You are the one that I commiserate with when life just sucks.  I didn\u2019t do this because I thought that it would hurt you.  I would never want that.  You know that I missed spending time with you.  I was desperate.  You breaking up with Cindy is all I wanted.  Even if you never speak to me again we need to fix this.\u201d  Marie said tears welling up in her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sat up facing Marie with a pleading look he said, \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I could spend the night and we could reminiscence.  Reminding you of the locket helped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a date with Brad tonight.  He is probably coming over as we speak.  When I separate from you I will go into Anna mode and be all over him.  It was hard enough to break from it this time.  Will you be able to do it after I am swooning over Brad and our evening together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not pretend to have answers but I believe that you will pull through.  You are strong.\u201d  Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d  Adam said making a pathetic arm pump with a forced laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie said, \u201cText Brad tell him you are sick and don\u2019t want to hurt his playing ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam nodded saying, \u201cGood idea.\u201d  His slender fingers took his phone in hand.  Typing in Brad\u2019s information he paused before typing a message offering it to Marie.  Adam said, \u201cYou text him.  I don\u2019t trust myself.  I want to put in kissy and heart emojis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Adam\u2019s strain Marie took the phone.  Texted Brad that a sudden illness struck her and she didn\u2019t want him to catch it.  She anxiously waited for a reply.  If he showed she didn\u2019t know what they would do.  Feeling relief when the phone buzzed with a sad face emoji followed by a heart.  Marie responded in kind ending the conversation.  \u201cThat is done what do you want to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe a man but since that is out how about a movie night.  I will tell my mom you are staying over.\u201d  Adam said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe notebook.\u201d  Adam said causing Marie to jerk her head, \u201cKidding.

Walking together to the video store laughing at funny moments from their past like the time Chad Miller stepped on one of his shoelaces and fell over walking in the hall.  A classic moment of karma biting him.  His relentless efforts to make Adam\u2019s life in elementary school a living hell.  Then puberty hit and instead of being teased Anna found herself the object of desire as her breasts came in.  No he told himself he miss remembered again.  He bulked out and became an amazing athlete, that is what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifficult to forget that he was a woman with his breasts jiggled about on his chest.  Feeling their weight on his chest pressing home his situation.  Marie thankfully broke his brooding thoughts saying, \u201cWhat say we rent trolls 2?  We can debate whether it is arguably worse than sharknado.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile came to Adam\u2019s face, \u201cI don\u2019t know don\u2019t we have to watch the first one for context?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredulous Marie said, \u201cWe should panic if you can\u2019t remember that trolls 2 has nothing to do with the original trolls and it is goblins not trolls in trolls 2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy Marie I am teasing.  Trolls 2 burns itself onto your soul.  Think we can find Samurai cop for our horrible movie pleasure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt we\u2019ll find any of them here.  Let\u2019s grab a zombie movie and head out.\u201d  Adam nodded in agreement missing his once proud collection of bad movies.    The clerk eyed Adam\u2019s deep valleys running on instinct you bent over offering a better view.  With a punch to the arm Marie broke your spell.  Marie said, \u201cWhat happens when I am not around to help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I fall into busty babe mode till you break me out.  We simply need to do research to cure me.  I bet there are a bunch of occult stores that might help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could take finding you shirt up making out with a guy.\u201d  Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam said, \u201cNever imagined I would be the one having my chest fondled.  I need to remain calm about it and realize it is natural for my other self.  Still, I would rather not have those memories when restored.\u201d  They both spent a laughter and smile filled evening together.  Tossing popcorn into each others mouths.  Uncomfortable undressing in front of Marie, Adam changed into silken pajamas in the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie felt a tinge of jealousy over Adam\u2019s physical form.  She didn\u2019t see herself as bad looking but Adam\u2019s flawless skin and curved form often created that feeling in women.  They fell asleep talking like they used to.  Marie woke to find a note.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey bestie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad fun last night but needed to run out and get groceries.  Back in a jiffy.\u2019  The heart drawn on it alarming Marie.  Hurrying to get dressed before Adam regretted later his actions.  </span></div></div>",

He was half-in, half-out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis soft snoring, was genuine, and just as clearly he was nothing to do with the doll. Tightening her grip on the doll, she crushed it's waist.

Again, as she watched, inches washed from Adam's height, 3\", 4\", 5\", she paused, when he'd lost six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now almost the same height.

She began to manipulate the doll more bending then pulling and pushing in other places while pressing her lips tightly together she felt and art to shifting the doll and seeing the changes on her brother. She thought of some of the insults he used to say to her growing up more determined then ever to be sure big ole brother had none of those flaws...<br>\r\n  1st order was simple and took priority as she could still hear his voice saying to her...<br>\r\n   \" why do you even need to wear a bra?  <br>\r\n   You don't have any boobs!<br>\r\n     My God I have bigger boobs then you do!  lol  \"<br>\r\n  \"Check!\" in her cute girlish voice as she watched her moms red bra fill out fully under the tight shirt plus some! She gave him a beautiful set of breasts any MILF would be proud of...not just some puffy conical teens figure for his age, but a mature,full,wide set of firm,heavy,womanly breasts complete with deep cleavage and large dark areolas!!! The pair of them were beyond words even to her...they'd put any bra to its limit carrying them around all day! She was so giddy if this doll stopped working after this she'd be a happy girl the rest of her life seeing him with them everyday! She couldn't conceal her presence anymore making herself know she spoke up<br>\r\n  \"OMG Adam!  What are you doing?  Those are mom's clothes! \"<br>\r\n She had to play it up placing both hands on her hips taping her foot speaking so fast she never let him get a full sentence in...<br>\r\n I...I...I...ugh<br>\r\n  \"Are you wearing her underware too???  OMG you are! ....  Thats her new red bra I can see it's strap! <br>\r\nthen she just had to add<br>\r\n  \"Why are YOU even wearing a bra? You DOO000ooooo... have BOOBS!  \"<br>\r\n  as she reached out before he had chance to react and heft both up giving them a good bounce to confirm their weight and size!<br>\r\n   \" LOLOL  Well I guess YOU just WILL HAVE to KEEP WEARING one NOW!<br>\r\n  the look of shame of his face was priceless to be standing before his sister in his mothers clothes and underware! He hadn't even had time to notice the breasts that had filled out her bra he was wearing but was well aware of them now as he stared down in disbelief with his mouth wide open he bounced on his toes a few times to watch them wiggle.He glanced up to try and say something to her as his hands could finally move now on their own and crossed covering his ample assets now on his chest as he watched her butt sway back and forth in an exaggerated manner to her room with doll in hand as she snapped a taunt at him holding a hand up giving him the middle finger<br>\r\n  \"And you STILL have bigger boobs then me!

She was so elated to humiliate her tough ole brother who loved bringing her to tears with torments.Just the though of him sporting that set of tits she put on him and were going to stay on him if she could help it made all those bad times disappear!  =D <br>\r\n  She sat at her dressing table and quickly brushed out her hair then put it in a cute high ponytail before pulling a few strands to hang loose in the front as she gave her head a quick shake to watch it flip! Her head canted slightly as she looked to the two tubes of lipstick thinking which shade to wear? Her smile got bigger as she thought more about Adams fate..  <br>\r\n         \"Sweetheart.. (Covergirl 390)... or   (Covergirl 327.my favorite shades =D ) ...Bombshell?? \"<br>\r\n   She liked them both but decided on Sweetheart, it was lighter pink and just a bit more shimmery as she looked down to the doll sitting up on her table, she thought more about Adam pointing the other tube of Bombshell at the doll using that cute girly voice she had...<br>\r\n        \"Don't you worry Sweetheart,you're going to be a Bombshell when i'm done with you!\"<br>\r\n  Doing her top lip carefully she traced the full outline of her puffy cupids bow before quickly finishing her thicker bottom lip... rolling her lips in she pressed then wiggled them a bit to spread the shimmery lipstick just right before puckering at the doll and blowing it a kiss shaking the tube of Bombshell at it her eyes suddenly widened with excitement! Her fingers hovered in front of the doll still pinching the tube of lipstick... quickly spreading her fingers she released it like a bomb! <br>\r\n         \"BOOM!!!!!!  LOL  Get ready for a \"Bombshell\" big brother.. Lady parts! we need to give you the rest of your lady parts!\" <br>\r\n  Her hand now empty she quickly snatched up the doll as she did her handy work to it! Her head tilted as she focused more pressing those slick shimmery lips together then parting them slowly with her tongue as she finished getting that pirates smile on her cute face just picturing the warm slit and smooth puffy mound that was soon going to be the only thing in her brothers panties! <br>\r\n         \"BOOOOOOOOOM! \"<br>\r\n  She set the doll back down on her table to gaze upon it while leaning back as she giggled knowing exactly what was happening in her brothers room at that moment... a gasp then a girlish squeel followed by some begging soon died down to a muffled pleading then silence... a satisfied look on Emilies face she stood up grabbing her purse as she walked down the hall to Adams room pushing the door open..<br>\r\n  She didn't even look at him to acknowledge her handy work yet before sorting through her purse for a $10 and one of her other tubes of lipstick as she set her purse by the door. Adam set on the edge of his bed with his legs tightly together and tilted to the side while Emily walked up to him looking down.  She took her hand and firmly lifted Adams chin before she opened the lipstick and gave him a nice coat of her favorite color Bombshell! Closing it up with a click she wrapped the $10 around it and then pushed it down to disappear between Adams deep exposed cleavage! <br>\r\n         Would you be a \"Doll\" \"Sweetheart\" and pick me up a big box of the \"Super Tampons\" at the drugstore?.. You know its that time and mom and I are on the same cycle!\" <br>\r\n  There was an awkward silence then she couldn't help but break in it her own way remembering Adams new additions or exclusions as it may be now<br>\r\n         Ooooh ...yes... you might want to pick up 2 boxes!<br>\r\n   Emily couldn't help but giggle as she shrugged and spun on one foot walking to the door as she grabbed her purse and cutely glanced over her shoulder that ponytail doing a big flip then she gave a quick quip<br>\r\n        \"Boom!     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

The smirk on her face showed no compassion for Adams fate and she only planned more if he'd just come home! <br>\r\n  The sound of car horns honking made Emily stop painting her toenails and look towards her window wondering what was going on...  Then she heard a different honk, then another and a whistle that seemed closer yet.She put the bottle of polish down on her table to look outside only to see Adam walking down their street in his moms outfit and heels.Emily got the biggest smile on her face thinking OMG he did not go to the store like that!<br>\r\n   Finally hearing the front door she ran to meet him with a grin from ear to ear and just couldn't stop from snickering as he walked in closing the door then leaning back against it he took a deep breath and sighed heavily...all Emily noticed was the rack she gave him heave up then deflate slowly to settle back in their cups.<br>\r\n    \"You wore those to the store!   OMG it must be 3 miles each way...in heels?\"\"<br>\r\n  Emily shook her head<br>\r\n   \" You know mom has flats too you moron! even sandals  but 3\" heels  you're such a girl!  lol\"<br>\r\n   \"Here.....\"<br>\r\n Adams hand shot out handing her a bag...she nearly forgot as she peeked in it then smiled..<br>\r\n  \"Thank you so much! I only had 2 left!\"<br>\r\n  Emily took out the box of Tampons and sure enough he got the supers and 2 boxes at that! She turned and left him standing in the hall as she took her Tampons to her room setting one box in the bathroom her and Adam shared. Emily had no sooner started back on her nails and seen Adam standing in her doorway looking so pitiful. <br>\r\n  \"Em...can weee talk?\"<br>\r\n  Surprised by his tone and demeanor she smiled patting the seat next to her\"<br>\r\n   \"Sure... I can do your nails next\"  <br>\r\n  Turing her attention back to what she was doing she waiting for him to start glancing up occasionally while she finished her last foot straightening the cotton balls back as she rested her foot on the floor<br>\r\n   Em... have you seen or been around that freak Maria at school?<br>\r\n   \"Why what's it to you?   I've seen her before and she seems cool...I like her why?\"<br>\r\n    \"WHY? look at me!  I know that freak has something to do with this and you probably know!\"<br>\r\n    \"Moi..you say?\"<br>\r\n Emily reached over poking Adam in one of those gorgeous boobs he had sending ripples through his soft exposed flesh popping out of his moms top!<br>\r\n   \"You had best watch yourself girlfriend,i'm not in the mood for this.You know i'm on the rag\"<br>\r\n  Emily held her hand out wiggling her fingers as Adam looked a bit confused<br>\r\n   \"your foot\"<br>\r\n  She put his foot on her thigh as she put cotton balls between his toes holding up two colors of polish between hers fingers shaking her hand<br>\r\n   \"Pink or white?   forget it..   pink!  \"<br>\r\n   Adam felt even worse as Emily just acted like he was always like this...she was doing her brothers toe nails like this didn't shock her too to see her brother need a bigger size bra then their mom wore!  She finished both feet and Adams hands then heard a car pulling in their driveway as she slapped her thigh motioning him to put his feet back so she could pull out the cotton balls...putting her polish back on the rack she looked up to see Adam fishing around in his cleavage pulling out the lipstick she gave him earlier... she took it from his hand before he could sit it back on her table and opened it grabbing his chin lifting it up and holding his face still<br>\r\n   \"OMG  you know i'm not going to be here to do this for you all the time...it's lipstick... and you can keep it it looks so cute on you..i've got more\" <br>\r\n  she pushed it back down inside his cleavage pointing towards the door<br>\r\n  \" I suggest you meet mom at the door don't let her come up here and find you like this!\"  <br>\r\n  Adams heart was crushed as he walked into the kitchen to meet his mom...what could he say to explain this there was No sugar coating any of this ..well maybe none except if he had some candy flavored lipgloss...lol he sat at the nook his hands folded on the counter that was high enough to initially hide some of his chest as his mom opened the door walking to the nook and tossing her keys down and turing to the frig for a cold drink<br>\r\n   \" Hey baby... i like your naaaaaails!    Adam!...why are you wearing pink finger nail polish?\"<br>\r\n  Emily was already in the doorway to add to his humiliation<br>\r\n   \"because he didn't like the white mom\"<br>\r\n  \"Adam is there something i need to know Mr?   lipstick? \"<br>\r\n  \"don't you mean miss mom?   lol\"<br>\r\n  \"come here Mr right now!\"  <br>\r\n  As he stood his mother nearly fainted as she got the full view<br>\r\n   \"Are....are those what I think they are?<br>\r\n   \" yes they are mom\"<br>\r\n His moved closer grabbing Adams hand to look at his nails then gasp when she seen his chest move<br>\r\n   \"Those are real!!!!  omg where did you get the money for those!!!! <br>\r\n   Her hand pressed to her forehead she rubbed it shaking it side to side<br>\r\n  \"ok....ok ...if this is what you want....should we call you Amanda now? \"  <br>\r\n   She rolled her eyes as she stared at...Amanda saying nothing else<br>\r\n   \" Did you know this Emily?\"<br>\r\n    She just shrugged smiling<br>\r\n   \"i just seen him...i mean her wearing your stuff and  i guess its his..i mean her choice    At least she can't fit in my bra's or clothes!\"<br>\r\n   Their mom let out a huge sigh shaking her head side to side as she gave Amandas rack another good size up... <br>\r\n  \"Just how big ...what size are those!!!\"<br>\r\n   Amands mom still had no idea of the full changes her new had...and Emily was still perfecting Amanda through Maria's help.. Amanda,..she was still a growing teenage girl with lots of growing yet to do... i wonder if she's on birth control yet?

Maria was crushed by him and everyone knows how emotional and fragile young girls feelings can be!   And Emily....ha ha ha. Some of the cruelest bloodiest fights in history have been between siblings not strangers!  So Maria had some good forethought getting Emily involved against her brother/now budding sister!<br>\r\n   It wasn't much longer before Mrs Jenkins /Rebecca returned home. She was doing great as a single mom or Cougar as most seen her up until now Still looking a bit rattled she seemed to be taking the bull by the horns or utters in Amands case...lol...<br>\r\n   Quietly entering the house she went right to Emily's room seriously needing an ear.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \" Em...Emily...  Oh good you're here \" <br>\r\nShe got a cynical look as she added shaking her head side to side<br>\r\n  \" Both my daughter's here?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes momma.... Your other daughter is in her room sleeping\"<br>\r\n   \"Good...I really need to get some things of my chest while he...while she's still asleep\"  <br>\r\n\" I hear you mom believe me you're not the only one who needs something off their chest in this house\"<br>\r\n  \"Eeeem...stop it\"<br>\r\n  \"Fine then..but he's going to be stretching out your bras not mine and don't be asking me anymore if I borrowed any of your things\"<br>\r\n Em pressed her tongue slightly through her shiny pink grin pointing a finger towards Adams room with wide eyes . Her comments did put a smile on her mom's face sadly as she quickly tried to act serious<br>\r\n  \"Girl stop it..you are so bad...please just listen and let me talk\"<br>\r\nShe just motioned that her mom now had the floor as she returned a smile leaning back in the chair at Em's dresser relaxing a bit more as she let out a stressful sigh. <br>\r\n   Then unbuttoning several buttons on her fitted white blouse down to her belly button she left three to try and continue doing their job of concealing little of the rest of her pretty flowered pushup bra while her dainty well kept hands went up to pinch the tabs of her collar and fan them back and forth a few times.<br>\r\n Stretching her slender neck she twisted leaning to the side pulling the two gold burettes holding her long light brown hair up then tossing them on Em's dresser before beginning her talk..<br>\r\n  \"Much better.....  Now, I talked to Jennifer and Christy and they almost positively assured me that Adam...Amanda is on female hormones \"<br>\r\n  \"You think!!!  Lol\"<br>\r\n  Em just couldn't help herself but to state the obvious cupping her hands widely out in front of her own chest..her mom's eyes got wide tilting her head as she opened her mouth as if surprised by one of her quips again. Mom was quick to hold a finger out towards Em's \ud83d\udc44<br>\r\n   \"Shhhhh... Stop...What am I going to do with you girl. Let me finish\" <br>\r\n  \"Do with me! Don't you mean do with her!<br>\r\nAs she gestured again pointing towards Amanda's place<br>\r\n  \"Honey look...this may not be all over yet...i have no idea how far this has gone or even how long it's been happening,but if Adam is on female hormones they can do some serious things....  He can change, his skin, his hair,even his feelings and more noticeably his body.  Not just those either...ahhh\"<br>\r\n  Mom was quick to head her off smiling as she knew what was coming from Em's expressions<br>\r\n  \"I really need your help with this..you know, to keep things in balance and help out some more,even things like the laundry..you know, ... him,... her seeing things..it might help... Do you promise me honey?\"<br>\r\n  \"OMG.  MOMMA, he's a GIRL and still gets out of doing laundry.....uuuugh! He's such little princess!... FINE...<br>\r\n Em was ticked and her mom did nothing but give her more ideas as she mumbled to herself.... Changes... oh you bet there's about to be somemore changes...to our princess there!<br>\r\n \"Oh look I think I woke our princess up\"<br>\r\nWalking past her door was Amanda heading to the bathroom quickly followed by mom as she turned and mouthed quietly to Em<br>\r\n  \"We'll talk later...love you\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

A nearly bare teen girls vagina! <br>\r\n  Things didn't even start to get good until Em opened her mouth...but you knew that was coming.<br>\r\n  \"OMG.....did you get your period!\"<br>\r\nIt was like Emily hit them both with a stun gun buying her more time to gawk and speak freely as they stood frozen<br>\r\n  \"You did!....and you didn't even tell me!\"<br>\r\n Emily stomped her feet like she was left out of something important...  It was as if Amanda had broken some code of being a girl by not sharing she had her first period...give him or her a break she is new to this girly stuff..lol <br>\r\n   It wasn't until mom heard that word that she came out from under her spell... \" PERIOD?\" her brain had to delete the first information she saw to have room for this word alone  <br>\r\nHim+Breasts-Him+Her+Panties+TamponString= PERIOD!!!!!! <br>\r\nMoms mouth agape in shock it just registered as her eyes also seen what Emily had to blurt out to finish her problem to get the same answer!

Amanda was now Offically a Woman in Emily's eyes but she had her excitement cut short as usual by momma as she reached to turn Emily's head away and say...<br>\r\n  \"Go...now... go\"<br>\r\n  \"God! What's the big deal...it's just a pussy!  We've aaaall got one!

This was going to be much better with Emily absent although mom kept and eye and ear open occasionally looking to the door before just starting out<br>\r\n   \"what's going on here?  how did you get thoooose and ..and that?\"<br>\r\n   \"I don't know mom....i just had a dream .... things just...you know... it was like it came true...and Marie she..she hates me\"<br>\r\n Mom pressed her lips together tightly and looked very somber not really knowing where to take this next...she had taken the opportunity putting the teddy over Amanda's head to look closely for scars around her huge areolas  .or under those impressive breasts.even at her arm pits but her skin was smooth and supple as could be even the subtle drape from their weight looked just perfect for firm breasts that size... almost like magic they were perfection!... one thing did strike Beca as odd,that  was the size and color of her areaolas and nipples...most women breasts didn't look like that unless they had given birth and carried milk before!.. go figure.??<br>\r\n  now that.. yes she thought a vagioplasty if she had that done she had missed something for quite sometime! She didn't have Amanda pull her panties down but she looked perfect there too! Well nearly perfect besides the fact her little kitty had obviously swallowed a mouse whole sporting a cute camel toe and the tail still dangling from her kittys mouth!<br>\r\n   \" listen we have a long weekend, how bout we go to the thrift store and just look around a bit...you can try on some different things and see what you like..you know bras are expensive and before we buy you a bunch i just want to be sure you're still happy\"<br>\r\n  Like if she had a choice I don't think she'd be wanting any D or DD however big he/she was at that moment..mom stood quietly and hesitated as Amanda was fidgeting more and seemed nervous pulling her knees together until a faint dribbling could be heard ,moms eyes widened as she opened her mouth a finger up but said nothing at first then turned to rush out but stopped again briefly to say one more last thing!<br>\r\n  \"honey wrap those up and put them in the trash don't flush it...i'll send Em back with another pair of panties...i'm so sorry that was my fault honey not yours\"<br>\r\n  The door clicked as Amanda stood up quickly pulling those now wet black panties off and kicking them towards the tub as she thought \"oh great I just pee'd in my panties in front of my mom!\"  Now pulling at a moist pee soaked string Amanda's little kitty now spit out a heavy chewed up bloody mouse that she held loosely by it tail as she began to relax and finish what she started in moms presence... oh gross.. how much worse can this get!\" she thought????<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   \"</span></div></div>",

The more girly she became the warmer and content she felt until that feeling would somehow get broken. Emily heard feet shuffling and some cabinet doors closing and ran to her doorway in wait. Only a few seconds later Amanda appeared looking disheveled and shaken on the way back to her room. Emily popped out like a cat grabbing her by her now long slender arm<br>\r\n  \"Where you going?\"<br>\r\n  \"please Em things are bad enough\"<br>\r\n  \"whats wrong with you now?  Your pink panties in a bunch?\"<br>\r\n  \"THATS NOT FUNNY!  are you really that stupid girl!   how can i go back to school looking like this! Everyone's talking about me now!  Theres no way i can hide these anymore everyone thinks i'm some freak!\"<br>\r\n   \"over half of the school are girls and we have no problems with THESE so I suggest if you don't like them then, then you had best man up and be a big girl like us!!  ....  get in here and let me look at you\"<br>\r\n  Emily was having a good time and about to rub the magic in deeper yanking hard on Amandas arm she pulled her into her room then pushed her against her tall dresser.She stepped back with a smirk on her face and studied her much much closer.Her smirk soon turned to a smile as she could feel her aura running her hands up and down her sides pushing harder and deeper. Emilies hands caressed her hourglass even deeper.There was now no denying a cute feminine hourglass shape.<br>\r\n  \"Come here and sit in my chair\"<br>\r\n Em took out her brush and brushed out his straight just short of shoulder length hair, Then she parted it sharply in front to the side then went for her black liquid eye liner.A little mascara and earth tone eye shadows the only thing missing was a nice lipstick.. she had something more sinister to add to her look.What every girl just needs but some sweet thick DSL's...a little lip venom (DuWop LipVenom lip plumper) went a long way next a topping of pink what could be more then Spellbound (CoverGirl 325) to finish them off!<br>\r\n  \"look you can go back to school as a kind of goth chic no one will even care... you look cuter then hell!\"  <br>\r\nAmanda got a smile and that warm feeling as she turned to see Em's work.She turned her head from side to side and finally felt glad to look so pretty but a sickening feeling soon filled her stomach as she ran to the bathroom to wretch. Em was quick on her heels and stood in the door watching her drop to all fours and puking. Her eyes grew wide as she stared at how big her ass had gotten and was right now looking forward to their big day tomorrow shopping<br>\r\n  \"it's just your period you'll be fine i'll fix up your face again tomorrow\" <br>\r\n  With that Em swaggered back to her room flopping across her bed as she savored another bomb eXpolded!<br>\r\nWhat she hadn't known was Amanda was fine until she stared in the mirror and pictured those big shimmery pink pillowy  DSL's the same as every red blooded guy like he USED to be would! </span></div></div>",

Mandy kept squirming around looking for a more comfortable position the weight of her chest shifted side to side pressing into her arms was very distracting... <br>\r\n  But like nights before she slid into a deep rem state....<br>\r\n Her breathing now methodical now quickening in pace her dreams began tp unfold....<br>\r\n  (-.-) ooOO  \"Adam...Adam  whats that pink on your mouth? Come here let me see...\" <br>\r\nHe felt a tug on his now slender arm as he looked to the ground remembering the pink on his lips to hide them... jerking away quickly he stood to his feet and still kept looking away. A terrifying feeling, he began to panic looking for somewhere to wipe them but anything he seen wouldn't be easily hidden <br>\r\n  Lifting his arm to cover his face his arm brushed against his large well endowed breast.Now bending over further to try and hide he had these firm soft breasts.With two bigger things to hide he ran for his pride.He was pursued down several narrow halls which seemed like his school but wasn't by his friend. Up and down stairs he just couldn't shake him! Once he made it outside it was getting dark and ran towards the darkest parts of town. <br>\r\n He could see people in the distance which didn't seem the type you wanted to run into but as he turned around his friend yelled not to go in there.  Still panicked and frightened he slowed his pace and turned into a dimly lit hallway.He stripped off his shirt throwing it down in the hallway followed by his sweatpants only leaving his bra and panties. Turning the next corner he came a room with a faint red glow as he ran into it shutting the door. <br>\r\n  Squatting down he began to look around scanning the room while he tried to catch his breath.Suddenly seeing a mirror he realized he was now more noticeable. He tried to wipe the pink off his lips.  But it was like it was tattooed and never coming off. Standing back to his feet he walked to the door and pressed his ear close to it to listen. He knew he had to run but going out like this he was afraid his friend would still find him. He had no choice but dig through the closet in the room for something else to wear. <br>\r\n  His mouth suddenly fell open as he moved closer to see only pretty dresses and skirts with low cut tops that filled it! Closing his eyes he shook his head and opened the door to exit the room.Slowly.he crept down the hall looking around for his own clothes he quickly had discarded.They had to be here he thought but they were no where to be found Letting out a depressing sigh he quietly went back walking back into the room and into the closet.<br>\r\n   He knew he had to hurry but there were so many pretty clothes he worried his friend would find him.It was a tough choice but he chose a pretty beige sundress and sandals. Finally he came out of the closet and walked to the door opening it only to see a blinding light.He came to a field with a old majestic looking tree the held a small figure upon it then suddenly woke up!<br>\r\n  \"Huuuh\"<br>\r\nSitting up quickly to see where he was his head swiveled looking round his room. Two hands next followed reaching up to the jostling he felt on his chest as he looked down to a pair of large heaving breasts. Letting out a soft sigh ,He then thought how lucky he was just to be out of that damn closet!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hoping that somehow the machine would trip a safety and snatch him back to the present. Adam listened with his heart in his throat, as the pitch of the straining machine rose and rose, straining towards a peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's body was becoming indistinct, as the tone rose towards a shriek of outrage. Feeling like his flesh was being ripped apart atom by atom. He started to scream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream too, rose in pitch, passing beyond his normal tones... taking on a feminine shrill edge. Adam was stunned momentarily to silence in surprise by his new more womanly shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance downwards confirmed his lab coat remained only as a memory.

Shaking her head futilely trying to deny the evidence of her own eyes, Eve felt her chest start to feel real, as if she were about to return to the real world, and slip back into a new era...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/d1/e5/7dd1e572f41e8dda1b11f8c00a00fdbc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/d1/e5/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... <i>No</i>.... <i><b>No!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer denials breathy, and sensual, her tone now impossibly alluring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognised it... Her new body, as plucked from a page... perhaps from history or shaped by the memory. But Eve was about to become a milk maid. Whimpering, as she felt another surge in growth, Eve wondered if she'd need milking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden -<i>snap</i>- silence fell. The whine of the lab equipment gone, and Eve found herself in a field filled with wild flowers, and only the sound of lowing cows to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/ce/3b/00ce3bf66d3d330ca326b7adea65aac4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/ce/3b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve took in her final form with a reluctant acceptance, her life as Adam was gone.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, he became aware he wasn't lying down. His eyes scrunched shut, he went to pull the sheets higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the edge of the material, it felt wrong in his grip. His fingers curling the wrong way. But still sleepy, and eager for a longer snooze, he tugged it higher. It was then that he felt an answering shift come from his chest. A warm fleshy shimmy, that felt entirely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping open, Adam found himself in a ... he wasn't sure. It took him a few moments for him to adjust to the muted light of the room. But, as he adjusted, it was clear the walls were lined with shelves and the shelves were lined with bottles. It was the back room to bar. An old stuffed chair in need of repair in a back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Adam had more pressing distractions. The waist hugging orange hot-pants, Even that was only visible through the canyon of cleavage that pulled at his... her shoulders. The fabric yanked high, serving more as a collar or necklace than a top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErupting from the chair, her chest heaved wildly, threatening to throw Adam wildly around. A heavier rump also threatening to pull her back into the burgundy, velour padded chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she tugged her top back down. The friction as it brushed over her ripe nipples pulling a soft moan from her lips. Snatching her fingers back, as if afraid of contamination, a hank of golden blonde hair flashed past her eyes. She muffled the startled scream, as her heart raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adele.\" a voice called through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntuitively, Adam knew this was her. She was Adele. Her hair flashed back and forth, as her head turned to look for any other escape, any other door. Hell, even a window large enough for her to crawl out. But the pale, bare light above showed no other exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to be cornered, you reach for the handle with your trembling fingers. The hubbub jumps as the door opens, the noise of eager customers being unmuffled by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping fully into public view, Adele felt like a piece of meat. A sumptuous feast for the customer's eyes to devour. Their gazes lewd and open, as they leered at her curves. The soft swell of her rear in the fluorescent orange pants, the even more unsettling feeling, as they checked for camel toe. She was only barely aware of how much her bust moved, each shimmy making her top climb just a fraction higher. The curve of her breasts emerging further and further into sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/b3074ea54c205f41382f1136caba842a/tumblr_opbm55uFOp1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/b3074ea54c20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customers were also rather brightly dressed, with the latest in high-fashion from the eighties with mullets topping far too many heads, and clothes too heavily inspired by Micheal Jackson, Prince and Miami Vice. Adele even forgot for a second, her own outfit, her own changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resounding, 'complimentary', slap on her arse, as a customer squeezed past her felt like it burned, felt like the sound would echo around the room. She was too shocked, to humiliated to even respond before he was out of reach, triumphant smiles reflecting back from his table mates.</span></div></div>",

Pressing against the back of her thighs, she tottered forward until she was pressed against the table, her balance rather precarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirmed against the encompassing arm, before looking more closely at the customer. Her mouth opening in a gasp of realisation, as she recognised Marie. Or rather Marie if she'd been born male. The same features, just a little squarer, the body stronger, the triumphant smile more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Adele's gaze passed around the small table, she recognised, the male features of all of Marie's transformed friends. Charlene now Chad, built like a footballer, instead of the petite cheerleader who topped the pyramid. Stephanie now Scott, with a wicked glint in his eye. His intelligence clear and undiluted, unashamed. Completing the table was Rachel now Rick, the geek of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Adele pinned in place, she felt the roaming hands of Chad caressing one full ass cheek. The other receiving attention from Scott, the delight in Adele's discomfort rather too plain. Across the table, Rick took the excuse of distance to not grope their hostess. Although, it was his cough, that broke up roaming hands, as their attention was noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might appreciate the experience.\" Mark informed her. His gaze covering her body, with the charm of a slug. She felt a shudder, as if his gaze was leaving a trail of slime over her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learn to take a compliment, .... toots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo quickly to be blocked, Mark's hand darted up. Firmly pulling her top down, until she was more discretely dressed. Just as quickly, he waved his hand to the bouncer. Proudly showing that he wasn't groping the waitress, instead making her more decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly gave their order to the still distracted Adele. \"This will only last for tonight, if you use your charms, to get enough in tips.\" His gaze focusing intently on her nips, as he mentioned 'charms', it was clear that Marie/Mark was in charge of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you want a longer experience, or fail to get enough, you can repeat tonight until you manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless it's beyond you.\" Chad chuckled, his laugh low and filthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine, this is all you're made for....\" Rick said with a lewd wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though ....\" Scott's insult died in his throat, falling silent, he fell into a limp silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night passed in humiliation for Adele, excusing wandering hands. Pretending that the customers had to squeeze past her so close. The snorting sniffs as she passed near certain tables. Mark and <i>his </i>friends were almost well-behaved in comparison. She felt black and blue, from the pats, cheapened by the <i>compliments</i>. Her colleagues were just as harsh, treating her as just another simpering fool, relying on her beauty, to cover some low stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam had never really doubted his intelligence. He wasn't a brain, being more sporty, than studious. But as Adele, she was constantly undermined and insecure, her arithmetic questioned with every bill. Eyes on her shoulders checking her figures, as much as leering at her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of losing too much in tips, she simpered and giggled at all the jokes, squirmed, faking pleasure at the touches, until the night, until her shift was finally over. Mark and his cohorts had already left by this point, but she still heard his voice, distant but clearly, as she reached the tip jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whisper of 'Congratulations', hissed snake-like in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering at the imagined proximity, and sighing in relief, Adele knew she'd never repeat have to this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on a long raincoat, finally feeling clothed Adele head for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... but the trial isn't over, you've merely passed the first hurdle.\" Adam's voice sibillant and eerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the doorframe, the air rippled as if reality were struggling. A customer slipped past, oblivious to her hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading what was coming, Adele steadied her nerves before stepping though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1:</b> Adele found herself on the beach, the fashions reminding her of the fifties?<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/86e230331e0e10e021177b15bb560c2b/tumblr_ortpd8Og231u3wdwxo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/86e230331e0e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2: </b>Adele hugged her letterman jacket close, like a comforting presence.

He couldn't spot that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was when he brought his hands up to a few inches from his face that he got the first sense of something, very, very wrong.

Rolling his shoulders, he felt the weight shift on his chest. But, it was his hands that were discovering vast expanses of new flesh. He had an ass, far larger than he'd ever had. It's size was undeniably feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading the worst, he twitched as his hands made contact, at the base of his spine. The fleshy mounds dipping into what was undoubtedly an incredible ass. Nodding to himself, he readied himself for the final discovery, the ultimate test and definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands worked back around, his thumbs tracing the outline of a belly button. Hissing in anticipation, his hands dipped lower... and lower, still hunting, still hoping to find his familiar cock.

It takes an effort for you to stop the fidgetting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she nods again, and you recall some deep memory. With a gasp, you hold out your hand. Fingers spread wide, you take in the small web of flesh between your thumb and fore finger. Shaking your head in denial, you see it. Tattooed into your flesh, the company logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyn-tech, a stylised pink oval inside a pyramid. The penalty for performing that on a real human is the death penalty.

Stepping through, she nods to it, and you close the door. It has a thick window, allowing you to see the scantily dressed women inside.

Having read the sign, you feel, or imagine you do the gentle humm filling the air, the vibration of engines telling you that you're in flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, cutie...\" Janice gives your ass an awkward pat, startling you into motion. She seems just as jumpy as you, keeping a few paces ahead of you, and out of reach of a revenge pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt left you wondering, if that's how she thought you should be addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a gynoid.\" you tell her. But the company logo silently calls you a liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just snorts, and keeps walking. Tuning out your attempts at conversation as a mechanical or software defect. Mind still whirling with your own questions, you need some new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the ship?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we... going?\" you hesitate, avoiding a stutter. Is it we, or you? Do you count as a passenger, or cargo.
