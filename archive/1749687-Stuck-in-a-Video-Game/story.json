Last night, no different from any other summer night--You stayed up late. You have a slight sense of guilt, knowing you told your parents you'd be going to sleep at eleven o'clock and ended up staying past midnight, but that feeling fades away quickly. You look out the window from your bed to see the sun up and shining, the sky still slightly golden from what remains of the sunrise. You then turn to look at the clock - 9:00 AM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the clanking of plates and can now smell the familiar aroma of bacon seeping into your room. You wonder why everyone's up so early. You rest your head back down on your pillow and close your eyes, trying to get the most out of whatever time you have left to sleep-in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you begin to settle in...</span></div></div>",

Just as you try closing your eyes back shut, you hear the door open up real quick. You're jolted out of your peaceful rest as your bed is pounced on violently by your little sister. \"Come on, get up brother, breakfast is ready\", she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally gets off your bed, you bear the burden of getting up. Once you slowly ease your way off you take nice stretch trying to shake off the unexpected pounding you took. You then get dressed and begin to walk over to the dining room. As you make your way downstairs, you notice the cartoons on the TV and realize it's a Saturday - You always have a early breakfast on Saturdays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get to the dining room, you see, to your delight, a nice pile of pancakes waiting on a plate just for you. \"We've been waiting for you to get up\", your mom says. \"Yeah\", Chloe says. \"Well, at least up you're up now.\" You dig in to your delicious platter, a worthy way of consolation for your violent wake-up. After filling yourself up, you ask to be excused, and go back to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look for a video game to play, since you have a smaller TV in your bedroom, and the TV downstairs obviously won't be available for a while. After looking for a while, you realize that none of the games you have currently fit your interest.</span></div></div>",

You find three 20's and a 5, and figure that'll be enough to buy a few used games. You then look at the clock - 11:19 - they should be open by now. You walk downstairs and ask Dad if you can go. \"Sure\", he says. Then you grab your shoes and begin to put them on, \"Don't forget to take your phone\", Mom says. You finish tying your shoes and then grab your phone and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost always walk to the used game store, since it's only a few blocks away. Your family is usually too busy doing their own things during the weekends anyways. The only time your family gets together is usually during dinner, a Saturday breakfast, or during the holidays. Today was forecast to get into the 90's, but so far it felt pretty good outside, and there were some other people outside enjoying the nice weather too.</span></div></div>",

You think to yourself, disappointed. You then decide to leave, unwilling to weave through traffic, knowing most of the interesting games must be taken by now. Right as you turn to leave, you here someone say \"Justin!\" You recognize the voice right away, and turn to see your friend Ryan. \"Come over here, I've got something for you!\" he says, \"Oh yeah, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell ya, It's a surprise\", he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads you into the back room of the store. You've never been in here before, but know that it's used to store whatever games or items they don't have enough room to display. You're astonished by all the games they have here, but what's even more surprising is the fact that they have stairs leading to a basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get down there, you see a large kid who looks like he's about two years older than you. He looks like a typical nerd, so you figure he knows some things about video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan introduces you to him, and asks the kid to show you his surprise. \"I present to you...\" he says, \"the VIDEO GAME TELEPORTER 3000!!!\" You try to hold your laughter down into a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"TELEPORTER\" happens to be an old TV connected to a video game console, and what appears to be the equipment used to take photos of students on 'picture day'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks so hilarious, you decide to take a photo of it on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you want to try it out?\" the kid says.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt first, you figure it's probably just a typical prank by an older kid, but you can tell, by the expression on his face, that he's being serious. You then decide to give it a shot, you really doubt that a high school kid could possibly create something only Willy Wonka could imagine anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what game should I should I 'teleport' you to?\" the kid asks, eager to test his invention...</span></div></div>",
