Other than that, things have been fine with your body, but that's being very nice. You take things one day at at time, and special provisions were always made at your school for your condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour biggest problems tended to come  at home with your overly doting Mom always wanting to \"baby\" you, though luckily not literally, at least not yet, and your younger, and full size, sister constantly wanting to play pranks on you. Despite all this, you can usually tell they care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, you're moving to a new town, and to a new school. The School has been made aware of your needs, but you've yet to meet any of the faculty or students. You're also still in the middle of unpacking at your new home, and your Mom has been acting strangely, even for her, working in a room of the house she keeps claiming is a \"surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",
