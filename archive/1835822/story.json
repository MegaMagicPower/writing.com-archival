Tell me, is Tails still with the other children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he will be at Acorn's palace for another hour, then I was going to send Eric to bring him back. You know how fidgety he gets when he stays inside too long, wanting to take off flying like his little bird friends.\" Rosemary showed her husband the trio of birds on the windowsill of the house, outside the room of their first son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Eric would like that, but we should remind to take his time, instead of rushing back so soon. I'm starting to think he is avoiding Tails' friends on purpose.\" Amadeus stated bluntly as he pulled another tulip out, now thinking on what he was going to say to his son when the time came to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inside the Prower home, Eric's room</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was repairing one of the clocks that broke in his room while his parents worked on the garden outside. Even though he was only 6, he had a knack for fixing things. Even Rotor, who was honored with the same gift and a few years older than him, said that he should keep up the good work and practice regularly. Not too far from him, Copper,Lead and Nickel were standing on his windowsill, watching him work without making too much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birds had claimed Eric as family when he saved Nickel from a large snake as a few years back, so they stuck around to make sure he was safe like one of the kids. They saved him from serious danger more than once from tweeting and directing him away from threats so his mother and father were thankful enough to let them stay around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Eric had finished fixing his clock, he placed it onto his dresser before he heard something that would haunt him for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard his mother scream, before he heard a few loud zaps and flashes of light from his window. Confused and scared, Eric went to the window to find out what happened when he saw a group of Swatbots holding his unconscious parents before loading them onto a ship that landed nearby. A large fat man and a small skinny man were talking in the distance but Eric recognized them to be Julian Robotnik and his assistant Snively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, the Great General Amadeus and his wife, they will be proud trophies for my citizens to see.\" Robotnik laughed as he sent the ship away. \"If memory serves, he should have two sons in the house. Find them and bring them out here, alive.\" At once Robotnik's Swatbots went into the house to find Eric and Tails, but only found Eric, who was in shock while third birds tried to protect him from the robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took the Swatbots 9 seconds to kill the birds before dragging Eric out of the house by his two tails, while he kicked and scream and swore with words he really shouldn't have learned at that age, out to the grinning madman that was Robotnik. \"Only one subject was in the house sir.\" A Swatbot reported to Robotnik as he held Eric in the air by his tails in front the fat monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is your brother dear child?\" Robotnik asked Eric while he rubbed his hand through Eric's hair with a smirk, which quickly changed to a snarl as Eric bite down hard on his hand, pulling his starting to bleed hand back before more damage could be done. \"You will regret that worm, I will enjoy roboticzing you. Take him away, knock him out if you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to struggle one more time before something dense hit the side of his head and all he could feel was himself falling into darkness of unconsciousness... </span></div></div>",

Eric then slowly looked around and saw he was in a cell and felt his eyes tear up and started to cry and wail a little. He missed his family, his birds, and his friends, all of which were taken from him by Robotnik. The thought of Robotnik filled Eric with an emotion he never felt before, wrath. In a blind rage, Eric punched the wall next to him and flinched as his soft hand started to bleed and throb as bad as his head, promoting another wave of crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, shut up!\" A rather harsh voice across the room yelled at Eric, which came from a rather large beefy Lion, also stuck in a cell. \"You're not the only one with problems you spoiled brat! So do us all a favor and shut the fuck up so we can sleep before we get changed!\" The lion growled before he flipped his back to Eric, who was shocked that the lion was so violent with him and scared of being hurt again, so he moved to a corner and tried to calm himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his cowering, Eric noticed that there was a beam of light directed at the center of his room and looked up to find a barred window. Without any hesitation, he tried to climb the wall to look out the window, which was harder to do with one of his hands possibly broken yet he managed to get his eyes up enough to look out into the world. It was already sunset and he managed to see a lot of Mobotropolis, so he must've been held somewhere close to the palace. He thought about yelling and scream out for help, but the Lion scared him too much and his voice was lost on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric started to shake and let himself rest back on the cold ground, clutching his now swollen and bruised hand. He tried to just sleep, hoping that it was just a nightmare and his mother Rosemary would help him forget it...    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next morning...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric woke up to sound of metal joints whining as his cell door opened, in front of him was a very large Swatbot who stood like a statute. \"Get moving prisoner, Robotnik demands your presence.\" Eric however noticed could try to run past the Swatbot and get away from the cell he was forced into. He could even try to break the robot since he still had a mini screwdriver in his pocket from fixing his clock before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood up and also tried to think of other ways to get free while the Swatbot stood motionless outside his cell door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric was just a six year old fox who had never gotten into a situation that others couldn't help him out of it, he even slept with a light on, how could he possibly react quick enough to get free? He saw no other real choice that wouldn't get him hurt more than he already was, so he stood up and walked out of the cell, following the Swatbot while holding his injured hand. He then realized when they walked down the corridor, that there was a small army of Swatbots waiting at the exit, with large, lethal weaponry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being put on an elevator that seemed to go on forever, The Swatbot lead Eric to a massive chamber with large computer monitors on top of the biggest computer Eric had ever seen. If not for the bad conditions, Eric would've went over to the computer and started to take it apart to find out how it worked. Yet the guards surrounding it seemed to deter that idea as Eric was forced to kneel on a large circular pattern on the floor, while the chair in front of him turned and a sitting Robotnik faced him with a rather dark frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a merciful overlord that I am, I will give you one last chance to answer my question I asked you when we found you. I want you to take your time with this, as the wrong answer will keep you in that little room you woke up in and your parents in their room. The truthful response will get you and your family free to go.\" Robotnik droned as he stared at the blue fox beneath him. \"Where is that brother of yours and his friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric clenched his hands and looked down in fear of the red eyes watching him, like a mouse caught by a large cobra. \"The last I saw Tails was went he was going to the palace to play with his friends. I don't know where he would go, or where he is now, please let us go.\" Eric answered truthfully as he looked Robotnik in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik stated to play with his mustache while he thought about Eric's answer, yet he stood up and walked over to the computer. \"Isn't she a beauty? More processing power than any computer to date, and connected to every camera in Mobotropolis. This is why I believe you, my dear boy as I saw your brother here in the garden with a number of his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed in relief and actually started to smile. \"Oh thank you Mr. Robotnik. Can I leave with my parents now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was confused for a second and thought he misheard Robotnik. \"I'm sorry sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't all I was looking for Prower,\" Robotnik answered as he faced Eric again, this time with his robot hand on top of a button. \"I'm sure you have some idea where Tails and his friends went, tell me or the same rules apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sir... I told you I don't know. I only know a couple of Tails'  friends, I have no idea where they'd be other than the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me the names you do know.\" Robotnik stated as his hand moved a bit up from the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to think and also wondered what the button Robotnik was almost touching would do, but didn't want to know. \"Well, um, Sally Acorn, Sonic, uh and... some rabbit?\" He left out his knowledge of Rotor, since he looked up to him like a brother and didn't want to get him hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik then pressed a different button and what sounded like a recording of Eric's scared voice played his statement again. \"Is that all you have to offer?\" He asked when the recording was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes sir? Now can I go be with my Mom and Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard a chuckle come from Robotnik, before his hand laid on the button he was touching before. \"No, but I will give you a place as my first roboticizer victim!\" Robotnik then pressed the button with an evil laugh as a machine came from below Eric and started to surround him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was trying to figure out a way of the roboticizer when he remembered his screwdriver in his pocket. He then frantically twisted the screws off of whatever parts he could reached to break the machine. When a light started to shine beneath him, Eric tried to rip parts off with his bare hands and for a second it seemed like he was disabling the machine when the light flickered and sparks started to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Eric could hear alarms and yelling but the machine's whine was deafening to hear exactly what was said but Eric could tell that things weren't going to their plans. Eric almost smiled but it was quickly wiped away when the light came back and was even brighter than before, almost burning his retinas when he looked down at it, like the sun was magnified directly on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eric opened one eye to see what he was facing and saw something strange. The parts of the machine he tore off were floating around him in a circle as more parts were being torn off from the gears.They then glowed red before they each attached to his body, burning into his skin, fusing to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Eric couldn't feel a thing, even as he saw a large part go for his head, he didn't flinch as it attached to the left side of his head, covering an eye. It was only when several currents of electricity went through his body, focusing primarily in the machine parts, caused him to pass out within seconds before the change was complete. When the protective cover was lowered, Robotnik saw what had happened and yet instead of getting angry, he actually looked pleased with his new creation.</span></div></div>",

It was what he wanted, yet the fox had altered the process enough to keep at least half of his form. Robotnik scanned the cyborg and found that while he had control, the boy could choose to accept it or could break free. He was so close to perfection, and with a few new alterations, all who went into the roboticizer would be true robots, all thanks to little Eric Prower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought the boy could be a hassle, Robotnik saw potential of a new agent. He would have to be trained of course, and fed, but he would be the one who could take down any sort of resistance King Acorn may have, including Princess Sally, without others seeing him as a threat. A true shadow agent, who would be called Ironfist from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snively,\" Robotnik spoke to his assistant in almost a breathless voice. \"Put him in a private cell, off the records, and run tests on his capabilities in the labs.

It seemed he was placed in a private cell, somewhere high up in a tower since the room was circular. Eric scratched his head to get rid of a painfully annoying itch and found that he was bleeding from his forehead. Alarmed, he tore off his sleeve and pressed it against his head. Eric then wondered why he suddenly felt so heavy and how he got to the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when the pieces of the puzzle came into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then raised both of his hands and realized that one of half of his body was mechanical or better put, robotic. He couldn't move his left arm or leg and his left eye was just pitch black. Eric the looked for a mirror or some kind of reflecting surface, something to see what that roboticzier did to him, and saw a puddle of rainwater forming under his window. Eric didn't noticed it was raining but quickly looked into the water forming to see the extent of the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a dirty, matted, cyborg freak fox look back at him with shock and fear. Eric grabbed at his face and touched where he was changed, including his new robotic eye, which was not turned on. Wrath filled him again and he grit his teeth, Robotnik would pay for robbing him of his family, his friends and roboticzing him. Eric then checked his pockets for his screwdriver and could not find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey freak.\" a voice in the shadows of his cell sneered at him, prompting Eric to face the shadows as a small man, not much taller than him appeared. \"Comfortable? As of now, you are property of Robotnik's. You will do everything we demand and you will live, if not, I can permanently unplug you right now. The first thing you will do, is stick out your arm through the bars, the flesh one.\"</span></div></div>",

So we have to charge you up like a reusable battery until you can move and make your own power.\" Snively gripped a lever and smiled cruelly. \"This will hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't even yell before the lever flipped and electricity coursed through his body like dropping a powerline into a pool of water with him engulfed. Eric screamed and yelled his lungs out and thrashed violently, convulsing in his restraints, screaming out pleads for mercy and to be free. Yet he didn't get any mercy as he felt his body suddenly hurt less and less until he realized he could move his left side and could see out of his left eye. Although it seemed like the world was in green and scales and charts flew past his sight of his body and conditions. He almost felt like he had full control of himself, despite being half scrap metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Scanning... charge holding at 50%, basic systems stabilized. Scan complete. Warning, unidentified platform  located, begining threat scan...\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what is that?

That is your new system, the one that will replace and improve yourself to a status above any normal person. Provided you train, as of now you could hardly handle any serious combat, let alone walk.\" Snively  spoke matter of factly before he released the bars holding Eric in place and watched him collapse the ground. \"You currently have the equivalent of a hundred and fifty pounds of metal attached permanently to your meager 75 pounds. It will take time, but you will learn to adapt to it and make it your ally in any situation beyond these walls. But if not, you will make a good paperweight for Dr. Robotnik, it doesn't matter much in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his head buzz before he heard the voice again, still booming loudly in his head. \"<b>Scan complete, identity as Eric Flint Prower, age 6 years and three months, threat level- No creditable threat.

Eric was put through hell with several experiments that were test his limits and abilities to real life situations. Runs against time, with certain motivation if he were to stop, drugs, stress tests were a daily requirement. He would often crash the second the day was over, only to be woken up to loud screams and robotic dogs. Eventually, Eric grew stronger each day that he was subjected to the torture, but he didn't stop attempting to escape. In three years, he had tried to get away countless times, but he would always fail. His battery would be too low and shut him down, he would get caught climbing down the side of the tower, and even was caught hiding in one of the bathrooms that had a few guards inside who heard him. He had made his system less deafening in his ears when it gave tactical advice that he could never do, he managed to walk almost the same as before but he couldn't slouch like before, as his spine had been changed as well, making him stand straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he wasn't as clueless as before, he learned a lot from his kidnappers, particularly the short man known as Snively. Eric learned to make every second count with using his resources for the best possible result days later, a skill that helped him with \"borrowing\" objects to break out of his cell with many times before. He also learned that having an ear around all corners came in handy, especially when you hear something important like codes for doors or shifts of guards. Of course he was caught and punished until he could barely move his body, but he had also learned how to managed the intensity of pain, so he almost hardened up so it would damage him as much. Yet he still dreamed of the outside, free from the bars on windows and existence he called a life in his cell, dancing for the fat man Robotnik every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't even sure why he was pushed this way anymore, at first he thought it was because he was defenseless and easy. But yet the specific manners how he was tortured had him almost curious for what kind of purpose he was to have. But he didn't plan for sticking around, he had a makeshift pick and rake from a pen and bobby pin he found in the maze, hoping the previous owner was alright, as well as a listening device so he could hear around him for farther. It was a matter of when, but it was only if he was careful where he hid his stuff and made sure his robotic eye was covered with a patch he made from his ratty old clothes, which would warn Robotnik what he was up to. All he needed to do was to pick his way out and do it.</span></div></div>",

Older animals took shots at Swatbots and other robots as they moved towards a generator that power half the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, plant it Sally and get out of here!\" An older eagle yelled before he was hit and dropped like a stone paralyzed as others moved to cover his end. The squirrel pulled out a small box from her pack and placed it by the generator as everyone started to run for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally ran as hard as she could but she could not help but see her friends slowly taken away by Robots as they neared the end of the range of the blast radius. Her friend stood by and helped her fight back against outstretched claws and hooks towards them, just when she hit the trigger and watched the world light up within seconds before the building they fled from exploded, blasting out windows and crumbled the roof as buildings around slowly turned off from the lack of electricity, including the main base of Robotnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job Sal!\" A walrus congratulated Sally as she counted the remaining friends they had left and realized that more than half were taken, leaving only a few older than them fighting. \"Now that metalhead is stuck in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a victory. We lost too many.\" Sally shook her head as she disliked her role as leader, knowing she would always fail her friends and fighters in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get them back.\" The Walrus stated with crossed arms, staring back at the tower where their hated enemy slept. \"One day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems to be doing well sir, his endurance and strength have grown as we test him.\" Snively told Robotnik as they watched over the maze where the blue fox fought through traps as he made his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How soon until we start the Phase 2?\" Robotnik asked without looking away from his future weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnively took a few moments before he carefully explained to his master what troubled him. \"He has been very resistant to obey, at most, he needs to be 're-orientated' before we even begin with the next phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't what I wanted to hear-\" Robotnik didn't look pleased as he started to comment but was interupted by the power going out everywhere. \"Snively! What is the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power seems to have been cut, one of our plants must've been hit by those troublesome rebels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik slammed his fist on the console before he face his second in command with a face of hate. \"Those brats! Send teams to fix the problem, now! And make sure that brat down there cannot get out!\" Robotnik pointed to the maze Eric was in, who was at the end of the maze but the power out made him confused, getting Snively to salute to Robotnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quickly knocked out the dogs as they were easier to stop without him being watched and stunned if he touched them. Yet it was nearly impossible for anyone to see him as he slipped out the door of the maze, little more than a sliding door without power to magnetically seal it. He quickly ducked out of the room after picking the lock, watching the platform where Snively was trying to find Eric's movement with little luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he had two options to escape, one was to break out through the landing bay, which had a way from him to the city he once knew. The other had him sneak out through one of the exits, hopefully avoiding all of the robots who were programed to take him in at once on sight. Both had their risks and both could possibly end with him back in his cell with broken ribs, but he had to take a chance and he quickly decided towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric remembered the landing bay to be quiet, from his last couple of attempts to get free, as it mostly held transports of drones and robots to factories or to the streets, just where he wanted to go. He moved himself in the shadows around patrols which were stirred up in search of him, careful to use his knowledge from his exercises to keep his wits sharper than a razer. Eric stopped in front of the door to the bay after a few close calls and a good amount of stealth, careful to keep to the side in case someone looked in from down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this thing is heavy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric commented as he looked at the double door, which was several times taller than him. It would be easy to unlock, but the noise of him opening it would get him in trouble. Yet his ears told him of another way as he quickly climbed up onto the ceiling just as two Swatbots were coming through, glad he was able to find grips and footholds to grasp on. He then tried to think of a way to get them to open the door when suddenly the intercom sparked to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Swatbots! Converge on the area! Get me those hedgehogs! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the two bots perked up as they went past the door to the bay, but the door opened from the inside and several Swatbots poured out, unaware the blue fox who took his chance. He then climbed high in the room to see everything in the landing bay from the highest corner, waving off spiderwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his spot, Eric could see the entire bay and each vehicle and robot working there. The bay had several vehicles for him to get away in, but without a proper set of keys, he would be stuck. His first thought was to be a stowaway in a transport, but once he saw the scanners bots screening the cargo for organic life, he dropped it and settled for stealing an airship. Of course, he didn't necessarily knew how to drive one, so he hoped it was as simple as pushing a button and it went off. Yet Eric spotted a drone which had the key while it typed away in a terminal, so he quietly climbed above the machine and swiped it which was nothing more than a keycard. He then climbed back up just when the drone turned to look around, yet returned to it's work after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric let out a soft sigh before he examined the keycard and saw it had  which he looked towards the ships to find it, stopping at a ship which had the number on the wing. It was a cargo transport which some drones were finished loading barrels into it, yet he couldn't tell what it was other than black tar when one robot accidently spilled one. Eric was a little unsure what they needed black tar for but shook it off and slowly moved to where he was above the ship, which was a decent size better than the others. Just as he was about to drop down, Eric spotted four forms by a ship that were definitely not robots, as one was a mouse and the other three were pink, green and blue hedgehogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his heart soar as he had rarely seen normal creatures other than metalheads and his overseers for years, wanting to yell and get their attention, but he knew they were hiding from trouble like he was. He couldn't hear what they were saying but the mouse ran off to another ship as the three tried to unlock the ship, with the green one slipping something into the lock before it opened for them, then the green hedgehog gestured them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact they were something that pissed off Robotnik made Eric happy as they were someone he could go to once he was free. Suddenly he saw their ship power on and he quickly dropped onto his own and got inside as their plan to get out would help him get away with less heat. He waited all of a few minutes after their mouse friend caught the Swatbot's attention as he sped away, before he glanced at the dashboard and suddenly felt really stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, Eric saw several glowing buttons and levers that had no labels and not even pads in the floor to press that he remembered his father's car had. Eric braved a button and found it turned on the wipers to the windshield, quickly turning it off before he hit another that turned on the headlights. \"Damn it! How do you start this thing?\" Eric cursed as he kicked the dashboard before slamming a large button, surprised when he felt like something was lifting before he realized he had hit the bottom thrusters. He then felt around and saw a switch that showed speed, quickly moving it to normal speed before he felt himself fall back as the ship headed through the gates and out into the open sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric whooped with joy before he got up and grabbed what look like a wheel that seemed to control the direction of the ship, moving away from Robotnik's tower and more towards what he remembered as Mobotropolis. His stunt with messing around with the dashboard had made him lose sight of the hedgehogs or the mouse's ships, making Eric annoyed. He flew over Downtown and was shocked by the amount of polution and metalwork that seemed to cover the town as he went by, realizing how much had changed in the years he had as a prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interupted as he hear a deep robotic voice through what he assumed was the intercom. \"TB7-HD9-6N3! You are off course, return to base immediately!\" Eric quickly realized the booming baritone was of Robotnik, and pressed the talk button before he yelled into the mic directly from his rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way fatso!\" Eric screamed into the mic before a screen flashed and a confused but quickly angered image of Robotnik appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prower! You stole my fuelship?! How dare you!\" Robotnik barked and pointed at Eric but somehow he didn't seem too upset after a few minutes. \"Hmm, you think you are out of my reach? Did you forget you are in my ship? I have control!\" The rotund tyrant then laughed before the ship suddenly lurched and went in a different direction, right into a tall glass windowed skyscraper. \"If you beg for forgiveness, and I will spare your life and theirs. If not, I can afford to lose you and the rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quickly put his robotic fist into the screen as he was never going to be Robotnik's puppet again, never to beg or pled for anything anymore. He then took his hand out and gripped the steering wheel and pulled with all of his might to turn it, yet it seemed like he was doing nothing as he started to see people inside the buildings windows from turned on lights. His robotic eye quickly estimated that the collision would effectively level the top of the building as well as kill him and the hundreds if not thousands of people inside judging by the high number of fuel barrels in storage. Eric came to the conclusion that he had two options, both risked his life and others but not to the number the collision would if he did not act, just as fighter ships followed on his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption one was that he was dump all fuel tanks and hope for the best as the toll would be less although the damage would be done as he would bail out on a nearby rooftop. From there, Eric would flee into the building and avoid the fighter airships that would end his life quickly. The second option was to break the override that Robotnik had and steer away from the building, even though that would not give him enough time to escape the fireball that the ship trapped him in once it crashed, as any body of water was far away and only the concrete jungle was available. Plus the ships would likely shoot him down and he would be killed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wiped the sweat from his forehead as he quickly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric frantically flipped switches and knobs to open the cargo door, yet nothing happened, as he was still locked out of the dash. He glanced back through the cabin at the back door and went to it as he would have to do it manually, kicking down the door as he ran past the cylinders full of fuel. Each one he passed by made him feel panic build in what was left of his chest, yet he held his nerve until he reached the cargo door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was designed to prevent anyone from easily getting inside. With several inches of soild steel, reinforced to weathering and heat, most would be stuck. Yet Eric was more progmatic, even when he turned the manual switch and found it did nothing. He traced a hand along the wall, trying to find where the wall was thin and gave way to some pressure. That was easier done when the ship wasn't rocked hard after another hit from the fireships, momentarily losing the spot before he rushed and found it again. He dialed into his arm's interface and prepared it to deal with the task ahead, feeling it extend the shock absorber before he hammered his metal fist into the weak point over and over. At first it seemed like nothing happened but the ring of metal on metal, but dents built up and a hole formed, where he peeled away the wall until the gale forces ripped it from the hull. The gales stormed strong as he went back to the front of the canisters and kicked, shoved and tossed each toward the open door in a mad rush to lessen the effects of the crash that was closer and closer each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had managed half of the barrels before he spotted a missle soaring towards his ship again, making he panic as it soared by and hit the side of the ship again, knocking him off his feet. He heard warning whines from the bridge and felt the whines of metal barely holding on as he knew that it was his last clance to leave, hoping he made a difference. He ran to the open hatch, dialing his metal hand to a hook in case he needed to anchor fast from becoming a stain on the road before he looked at his options. His robot eye was displaying calculations of his survival, which was low wifh a high chance of breaking both his neck and anything else that hit first, but a soild hundred percent chance of him dying if he stayed on the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a breath before he jumped, trying to grab onto a roof with his wildly flailing arms and legs, wishing he had a shorter jump distance from the ship to the roofs. He first fell stomach first on the stone railing edge of a roof, knocking the air out of him, but thankful he caught himself. \"Up and over... before I...\" It wasn't untill after he wedged his foot in the stone to climb over that it broke, making him lose his grip and dropping him yet again with his eyes wide with shock as he screamed obscenities through the descent. The landing sucked as he fell hard on his side although in something surprisingly soft and absolutely disgustingly scented. He slowly opened his eyes to find himself deep in a dumpster, resting on nearly three-dozen bags of trash and food waste, although he made sure to check if he was really alive first through gags as he wondered how he survived. \"Did I seriously live through a dozen floors distance to soild ground? Maybe my luck is turning around after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding no easy answer other than his robot bit blunted the fall, Eric tried to dig his way out of the trash, trying to keep his mind off what he was actually touching as he went. He fell off the edge of the dumpster, rolling over a few bags that were on the ground before he stood up and tried to wipe off as much as he could from his clothes and fur. In the distance, he spotted the damage of the building with his ship leaving a hell of a hole in the side of the building, yet it stood strong with a crowd slowly forming to help those hurt at the base. Eric's expression darkened as he tried to help and vowed to repay Robotnik for the damaged he caused, yet quietly thankful he was not in the wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first thought as he walked was a warm shower, a good meal and a clean bed to sleep in away from Robotnik, yet he knew many of those were for the wealth only. So he thought about what he could do and quickly figured he would have to get cleaned up if he wanted to see about a way to get his family back. \"I wonder how long it would be to find a working shower out here.\" He commented as his wiped his hands and sought it out while covering his own nose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric quickly ducked under the console before he slammed his robotic fist into the plating to weaken it, peeling it away so he could get to the wiring underneath it. Once he had peeled it away, he looked at the array of circuts and wires, each had a function for the ship and could ultimately change fate. He quickly grabbed a few wires and spilt them open in order to reconnect with other circuts and inputs to disable the lock on the steering wheel. As he worked, he heard the computer interface speak, but he couldn't look up for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alert! System is being sabotaged! All hands report to the cockpit!\" Alert! System on collision course with existing stucture, please change current course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I want to do! \" Eric angrily remarked at the machine as he winced back when sparks came up near his face before continuing his work, yet froze when he heard another alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alert! System is being locked on by friendly ships! Brace for immediate fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't sh-!\" Eric tried to yell before he was cut short by a violent shockwave that launched him foreward and slammed his head into the dashboard before he fell to the ground, clutching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning! Critical damage to cargo bay! Tempature rising in Cargo bay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Fire!\" Eric cursed as he then forgot about the guts of the computer system and then tried his hardest to force the wheel with his robotic arm and even kicking it. He knew the second the fire hit the fuel, he would go up in flames like his system warned him, so he put all he could to move the wheel. He was shocked to find the pressure had actually ripped it from postion, dooming Eric as he tried to think of another way out while holding the wheel. That's when he heard feedback from inside his ear, direct from his tactical computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"User, analysis of fuel ship collision course has now found a higher chance of survial. Now taking control for precision power!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt himself go cold as his green interface turned dark red along his robotic body, until it went up and consumed all of the green, making Eric's exprssion change from fear and anger to blank and emotionless. \"Control complete, executing comands.\" He droned on, all life in his face gone. Eric then walked to the left side window as the dashboard and it's interface barked damged parts of the ship as it took more hits from the other ships. He then pulled back his arm with the wheel in it before he slammed the window with it until it broke open and air ripped through. He then looked back at the wing of the ship and launched the wheel at it with enough force to level a tower, gripping tightly to the ship to brace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\nHalf an hour eariler...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red panda calmly walked through the front doors of Mobius Express' headquarters, one of the largest inport export businesses that Robotnik left it alone, in exchange for some of the dough. Her short orange heels clicking on the polished floors as she made her way to the front desk, ringing the bell to get the attention of a crocodile reading the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" He said before he folded down the top of his paper to see her young face before he took his feet off the desk and sat upright. \"What brings a young lady like yourself here, miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am expected upstairs to see my father. I need a vistor badge.\" The red panda replied curtly with a distinct accent that the clerk took note of, as well as her expensive eastern dress and suitcase. He also noticed she was barely older than ten years old but held herself as if she was more than twice her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? No one told me anything about that...\" The crocodile looked doubtful as he couldn't remember any pandas in the building, just when he noticed the black card put on the table with one word 'Dusk' typed on it. Immediately the color drained from his face before he shakily handed her a vistor badge. \"S-sorry, I didn't mean to pry, here miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should forget I came through.\" The red panda answered back as she pinned the badge to her waist, staring coldly into his eyes, making the crocodile nod quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sure thing kid. I wasn't even here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red panda then smiled sweetly like nothing had happened and took the card before she walked away to the elevators, dragging her suitcase with her. The crocodile waited until she went into the elevator before exhaling the breath he had sucked in, holding a hand to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I didn't know the assassin's guild took anyone so young, I think I need a holiday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\nMinutes before Eric's critical moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red panda looked through the scope of a high powered rifle out into the day, using the janitor's closet to her advantage. After getting the janitor out with the sight of her rilfe, all she had to do was cut a hole just big enough so she could aim through to her target. Several dozen blocks away was a skyscrapper with a window showing a particular conference room that held her target. She had three different bullets next to her, as she left her rifle unloaded while she touched the button on her earset, hearing it ring once before a deep voice spoke in her ear. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a problem, the angle has more than half the boardroom facing away from me. At least six are impossible to id.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is your problem, not ours. Get it done, or no payment Xin, you know how this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" The red panda growled before she hit the button again and cancelled the call. She kept looking for a way to distract the boardroom in order to get their attention when she suddenly saw quite a sight to see. Three of Robotink's airships, one fuel ship and two attackships, heading toward her target's building at a high speed. She could see the fuelship was the target as it took a few hits and fires started to appear, making her wonder about her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm, that fuel ship looks like it might do my job for me. However, it never hurts to be prepared.\" </i> Xin thought as she picked out one of the bullets with her other hand and loaded it into the rifle, keeping an eye on the fuel ship. She then watched has a blue form appears from the window of the fuelship, zooming her len as far as it went to to examine their face. She immediately thought of the Freedom Fighters, a bunch of rebels with ancient equipment trying to take down a tech monster. She shook her head in disgust just when she saw the blue form launch something hard enough to cut one of the wings off the fuel ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt immediately dipped downward to the left of the building, the last functioning wing scrapping against the side of the building before it went past. Xin however switched over to her target's window and saw each of the members were staring out the window, and quickly identified her target before she shot him dead. Xin pushed the earset button again as she watched the chaos inside the opposite building as the line connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it done?\" The same voice asked without any emotion other than impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The money has been transfered. We will contact you for your next task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Xin stated as she moved the rifle away and started to disassemble it just when she heard a massive explosion. She then used the scope to check around the area and found a huge stack of smoke not too far from the building she was aimed at, most likely the fuelship that went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Another idiot dead, this warzone is prime pickings for someone like me. But I just need enough for back home, my family relies on me.\"</i> Xin thought coldly as she went back to putting her rifle away, already wondering about where she would go visit next that she hadn't went to already.</span></div></div>",

Life readings for Eric Prower are fractional, possibly of instantaneous death, 90.8 percent. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a pity.\" Robotnik grimaced before he slammed his fist into the chair arm, somehow feeling regret tickle at him as he reflected. <i>That boy was supposed to be my shadow agent, all that time and money, what a waste. Still, I suppose it's up of me to take down those rebels, as always.</i> Robotnik then pressed a button and Sleet's face along with Scratch's face appeared on the screen, tightening his glove. \"It seems like our side project failed, double your efforts on taking down the Hedgehog Trio and focus on Princess Sally. Without him, you both need to compensate for what his actions would've been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem sir, that tin can could never compete with us.

Got to take it slow...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric managed to open his right eye, but the swelling around it made it hard to see everything, greeted with the scene of piles of scrap metal that used to be his ship, making out the cockpit a few meters ahead of him as well as the tail rotor stuck right into it. He tried to see with his left but it didn't turn on, and with the crunch of glass near his head, he half expected it to be broken. Slowly he tried to pick himself up, only to cry out in pain as his body lit up in agony, cracked bones and deep cuts screamed out along his body, droping him to the cold ground quickly. After managing to breath after the surge of pain, he realized his robotic side was turned off, likely damaged in the crash, unaware what caused the crash other than the other fireships. He quickly stopped moving and tried to find someone to help him, only able to croak out his words. \"S-someone...? Please help m-me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't find any motion around him, it was as if he dropped into a graveyard, which did not seem right for the city he knew. However his thoughts were interupted when he coughed up again and found he coughed up blood and a lot of it. He looked at his body and found a few large pieces of scrap that were stabbed deep into his fur, making him groan as he turned his body so the pressure was off them, know full well that they were in some of his organs and the warm wettness at them was his blood. <i>\"Where is everyone?\"</i> Eric thought as he tried to keep from groaning in pain, slowly able to move his normal arm, though he knew it was brusied badly. <i>\"You'd think an airship crashing and an explosion would catch some eyes... Damn that hurts... Not to mention a hurt kid bleeding in the street. Damn them... I'll do it myself as always...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to feel very cold as he lifted his arm and dragged his body from it's spot, using his chin to help pull him since his body was too heavy to pick up turned off. Eric tried to avoid from stopping, slowly feeling the world blur to his eyes, know if he did he would have trouble starting again. He honestly didn't know how far he went, maybe a block, maybe two feet before he came to the sight of someone in front of him. Even with his blurred vision, he noted the hooded green robe before seeing a mask that was vibrant with deep shades of red, it's eyes wide, letting Eric see the figure's true eyes which were blue. Eric's first thought was that the figure was going to rob him, as his mother warned him about masked figures, however his eyes looked so peaceful, it swayed him of his fears. He then croaked out the last words he could muster, hoping that whoever in from of him would help, dropping his face to the ground and feeling tears form from his good eye. \"P-please, help m-me. I'll do anything... I-I can't go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure look at the wreck of the airship for a moment before he kneeled down and put a hand to Eric's head before he reached under him and lifted up the broken fox in his arms, watching the boy pass out. The figure check his pulse and moved as fast as his feet let him away from the crash site, not allowing the cyborg boy to die on his watch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world sounded like he was underwater, everything swirling around his head as he tried to understand the basics of his situation. He could hear raised tones and shouting but the words were lost in the blur, feeling himself coughing out something that made his tongue tingle, but the familar feeling required more awareness than he could spare. He attempted to move his fingers and toes and was relieved to feel them work, even his robotic ones, which then alarmed him. <i>\"Wait...my power...is restored? Where...am I?\"</i> His first thought was that he was back in his room, yet he was on a bed, and it was much too comfortable to be something Robotnik or Sniviely just gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him all of his effort to just open his eyes, and was surprised to see himself in a wooden room that was bare of everything but the bed and a chair place in front of him. It had a single candle that illuminated the room, showing no windows and a single door on the far side of the room, much out of his current reach. The covers were up to his neck but he felt bandages wrapped around his chest where the shards of metal were once lodged. <i>\"What... What is this? Who put me here? Why did they fix me up?\"</i> Eric thought as he saw the diagnostic of his body through a shade of white glass, a cheap substitute but handy none the less, seeing he was at a soild 35% functionality and more than half way closer to pushing up daisies than he was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears picked up the voices he heard before, loud and angry and muffled by the door, but it was clear that someone was in a bad mood. He could also hear a softer voice that was a struggle just to register, clearly someone who was not for letting others know their conversations, yet Eric felt like he recognized it somehow. Then he heard a loud slam and what sounded like a lightening bolt before he coughed violently, spitting out over the covers with blood, slowly feeling the world blur as a door burst open and two figure rushed in, his eyes closing against his will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slowly opened his eyes again to the same hooded figure from before on the street, the green cloak reflecting light of the candle and the mask was illuminated. Eric heard small gasps from the figure before he noticed the blood on the figure's gloves and the pile of bandages next to the chair, realizing that they were his own. The hooded figure dropped a bloody scapel onto the floor, next to a small pile of blood-covered metal shards, wiping the gloves off on a rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a kid trying not to die, you sink toward the darkness easily.\" The figure spoke loudly to him, full of strength and authority that made Eric wonder who he was facing. \"Since you've been sleeping, I haven't learned your name, why don't you introduce yourself son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...first....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a guest in my home, have the respect to honor my wishes.\" The voice cut sharply, making Eric wince as the figure was not much for backtalking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric. Eric Prower.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure leaned in and rested their chin on their gloves, their blue eyes piercing into Eric's soul. \"Tell me Eric, for what reason did you decide to take a fuelship from Robotnik and crash it into the street? You nearly destroyed a whole block with that ship, and several people were injuried by the wreckage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Eric looked away from the figure's eyes, thinking that he thought no one was there and was kicking himself that he must seem like a horrible person to this figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enlighten me. I'm a good listener.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....And then I saw you and you know what happened beyond that.\" Eric wrapped up his story, feeling slightly better as for the last few hours he explained everything to the figure, trusting them completely for some odd reason. He slowly felt his body being able to move better as he tried to let himself heal, somehow faster than he or the figure had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting... that is quite the story. You've certainly dealt with many things for someone barely a decade old. I do have one concern though...\" the figure asked as he relit a fresh candle, seeing Eric nod. \"You say you have a system in that metal head of yours, where it will take over and you won't have control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would Robotnik have access to that system? Make you do things you don't want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric moved his normal hand to scratch an itch on his ear but shook his head slowly. \"Not that I know, it mostly comes in whenever I'm close to a life-or-death situation. But after that wreck, I'm not sure that he knows I'm alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure then stood up and put a hand to Eric's face, examining his robotic face even though he didn't like to be touched. \"I wonder... maybe in time we can see this for fact. For now rest up, I'll have something made for you to eat.\" The figure then moved to the door putting out the candle on the way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I told you my name, who are you?\" Eric asked, the light from the next room almost blinding him as it streamed of the green cloak of the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time, you'll know it by heart, but not now.\"  The figure said as they walked into the light, closing the door slowly behind them. \"Rest.\"</span></div></div>",

He had forgotten how much the little things matter once they are taken away by force. Eric remembered how he felt the first time he was shown the moon by his mother Rosemary, how amazed and starstruck he was, like a new world had just be opened to him. The wind brushed against his fur and he almost felt complete again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... it was gone as an image showed in his left eye a call from his master Robotnik waiting impatiently to be answered. Eric frowned and pressed a button on his left arm, before replying in a manner fitting a teenager to a parent. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in position Ironfist?\" a voice he knew well droned into his ears through his ear pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see the target?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned his gaze below him and saw from the skyscraper roof he was on an assortment of small buildings that seemed like nothing but abandoned ruins. He zoomed in his sight with his robotic eye and saw what looked like a small base with armed guards surrounding it. Young and old animals holding weapons with varying degrees of confidence and determination. A base of Freedom Fighters, enemies of Robotnik and lackeys of Princess Sally Acorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh... Princess Sally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSad thing was, Sally Acorn was the only female he had ever seen since he was young. Robotnik wanted no attachments to the outside world that could keep Eric from him. He felt embarrassed as he remembered a few times he used the pictures of Sally on her file in ways the real squirrel wouldn't have liked. Sex drives, highly distracting. Eric was almost caught up in a fantasy of his when he realized Robotnik was waiting for him to respond.  \"Roger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy their archives and disable their power source. I will send in Swatbots to round them up for Robotization. Failure is not a option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Eric then stood on the edge of the roof and jumped with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWind howled as Eric dropped from the roof, doing nothing to prevent the oblivion rushing up to meet him, parallel to the building as he dropped head first to the ground. He looked at his reflection in the glass windows as he dropped by them, he looked dangerous and a threat to all who stood in his way albeit dirty and uncombed. At the last five stories to the cold merciless ground, Eric spun around and landed on his feet, causing a crater to form under his impact. Yet he brushed off the dirt and dust and quickly walked away from the crater, towards his target, glad he upgraded his flesh leg to robotic so he wouldn't have to hobble to the base with a shattered leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt a little showmanship didn't hurt when he was the quiet bane of all enemies to Robotnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base was more complex that Eric expected. Electric fences, state of the art security with time locks and vehicles everywhere, yet everything was disguised as broken junk. <i>Clever.</i> Eric thought as he hid behind a crumbled building across the street to the base. <i>They are adapting, Robotnik will be displeased.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned, he could break in given the right tools that he acquired from his childhood practice of thievery, but it would take a large distraction to get attention away from him. He then looked towards the vehicle garage where the guards were very thin and grinned. He sneaked over and broke in, to see that besides the cars were half filled tanks of gasoline, and quickly went over and turned on a blowtorch before setting it facing towards the tanks and their puddle surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fireworks were more then adequate and the shock on the poor fools faces was worth it as their stealth base lit up like a torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quickly broken into the database from the generator building far away from the hysterics of putting out the fires. He quickly downloaded everything on it into his files and quickly disabled the generator with ease before stepped out of the base and back into the darkness of the night when the Swatbots arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another day at work...<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked the streets of Robotroplis in the poorer district, where the people were weak with hunger and survived day by day if they had no money.

He was also a ex of a freedom fighters named Sonia, who was actually Sonic's sister, yet Eric couldn't imagine why she went for him in the first place. Maybe her foster family pushed her to it or maybe she liked the ones with bigger pockets than brains... Eric shook his head as he peered up to the mansion, his eye zoomed on the windows, looking for the host himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a couple of reasons he was casing out this particular mink, one of which was because Robotnik told him to. Old robo-head was tired of Bartleby and his pull with the other 1% so he was to take his fortune as well as look for any signs of Freedom Fighters in the house to arrest him for treason. The other reason he had was that Bartleby had to know how to contact one of his major contracts, Sonic the Hedgehog, who had a bounty that could give Eric the sweet life after all of the hell he had to endure, something he DESPERATELY wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then spotted the wealthy mink sleeping in his bed, and remembered it was only a few hours till morning, which meant he had to be quick or Bartleby may wake up and get the whole block's attention before he could shut him up. Eric remotely hacked the security system and walked along the path as if he owned the property he was trespassing on, knowing that he could since the rch were normally out cold before 8 and would be in no condition to wake up early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric climbed the side of the building and crawled through the window Bartleby had left open before he crept to the master bedroom to find the aristocrat curled up on one of his pillows, drooling slightly as Eric could smell good wine on his breath. Eric noticed the bottle near his bed next to a picture frame that was put face down and quickly flipped it up to see a pink hedgehog smiling back at him in a luxurious dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric said this automatically before he could stop himself, however it seemed the mink was out for the long count so Eric just calmed down and eased himself into a chair with the picture still in his hand. This must be Sonic's sister, the one with the keyboard and the bad attitude when her clothes got dirty. She was another girl he heard about from the grape vine but he could never find a picture that showed her, just a blur or even a pink blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric however pocketed the picture as he got up and took a small sip of the wine, liked it and drank a bit more before putting it down as he knew Bartleby's safe would require a steady hand to crack. He went over to the rich mink and grabbed his hand before he scanned it into a file in case he needed it, before he went over to the steel vault that was only a few steps away from the bed, shaking his head as he then...</span></div></div>",

Crap, now I need to hide.\"</i> Eric thought as he scoped out his options. He first thought the closet since it was roomy, yet the idea of being stuck in there was risky, maybe the visitor would go there first, then what could he do? However, he went to the private bathroom and cracked the door before going against the wall, dimming his interface and slowly holding back his breath as not to tip off the figure once it pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could only see what light came into the room from the open window, but it appeared the figure was femmine from the outline, with a spiky hairstyle to boot, and he could barely make out a short cut dress but he wasn't sure. The first thing the figure did was close the window after peeking out at the garden, then she moved towards the bed, just as Eric activated his night vision in his eye. He was surprised to see the girl in the photo was here, Sonia Hedgehog, Sonic's sister. She wore the punk outfit she first had out when she joined up with her brothers years ago, yet she accessorized with different colors and a new dye streak in her hair that looked nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Focus! You have a top five priority target in front of you, nab her and bring her to the Master. Lock up that mink while you're at it.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's not going to work...\"</i> Eric thought back at his programing, frowning as he felt his system try to reach into his controls, trying to go around him. <i>\"The job is to find out if Montclair has tides to the Freedom Fighters and to steal his money, she isn't mission critical. Besides, an ex dropping by doesn't mean jack for proof, now quiet!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then focused on Sonia and Bartleby at the bed, increasing the sensitivity of his robotic ear while he kept an eye on what they were doing, his eye recording them. It seemed Sonia sat on Bartleby's bed before she shook him away, slowly waking up the pompous mink before he realized who was there. \"Sonia! Whatever brings you here... this late?\" It seemed his expression was a mix of joy and serious worry, like he did still care for her, but worried about being found with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Bartleby.\" Sonia greeted her ex with a small smile yet she seemed to have something on her mind, something Eric picked up when she glanced around, not wanting to be heard. \" Unfortunately this isn't a social call, I need talk to you about what we talked about before, about helping us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jackpot.\"</i> Eric thought as he made sure to record Montclair's struggle for the right words, knowing that whatever he said would be at the front of Robotnik before sun up. <i>\"Just say yes, and she'll go away, you go to sleep and I go home.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia, you know how much trouble I could be in if Robotnik found out I helped you?\" Bartleby asked nervously, making Eric annoyed as Sonia's ex was trying to see how far she wanted him to go. \"I could lose my home, my wine collection, my life with the others! I know I helped you before, but this time I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just listening in on your friends. They know things that we need to hear about, like when Robotnik holds special events or news about secret projects in planning.\" Sonia reminded Bartleby as put her hands in his and squeezed them, giving him doe eyes, something that made Eric roll his eyes as he watched them. \"Please? It would really mean a lot if you help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and predictably, Bartleby calmed down and squeezed her hands back before he smiled at Sonia. \"I'll do it for you Sonia, I'll tell you about anything I hear that you need.\" It was at this point Eric stopped the recording, everything he needed was right there, and Robotnik would keep an eye on Bartleby. However, what Sonia said afterwards made him wish he was still recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Sonia kissed his cheek before she got up and went through the door. \"Now I'm off to take down one of Robohead's bomb factories, be good Bartleby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric growled quietly as the pink hedgehog was on her way out, seeing the mink slowly drift back to sleep, feeling rather divided. On one hand, he was supposed to complete his mission by steal what was in the safe otherwise Robotnik would not be pleased, but stopping a factory from blowing was an opportunity too good to pass up. He could save the bomb factory, plant a tracker on Sonia and find the freedom base or run into Sally and get in good with his overlord by bringing her back.

He quietly ducked into the hallway, following Sonia's shadow as he opened a window and went through, avoiding being too close to her as she ran off into the city. <i>\"Hmm, she could be going anywhere. I want to put a tracker on her, but it's too risky. If she sees my face, then I'm stuck if she shows up again. I need to know where she's going first, then plan for action.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso like a shadow, he tagged along and followed Sonia's every move, not seen to her as she attempted her little scan in the darkeness. He was worried about the soon coming dawn, even he couldnvt get away easily if they saw his face during a fight. Eventually however, the hedgehog made it to a factory on the other side of town, with Eric on a rooftop overlooking the team set up near it. He counted five Freedom Fighters, Sonia, her brothers Sonic and Manic, a walrus and finally Sally Acorn. Eric's mind lit up like a spotlight, his system almost going off like an alarm as his focus was directed at her, not like he wasn't already scoping her out when he first saw her. She looked good, and immediately he felt the need to control himself, otherwise his focus would not end the way Robotnik intended. He cooled off before he noticed the hedgehog trio was moving towards the plant, immediately struck with the idea with calling in backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can handle getting Sally, while someone else goes and stops those hedgehogs. Robotnik can lose a plant, having Sally can change his attitude quickly.Hmm, I think it's think to get out the disguise.\"</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pull the pack off his back and dug through to find his action clothes, pulling out a hoodie, a mask and some gloves. He liked his mask, it was a version of his master's, the eyes circular and the mouth was a straight line, but the vibrant colors of the lips and checks made him seem like he was wearing artwork. He however didn't enjoy hiding himself by wearing the disguise, he felt like he should know those below him, yet a quick jolt corrected his behavior and he dawned his mask with the hoodie and the gloves. He then scouted what the walrus and Sally were doing and saw they were tapped into the network, providing the trio with assistance. Eric then tapped his interface, pulling up the phonebook and called Sleet, putting his finger to his robotic ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it furball?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robotnik's factory in the southwest quadrant is being attacked by the Freedom Fighters. Get Dingo and get over here.\" Eric frowned as Sleet always got on his nerves, yet he heard a yawn before Sleet responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with it yourself, it's too earily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rolled his eyes as he went with his go-to way to getting Sleet to do his grunt work, apealing to his greed and ego.\"Fine, then I guess I'll grab the Hedgehogs myself. And get the credit for nabbing Sally myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Those hedghogs and the princess are in the same place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, for maybe 15 more minutes at best. It's a shame really, I would be taking all of them in, and your task was to get the hedgehogs, I wonder how the boss man will treat you for not getting the job done. I bet he'll give me a fortune...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We'll be there in 10...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smirked as he cut off the line, keeping an eye on the two in front of him. Sleet was too stupidly smart for his own good, all he needed was a reason to try and beat Eric at something and that wolf would jump to nab it, not willing to be the loser. In truth, Sleet would have the hedgehogs if he caught them, that was his and Dingo's goal. Eric's mission was Sally Acorn, no matter what, he would get her to Robotnik alive or otherwise. His programing told him to follow this simple intruction and he wasn't going to deviate from the plan, preparing a cloth to knock her out and a gun for the worst case scenario. The challenge was to drag her all the way back home, maybe if he 'borrowed' a ship from Sleet's bunch while they were busy, he could get away easier. Neverless, Eric waited for Sleet to arrive, prepared to snatch the girl and be on his merry way out to retirement.</span></div></div>",

My old partner?\" Rouge answered back, a little surprised at what on earth the Thieves Guild wanted with Hypon, but poured another glass and nudged the glass Eric had yet to touch towards him. \"And why would your leader want to know about him? He's not exactly the type to ask, he would stick his pawns to the shadows and spy on me like usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my leader... I'm asking for myself.\" Eric answered  honestly, knowing a bit of truth could allow Rouge to give him more of what he wanted. \"He came up during some side work, I was considering knowing a bit more about another power player in case we cross paths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sat back in her seat, letting the music drown out the tables around them while she stared intently at her guest. \"So you came to his old partner? I'm not sure you understand the kind of question you are asking fox. It happens that particular bit of info will cost you big, as I like Hypon and I don't like you or the trouble you will bring us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you don't like me, what exactly are you asking for?\" Eric finally asked, crossing his arms as he faced the bat who he was relying on for info, watching her eyes track every movement of her artist on stage. \"All I'm asking is details, filling in blanks, we don't have to be friends for a business deal. So quit dancing around it and say it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white bat sipped her drink and leaned forward enough to get in Eric's face, acknowledging that it would both get his attention on her and get his attention shifting down from her face. \"As it happens, there is something you can retrieve for me. It's a emerald a certain robotic overlord has in his possession, large and yellow, should fit in your hand. Give me that, and I'll answer any question you want from his turn ons to his old drama. Do we have a deal, fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gritted his teeth as stealing or asking for something from Robotnik was not easy or simple in the least, however he knew Rouge was a source he couldn't pass up, so he sighed and slowly answered while his robotic eye continued to record their entire interaction. \"That's a steep price Rouge, but I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white bat chuckled slightly after hearing Eric, facing him with a smile before she snapped her fingers. Eric was blinded when a stage light flipped on that illuminated their table, putting him on the spot with Rouge who just looked at him in a way that made him intensely uncomfortable, along with everyone else including the bird Everfree. \"Run along boy, don't make me come find you or I'll be a different kind of host to you in ways you can scarcely dream of.\" She watched him awkwardly walk away before she snapped her fingers again, starting the show again from the start, already daydreaming ideas for the golden bird after the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't have felt more awkward walking away from the club as the white bat seemed to play him like a tuned violin while also making him blush red with how she made his eyes wander. However, he was more worried about Robotnik and the emerald as stealing or lying to Robotnik was a dangerous game, with his robotic side which would take control away. Although honesty could lead to a dead end as the fat man wasn't much for handing valuable things away to charity and Eric didn't want to tell him about Hypon yet, at the least until he had more to go on. With a sigh, Eric goes back to his \"home\" in order to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric's robotic eye focused on the bat he was here to see, Rouge, who was chatting with some bartender and pointed at the stage a few times. He felt his hands tremble, nerves were the least of his troubles yet a key part to his failure, so he gathered himself and looked for danger to calm himself down. He noted three of her crew with tazers as well as one with a gun blended into the tables and also noticed one of the watriesses had a knife in her boot, but he could easily overpower her, it was the crew that was the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuns were bad in Eric's trade. They are loud, messy, and almost never used unless the user had some skill with it, hardly appropriate for a thief whom's whole purpose is to be stealthy. Eric had some bad calls with guns, especially when they were aimed at him, yet he managed to avoid serious injury, which made him pause at the one who had one. He was drinking and playing cards with some airheads who were doing badly and didn't know why. The other two were smoking in the back, doing the same thing he was, looking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then looked back to Rouge who moved towards the stage and was now near the mic in the center, he moved as far into the wall's shadow as he could and hid his face to avoid her detection as she spoke into the mic, addressing the crowds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone.\" Rouge spoke each word with a smile a very curious tone that made the hair on his neck stand up but he didn't know what to call it other than laced with honey from it's sweetness. \"Our next performance is coming soon, and our girls are just excited to show you a good time. Hope you like birds, 'cause our next gals will give you a show you'll never forget.\" Rouge then looked in Eric's direction and he felt like he was seen but Rouge quickly turned away and then gracefully walked off stage through a door that marked \"For Employees only\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could think of a couple of ways to get to Rouge, one involved getting a disguise as a male employee from the laundry room near him and walking right in, the other was to see if the local servers knew anything about Hypon's arrival times or general information, starting with the bartender since Eric knew that they saw all and told only those with the right amount of cash.</span></div></div>",

He kept watch on the guards in the back and slipped into the room when their focus moved to an annoying drunken hen by the bar. He quickly slipped off his coat and searched for a disguise, putting it into the wash as he floated through the piles of clean clothes for something that said \"Ignore me, I work here\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly found a collared black shirt and slacks and put them on and found different sizes of boots that he slipped on and tied as well as a simple logo ball cap. Eric looked in a cracked mirror and saw himself dressed the part of a minimum paid grunt and slowly changed his posture and added a slight limp in his walk until he convinced himself. Eventually, even he would've had to try in order to see himself in a crowd of workers, and he slowly headed back into the showroom to go toward the employee room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to slip out in a hurried walk table to table and acted like he was dressed. He was lucky that most wanted him to go away, but a few tables to the door made he run drinks over, which he did with many insults at his heels. Eventually he slipped away into the employee only room as other workers came out, not one to see his face. His luck changed when a guard stopped him as he went in, a tall and muscular hound who gripped his shoulder with a vice. \"Hey, what do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My job.\" Eric spoke bluntly and with a hurried tone to try and move along, but the grip kept him in place and slowly hurt his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that? This area is for dancers or hunters. Service staff are strictly prohibited from being in here, so I ask again. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gritted his teeth but remember the spirits in his pocket and slowly pulled it out to the hound,  who gave him a curious look as he quicky made up a story. \"The Madam of the club asked for this, and she wanted it a few minutes ago for her office. I assume her room didn't change in the few months I have been here, so if you don't mind I rather get this to her before I lose my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hound slowly looked him and the spirits before grunting and shoving him away into the room. \"Be quick about it, then head back out there. I'll be speaking to your handler about the attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Eric answered back before he rushed away, avoiding changing rooms as the girls and guys were not his priority. Moving quickly and quietly, avoiding eye contact with anyone he passed, Eric made it to the office of the big bad bat, feeling his nerves take over slightly as he watched for guards but found none for some reason. He slowly put his ear to the door and listened but didn't hear much other than some movement and clinking of glass on glass.</span></div></div>",

He noticed the vast decoration around her office and even a large oil portrait of her and what he assumed were her friends or workers on a large heart bed, yet he didn't see any guys there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge however poured two glasses full and passed one to Eric while she held one in her hand as she sat down and gave Eric her full attention. \"So Prower, what brings a Thief into my house?

Tall, sharp red eyes, killjoy as his face is serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" Eric said as his system recorded notes and was already working on a possible face,  moving on to something more serious. \"What do you know about Hypon and Eggman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Rouge asked curious at his line of questions. \"If Hypon is up against the lard man, it's to take him down, the last thing he would do would work for Eggman. I thought he was with those rebel kids, what were their pretend name? Oh yes, 'Freedom Fighters', not really working out for them in terms of freedom right now are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what about something called 'Project Ironfist'? Ring any bells?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge snapped to attention and stood up, making Eric coil up in order to get away faster. \"How do you know about that? Hypon was looking into an outfiting project from Eggman, something about a deadly agent in progress. It was years ago, so maybe it already happened. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could tell he was making her annoyed and swallowed his nerves as he asked his last question. \"You've seen him in action, how would you rate his combat skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that which made Rouge chuckle as she refilled her glass and drank again from it, crossing her legs as she sat down and glancing at Eric. \"Against you? He would destroy you. Against me? I would leave him hurt but he might have my number. Against Eggman? Hypon could end him if properly provoked. I would say unless you are hiding more than your face behind that cap.\" She then gestered the bouncers and Eric felt them pick him up under his arms and held him in place. \"My turn, why are you asking questions about my ex partner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gritted his teeth as he fought to keep himself in control and blurted out something random. \"I'm supposed to steal from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rouge asked completely taken back from what she thought he would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My task is to steal something he has that a client wants returned. I just want to know what I'm up against! I heard he was a heavy hitter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge frowned but took a gun from her drawer and put it against Eric's head, arming it as she was not done with him. \"Weird questions for a thief, you are hiding something, speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all!\" Eric yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge took several seconds before she took the gun away from him and sat at her desk again. \"Very well, you are excused.\" As Eric was dragged out, Rouge wondered if she should give Hypon a call and warn him of what the fox boy had in plan for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this time that wolf is on his own. Serves him for not calling me after he quit, at least a visit would've been nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Eric had less fun as he was tossed into the club's garbage by the bouncers, both sneering at him as they closed the door and locked it, leaving Eric. Eric just sighed before he climbed out and then walked away from the club, his mind buzzing with thoughts too much to smell how bad he was. He got a possible face of Hypon to match existing data in the file, assuming his age and that he didn't get any huge marks from fights. It was more than he had, and for that he was willing to ignore the bouncers and Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a new foe, outside of the box he had already planned for his enemies, one he knew would be trouble if he was already digging into his past. Hypon had to go, and if Eggman was there to see it or if he would be already dead was just a matter of how his new report was to go off. Eric had a balde ready in case, as the fatman was known for his temper as he went back to tell him of the huge leaks and a newer threat.</span></div></div>",

It was not Eric's kind of plan to sit on a place he was tossed out of, but once he found out a number of people were sitting on the place from the rooftops, he knew someone was making a play. Luckly for Eric, Rouge had put only one bouncer on the backdoor to keep out anyone trying to sneak in, which he was not as effective as Eric only flashed a stolen ID card to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing a simular outfit to one of the band's staff, a backward purple hat and black shirt that had \"Audio Tech, with the band\" on both sides as well as red cargo pants and sneakers. Eric had found one of their members about his size and 'persuaded' him not to come in, actually liking the hat which had \"Knothole Knuts\" proudly displayed on the front, ignoring that the band was friends with one of his hated enemies. He set down a case which had tools of the trade in and quietly went to work on the sound systems as everyone around him were too busy to notice the change in staff, except one bird who went over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who are you? I thought Max was coming.\" The bird asked, her shirt stated \"Stage Manager\" and the clipboard in her wing also had a checklist to do before the show, letting Eric know he was refering to a boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max got sick, I'm his fill in, Mikey.\" Eric responded confidently, keeping at his work adjusting the the systems until the bird physcially stopped him and stared his down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had a little too much to drink and made a mess of himself.\" Eric told the bird with an impatient look, making it seem like he was just trying to to his job. \"Look, I just need to do a once through to make sure everything works fine, I just want to get it over with. I won't be any trouble.\" He knew that the manager was pressed for time as the show was only an hour away, so she might forgive him if the job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird however didn't buy his story and held up a radio to security, ready to alert them that something was up. \"Max doesn't drink, why are you really here? You got five seconds before I get Rouge's staff to haul you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt himself bit his tongue as he felt like beating the bird for the attitude, but came up with a better approach, hoping not to raise any alerts before his time was up. \"Alright, you got me, I'm not here just to fix the systems. I'm also trying to get Songoose's autograph.\" Eric then pretended to look embarrassed and rubbed the back of his head. \"She just so awesome that I asked Max to take his place to ask her for it, but I really do know how everything works. Max was training me to I could join as an intern. I promise I'll do all of Max's work, no charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird took a few moments before she sighed and lowered the radio, rubbing her feathers. \"Ugh, another groupie. Fine, since Max isn't coming, you do it. But if anything goes wrong onstage, your ass is in the fryer, and leave Mina alone until after the show. Now get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am!\" Eric answered back before he was back to the system as the bird wandered off to vent her new anger at someone else, watching the area and the audience beyond the curtain with a bit of a smile. He had his place and not one person knew where he was yet. Now all he had to do was lay low and keep an eye out for Hypon, he also planted a few micro cameras around the area as he worked, several just outside the curtain focused on the only hallway to go through to reach Rouge's office. He bent down and pulled out his pistol to silence Hypon with, loading it with bullets before slipping it in the back of his pants and fixing his shirt to hid it, his robot eye already viewing the feeds from the cameras in real time. Then he went over the next system as he actually had to do work in order to blend in, glad he had played around enough with computer systems to know what the hell he was doing.</span></div></div>",

They must've noticed that he was one of the only people in the room who wasn't drunk or high, even more so with his eyes lingering on the VIP entrance for too long. The cyborg fox quickly dashed through the dancers, but was surprised when two other bouncers gripped him from under his arms and the two hauled him out, lifting him up enough that his legs kicked the air. \"You shouldn't have come here runt. This club is for those of us who are a little more established, not for snot-nosed kids.\" The bouncer on his left who in light was a brown bear grunted as he managed to hold the young fox in his grip, kicking the front door open as they forced him out to the street. \"Time to get lost, or we'll teach you not to overstay your welcome on Miss Rouge's property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know... you have a point...\" Eric managed to speak before he detached the bolt of his metal arm, slipping out of their grip before cracking the other bouncer in the head with his detached arm. He quickly snapped it back on before he slammed his robotic fist into the brown bear bouncer's head and the other bouncer's several times until they stopped getting up from the street. The fox took several breathes before he realized that all eyes were on him and the two bouncers groaning on the concrete, including a handful of bouncers that rushed out of the club to deal with him. Facing all of those threats at once made Eric turn tail and run as fast as he could away, knowing feel well he couldn't handle all of them and attempt to go inside without guns being pointed at his face. The chase between him and the bouncers went on for blocks as the handful of Rouge's trusted workers were well equipped with endurance and strength, something he only had a small tank for. Eric managed to duck out of harms way after losing their eye contact for the third time by climbing a gutter pipe up to the building's roof six stories up, gasping for breath as he couldn't believe how everything went sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He considered the brown bear's point about his failings, knowing full well that any more attempts to face Rouge as himself were gone unless he could magically talk to her without getting shot first. Eric sighed as he had an idea how to sneak in, involving a technique he learned under his old mentor the Thief Lord that changed his shape, but there were too many problems that could arise. First and foremost, he could not changed into anything beyond someone he had examined closely since he did not have the experience to change into a random form that he had to make himself without the whole thing falling away after 5 minutes. His mentor could change into anyone or things since he had perfected this ability over the course of several decades, while Eric had only a few years at best after working to learn this invaluable skill for his trade. Second, he had to pick someone who could get past the VIP doorway, but there were too many risks from what the two already knew and talked about that he had to know the hows and whats between them. If Eric stumbled into a conversation that involved a topic he didn't know, the ease of info accessed from his target would lessen and detection could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric then dug into his tool belt and pulled out a small square box before setting it on the ground. He tapped the top of it and watched it extend into a mirror for him to practice on, taking a breath as he decided on who he would test out first. His first thoughts were of his sister Jasmine, a white furred fox not unlike him and his brother Tails who he lost to Robotnik after he was re-caught most recently. Her form slowly appeared in the mirror in front of him as her tough girl look from when she was taken from him, a biker girl with the leather to show off. Jasmine wore a black biker vest with the words \"Fallen Angels\" on the back, cut up jeans that looked like she fell off her motorcycle at some point and shiny black leather boots when he saw her last, along with a knife sheath on her hip that was empty. Eric looked at his sister's form and slowly adjusted her age using the computer in his robotic arm for reference, knowing a preteen would be stopped on the way in the club, adjusting her to be 21 in case someone bothered to check her up. He shook his head at her outfit as it reminded him too much of her death, switching out her tough look for the white furred angel of his past, where she could look like a woman on her night out than a troublemaker for a bar fight. He gave her a small clean up where her leather went away in exchange for a formal turquoise dress, gold open toe pump heels and a pair of small gold earrings with turquoise stones, making her become what he hoped for her future. Eric however wanted to test his abilities against the mythology of humans, using Jasmine as his set piece, he formed what she would look like if she was human to push his skills to a new level. Jasmine's Mobian form slowly altered to fit what he considered a human version of her, from growing to 5'7 as humans were taller to the small features of her pale white skin. Jasmine grew blond hair and remained skinny as he couldn't force himself to make her shapely since he was becoming awkward with her image in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cyborg fox tried to pretend to be Jasmine as both human and Mobian, but he kept thinking of how his sister would react with him using her as his disguise so he quickly dissolved her shape to his own while he considered another option that began to form in front of the mirror. His shape turned to that of Xin, a red panda who did hits for the shadowy organization named Dusk, her short but slightly muscular form did her well in achieving her work. He couldn't help but put her form into a finely designed red formal dress that cost more than he could steal in a week along with her jade heels and a pair of her simple silver jet earrings that she was comfortable in for overt jobs since it was better than her black jumpsuit. If anyone could get into anywhere, it would be the killer with expensive tastes who was known for ending anyone who didn't give her what she wanted, something Rouge could respect. Eric also tested how his friend would look as a human, Xin turning into a young Korean woman who was 5'5 who shared her muscular yet feminine form, but grew dark brown hair that was shortly tied in a small bun for ease. He appreciated the forms she had since she was older than him and could easily go in any club that she wanted, but once he glanced towards the club, he had to reconsider. The whole street was on lock-down, with guards blocking access everywhere and a double set of bouncers at the doors who were frisking everyone who wanted in. Eric sighed as he couldn't show up as a known assassin to her club after he knocked heads, it would draw way too much attention and Xin was anything but the wrong type of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thought deeply about what he could do with the situation he unfortunately put himself into and slowly came up with someone who Rouge couldn't afford to turn away, someone whom had connections with all collectors of valuable merchandise and someone who he could actually pull off. Eric slowly pushed out of his friend Xin's form and into her best friend Sarah, who was well known for being both cutthroat and quite the collector of well sought after items. Her appearance in the mirror reflected a orange fox much taller than Xin, more shapely but not exactly hourglass with her moderately formed breasts and behind, wearing a small black dress and small red orb earrings that she was known to wear, but an idea he had changed her outfit to a one-piece blue swimsuit with a white skirt around the waist. In his mind, Sarah was as cagey as she was smart, setting a meeting with Rouge would be weird if Sarah didn't have a plan and nothing like a dip in Rouge's rumored private pool would make the right balance. There would be no way to hide bugs to record them, no one else to be watching them and it set Rouge in the mindset that he would really be Sarah than a fake. Eric slowly mimed Sarah's walk and practiced how she moved her mouth and her expressions, until he felt like it was really Sarah who was glaring at him for messing with her body in the mirror instead of his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a slowly breath, he climbed down the pipe again and walked towards the club, fully focused on keeping his appearance consistent for the bouncers. At first Eric had to stand by while a bouncer frisked his form and gripped near places he shouldn't have, but eventually they let her into the main floor, which was more animated from his antics outside the club. The disguised fox moved through the crowd carefully until she reached the VIP door with the brown bear that wore the bruises from their last encounter on his face. \"Name?\" the bouncer asked as he looked her over, clearly wondering why this fox would wear a swimsuit to a dance club, but it gave Eric an advantage as he didn't know Sarah by sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Collector, I want a meeting with your boss in her private pool for a little talk. If Rouge doesn't come out, I walk and she loses on some business.\" Eric spoke with her traits, putting her hands on her hips and glaring at the bear until he put a claw to his ear and relayed the message, pausing as they waited for Rouge to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown bear bouncer listened closely before he moved aside for Eric, his expression changing to respect and even apologetic to the small orange fox in front of him. \" Sorry miss, go on in and keep straight until you see the sign. Someone will unlock the entrance for you and will lead you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Eric spoke with a bit of a bite as Sarah was not one for waiting around, but walked through with a sigh as he finally was on his way to see Rouge and get some answers.</span></div></div>",

Is that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccon slowly looked up and a hardened face slowly turned gleeful. \"You old metalhead, come give me a hug.\" The voice was much different than an outsider would've guessed for such a short raccoon, as it was feminine even though the body looked mostly male like with no breasts to speak of and no feminine figure. Only a few in the past would've known this raccoon as Vex, though most would remember what a trickster she was and how their pockets were always lighter when she walked by. With her child-like size, she easily cleared crowds and remained mostly undetected and her flexibility and agility, she was a clear title of an acrobat with lean muscle covering her small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hugged each other, a little awkwardly as Eric had to knee down to hug her, but slowly made themselves to a table where Vex had a filled glass waiting with a bottle nearby. \"So... years go by and not a message? I figured I was tough on you when we were little, but seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, It's especially hard to send a message so far away without giving away yourself.  Speaking of which, how was the far east? Did you bring back something other than your insightful options?\" Eric grinned as Tex slowly chuckled before going into her bag and placing a tanto in front of them, letting Eric examine it. \"Cool, this thing looks genuine. Bought it at the dollar store did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass.\" Vex grunted before she snatched the blade from his paws, holding it up to the candle on the table. \"I got it from some rich kid who had it his family for some number of years. Bragging it was older than the Acorn empire! Figured I'd sell it to the boss or huck it at targets until it served some usefulness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Older than the Acorn empire... seems doubtful...\" Eric commented as he looked at his old friend and started to get a bit more serious. \"Have you heard from our friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVex fell quiet and put away the blade on her belt before answering. \"Yeah.\" Vex then gulped what was in her glass and poured another, as if she needed to dull herself to tell anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to share with the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\" Vex started to explain as she tried to touch Eric's hand, but saw his recoil quickly and felt sad about it. \"Sarah is around, but she has a new name that she'd prefer you use, called the Collector. I don't know  much about Beetle except he made a name of himself putting a 'Golden' in his name from some job he did. Zarran is some two-bit thug for some gang that will go nowhere and Xin... she disappeared again. This time we're all looking for a body, as sad as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Eric remain serious as he heard about his friends and recorded it into his memory, focusing on Sarah as he worried about her and her obsessions. He knew Beetle could take care of himself, as well as Xin as he didn't think she was gone completely, he had already given up on Zarran changing his ways so he just let it go. Slowly he took her glass and downed her drink before letting it slam on the table upside down. \"Alright. We'll keep in contact, but I have somethings I want to do before my leash pulls me back to the fathead. Try to get everyone together, I have a favor to ask everyone as well as settle somethings. Take care Vex and keep your feet and nose to the ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVex watched Eric stand up and leave and saw the weight of the world on his shoulders, bending him to all of his baggage he kept close at heart. She knew she had just remind him of their old baggage, but he seemed to walk it off well, which made her frown as he still kept to his word after all of this time. She drank the rest of her bottle and sighed as she had to get another to drown away a pit in her gut that had formed when he pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, toss me another bottle here, I'm too sober here!' She called out to the bartender who quickly tossed her another bottle, knowing it was better to give then bug one of the Thief Lord's star pupils for cash.</span></div></div>",

Every place in the world has a bounty on capture, dead or alive, it matters little when they had an expensive bone to pick with him. However, even fewer have seen his face, as he always wore a hood and a mask outside of his base. Seven have seen his true identity, and only three have lived between them all, which held the highest trust between them and this legend of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommon courtesy was always expected, and even when Eric knew the Thief Lord to an almost personal level, he treated the man like his king above all. Eric owed his life to the Lord, after taking him in when no others would, training him as a son and teaching him how to change his perspectives on what mattered truely, Eric  tried to hold to the creed of his master even when his programming tried to force him away. Yet some choices are hard to face, and Eric had made many bad decisions against his Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried not to think hard on his past as he slowly knelt in front of a wooden desk with a figure in a rich green cloak sat. The mask the Lord wore was a usual one, a white clay made features of a hearty smile with wide eyes of ammusement, something he wore to fight talk of his old age. Slowly a hand was raised and Eric rose to meet his mentor and friend. \"Greetings Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those freedom fighters this morning were under our protection. \" The Lord spoke in an exhausted voice, but full of an edge that hit Eric hard, as he knew his mentor disapproved of his night job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lord... my puppet master has me under a tight lock, I need to give him something for the freedom to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the cost of those poor people's freedom, no doubt.\" Eric looked away from his mentor and remained quiet as not to be rude, slowly returning his gaze to see his mentor, who sighed before he rose from his seat. \"I understand you have no choice, with that program that makes you into his soldier, but we had people on the inside. Brothers and sisters, who are uncounted for because of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me mentor. I am sorry.\" Eric lower his head and looked down from the man who gave him the ability to be free, despising his uncomfortable postion between friend and his most hated enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pity is pointless, you need to unshackle yourself from him, or you will continue to be a liability to your friends and to me.\" The Thief Lord moved himself to a poster on the wall, which held the rules everyone had to follow in order to remain in the Guild. \"The leader of those Fighters spoke with me the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" Eric was surprised to hear of Sally's presence anywhere near the Guild as her personality profile held the idea of thievery to be completely ridiculous. Yet occasionally she would allow her members to be part of the Guild for the resource, people Eric knew well and knew to keep a blank face to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She continues to ask why we have not found a culprit to the number of her fighter bases capture, and the number of people who are caught from her side because of it. Even with our relationship, at some point I have to tell her something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll figure it out mentor, I always do.\" Eric stood and turned to face the door, before calling back to the Lord. \"You can tell her who I am, you don't owe me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, Eric heard a bit of a laugh, although it was quickly taken by coughs before his mentor's voice returned to him. \"I could, but I'm not too good with turning on family, even when they are a pain in my ass. Goodbye Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Mentor.\" Eric nodded with a smile before he headed out, knowing his other master was no doubt waiting impatiently to bark commands at him when he came 'home'. He hated that word when it came to the hole he had as a place in that tower, little more than a storage room turned empty. Feeling angry as he always did going back, he moved through the bar with purpose in his step, ignoring the eyes of the hooded stranger who watched him go through the door, before finishing his drink with a gulp.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Downtown was one of the most balanced places in the whole city for people like Eric, where the corrupted aristocrat smoked along with a cutthroat loanshark and the rebels bumped shoulders with the machines. Normal citizens who were in constant fear that the next raid was the last, and where the vultures of society were the local men in charge. Not to say that Eric was on the moral high end, he had done his fair share of thieving with his friends in the Guild and even had the friendship of a master assassin who did hits for the Underworld. Yet even he knew he had not sunk so low as the thug beating a man to death in an alley he went by, he was close, but not there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric employed a variety of ears and eyes in Downtown for himself, some with money and praise, others with his fist or a knife against their throats. He needed to know everything about his prey, the rebels who fought his sworn master, and the wiring in his own head. Eric hated the program and brainwashing he endured after being recovered from the Thieves Guild by Robotnik, it kept him in line worse than any beating he had taken. Plus it was forever in his head, until the day he died, he would serve every order from Robotnik. However he bided his time and soon the old man, as well as anyone who would hurt him, would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he planned to wait until he died to be free of Robotnik. He almost had a plan how to get free of his Overlord program, but he did not know the safeguards in place and hoped he did not cut off his life line in the process. He needed an intense hacker and tech genius just to make it to a diagnosis, which was on his short list. He knew of a hacker with the credit to his bragging not too far away, but he was always resistant on matters that related to charity. Eric also knew of several in the Freedom Fighters by their IP addresses and the strength of their attacks on Robotnik, as well as shadow-organizations with low net footprints, but they would be more likely to kill him where he stood then help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end though, he figured for once he could just rest and not cause trouble or be in trouble by visiting some old tourist spots he knew of before Robotnik took control. So he headed toward an old landmark that used to bring him joy, the memorial garden to the deceased soldiers from the Last Great War. He and his brother Miles had played their countless times as their father gave his respect to their memory. Eric figured his dad would approve, and Eric could also give his respects to his dad, whom was killed along with his mother and brother the day he escaped Robotnik. The memory still hurt him, and his robot side always tried to keep him from losing himself in grief. He however was on his guard, as even in his age, he had enemies in shadows and people looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stood in front of the bronze plaque commemorating each of the soldiers names and he felt a moment of empathy for the families who shared his pain of never seeing their loved ones again. But it was gone as soon as it came as Eric dipped his head and knelt at the plaque, the garden now barren as he felt rage consume him, tears running down his flesh cheek. The memories that anchored him to this place dug a hole in his heart. They would never happen again, no longer would he see his mother's smile, no longer would he hear his father's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would be alone, only to rely on himself for survival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To call his place where he slept \"a room\" was a stretch, as it was barely enough space for the mattress on the floor and Eric at the same time. He had to take off the door to what he called \"the box\" in order to fit his own things inside. Yet he made holes in the wall where he stored his personal things, as a form of shelves built into the wall. It was his home though, and no one dared bother him while he was there, mostly since his room was at the top of the tower near his old cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat on his mattress, looking through his arm's interface while a cord that hung from the ceiling charged him up. His battery was still unable to keep a charge for too long, yet he didn't dare try to replace it as it was nested right by his heart, so he stuck to power cords. He glanced at profiles of his targets, each had a number for their priority, yet Sally Acorn was always enemy number 1. Eric often wondered what a different life Sally must be in after her father was wiped from the throne, now somewhere without AC, barking orders to her friends while squatting in a hut. More than most, he wondered why the rebels kept fighting. Somehow after everything they lost, they still had the strength to keep going. It was admirable, if misguided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis time alone was interupted as a furry wolf in skull armour walked up to his spot, his ugly boots resting in Eric's sight before he looked up. \"Get up, we have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What work Sleet? I just took down a whole stealth base, the least I get is a few days off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleet frown and kicked Eric's bed impatiently, crossing his arms stubbornly. \"I don't care you idiot, Robotnik called us both in, get off your behind and we can get it finished quickly.\" He tapped his foot on the floor until Eric got up and unplugged himself, shoving the cyborg fox down the hall as he didn't care to drag this out. Eric thought that something big must've happened to call him back in, possibly some new intel or Sonic out on the loose where he would help Sleet and Dingo get him. Yet nothing brought up his mood, as he really didn't have anyone to make him happy in his slice of paradise since he couldn't save his family.</span></div></div>",

The story is that you were imprisoned from stealing one of my priceless exhibits, caught by a passing security bot. We need you to sound new, less experienced, so tell those criminals in that club to forget you exist for a while. I have the file set up for them to take on their next raid but you will need to change your appearance in case you've been sloppy and they recognize you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been sloppy.\" Eric stated venomously enough to catch the eyes of a passing eagle, who Eric waved off. \"No one knows me except the ones I reveal myself to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause before Robotnik could be heard. \"We will see... Go to a salon or something. I will be watching through your false eye so stay focused and get me that brat squirrel and that annoying Hedgehog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced from the yell right in his ear and closed the line before he joined back into the crowds. Changing his looks would be a miracle as he was dirty, uncombed and his last shower was hard to remember, he would stand out in salon full of clean rich women or men as he was. He quietly stole from passing animals until he had a full wallet of rich green Mobians before walking toward the rich district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a interesting idea in mind how to change his appearance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want this color sweetheart? It doesn't really suite you with those eyes..\" A frog said with a frown as Eric picked a large vial full of red from the display. \"I don't see many red foxes around here scoring with the ladies. That is a color more for the same sex couples. If so, I can do it, we don't judge here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I like that. You don't know how suave I can be... Ricky...\" Eric answered with a toothy grin that made the salon owner a bit nervous, pausing only to read the badge on the frog's collared shirt. He had cleaned up rather viciously so he looked well groomed and could be mistaken for a teenage son of a rich aristocrat \"I just want a different look for a little vixen who might have a heat soon.. I heard through a good source she likes red, so that's what I'm want.\" Eric lied with grace from years of perfect practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog shrugged and rubbed his head. \"I don't know if that is the smart choice. With your eyes, a little white and brown would look much cleaner and less forced. Gentle and more common, yet strong with your... upgrade... respectively. Red normally means you are attention seeking and arrogant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how about this... my base fur color will have brown and white mix, but some black highlights on my hair? How would that look?\" Eric tried to reason with the frog since he wanted to blend in with a puff of individuality while ignoring the last comment about his cyborg body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It might work, Your vixen will like the brown and white and the black will add to the color. I can get the dye down deep, but you will have to manage it through the regrowth of your normal hair which will stand out against the white and brown. We also recommend you dye it every four to six weeks so the color doesn't fade.\" The frog answered before letting Eric step into a private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like looking at a different fox.\" Eric breathlessly stated as he looked into the mirror provided by the frog. The black highlight turned out OK and his fur looked almost natural, so Eric gave a decent tip before he started to head back out to complete his list of to do's. He looked too clean, so he would have to get dirty again to convince the Freedom Fighter he was a thief.</span></div></div>",

He casually walked past the bar and waved off the girls by the bar who were known for their sticky fingers with the men, heading for the back room that held one of the most influential creatures in the entire world, the Thief Lord. Eric was almost stopped by the guards outside but he dropped a code word and they moved aside quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked slowly pass the threshold and when he saw the colorful green cloak that marked rank, he knelt down to the figure who sat at the table in front of him. \"My lord. Forgive my intrusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak Eric Prower.\" A voice strong but kind rang out after a short silence from the hooded figure behind the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, I need a sheet done on me for a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hide from your fellow thieves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my targets recognize me, or thieves who work for them recognize me, I will be caught and killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand this is a serious method, our brothers and sisters will see you as only your disguise, not kin. They will not protect you, they may kill you by themselves, are you sure that you are ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thief Lord rose from the seat of the desk and walked to Eric's spot, where Eric lowered his head in respect even more. \"Very well, from this point on, Ironfist is dead and only Eric Prower will continue in his place until your mission is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my lord.\" Eric stated with gratitude as he slowly rose from the ground, turning to leave but was stopped by the hand of the Thief Lord on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't given me an answer for before, when we welcomed you back into our fold after Robotic got his hands on you. Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric paused for a while before answering with a calm mannerism.\"Mentor, I am not yet ready for either option. I suspect I may be after my mission, but to answer you now would only prevent the right choice from forming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others are getting restless, they want an answer soon or they will intervene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will come, but not now.

By distracting the Security Bots, the three made it inside the gates and into the main chamber. Slowly they looked around and grouped together, being cautious of any cameras they hadn't already disabled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what we're supposed to do?\" A feminine voice asked the two other forms, carefully straightening her designer dress out of dust and fixing her hair back into a rockstar style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, beat 'Botnik butt and save these Mobians.\" An impatient male voice blurted out as he struggled to keep still as he was itching to go and get back to his dinner. \"Can we hurry this up? We just need to disable the power and security, it will take less than a Mobius second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on bro.\" The third figure called out quietly as he held the impatient male in place, this figure also a male but much more calm and patient. \"We need to be quiet, no alarms, or the whole place will be impossible to get out. Just chill and take it slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow?! Come on, you know I hate being slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know.\" Both other figures groaned and rubbed their heads, before the female figure spoke. \"We'll go fast on the way back, but we need to make sure we can take them with us. Not everyone can be as fast as you Sonic, we'll leave with more hurt than safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... but I don't like this. It seems weird with Egghead putting so many low crime offenders in a maximum security prison with the truly hardened monsters. It's like he wants them to suffer, and wants us to step in .\" Sonic softly wondered as they started to walk quietly past guards while hiding behind crates, working their way to the main control center of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was in sleep mode until he heard footsteps that didn't sound like robots and immediately got up and went to his bars. He just caught a view of three hedgehogs, one of which he recognized right off the bat as Sonic and the other two looked like his siblings that he worked with in the Underground. Eric's robotic side immediately tried to reach out and grab them but they moved too quick past him and only the green hedgehog turned to see him before going back to his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, we'll get you out soon man, just wait a little longer!\" The green hedgehog that Eric then recognized as Manic promised as with a confident smile before following after his siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had to breath once they were far enough away, his body kicking into overdrive as he realized that he had three high priority targets right in front of him and they were the Hedgehog Trio. His robotic side was nearly begging him to take them in and to forget the whole mission as they were literally the second highest targets on his capture list. But he had a goal, all must fall, and even though it hurt him to pass up on taking them down now, he had to take down Sally and everyone else too. He just had to hide under their noses and wait patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis time would come, and he will make all of his enemies crumble before him. With Robotnik's head, right under his boot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there.\" Sonia, Sonic's sister stated to her brothers, who were disabling the robot maintenance staff in charge of keeping everything in place and working. \"Security is down and the alarm is cut, but the power is a different problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Manic asked after ripping the head of a Swatbot who was supposed to guard the maintenance team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like this place shares power with half of Mobotrobolis, it links here from several junctions. The second we drop the power here, every Swatbot in town will come right at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good, can't we just reroute all building power to the link out to the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try, but it will be fixed by the main power generators here in a little over a few minutes. We'd need everyone to get everyone ready to run for the main exit once it goes. Manic, go look through the least dangerous criminals here in the records and find their cells releases. Sonic, go tell Sally we need every transport she has ready, we're almost ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it sis.\" Sonic nodded before calling Sally from his headset. \"Hey Sal, get every transport you managed ready, we're about to blow this popsicle stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric drummed his fingers along the floor of his cell as he waited for the three to figure out who were going to be saved or not. Suddenly the power went out in cells across from his and soon his own was dark, yet it seemed it was only few dozen in his district were getting out. Without hesitation, he kicked the cell door open and yelled out to the confused prisoners. \"FOR FREEDOM!\" The prisoners took a second before hollering back his words and then charged to the exit, with Eric following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt always amazed Eric how simple it was to inspire hope in people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly on his left were the hedgehogs who were guiding everyone out into the outside of the walls that imprisoned them. Eric felt his body try to take over and grab them but he held his own, he wasn't going break his cover yet so he instead made it to a pat on the shoulder to the nearest hedgehog, which was Sonia. \"You have a plan for getting us away safe, right?\" He asked over the roars of the prisoners and was answered in a nod as they made it out into the outside world. He could see the sunrise starting over the horizon, with several cars and hover vehicles waiting inside the gate to take them all away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric paused as he watched dozens of Mobians pack into anything that would get them to safety, standing still in the middle of the chaos as Swatbots were shooting from inside the prison out at them, hitting vehicles and people with ray bursts. He felt conflicted as he was literally in a war zone, a place he had never experienced, until someone grabbed his left arm and tugged him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to thrash but stopped once he realized it was Manic who was directing him to their van on the side with the lowest resistance for the getaway. Quickly Manic pulled him into it, before shutting the door and sitting in the passenger seat as the van zoomed off from the prison. He could see through the windows that the transports had nearly gotten everyone away safe, and just one had been grounded and was captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not bad for unorganized rebels...\"</i> Eric thought as he steadied himself with the van's jerks and bumps, glancing at the Trio who were celebrating a well done mission. <i>\"I have a feeling my work is cut out for me on this job...\"</i></span></div></div>",

We have some leftover snacks or some water if your thirsty.\" Sonic asked as he got up and went over to where their passenger was sitting on the van's floor, holding a energy bar and a bottled water out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" The brown fox nodded as he took the water but left the bar and drank it quickly, looking around slightly. \"I would've been stuck in that prison for the rest of my life if you hadn't come, all of you. I don't have much, but I hope thank you will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we're all just doing our job. Say, what were you in for...?\" Sonia asked while she drove the van, glancing slightly at the brown fox as he looked a little rough with his half robotized body. She noticed he flinched slightly before he answered her and took note of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to lift one of Robotnik's gold statues to sell like one of the legends of the Thieves Guild, Golden Beetle. I almost got away until I... triggered a motion sensor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManic felt himself snicker before laughing. \"A motion detector? You must be new to the game, any vetted thief disarms one in the first lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manic...\" Sonia spoke with a sharp tone that made Manic cut the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good at lifting wallets and jewelry, I just got careless and cocky.\" The brown fox frowned at Manic, turning to face the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Sonic asked the fox as he saw past the metal shell, seeing the man inside like he saw the woman in Bunny the Rabbot when she struggled with her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric.\" The fox said before he raised a hand up to shake Sonic's and saw the smile on the hedgehog's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic. That's my brother Manic and Sonia my sister. We're all part of the Underground and the Resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so your Freedom Fighters? Some of the guys in the prison spoke about your group and how your willing to fight that tyrant Robotnik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's us.\" Sonia answered as her brothers nodded and glanced at the map beside her. \"It looks like we're going to be a while from the drop off point, why don't you sleep in the back compartment Eric? It won't be safe until we get there, with all Swatbots out there looking for any prisioners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slowly nodded and watched Sonic sit back with his siblings before he got up and placed something just under a discarded empty bag of chips before he went to the back of the van and went to the lower bunk after closing the door to the rest of the van. Eric then activated the bug he put down and listened from his left ear to the other side of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems alright for a prisoner and thief. How long did you say he was in for Manic?\" He heard Sonia's feminine voice over the bumps of the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only three months, but he was right about his sentence, live without parole for one gold statue of 'Botnik. He seems familiar, I think I saw him before.\" Eric felt his heart drop as he remembered Manic's past of thievery, and having contact with some of his eyes in the guild and realized his cover might be blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't seem to know you, or any of us. Maybe he was just a face you remember seeing in the crowd...\" Sonic quietly come to his rescue and made Manic chuckle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I could've stolen his wallet when I had my skills and remembered his face when he realized it was gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill sis, only joking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric exhaled and turned off the bug to his ear as after that they spoke about the past that he already memorized. He however recorded it in case the fat man wanted to fact check and laid back on the bunk to get some rest. Now he had some trust in them, he was going to put it to the test when they stopped, asking the question that only the serious about the Resistance would ask.</span></div></div>",

Sonia put the van into park and spoke into a radio to Manic, who was on the turret on top. \"See anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's all quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia nodded to Sonic before she got up and went to the back of the van where their guest was probably sleeping, Sonic taking her place at the wheel. She opened the door to find the fox sleeping on his stomach on the lower bunk, looking almost peaceful except for his prison uniform that made her cautious. Sonia gently nudged his shoulder to wake him up, surprised when he nearly jump-started awake and sat up quickly. \"We're all at the drop off,  time to let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric yawned and rubbed his eye as he let his robotic side start up and bring effective power to everywhere. \"Alright.\" Slowly he followed after Sonia as she lead him to the outside, breathing in the air as he faced her with his back to the forest while the van blocked the sun already high in the sky behind her. \"So... Sonia, I know I'm not the best of skill but... is it possible that I could join the Freedom Fighters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis question seemed to shock her as she took a few minutes to respond. \"You a Freedom Fighter? Eric, I don't know enough about you to give you a good answer. You would need to take tests, pass our written exams, give a full history, and even then you need approval from a current member. With your current skills... I don't think you will pass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm going anywhere...\" Eric answered back with a serious look. \"I don't have anyone or anything to go to and you saw how I'm doing alone. All I ask is that you consider it if I went and tried. I just want people who will have my back when things get bad, like Manic did when the prison yard became a war-zone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric that's half the reason why I'm not sure.\" Sonia frown and put her hands on her hips. \"A good fighter needs to be able to handle a battlefield. You froze up at the sight of it, which means you haven't had any serious combat. The last thing the Princess wants is Freedom Fighters who flinch at fighting and can't handle themselves. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was unprepared, give me time and I will come back a different fox.\" Eric spoke defensively, crossing his arms stubbornly. \"I just need to know where to go and a chance. Please Sonia, I just want to try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia and Eric stood quietly for almost a solid five minutes, making Eric nervous that he was pressing too hard and would lose her. Yet he felt relief when Sonia sighed and gave him a start and blunt answer. \"One chance, and you will see how difficult it is. Go back to Mobotrobolis and go to the north section of the city, and wander toward the abandoned slums. You'll be stopped by a patrol and tell them that I sent you to get tested.\" Sonia then gripped Eric's shoulder and gave him a stare. \"This does not mean I support your recruitment, it just means you were noticed. Impress the judges and you'll get in if you make the cut. Now I need to go with my brothers. Take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Sonia walked back to the van before her two brothers gestured goodbye to him, he was silently admiring Sonia from behind as she stepped in and the van drove off. Eric knew he had no chance, but he had to get his material from somewhere and he was broke. \"Hmm, not what I had hoped for. At least I know where to go but without a recommendation, I'll fall flat on my face at the end. I got to get my name out there somehow... get some members interested.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe personally didn't care about the tests, he was treated to the worst of his own with the doctor, surely the Freedom Fighters wouldn't meet up to that intensity. With his false history memorized, he just had to do some kind hearted and nearly suicidal task against Robotnik in order to get the rebels to accept him. He worried that the thieves might remember him if he went too high, so he just thought about normal standards for beginners. He did notice a hint of truth in Sonia's evaluation of his fighting prowess, as his fight were all silent and never went to a real battle, he was at a disadvantage, something he would correct in the passing days. Eric shrugged at himself and walked back the way to the city he enforced for the fat man, ready to crack some skulls.</span></div></div>",

In the South and the West of the Mobotrobolis, he was known as Flint, a crime fighter who fought Robotnik at every turn. Starting every single fight with \"You work for Robotnik?\" or \"You picked the wrong day chump\" Eric turned himself into a know phenomenon, the opposite of his past as a shadow agent even to his attempts to lessen his renown. He now was recognized on the street as Flint regularly, which annoyed him greatly as it reminded him of being scolded by his mother when she used his middle name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of cracking faces and saving kids, much easier than Eric had imagined, he got a single letter from the Freedom Fighters to his makeshift home on the street. In the letter was a recruitment offer and restated the info Sonia had shared with him eariler to go to their center. So at the crack of dawn, Eric set out to the center in the north of Mobotrobolis to become his enemy, a Freedom Fighter. The irony was not lost on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in front of yet another ruin of buildings that fell into disrepair but were hiding the secrets of the rebels. Eric's robot eye already saw the ambush planned in front of him with fighters hiding in the garbage to pounce him, yet he knew he still needed to seem newish, so he just readied his pistol he got from his crime fighting and went ahead like he didn't already spot the main base. The attack was swift and quickly Eric was without his gun and forced to the ground as a grey wolf with a scar spoke to him. \"That wasn't as impressive as you claim you are Flint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually didn't say I was, I just implied it. Now can we cut knocking me down a peg for your new guards and sign me up already?\" Eric asked before he felt himself be blindfolded and pushed into the direction of the main building, rolling his eye as they truely expected him to be that weak. He was dragged into many scanners and searched uncomfortably well for weapons even though all of his body was a weapon. Eventually, he was forced to sit and the cloth was removed where he could see an interrogation room one-sided mirror facing him as he sat at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just watched the mirror as he could see behind it with his robotic eye and saw...</span></div></div>",

For a brief moment, Eric felt himself blush as he saw the real woman that was Sally Acorn, Princess of Mobius, but quickly dropped it from his face in case they noticed. Still, her pictures had nothing on the real squirrel and Eric felt his hormones trying to start up again, only to be suppressed by his robotic side which kicked in. He needed to focus, and after a few quick pictures from his robot eye, he was able to focus on their lips to try and read what they were saying about him. The pictures would wait until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda small... I mean... with the rumors, I expected him to be more than this...\" Sally spoke, which hit Eric a little hard as he was being dimissed by the woman he idolized. Yet he switched to Sonia, knowing he'd prove himself to her later,  and maybe do something with her before or after she was locked up for the rest of her life by Robotnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he has gotten better, remember when I first told you his story about getting locked up, you barely glanced at his report. Yet you're here now.\" Eric read from Sonia's lips and took note, as she had a valid point, knowing she had to see something in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'd rather deal with Sonic than be here. Yet our latest recruits have been so disapointing, this one will hopefully have some merit to his bragging. Juse look at his robitic side, I doubt he could keep up with our tests, let alone the psychological test. He isn't worth our time, Robotnik needs to be stopped soon, not in ten yeas when he is ready.\" Sally spoke coldly and Eric was brought into a frown, losing his patience with the brat of a princess who was judging him so harshly, making note of his anger for when he would be alone with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already support his recruitment Sally, you know we need to go through the motions or we won't know anything. Manic and Sonic want him to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Sally stare at him and slowly made it obvious he was staring right at her eyes, making her flinch slightly at how cold his glare was. \"Fine, but start with the psychological test first, we don't need any more crazy agents than we have already. Get the equipment ready to scan him and I'll go ready a chamber.\" Sally spoke as she walked out, leaving Sonia with the tech recording the room Eric was in. Sonia took a moment and typed something into a computer before Eric was snapped out of his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew what they were up to as he saw the beam of light target him and suddenly his mind went blank as he went through his entire life and every one of his emotions before blacking out and falling to the ground with a thud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia watched as some fighters went in and picked him up before dragging him away to his chamber, wondering how it was all going to go down....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric slowly woke up on a hardwood floor as he wiped away some drool he had before he looked around and saw he was in his old room. Eric tried to remember what he was doing beforehand but it came out fuzzy as he realized he was holding something, which turned out to be his old clock. Confused, Eric looked at his mirror in his room and saw his old self, a complete blue fox kid who looked a little quiet but had a shine in his eyes. He admired himself before he saw his old bird friends Copper, Lead and Nickel chirping pleasantly at him and felt happy to see them after so long, hearing their musical chimes. Eric then went to his clock and put it back on his dresser, seeing his room made him content and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things came into motion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric heard a loud scream, and was snapped out of his nostalgia as his mind cleared and he remembered this fateful day. Without hesitation he went to the window, seeing the events of his kidhood play out in front of him, with his parents being loaded onto ships and sent away as Robotnik and his assistant Snively stood out and barked commands. He saw how motionless his parents were as they were shoved into the ships and ducked under the window, hoping not to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, the Great General Amadeus and his wife, they will be proud trophies for my citizens to see. If memory serves, he should have two sons in the house. Find them and bring them out here, alive.\" Robotnik demanded his Swatbots and immediately they went into the house. Eric took all of his will to calm down as he knew that they would find him and take him away, knowing now that what the Freedom Fighters had done to him was to test his psychological state. He hoped he had put up enough barriers to stop them but whatever they gave him was affecting him badly. Eric turned to face the door but found something that scared him more than anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was in the house, in his bed, asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you... you weren't here...\" Eric froze in horror as he saw his orange little brother resting peacefully in his bed, unaware to the world. \"You got away, Sonic and Sally, they saved your life... you can't be here!\" He tried to reason with his situation just as a pair of Swatbots came in to get them. Again his birds were killed but they protected Tails and not Eric as both boys were dragged out to the madman, Tails thrashing to get away as the Swatbot held him by the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you both are.\" Robotnik spoke pleased as his bots stood the Prower's in front of him, walking up to Eric with a smile. \"You must be Eric and he must be Miles. I am Dr. Julian Robotnik, and you both are now part of my army as well as your little parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Army? What happened to King Acorn?\" Tails asked with fear, trying to loosen the grip on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobotnik only smiled before he spoke to Tails, amusing himself. \"Deceased, I killed him. Which makes me King of Mobius, and as subjects, you must surrender to my wishes, so BOW!\" Immediately the Swatbots who held them released them but instead they and all other bots trained lasers onto them. Eric was confused as this didn't seem right with his memory, yet he knocked to the ground with a hit to his gut, hardly able to breath. Yet Tails, only a few years younger, stood tall to Robotnik and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Tails just do it!\" Eric gasped out to his brother, gripping his stomach as he was kneeling on the green grass of their lawn, seeing the lasers aim directly at his brother and worried for him. \"It's not worth dying over! Just do it! Please!\" Eric then saw Tail look at him and shake his head before he looked back at Robotnik, displaying such strength Eric felt proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, suite yourself kid.\" Robotnik spoke calmly before he went over to Tails, grabbed him by the neck and broke it with a flick of his wrist. \"I don't need rebels, only obedience.\" Robotnik then flicked Tails' body to the side of Eric and faced Eric with such cold and calculating eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his eyes water with tears and he saw Tails laying on the ground, motionless and felt something deep inside his body like he was on fire on the inside. Eric wept for his brother, for his birds and for his parents before Robotnik knelt to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will obey me, until you die, not matter where or when. I am your master. I own you and you will always be mine. Now obey me Eric Prower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to look away but felt the burn of his body again as his body robotized again in a flash, making him gasp again for breath his his body started to go numb as the fire inside him surged out into each limb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My every command is your structure! My enemies are your enemies! You live to serve me, and doing so will complete you! You are obedient, you will always obey me. You are no rebel. You're nothing but a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw a screwdriver fall out of Tails' cold hand, his first one that he had for so long, and felt his own hand grab it slowly without his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy does nothing but obeys, he is a slave to himself, just as you are. You obey whoever commands you, a real man, would never do this. A man chooses, a slave obeys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his visor blur, his eyes go red as he gripped the screwdriver in his hand, seeing blood in the world around him, his body acting for him, making him obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What will you ever choose to do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL KILL YOU!\" Eric screamed as he dug the screwdriver deep into Robotnik's head over and over, his blood lust unquenchable and his mind long gone. \"I WILL END YOU, YOU OLD MONSTER! DIE! DIE! DIE!\" Eric continued until the screwdriver snapped in the head of Robotnik, the man laying on his back in a pool of blood, staring out into the distance with his evil grin. Eric breathed hard as he found himself alone at his home with the body as he realized the eyes were focused on him with piercing joy. He could see the lips move to make out words he would never forget for the rest of his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never be complete again, you will die alone, in the darkness of a great threat. You are a failure, destined to destroy everything you touch, ruin the lives of all you hold dear. You are weak, and I have only manifested your toxicity, not created it. You will end your life with disgrace to your family name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to make the words go away as they bounced through his skull, causing him pain as he felt a white light blind him as he fell for seemingly an eternity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric came to the same blinding light as he started to hear a buzz before words seemed to bounce around above him, like someone was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flint, Flint are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded feminine, and had heavy accounts of worry and something new... fear..? Eric tried his best to sit up but his body was fighting him, as well as a soft hand pressing what little progress upward he managed down. He saw the hand and then his eyes slowly adjusted to the light as he saw the face of Sonia above him, trying to remain neutral but something clearly was eating at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia? What... what happened?\" He croaked out at her, making her move away suddenly, which he took note of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said somethings in the chamber we put you in... you have more than a little baggage and scars than you let on...\" Sonia then held his hand, looking him straight in the eyes. \"You lost someone dear to you, and you blame yourself, and you are out for vengeance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a long while to answer Sonia and when he did, he did so with as much restrain as he could manage...</span></div></div>",

Do with that as you will, just be prepared to leave once your recover.\" Sonia then got up from his bed and walked out to the hall, leaving Eric to brood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I failed...\" Eric spoke quietly as he laid on his bed, thinking on his actions. He didn't even get to see the real base, he failed before he got into the recruitment. Robotnik will have a meltdown, and probably put him into the junk pile. He misjudged the power of the drug they gave him to experience such devastating hallucinations, and now he would suffer once Robotnik called in. He turned onto his stomach and went to sleep, hoping things would be better tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Acorn was meeting with Sonia, Sonic and Manic in her office for a debriefing on the failed recruits. They had already cover a large number of fails, much to Sally's disappointment, when they made it to Flint. \"I don't know what was in your minds when you supported this unstable monster. His demons nearly destroyed one of our testing chambers, he is unfit to serve us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sal, I think we are looking at this the wrong way.\" Sonic told Sally as he leaned back in his chair and rested his head in his hands. \"Did you see the amount of raw power he has? I watched the tape and for a moment I thought my screen might break. We need a strong backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?! He'll kill us all if we don't watch him! That murderous intent, he is a ticking time bomb before he hurts one of us. I need to protect the others in case he goes off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, believe it or not, we are desperate for talent. Most of our recruits never picked up a gun, or even fought more than a street brawl. Now Flint is fresh, but he has talent, if unrefined. Give him the training and he will become a key role in the end of Robotnik.\" Sonia spoke bluntly as she stood up and leaned right into Sally's face, which the ex-Princess stared back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be crushed. He is used to fighting alone, his lone wolf bullshit will end up costing us time and possibly fighters. Plus our teachers will not go soft on him, he will have to face more struggles than he has ever faced before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we're not saying the guy will save the world, but he came to us for help and some purpose. I say we try it, and give him the support he wants. Otherwise the AFF or Robotnik might get their hands on him and do the same before making him our headache again.\" Manic spoke calmly as Sally stared back at him, only making him shrug. \"If he actually kills someone, then we drop him off at the loony bin or a high security prison, but for now you know we have a point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally frowned but slowly sighed before glancing at his final report. \"IF he passes the final test, then he will be considered. I will allow him a chance to make up his poor grade by averaging it with his final. We are finished on this matter, tomorrow he will step into his next test and his actions will allow his chance to work for us.\" Sally then stamped his paper and put it into a file, watching the trio leave and hoping she wouldn't have to pay for another room to repair...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric rolled in his bed as he dreamt of his worries for the future before he felt himself fall and woke up immediately as he hit the floor with his face. He was about to make a smart remark about beds with no walls when he looked out and saw mist covering a room that was clearly not where he went to bed. Alarmed, Eric stood up and got his robotic side up and running, setting up his combat system that made his left eye glow red as it scanned for threats. Eric was confused at what was going on until he realized that this was another test for him as they weren't going to fail him after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this is interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric spoke out but immediately felt something cut the skin of his right arm and gasped out as a small spray of blood came out before he compressed it. Eric gritted his teeth but viewed a playback of the scene second by second and saw he was against some blue wolf with some type of tribe clothes on that showed her body but covered important parts. He would've found her interesting to see if she didn't have incredible speed and precision to strike without causing permanent damage, as well as a large sword that could be used for cutting him in half. Eric tore off a sleeve and tied it to his cut to soak up blood and prevent too much from spilling out, before calling out to the mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're my test? That sword is cheating, but since I'm mostly metal, I'll cut you some slack.\" Eric tried to gauge where she would strike and attempted to defend as much as he could that would seriously hurt him. He suddenly saw movement in the air to his left and immediately raised his arm only to have a blade collide with it as the female wolf was trying to force it to cut through, now visable to Eric. \"Hi there, you'll find that harder to cut lady.\" He spoke before trying to attack the wolf, only to be punched in the face before she jumped back and had her weapon ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take death rather lightly fox...\" The wolf told Eric as she stood ready for any attack, pointing the tip of her sharp sword to Eric, who just crossed his arms and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already died, you just see my shell.\" Eric spoke with even coldness as he realized the temperature near the wolf was almost uncomfortably freezing. \"Say, can we turn up the heat, your AC must be in overdrive for it to be this cold. Can't afford good heating?\" He spoke as he also glanced around for any advantages he could have but few were present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cold you feel is from me fox,\" the wolf spoke as she straight at Eric, now planning her next move as she slightly relaxed her wrist. \"Some say I am frigid or icy cold, but dealing with it and me is your problem. A good fighter for our cause must be able to adapt and to succeed in situations where the situation is dim. Prove yourself by beating me, and you will become a Freedom Fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When beat you, how about we grab dinner together to celebrate?\" Eric spoke warmly, surprising the wolf but she just frowned and shook her head at him, giving him a glare that he shrugged off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling confident, do you? I wouldn't even if you beat me three times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame, you must turn heads at work letting everyone see your body and curves like this. Or am I that special to get to see you in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to tick off the wolf as she angry stared at Eric and took a step forward, making Eric take note. \"Look buddy, I don't know where you grew up, but these are traditional fighting clothes in my clan. I'm not wearing this so I would show off my midriff to you! Now shut up and fight or I'll cut lower next time you talk like that about my heritage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little touchy are you? Good to know.\" Eric then got himself ready to take down the wolf with assistance from his interface. \"I'll get you for a dinner if it kills me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stick with the latter, and you should know fox, those thoughts you're having about after that dinner are delusional.\" The wolf spoke as she got into a fighting position, nearly growling at the young fox who was trying her patience with his jokes and open looks at her body like she was some kind of doormat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric and the Wolf fought a long and terrific battle, with near misses of mortal wounds and high speed, it was hard for an outside viewer to understand what was going on. Yet the fight was a standstill, with the Wolf standing tired but only lightly bruised while Eric was bleeding from several cuts and was covered in bruises and swelling, however still standing. Both gasped for breath once they stood in front of each other again, taking a small breath in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't get it, I hit and cut and he still stands. At this point, most surrender, yet he doesn't look like he wants to stop.\"</i> Frost thought as she held her sword, which had gotten rather dull after hitting Eric's robotic side over and over, staring at the grinning blue fox. <i>\"This is just like that other fight a month ago, but what could possibly drive him to keep going?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric grinned and weakly laughed as he was completely exhausted and was trying his best not to collapse, as his limbs were well used up and his battery was nearly critically in need of energy. He however felt challenged as he was up against a foe who was powerful and with every hit and movement was teaching him new ways to fight his enemies. Her style was blunt power and rapid precision, and with some tweaking, he could make it work with him as well as the many others he had observed and recorded. Plus he finally knew this wolf's name now from the image he ran through his database that he took when she first appeared, which had her as Frost Lynn, bodyguard to Princess Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had spent most of his battery and the fight reading the reports of her as he kept up with Frost, mostly intrigued by her as she had dealt with a very difficult life before she came to fight for Sally. And her history was quite a read, as he tried not to die while he came up with a plan that he was just about to get to the end of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this match is a draw.\" Frost spoke before she slide her sword into it's sheath, starting to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was surprised but pretended to look outraged for the audience behind the fake mirror he spotted during the fight. \"You can't just call a match like that! I'M still standing and we will finish this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is a draw. You are not going to stop until I rip your limbs off, and I don't feel that is necessary for a recruit. Not when your have to do exercises in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt himself grin as he knew he had made it, yet still played his role. \" So I am in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... though barely.\" Frost frowned at his grin and turned away to the door. \"A good warrior knows when the battle is finished, you should've walked away with your wounds, yet you let yourself be a chopping block for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you weren't half metal, you would be dead. That is what made you acceptable, nothing else.\" Frost then opened the door and saw Eric walk pass it before she left the room and closed the door. \"Flint, was it? I warn you that things will get more difficult from here. Your instructor for tomorrow is known for her fiery personality, she does not like smartasses, and will probably run you into the ground. You should rest up for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just kept smiling and walked with her to what he assumed was his room for the night, feeling pleased he could handle the bodyguard of his future target, at least equal her power. \"Maybe. When do you want to have dinner together? You know, since I beat you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost rolled her eyes again and held a firm frown. \"You're still on that? I said it wouldn't happen, and I meant it. Besides, your not exactly my type, meat.\" She spoke roughly as she stopped at a door with Eric looking slightly confused at her. \"Here's your room, be up for training at 6 in the am. Go to the sparing room for your lesson and watch your tone when speaking to her, seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric just looked at the door and turned to see Frost already walking away, calling out to her as a few freedom fighters looked at him as they pass by. \"Wait, your name?\" Even though he knew it already, he had to appear weak and uninformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frost.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric had spent the night tossing and turning as he attempted to charge his battery using a long cord directed into the grid, given though somewhere, someone was annoyed at the steady increase of power draw. His room was bigger than his closet at Robotnik's as it had enough room for a bed and a bathroom with a shower, athough it would seem normal to anyone else. When he had walked in at first, he noticed that a pair of white robes were on the bed, along with a note that was a simple \"<i>Wear this for training, recruit. Nothing else.</i>\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robes were comfortable, and obviously a way to make sure he was at his absoulte basic for training, but he still had the cyborg advantage. He stared back at his own face, feeling his robotic eye naming operational status of all parts, knowing that their was another set of eyes looking back at him through the green glow of the robotic lens. Yet Eric turned away and headed to the training room, which were along the hall for a while, tightening the knot to keep his robes in place as the cold floor made him relax. He knew he could learn a lot from the training if Sonic was there, or even Sally, which made his pace increase as he hoped he would be able to see the true power of the Freedom Fighter and knock it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed several others were waiting outside a room and saw they too wore his white robes, talking among themselves. He joined them and slowly each went in, even though Eric noticed some red robes and black robes on the other side of the hall, taking note that the ones wearing them looked quite the challenge, before he joined the others. Inside, he pushed his way forward until he stood in line in a room that reminded him of a dojo, with large mats on the center of the ground and beautiful imagery of fighting and meditation on the walls. From his spot, he noticed a purple cat sitting on the ground, meditating with her hands out on her lap, sitting perfectly straight up and wearing a white robe to theirs, but with a red belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, one of the recruits yelled out to the cat, a tank of a gorilla with as much rudeness as he had muscles. \"Hey! We're waiting to be taught lady! Get a move on!\" His barking seemed to twitch one of the cat's ears before a plain voice spoke out that seemed to come from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't learn a thing in my class. You should go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The Gorilla exclaimed before he pounded his fists into his chest to show his power and authority. \" How dare you?! I bet I know more than you in fighting! I've taken down my fair share of fools and I won't be insulted by a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the cat sighed before she got up and turned to face her class, her face edged with determination and a spark in her eye that told Eric stories of ability hidden in her, and simply pointed at the Gorilla with a doubtful expression. \"In this room I am your mentor or Blaze, and if you wish, I will gladly show you what I know. Just step forward and fight me, show the class what you know.\" The Gorilla smirked and steped forward but Eric knew he was doomed to fail, recording them as he knew he needed to see what this anomaly in his database could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gorilla pumped out his chest and beat it to show his strength before he charged at Blaze with his large hands outward to hit her, using his weight to add to the intensity of the charge. However, Blaze simply smiled before she stretched her leg back and waited for the Gorilla, shocking the class when she struck. Her motions were perfect with balance and grace of a ballerina, spun in the air forewards before her foot landed hard between the Gorilla's eyes with a loud boom. Then in mid-air, she brought her hands down and swung with all her force against the Gorilla's legs, snapping the large beast of an ape off balance with one foot off the ground, yet she was not done. She then drawed her leg back in the fraction of a second where the Gorilla was off balance and then launched a devastating kick to his chest, sending the Gorilla into the air with a cry before he face-planted on the ground near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd of recruits were gasping and were impressed, even Eric who felt alarmingly outmatched in speed to the purple cat. It had seemed she had spent much more time on precision and balance that when she gained power, she became a walking tank. However Blaze seemed unnerved by her own actions and simply addressed the class, ignoring the unconscious Gorilla she had beat down hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that is settle, allow me to finally introduce myself. My name is Blaze the Cat and I am the instructor for the new recruits to combat. You are beginners, which means you have talent, but don't have a clue how to make it work for you in combat. I will teach you exactly how to fight to take down opponents that we will be facing from Robotnik, as well as for the future of your own lives.\" Blaze then paused to glance at the Gorilla who slowly got up and walked ashamed to the back of the line against the wall, making her grin slightly. \"I do not hold back, only from a stronger force, you'll get stronger yourselves. I also use fire in fights so there will be burns in my course, which our medical center will take care of. I am your mentor from now until you become true fighters, which might be quick for some and some might take years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze let the recruits look at each other and mumble before she put her hand out and yell out at them. \"Alright, enough talking! Your first test starts tomorrow, same time, use the time to prepare yourself for the most intense training of your lives! Now go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched Blaze as the recruits fled from the room, admiring her beauty as well as her ability, as she was definitely a force to be reckoned with. He silently wondered how lucky he was that Freedom Fighter had such pretty women in their force as he was having a little trouble staying on task, but he knew that she would crush whatever he pointed at her in a real situation. He also knew that her speed was a huge advantage but also knew her strength was impressive, which made her the next stepping stone for beating the Freedom Fighters through knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you have cobwebs between your ears? The lecture is over until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric snapped out of his thoughts to see Blaze was standing right in front of him with a frown as she seemed to notice he was the only one left. \"Sorry, I was just thinking about how you moved in that fight. It was rather impressive.\" He quickly excused himself and for some reason found himself blushing about have her close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze however rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"That wasn't a fight, that was me letting him know that blunt force doesn't get you anything in a real match. As well as getting him to shut his loud mouth.\" She then looked at Eric sharply, as if she could see into his soul before she commented. \"Sally told me about you, about the raw energy you got stored up, and how unstable you were during the psychological test. I don't care about that, if you have the ability, do your job. But if it becomes a handicap, as well as the lead strapped to your body, to your teammates or to me, then we have a problem. One I correct with force, and flames.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then gestured to the door and Eric started to head off before he caught the last comment she had to say. \"If I catch you staring at my ass again, I'll kick yours off it's hinges. I'm not here to entertain your thoughts, only kick you into shape. And so help me if you try anything boy...\" He immediately felt himself turn red before he hurried as he realized that he did stare a littld too much at her body while he was there, something she picked up on quickly enough. Eric just sighed before he went back to his room, knowing he need to get ready to be in the worse of it tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze the Cat however just sighed as she had enough to deal with and just closed the room down before heading off to give her report of the recruits. Still thinking about the cyborg fox boy, hoping he would not be a problem for tomorrow when she will knock some sense into her new students.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The start of the week had led them to dueling as Blaze set her own class against her in order to teach teamwork. Eric watches as she danced her way around four recruits with flames coming out of her limbs as she struck each when they missed, crossing his arms with the next group to go up. He carefully watched her movements as he was watching for an opening to strike when it came to his turn, no longer fit for playing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric overestimated his abilities compared to his instructor Blaze, as a week went by of training with her, he realized the game she played. After long drills underground in courses of speed and strength, as well as duels with partners and exercises of body and mind, she coaxed out their true potential. Even with his real set of skills, he found himself winded and often outmatched when placed against Blaze in duels, so much that Blaze made him a point to others on the need of endurance for more than quick fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he could blame her, she was quick to find his weakness, all of his sneaking around and quick fighting in the dark had left him without the ability to handle a longer fight. She, of course, had no knowledge of his true goals and he immediately set himself to improve, honestly impressed how effective she was as a teacher. Blaze had even managed to help him with one on one exercises which he felt himself get stronger, something he would need if she was only the basic teacher for Freedom Fighters, and others were better than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eric felt his patience with her was running out, as she made him a focus of daily training. Every day he had become a focus of how he didn't catch up with the class on run or how weak he was when he held back. It seemed she saw through his to disguise of a recruit and was tempting the rage of a shadow agent with a flare of kleptomania, in which he felt close to granting her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next team!\" Blaze's declaration stirred him from his thoughts as his teammates rushed her and met a predictable fate with the floor mat. He however took his time and let his feet silently go over the mat to circle her, Blaze already taunting him to attack. \"Hurry up Flint, we don't need show offs! If you're going to attack, do it now so we can go to lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric however was not swayed by her remarks, he had a plan, one that would finally land a soild hit to Blaze as he grabbed a recruit from the ground and picked her up. \"I have a plan to take off her smug smile, are you in?\" The recruit looked confused until she saw his eyes and simply nodded as they stood beside each other as the other two slowly caught on and the trio joined his side. Eric recognized the three as they were long time recruits, a fox named Benny, a bird named Alexandra and a monkey named Taz and remembered their fighting styles as Blaze watched over them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Am I seeing some actually brain power here? This should be interesting...\" Blaze commented as she let out more flames and made the room temperature go up after Eric spoke his plan to the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could work... But why am I going head to head with her?\" Taz spoke quietly as Alexandra answered him quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're loud and if my older brother taught me anything, she will focus on you first. Then I swoop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Benny the fox told Eric as they stood together, his height slightly smaller than Eric despite his older age. \"It sounds like you get the glory while we suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benny, this only works if we all do it at once.\" Eric began as he tightened his knot of his robe. \"We all win if she falls for it, just get ready and we could all be moving up in class rank.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Benny nodded before the four got into their stances and slowly circled Blaze, who looked generally pleased with the combined effort, ready for them. Then as quick as possible Taz rushed after Blaze and swung wildly at her with his claws on his hands and feet, amazed when she danced around him and missed his every strike. Then Alexandra flapped her wings before she spun at Blaze and pecked at the cat, while also missing Taz, yet Blaze managed to keep up with them well until she sent out a wave of flames that pushed them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny then charged at Blaze and locked his hands with Blazes as they stood together, both trying to exhert more power than the other. Blaze however just grinned as she tightened her grip and several pops were heard from Benny's hands, smirking as she insulted him. \"Is this all you came up with? I'm not impressed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be...\" Benny grunted with pain from his hands but managed to laugh a little before he yelled. \"NOW!\" Blaze looked around for Eric but realized too late where he was right when she felt her jaw slam shut from a hard hit on the right side of her jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT THIS!\" Eric screamed as he punched Blaze with enough force from his robot hand that Blaze went flying into the wall and dropped to the floor limply. He and Benny took a breath as the class stood in shock and several were debating to call for the medical team. \"I told you she wouldn't see me if I came from below her sight.\" He commented to Benny as the poor fox tried to rub his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did... but man my hands hurt. I though for a second she would snap the bones in my hands, or cook me in flames for that embrace. That was smart to have her distracted right when she dropped her guard. You just slide under the gap between my legs and nailed her in the jaw without her realizing where you were.\" However the two foxes were pulled away from their talk to the sound of laughter as Blaze pushed off from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stood up slowly as she held her jaw, a little shake as she stood on both feet and addressed the class with a smile on her face. \"Now that is tactics. Using resources to the best you can and striking when the enemy is off guard or unable to fight back. Not a clean fight, but successive fighting.\" She then went over to the two of them as Taz and Alexandra came together too, the four of them on guard in case she was going to fight back but she just smiled. \"You're all alright, maybe you might do well for us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class is dismissed for today!\" She turned and announced to the rest of the room, letting the room empty out save for Eric. \"Hang on, stay here Flint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny the fox and his teammates gave him a worried look but left just as Blaze stood in front of him, making him worry about if he was going to leave the room when she hit him in his shoulder playfully. \"I thought you were holding back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gritted his teeth as he rubbed his shoulder, both his mind and his computer system were yelling at him for putting his real effort into knocking her flat. \"I don't know what you mean... I just got lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now,\" Blaze started as she crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow at him. \"You can drop the act, I can tell when someone is lying to me and when they hold back. Since you came in, you've done both to everyone here but now you showed serious power. So why hold back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have been working out...\" Eric started to falsely explain before Blaze put her her claw to his right eye as she held a deadpan expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie again and lose your one good eye. Now, again, with the truth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt like he was on the verge of expelling his true motives as Blaze was not the kind of woman to joke around with. Yet he couldn't tell her or risk being exposed and jailed for life, so he came up with a line that had some truth but not the juicy center. \"I wanted to see how Freedom Fighters handle themselves. Seeing you in action was all I could hope for, why ruin it by stepping up and being shipped to another class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze took a few moments before she retracted her claw and crossed her arms, thinking about what he said and how he responded before she asked him. \"But then, you would see someone better than me. Why stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you know that answer.\" Eric spoke as he stood close to Blaze and held one of her hands, looking her in the eye as he spoke a little too much from his own heart than his hardwiring would've liked. \"I like you Blaze, you are possibly one of the most amazing women I have met, and you can handle youself against anything. Who know who I will have as my next teacher, and I like being right beside you. That's why I want to stay in your class.\" He then dropped a little ice breaker to fight his own nerves while rubbing the back of his head with a goofy smile. \"Plus you're pretty fun to watch, easy on the eyes, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Blaze actually blushed in front of Eric and quickly withdrawed her hand and she tried to get a handle on herself. Yet she clear her throat and waved him away with a few words. \"I um, I expect to see you tomorrow on time. This... this doesn't change your effort in my class, understood? Now... get out of here.\" When Eric nodded and walked out of the room, Blaze felt a little different about Eric. Sure he had some secrets, but what he said about her registered pretty low on her BS scale, he honestly cared for her and that did a number on her expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt himself breath in relief as he walked back to his room and he avoided losing his cover, but also avoided angering Blaze. He felt like he should've said something else and his hardwiring said the same, but he felt a lot better with his own feelings aired out. He did like Blaze, in every sense of the word, but he was also there to scout and eventually give everyone over to his master Robotnik. As much as he wanted to resist, his guidelines were ridged, and the consequence would be his life. However, nothing prevented him from keeping a girlfriend, and maybe she could help connect with someone who could override his programs. But that required him to get close enough for her to trust him, and that required him to keep up with Blaze. He only hoped Robotnik would think that his actions were to get closer to Sally and leave it at that. One thing was clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next classes would be interesting...</span></div></div>",

No longer were there comments about his abilities and no longer were there remarks about his effort. However, Blaze seemed to watch him very closely, in duels and on the track, she had her focus on him while he got better at his own skills. Eric felt like she was measuring him up, seeing what made him tick, and what she did with her results was beyond him. She also seemed in those fight and instructions, to try and catch his eyes like she wanted him to focus on her, from her eyes to everything below. It came a little difficult to focus on the lesson some days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Eric found himself with a small group of friends, the team he used to knock Blaze down a peg as well as the gorilla from the start of class. They all seemed nice, even with his hardwiring declaring that he should make no attachments, he couldn't help but spent time with them. Pulling pranks on the Freedom Fighter with Taz and Benny, helping Alexandra with her possible outfits for the big day that loomed over them, he had almost forgotten the concept of fun. Yet he also looked forward to a day that was coming up, graduation to offical members of the Freedom Fighters, for work and personal reasons he was excited for it. His team were close to their requirements, and he was only a single no hold barrage fight to prove he met the mettle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he was also a little worried, in previous fights with Blaze, he held well to her but often fell flat at the end and got knocked around for his trouble. In the last fight, with judges standing behind protective glass, they had only barely held each other off. Even with his full strength, Blaze was always a step ahead, with his full speed, she would dance around him. So he hoped for the final test between them, he would focus on defense and counter-attacks, making sure he weathered her strikes before knocking her flat like before. But he also felt a little unsure, since he got a note that the fight would happen in Blaze's personal room, without judges or spectators, which set off a few alarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked there in his white robe as usual for sparring, hyping himself up for the fight with strategies to take her down as he knocked on her room's door. It took a few minutes before Blaze stood in her usual teacher outfit at the door but her hair was not tied up, letting him see a more relaxed Blaze then before as she looked at him. \"About time. Get in here.\" She then let him come inside, closing and locking the door behind him, leading him to a large circle mat placed so they could fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we start, do you mind me asking why we're doing this here?\" Eric asked as he stood on the mat, looking around with interest at her room. \"Not that I'm complaining, but I thought final tests were done with judges like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are, but you don't need to worry about that. You need my approval and you'll graduate to Freedom Fighter.\" Blaze spoke calmly, as if she didn't expect him to win. \"Consider this our tie-breaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. So let's get this over with, I plan to win.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two warriors stood proudly on the battle mat, in their fighting stances for the fight that would lead to Eric's higher rank. He tried to put aside the concept that he would then be focused on taking down the whole base and Blaze, as well as the fact they were fighting in Blaze's room and she had eyes on him that were peering into his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet his worries were interupted as Blaze launched at him with quick jabs at incredible speeds, taking all of his reflexs to dodge then and precision timing to throw counter jabs back. However they both did not manage to hit each other, unless someone slowed down and each would get hit until they sped back up. After a while, they then spilt apart before Blaze launched swift swips at his feet and at his head, which he countered by grabbing her feet and tossing her away with a spin. However she grabbed his robot arm and used the momentum to slam her feet into his chest, pushing him to the edge of the mat as his arm blunted the blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was feeling the pressure to beat Blaze, his own system trying to kick in and knock her down.<b> \"Let me take care of it, enough of this nonesense!\" </b>It barked at him before he used his will power to shove down his Overlord program, it growled at him as he violently snarled at it in his mind \"Step in and I rip you out! Now shut up, I am not going to lose!\" He then launched a counter attack of jabs and swips at Blaze, feeling his system constantly intruding on the back of his mind but leaving it be for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was pretty evenly sided, and even after a few hours of constant fighting, both Blaze and Eric were running on fumes. They had put their best into the fight, and found that they knew each other's styles well and that direct attacks were almost not worth it, since they never connected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gasped for breath along with Eric, her hands sore as well as the fresh bruises on her body where he had hit her. \"Hey, I think... we missed dinner call... how about... a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... admitting... surrender?\" Eric answered with a few gasps for air as he was equally bruised and hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze shook her head and then put her hands on her hips, taking in a breath before she exhaled. \"Look, we're both tired, why not get more energy and fight at our peak instead of seeing which one will fall first? Plus I have something ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... wait, what do you mean you have something ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then that Blaze rolled her eyes and went into the kitchen area, with Eric trailing behind her, as she opened her oven and used some holders to pull out a pot of curry she had left in there that was still hot and then rice from a cooker and placed them on the table. Eric was completely lost as Blaze then snapped her fingers and lit two long candles that were sitting on the table. \"Uh Blaze?\" Eric asked as she got out plates for them, feeling like something was up. \"Why does this feel like...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date? Because it is one.\" Blaze replied nonchalantly before she put silverware out and then dug into her fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then pulled out a bottle of wine, but her expression looked a little sour at him. \"I have never let a recruit go into my room, what, you thought I did this with everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said you needed my approval, not that the fight would give you it.\" Blaze popped the cork before she poured into two glasses, then reached into her pocket and slammed a paper on the table. \"Congrats, you got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric stared at Blaze a little doubtful until he saw the paper and realized she was serious, a little annoyed that he didn't have to beat her when he worked his way up to stop her cold. \"So why were we just fighting then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it was our tiebreaker, you may not like it, but I always enjoy a good fight and I'm not one for being square with some fresh Freedom Fighter. Now sit down before it gets cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Remember your mission, play nice or risk losing! She is clever though, watch her closer, or be the fool again.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a little irritated but sat down, starting to eat with Blaze as he tried to wrap his head around what could possibly be going on in Blaze's, but was having no success until he realized something. \"Hang on, their are rules against teacher's dating a student, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze just swallowed before she gave him a predatory smile that made him feel a little uncomfortable. \"There are, but not for fellow Freedom Fighters, so you are free game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Eric felt himself start to blush, as he figured out she had played a game with him, leading him to her room and her little dinner. He almost felt upset that he fell for her game. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted to be by my side. And you made a little remark about my body while you were at it, how it was easy to look at.\" She smirked as she drank her glass, his expression of embarrassment apparent. \"I play for keeps Eric, and if you want to back out, now would be the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Get up and leave now!\" </b>Eric's programing boomed in his head. \"<b>Forget her and go after Sally, that is your mission!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric felt his legs move but he quickly stopped them and instead put his hands on the table, getting Blaze's attention. He knew he would be breaking all the rules that his master put into place, but he had the chance to have a normal aspect of his life, something he'd fight to the death for. So he grabbed his glass and downed his wine and let himself smile honestly for the first time in a while.\"You're not going to scare me away Blaze, I'll stick with you until you get sick of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NO ATTACHMENTS!\"</b> His programing screamed inside his head, making Eric wince silently before he pressed a button on his arm that turned on whitenoise programing he put in to shut it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" We'll see how you do, and a word of warning, if I feel like I'm not happy I will kick your ass.\" Blaze spoke with a little venom before she got remarkably sweeter and grabbed the bottle of wine. \"Would you like some more?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric woke up with a bad headache as he slowly got up from the rather stiff metal bench he was sleeping on the inside of the cell he was locked in. Eric checked his systems on his arm for a damage report as he could feel blood dried under his nose and his chest hurt to find he broke a rib and had a concussion from his latest misadventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his dirty blend-in clothes and saw a dark stain of red in his otherwise white shirt but didn't feel like it was his as his black zip off pants had dirt caked on the knees. His amber sneakers were falling apart, as usual, but this time he was missing the laces on one and the tongue on the other. He then cleared his throat and called out unimpressed to the officer sitting outside of his cell with a mug of coffee and the local paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to make my phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer didn't look like he was listening, so Eric got up and went to the bars before banging his robotic arm against the bars to make a loud metallic ring. \"You already used your phone call before you passed out.\" The officer stated as he turned the page, equally unimpressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed at this before he sat down and hung his head in his hands. \"Is she here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. She stayed the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer then faced Eric for the first time and put down his paper for a moment. \"Want me to let you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay in here for the rest of my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... five more minutes then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rubbed his hair and eventually stood up before shakingly walking to the bars again. \"Haha, real funny. I'm glad my situation is hysterical to you. Let me out, might as well get it over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was escorted through the Mobotropolis Police Department or the MPD by the officer in a pair of cuffs. Not the first time mind you, he was known by name to every officer in there as \" The Trouble Child\" when he was young and now TTC since it was quick with their insults. Eric however was being given special treatment now as he dropped his connection with the evil Dr. Julian Robotnik and now did work as a Freedom Fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rough couple of months since he spared Robotnik's life and supposedly turned over a new leaf. The hardest decision he ever had to make, and hopefully will ever make, that turned out to be a regret he had. Eric wanted him dead for all that he had done, to him, to the citizens he controlled, his family, but he couldn't do it. Now the tub of lard was off in a hideout hatching a new scheme, all thanks to him. At least some of his lackeys were taken down as well. Scratch and Grounder became servants and Sleet disappeared with Dingo, presumably arrested. Eric liked Dingo, even if he was stupid, he was a friend before real friends and helped made his nights comfortable with conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his life as a thief was a harder sell. More of a hobby he started as a child after some thieves took him in, it was something he was really good at and helped in his missions requiring stealth. It was also the resason he was in the station, he stupidly got drunk and bragged about stealing the ring of a very wealthy aristocrat and got into a fight with three officers, knocking two down before the last one managed to zap him with a taser. Not his best day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was then brought into an office where the brass sat and saw the face of the girl he wished wasn't there standing next to the desk.</span></div></div>",

Eric nodded slightly to Sally before he sat in the chair in front of the desk and waited until they would leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything for a long time.\" Sally thanked the commissioner as she started to go towards Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I do this, otherwise his next cell won't have a key and all of his previous charges will suddenly be remembered.\" The police commissioner stated plainly as he stared at Eric, who just gave him the finger until Sally slapped and dragged him out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Sally were driving from the police station, Sally drove while Eric sat quietly in the passenger. For most of the ride, things were quiet, until Sally pulled over and just sat there as traffic went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd we stop?\" Eric asked as Sally turned off the vehicle and then rubbed the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't control yourself enough to stop being a bonehead, so you are now restricted to base for six months. You also have to hand over all of your tools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned but slowly took off every single one of his tools for thievery and put them in the backseat. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also no mission time, strictly desk work. And I swear Eric, if you mess up again, I will drop your ass in that cell myself and revoke your status as a Freedom Fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally scoffed and looked like she was going to slap him again. \"Oh, you get it huh? Seven times you got into fights and got caught stealing from our allies and you get it... now?! You have to be the most stubborn and idiotic thief I know, even Manic got it together, but you can't even stop for more than a month without casing a score. What do you even get out of it anyway? We provide your bed, a roof, meals, you don't pay for anything, we pay you! Instead, you go out and take what isn't yours for what? Some cheap thrill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was quiet and Sally sighed and started up the car and drove again. As they parked in front of the base, Eric saw Blaze and Tails standing by the door, Tails worried, Blaze furious. \"Shit, you can still drive me back to the cell, step on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you are going to face them yourself. I will make you face a therapist after Blaze tears you a new one, mandatory, so you will get over it. Now get out of my car.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to resist and got kicked out of the car in front of his brother and his girlfriend and slowly got up before Blaze socked him in the gut. \"You idiot. You had us worried sick.\" Blaze then grabbed Eric and pulled him into the base with Tails following by, trying to loosen Blaze's claws that were digging into Eric's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Blaze... Could you let me and Eric talk...? Brother to brother?\" Tails asked as Blaze she shoved Eric into a wall with her claws digging into his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine be quick, I need something to punch something, I'll be at the training room.\" Blaze stated before she walked briskly away before she hurt her boyfriend. Tails shook his head and brought Eric to his room he shared with Sonic to try and figure out what was going on with his brother.</span></div></div>",

So, go ahead.\" Tails then crossed his arms and remained quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I have work to do, talking with a therapist from Sally and a bunch of deskwork. I don't want to do this now.\" Eric spoke rapidly as he got up and went to the door out of Tails and Sonic's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get it out eventually, and if it isn't me, it will be Sally or her therapist. I want to help, think about it before you go and get yourself in more trouble.

I just hope I can walk tomorrow to work after Blaze gets me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails frowned slightly as Eric rushed out of the door and slowly laid on his bed, worried about his brother and his issues with letting the past remain in the past. He hoped that someone would figure out how to get him in order for his new life as a Freedom Fighter, as his brother moved along a self-destructive path if he kept up his nonesense.</span></div></div>",

Everywhere he went, he would be ambushed by the robots he fought many times over for pratice or while he pretended to be a Freedom Fighter. He could feel his legs burning, his heart bouncing in his chest as he put everything into keeping his feet moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to keep moving, even though he wasn't sure why, only that it meant his death if he stopped. The trouble came when his foot hit a hole in the ground and he fell hard on it, hearing a loud snap as fire rushed up his leg, screaming in pain briefly. <i>\"Come on!\"</i> He felt himself scream out in his head, as he got up, trying to ignore the pain in his leg. <i>\"Keep going!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned to see what had been chasing him, Robotnik stood in front of him, his eyes budging out as it made a horific laugh that made his ears ring. The fat man then pulled out a remote from his pocket, one that made Eric terrified, the one which his mind turned against him. \"You pathetic runt, you don't have the guts to face me, why don't we bring out the real you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Eric felt himself drop to his knees, begging for Robotnik to change his mind, almost crying as Robotnik almost hit the switch. \"Don't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he screamed out as he felt himself fall, the wind rushing through his hair and clothes, the weight of the world eased up on him before he looked out at his world. He was falling from Robotnik's tower, almost to the soild ground below him that would turn him to paste. Eric tried to move his body but it was as if he was held in place, closing his eyes as he hit the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric slowly did as he saw his family home burn in front of him, each member of his family against the side of the house, lifeless. His mother Rosemary staring out at him with a soft smile before timber from the house felt and ignited them. He knelt at the ground as his home turned to a pile of ash, slowly surrounding him, choking him as his world went white, before suddenly it went completely dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he was on a street from his time as a thief, his friends Sara, Xin, Zarren, and Tex were off running in front of him, smiling except Xin, generally happy as he tried to stand and follow them. They seemed to go to the guild, a tavern that he called home for years of his life, pushing through the door and beckoning him to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric push through the door however, and found himself freezing cold before a familar face reached out at him. Frost Lynn then pulled out her sword, pointing it at him like she did in their duel but she was standing with the full army of the Freedom Fighters, all there as he held an unconscious Sally Acorn in one hand and another with a gun pointed right under her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to turn away before he found another flash of light in his eyes and found himself staring at the edge of the Robotnik's tower, Juilan Robotnik gasping for breath as he dangled over the edge from Eric's robotic hand around his neck. The only thing that kept the fat man alive as Eric stared right into Robotnik's eyes. \"Eric, this isn't the way.\" A voice called out to him from his side, the cool, calm voice of Hypon as he stood by Eric and put a hand on his shoulder. \"Let him be tried by Mobius, don't let him change you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll get away!\" Eric yelled out, tears rolling down his eyes as he felt the rage in his heart grow, tightening his grip on Robotnik which made him choke out. \"He'll get away and I'll be my fault! He'll continue to hurt others, others who don't deserve it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you Eric, you want for the pain to stop, his words to no longer affect you. A killer wouldn't care about the lives of others, only his mark. Please, put him down, don't make this mistake. Tails needs you.\" Hypon tried to calm Eric, seeing the fox cry as they looked out at the whole city. Eric almost felt himself be overcome by the rage just before he saw the same switch in Robotnik's hand as before, only able to mutter out a single word before the fat man hit the button, lost on the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then felt himself scream out as red filled his interface, Overlord stepping in before he could stop it. He felt his hand close around Hypon's neck before it snapped in two, dropping the wolf to the ground as he put Robotnik back into the tower and let him go. Robotnik then sneered before he pointed out the hole and yelled out at him. \"Time to get this finished once and for all, kill them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\" The form that took Eric's body grinned toothily before he swept out of the tower, Eric eyes watched as he killed all of the Freedom Fighters with his own hands, before going before Tails, the last of the whole. He tried to fight the Overlord but it only laughed as it drove a blade through his brother's neck, holding his own brother's body in his arms before Eric regained control and began to sob while the blood soaked around him, in a lake of red as the Freedom Fighters laid around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up already.\" Eric heard his own voice in front of him and looked up to see the Overlord Eric grinned with a bloody knife in his hand, his red interface darker than the blood around them. \"The difference between us, is that deep down, you need me. Why you continue to resist me, I will never know, but you just need to tap in on me kid and the world will be ours. I will make your problems, disappear!\" Then the Red Eric grabbed him by his hair before putting the blade against Eric's neck, the warmth wetness of the blade only increased his fear as the wild smile the Red Eric turned to hysterical laughing and as it plunged the blade through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric snapped his eyes open as he shot up on his bed, only seeing red before he saw everything normally, realizing his heartbeat was way higher than it should've been. He realized he was gasping for breath and slowly sighed out and started to correct it as he checked his interface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" He heard a soft voice from beside him as Blaze slowly glanced up at him, still half asleep with her head on the pillow, closing her eyes again. \"Did it happen again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\" He sighed out before he laid back, turning to see her beautiful face before he kissed her forhead. She slowly put her arm around his chest as they held each other, making Eric feel a bit better, though his dreams scared his more than he was willing to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to sleep, I'll be here for you.\" Blaze spoke out quietly before he could hear a soft snore, making him  realize it was only a few hours before daylight. He slowly closed his eyes and tried to get comfotable before he said one last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" </span></div></div>",

Of course, he didn't actually say anything about his nightmares, or anything at all about himself than surface information that any file would have in spades. The last thing he wanted was to reignite the fear of the Overlord program taking him over, and he knew that not one single person would understand unless it happened to them. He did talk about the abuse he got from those who he was supposed to consider his peers, where they treated him exactly the same as the thugs or monsters they chased outside the walls of the base, which his therapist shrugged and tried to make him consider their fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah right...</i> Eric would think as the person chatted away about stress relief practices that he didn't acknowledge. <i>Everyone is afraid of the backstabbing cyborg agent that nearly got Sally and the base captured. It's not the right word. More like they hate me, for being the one who didn't get locked up in their search for justice, the one who got a free pass after letting his old boss run away instead of capturing him, the one who let the war continue instead of ending it when he had the chance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue fox beat himself up about it more than anyone else, how he had planned for years to take down Robotnik, only to watch him fly off. He tried to consider being angry at Hypon for stopping him, as it was only him that kept the fury at bay, but really it was his own choice and Hypon was only doing what he thought was right. Yet it didn't help calm the pain in his heart, which he tried to drown with drink or his nighttime activities, and ended up in worse waters than before. He hardly focused on the head shrink who talked about what they were to cover for the next day, his head already out the door as he body followed, moving along for his steady habit of paperwork to begin for six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric got looks and grumbles at him in the hall, a steady supply from others, while he made his way to the desk that would sit in Sally's office. She wanted to keep an eye on him and likely wanted to harass him over her own feelings of betrayal, which she claimed to be over, but the cyborg wasn't stupid or unable to see how she frowned when in front of him.

The sterile walls and rug of a typical secretary's office were clean and pictures hung of friends or environment shots both before and after the war started. In the side of the room was a small desk that used to hold a rather angry lioness who left with more of a whimper after a certain wolf took matters into her own hands. It would be where he was to set up, although he had his work cut out for him. Eric noticed the rather daunting pile of folders on top of it first before he caught the small chuckle of the wolves on the side of it, in a small embrace while looking into their own eyes. It was coming more common to see the two together, particularly with how playful they seemed to be to wander off for a while, reminding him of the previous relationship Frost had before when it was fresh. Usually he would attempt to be polite and ask them to go somewhere else if they were getting fresh, but he felt tired and didn't want to deal with them at all. So he instead closed the door with a firm thud, watching the Ice Wolf who was pressed against his new desk flinch and pull away to face the noise with a hand on her blade. \"Eric! Don't do that again!\" Frost exclaimed once she spotted him before giving off a small sigh, fixing her clothes while clearing her throat for being caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you weren't on my desk, I wouldn't have to. Now if you don't mind, I have work to get done while you two have the time to fool around. Now move.\" The cyborg fox answered with narrowed eyes at the wolf who was started to blush, moving over to the desk while going past Hypon without acknowledging him. \"Well, someone is in a good mood after talking to the therapist... \" Frost spoke sarcastically as she made room for the fox to sit at the desk, putting her hands on her hips while Hypon crossed his arms in thought. \"Just do your job and be thankful you aren't in a cell or worse...\" Eric stared at the wolf who was a bodyguard for Sally decreed by her father before the war, watching her kiss Hypon and motion outside before leaving the two of them alone. Frost had nearly slit his throat once he captured Sally and held her against the others, her loyalty to her friend stronger than most other bonds he had ever seen. It took the combined effort of Hypon and Sonic to yank her off until Sally could order her down, though the potential to continue her efforts always remained in both Frost and Sally if he was to step out of line. Despite the wolf's cold words, he could at least respect her wishes for her friend's safety and how she seemed to help balance Blaze after he was exposed, which was not a simple thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Eric realized Hypon was looking him over in his typical manner of finding answers to questions he didn't already know, turning to match his gaze with a stern and tired question. \"Don't you have somewhere else to be?\"</span></div></div>",

One day you may understand that.\" With that, Hypon departed with Frost and going down the halls, making his statement loud and clear on where he stood towards Eric's lack of communication with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was a wolf who had connections with several people, organizations, and enough experience to walk in Sally's shoes but didn't want the title of the leader as he never felt worthy of it, rather being a solider or a tactical strategist under her employ. The Night-Blood cared about Eric and was not going to let him destroy his own life just to get some petty vengeance towards a man that everyone wanted dead or apprehended. Hypon had his own stories to tell about that same sentiment towards a full list of others. Killing people would be too easy and Hypon knew that if Eric did what he wanted to Eggman; he would have been changed forever...He was hoping Eric could see past all of that as he helping him from behind the scenes with Sally, unlike Frost who helped him from the inside, handling the relationship with Blaze.</span></div></div>",

When he motioned for her to follow, they both started to walk down the hall while silently thinking about their encounter with the former secret agent now paying for his crimes. It wasn't long until Hypon's thoughts were interrupted by his partner Frost, speaking low enough for him to hear and no one else in the hall. \"I've been taking to Blaze and she told me that he's having nightmares about the old days. Going wild... going after everyone...\" After a bit where they reached their newly moved in room, Frost walked in with her Nightblood boyfriend and spoke more directly from her own thoughts while he sat down on their couch. \"I know I'm not the best when it comes to technology or dealing with broken trust, but are you sure he won't turn back into that thing? Eric said that he got away with his controller, the one that bends him to his will, shouldn't we be a little more worried?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hypon turned to face her, he could see the topic was bothering her from her feelings towards Sally's safety and knew that she wouldn't ask unless she took the time to think it through. \"Tails says it's gone, and I trust his judgement. However, we won't know for sure until Eric runs into him again and is put to the test.\" He reassured his girlfriend as he stretched out, feeling a small bit of tiredness creep up while he added the small warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally won't be happy. She still wants to haul him into our high security prison in case he starts up again, gets a request almost every day from one our fighters, as if she needs more persuasion...\" The Ice Wolf interjected before her partner could relax, her own feelings conflicted between friends and loyalties as she sat in one of the other chairs near the couch. \"I don't want to say I agree, but I can't imagine leaving the situation alone is good for the health of our cause, especially when it snuck up on us once. It would put people's minds at rest, at the very least.\" </span></div></div>",

Just because it is the simple answer doesn't make it the best answer, Frost. Eric seemed completely unaware of the presence of Overlord and that should be no fault of his; not all computers can see every virus hiding in the mainframe. We all have made mistakes, some of them comparable to the drastic events that have occurred but if we threw every single person who has wronged the Fighters; there would be no room for people who actually deserved to be behind bars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon spoke from a realistic point of perspective, speaking from his memory of being a mercenary and from his experiences in several different organizations; he was going to defend Eric's lack of information at the time of the occurrence and judge him from there, rather than after the fact with what they know now. Overlord had been squashed as they know from Tails' first hand investigation and with it, Eggman's control of the blue fox with a vendetta. Did Hypon agree with everything Eric wanted to do? No, but he was a friend. Hypon was going to make sure that Eric was protected even if he didn't want the protection from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then went back to his relaxed state, adding as he reclined, \"But I do agree with one thing, leaving the situation alone is the worst part of this. There are some changes that need to be in play when it comes to the defense of everyone's safety.

However he felt his mind drifting away towards anything else, while he leaned back in the uncomfortable chair for a moment, closing his eyes. Doing paperwork wasn't his favorite thing, which was bad enough, until he realized how old much of it was and knew it was pushed on him as a punishment than just business as usual. He was starting to get pretty sick of being treated this way, feeling a small bubbling of anger in his gut while he glanced at his boss' room, letting his annoyance paint the door where the squirrel was inside. She came in a few moments after the two wolves left, giving him orders to keep pace with the paperwork while she went inside her private room for a call, which annoyed and made Eric curious. Even though he was no longer a spy in an offical sense, he couldn't help himself from being kept out of the loop, as it had always put him into a bind when he didn't know the cards already in play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard for him to hear what was going on behind the door. Once a upon a time his robotic and normal ears were trained to detect even the most subtle of sounds such as tumblers in a safe or the most silent of talking. If he could see someone's lips, he could tell most of the time what was said even from a distance, however, his ears could still detect the pitch and pronunciation of letters from close by. So he tapped the sensors in his arm and dragged his finger over the sensitivity until he could make out the half of Sally's conversation on the phone. \"-and... I know you need help Lupe... the betrayal hurt us. I can't spare one fighter... the fox caused us damages we are still trying to repair, no way of knowing how much he could still do... Yes... I don't want to talk about what he might know about me. It makes my skin crawl Lupe, you know that... Not to my knowledge, but his brother says it's safe for now... Just do what you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyborg fox could feel the frown on his face as he fixed his ear to normal ranges, regretting his choice to spy on the squirrel, but was also rather angry from what he heard. Clearly Sally didn't bury any of her feelings, but the edge in her voice hurt as much as it showed how much she truly felt about him. Eric let off a sigh as he made his robotic hand start to file papers while he thought, trying to balance his state of mind without making a scene with his boss. It was true he had gathered a wide array of information on Sally before they had even met, and he developed feelings for her when he was younger as it was hard not to see the woman behind the throne. He knew just about everything he could want to know about her, from her past to more recent things, but it was mostly for his task of capturing her for Robotnik. Sally however saw <i>all</i> of what he held about her when Tails plugged him in to erase Overlord from his system, understandably freaking out over things he had thought or pictured about her while he was dealing with his younger demons. Eric had apologized countless times for it, but that would never erase it from her mind, even though he only cared for Blaze in that way now. What made him mad was treating him like he was on a timer before causing another incident and treating him like a creep for how he had felt as a teenager, which hurt what remained of his pride after everything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you don't have the same thoughts for Sonic, even if he sleeps with every girl on base before seeing you Princess...\" Eric mutter out sarcastically as he thought, followed with a bitter taste left on his tongue from the words. He did shake his thoughts away from his bubbling anger with another sigh as he leaned back to the work in front of him, trying to get back on track despite the pain in his chest over what his life seemed to turn into.</span></div></div>",

Now, how she summoned him is what usually annoyed him, using one of his favorite people as messengers: Cream the Rabbit. He never got mad at Cream for delivering the news but it made Hypon think that Sally was using the child as a shield after the fifth time it had occurred and that was what really bothered him. Sally had other ways to message him and several other messengers but she always chose Cream, the person he treated as a daughter to him. He didn't know if it was just fate, Cream's request, or just Sally trying to get under his skin but he never really thought about it until this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon didn't know what the talk could be about as there was a long list of things but the first thing that quickly came to mind was Eric and Overlord as since he has been involved with both sides of the same coin since the night he stopped Eric from making a bad decision. He was also there with Sally and saw all of Eric's demons painted on the screen when the erasing was happening. If there was a long list of reasons why he chose to defend Eric even after all the stuff happened and how he has been treated, the top of the list would simply read, \"Eric Prowler is the victim, not the monster.\" He didn't change how he felt towards the Blue Fox but Hypon wanted to avoid touching any open wounds with his friend unless he wanted to talk about it, taking a more subtle approach than being the doctors and play 20 questions with the mentally scarred fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone wolf walked the halls towards Sally's office, his mind deep within thought about what the conversation was going to be this time. Sally and Hypon had the moments of agreeableness in the past but they usually fought, never really seeing eye to eye on anything. Most days Hypon felt like he was talking to a wall and Sally saw a fighter who was high on their own horse but they both had experiences with the world so they still continued to talk, even if the talking sounded like a courtroom drama. Hypon stopped at the door before taking a deep breath and saying to himself, \"Ancestors, give me something to cling on towards so I may stop this chaos...\" With that, after a few more seconds; Hypon opened the door and stepped inside, ready to face the squirrel that summoned him.</span></div></div>",

I guess I should let her know you're here, like the good little worker I'm supposed to be...\" The cyborg fox looked thinner than usual and had deep circles under his eyes that didn't speak of restful nights, but when he stood up to go to Sally's door, Hypon could see a glowing band on his ankle like were used for prisoners on house arrest. Eric didn't notice Hypon's gaze and knocked on the door three time before opening it up and speaking out to the squirrel at the desk. \"Your appointment is here, Princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally hardly looked up as Hypon entered, waving off Eric as he closed the door behind him as he left while she looked over her own thick packet of information. She did speak up once Hypon grabbed a chair and sat in front of her desk, raising her eyes to meet his with the same hard stare that came from authority she held. \"I have a job for you to do, concerning a few issues we have as a result of your friend in there. You did your own research on the project that monster had about that fox, didn't you?\" When he nodded, the squirrel continued without missing a beat, her voice becoming more cold as she went on. \"You are to aid Tails and download everything his database has, removing any and all sensitive information that he should not have on us, but look especially for anything he has on our enemy he hasn't been telling us about. He is hiding things from us and I will not let it slide until everything is on the table, every name and resource he used or any other moles or agents that are still in place for Robotnik here or otherwise. If he won't agree to it, he has to go into a cell, there are no more chances about this. Do you understand or have any questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point Hypon could hear the chair from outside the office scuff the carpet, likely moving the fox in or out of his seat to the conversation that wasn't as private as Sally wanted. He alright knew what the cyborg fox's answer would be to such a demand, but Sally herself seemed ready to fight back given their history and the look in her eyes.

Asking me and his brother to do this is going to make an enemy out of the one person you don't need to. Put yourself in his shoes for a moment and be reasonable here or better yet; walk a mile in mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then threatened, \"You don't understand how much pressure I have been dealing with so don't treat me like one of your 'subjects'. I am your boss, not your experiment. I have to make the tough choices here so don't you dare play the high and mighty card on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then sighed before getting up, \"Your 'decisions' may reveal more things that you may not want to know...especially after the last time.\" Hypon wasn't able to continue after feeling a very hard smack connect with his face from Sally. Sally knows what Hypon was insinuating and was having none of it as she added, \"Don't...you...dare mention that again in my presence...\" Hypon's mood remained firm as he looked at Sally, adding, \"All I am saying is to give him a chance to redeem himself; like you gave to me. This isn't the first time that we've been attacked on the inside. The AFF tried to frame me for the last attack and you listened to reason. What's so hard in giving him the same chance for basically the same thing? You and I both know that he was not in control at the time and it's not his fault that he did not know about the plans that Eggman laid out for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Hypon were basically having a shouting match at this point, louder than their usual ones as Hypon tried to defend Eric while Sally wanted Eric to come clean about details. Hypon could only wonder what was going through the mind of the blue-tailed fox outside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of pointless shouting and constantly circling; Sally then asked firmly, \"Enough of the stalling, I want an answer now, Hypon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then turned his back towards Sally and walked to the door, giving his answer without looking at her, \"There are several things that we agree on Sally and even parts of this is included in that discussion but I will not be a part of removing pieces of someone's memory without their actual consent. You may be the leader of the fighters but you are not the person with that authority. Rethink your decison...then we will talk.\" With that, Hypon made his exit, choosing the lesser of two evils; agreeing with half of the problem but not the methods on how to solve it. He glanced at Eric as he entered the waiting room, hoping he heard everything as he made his exit outside the office entirely without looking back. He made his choice and was about to inform the one person who needed to know what was coming if he didn't already know about Sally's plans.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally was about to go after Hypon for what he said, furious at how he treated her less like the leader of the Freedom Fighters and more like a recruit doing something stupid, yet the cyborg fox stood in front of the hallway door blocking her. At first the squirrel was about to shove him away, but the fox raised his arm out in order to keep her at a distance. \"Out of my way Prower! That wolf doesn't get to walk away from me after talking like that!\" However Eric just stood and stared at his boss without saying a word at first, but slowly started to speak from what he heard and his own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say to me when I was given my title as Freedom Fighter Sally?\" When he didn't hear a reply and was shoved once more, Eric continued with a low tone. \"You said that 'a Freedom Fighter should always fight for those who cannot fight for themselves, to aid those who are the most harmed under the hand of our enemy, to guide those who are lost back to the light of salvation.' I may have been a spy at the time, but even I won't forget those words. You have, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former princess however just shouted back at him, feeling the fury in her chest explode in the form of mocking laughter as she jabbed a finger in his chest. \"You're innocent?! You?! Our people were captured because of you, turned into slaves! Our base nearly was captured by that scumbag and I was held hostage by you! Every single person here and the war was at risk of a fate worse than death and it was because you put it in jeopardy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Sally! Don't you dare put all of that on me!\" The cyborg fox snarled, scaring the squirrel who took a step back with a frightened look on her face. He continued without hesitation as he finally could speak his mind without a filter, his tone sharp, but slowly calming down as he stepped towards her. \"I am SO sorry for putting your people on the line, and I know I made you uncomfortable with my file on you, but stop treating me like I'm going to turn on you and stop wishing I didn't come back from that tower.\" When Sally tried to step in and argue the point to regain control, Eric shut her down immediately. \"No! You don't understand what it was like being his prisoner! You got away with your friends and could play soldier in the forrest, I was there for YEARS! I didn't have any friends, I only had HIM and his goons for company. The few people I did know after I tried to escape turned me over to save themselves, then Robotnik made me watch my family being killed as punishment for leaving him! I didn't know it was fake until Tails stood in front of me that day, I though they were gone forever because of me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally bumped back into the side of the desk as Eric stood a foot away from her, alarmed at being alone without any backup, right as she was snapped back to the fox in front of her. \"What do you do when you don't have anyone or anything left Sally? When everything you knew and everyone you had were gone because of your actions?\" She could see tears slide down the side of his face as he stood there, feeling the weight of his words between them. \"I never wanted to be his agent, he wasn't my proud mentor, he was worse than a monster and I tried like hell to break free well before the attack. His 'Overlord' program is the worst kind of control Sally, every thought and action was filtered, at points I had no option but to obey under threat of my system overheating and exploding or him taking direct control and causing a bloody rampage. Everyone here was always painted an enemy because I didn't have the freedom to think otherwise, they were just objects in my path to get to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood quietly for a moment, sharing the first look at each other since the day Eric stood on stage to accept his membership to be a Freedom Fighter, before he spoke for the last time. \"I'm not innocent by any stretch, but I could never fight for myself before my chains were removed by Tails. Why did you think I went to confront Robotnik once I was free? I went to finally get him for what he did to me since I was a kid, taken from my family and forced to be his slave. Now I am as free as I can be from him and I want to earn my path back to the light. All I ask is to be given a fair chance, for you to respect that I'm trying not to be the same person and it's hard to change so quickly.\" The cyborg took a breath once he aired the bubbling anger in his gut, knowing that there was no way for him to return to work after what happened, so he went back to his room and left Sally alone with what had been said by them. He hoped she could give him a chance to do better, but did quietly acknowledge that he worried about being a risk to the cat he had feelings for as well as his brother if Overlord wasn't through, since it would go after them first.</span></div></div>",

He sent a message to Frost to advise what had happened in the office before signing off with a slightly cryptic message which was his code for, \"I may be out for a while...\" He knew Frost would be the next one on the list to be talked to (if she hadn't been already) and he didn't want her to be punished for his lack of agreement with Sally's decisions. But Hypon said what he meant: she was going too far. <br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting over Knothole and the base had hear rumblings of what had happened but Eric was able to get past most of the blame as Hypon took most of the heat for them. However, as Eric turned the corner to get to his room after trying to simply sneak out for some food...he saw a haunting figure that he had only seen once. There stood the Night-Blood Wolf, dressed in his tribal garb and covered in his tribal colors, something that Hypon hardly shown to people outright unless he was making a statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon glanced at Eric and simply smiled before leading the conversation quickly, \"Thanks Eric. I heard about you standing up for yourself and me to a degree. I want to give you a fair chance at walking back into the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, still stunned at the appearance of the wolf, answered back, \"Sure...what's with the getup?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon responded, \"To remind the people who have forgotten the animal behind the jacket. I assume you heard about my initiation fight with Frost years back? This was the same garb I wore for our rematch. The first time, I tried to reason with her by using my cunning and words...the second time, I used my strength and actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized how serious Hypon was taking his stance against Sally's words to him but couldn't help to think that he may be going just a tiny bit overboard but Hypon was known for being the neutral party unless you have angered him before saying, \"Just don't bury yourself or everyone else around you while trying to save me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon nodded in respect before walking past Eric down the hall, \"I will try, Eric...but my fight is with Sally...she will hopefully remember that I am more experienced in the field of spys than most people...present party excused... \" Hypon then turned the corner before leaving Eric alone with a small takeout box of food from the base kitchen, feeling the haunting gaze of a specter of the past who had just appeared in the form of a friend.</span></div></div>",

He went through at least 100 papers before lunch and was surrounded by several older freedom fighters and other fighters that were out of the graces of Sally, causing a mixture of stares in the paper room. Eric knew the stares were not going to end, especially due to the fact that news of what happened to him when he stepped into the cafeteria. Eric had almost every single eye on him as he went to get his food and sit in his usual spot, quickly noticing that someone was sitting across from his seat, knowing who after the years of looking at him and trying to hunt him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's rare when I have four people contact about the same issue, Eric.

Eventually, he put down his fork and rested his hands on the table. \"I am between a rock and a hard place Hypon. I swore my allegiance to the Thieves Guild, and now I have my oath to assist the Freedom Fighters or risk going away into some prision. Both ask me to put them first, above everything else, even family matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then looked away to stare down a Freedom Fighter who was giving him a side look, before continuing. \"My closest friend is the head of the Thieves Guild, I look up to him as a father that I didn't have at the time. Sally wants me to leave the man in his old age and swear to never help him again, this man who was there for me when no one cared about a freak of nature. I would rather die, than spit in his face by abandoning him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I hate myself, for not finishing off Robotnik, letting him flee on his ship after I tore down his fortress and nearly all of his toys. All I had to do was drop him off the side of the tower and yet he lives to cause more pain and misery. I feel the same hate of myself in the eyes of the others here, they all are wondering why I 'let' him get away, instead of finishing him.\" Eric growled as he sat back and sighed, right when a familiar brown lynx walked in, immediately frowning the second she saw Eric and walked off. The blue fox glowered at himself before he picked up his fork and speared some more food. \" I don't blame them for hating me, after all, I put a gun to Sally's head and nearly got everyone here taken by Robotnik when I lowered the defenses. Stupid Overload program bullshit, at least Miles wiped the worse of it from me, so I can control my own body without going psycho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ate a little bit while silence hung between him and Hypon, ex Antifreedom fighter and GUN agent, before he spoke again. \"What am I supposed to be doing, other than be miserable? Right after being without options for a decade, I jump back in with nothing but awful choices. Everyone has it out for me, and rightly so.\" Hypon noticed Eric was completely agitated and saw that he was beating himself up hard from how he spoke to not taking care of himself enough.</span></div></div>",

She shook her head before she spoke to the Captain, her posture perfect and almost addressing him as if he was less than her. \"Thank you, I will take care of it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better.\" The Captain responded with an edge in his voice that Blaze didn't take kindly to, yet she held back her words as he continued. \"Next time I'm letting Acorn settle it, and if she tells us to leave him here, we will.

This is about survival, cut the Thief Lord loose with your condolences, or you will not as useful to him for much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't leave my friends behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric...\" Blaze responded just before her boyfriend got out of her car and headed to the base entrance, making her sigh as she was really trying to help him without violence but her patience was slowly draining away.

Sally was less than happy he got a huge role in their defense, but he proved to strengthen  the base and not be a hinderance so she let it slide while having weekly check ins so he didn't muck around. He heard a bell ring and he glanced over to the feed which had Sally standing outside his door, waiting impatiently for him to open the door, the angle giving him a view down her jacket.

I have to literally break up sections and change it bit by bit, and you should be glad.\" Eric tried to explain as he glared through her stares, turning the screen so she could see his work. \"Right now, it would take a supercomputer to hit us in order to break into this base's files.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? That sounds like what we had before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head and ran his hand through his hair. \"Maybe five years ago, but now you can almost compete with something brand new. Trust me though, I'm not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this Sally stomped her boot into the ground and pointed a finger at his head. \"WHAT?! How much longer could this take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe another month. Then the base will be years ahead of hackers, which is a slight advantage. Once I do a test hack and can't get in on the first try, you should be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as Sally cooled off and slowly brought herself to speak again, this time barely holding back her annoyance. \"You better have it done by next month.\" He watched he head off and close the door behind herself as she went to her office, slowly spinning back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I miss the days where I was the one barking orders to Sleet and Dingo. Not that they listened much, but having a boss who hates you sucks.\" He spoke to himself as he leaned back and rested his head on his hands. \"Of course I was the brainwashed minion of a sociopathic narcissist, but at least he gave me vacation days.

Not wanting to have this argument again when someone could come knocking and hear it, having to explain yet again how he wasn't crazy and he was just talking to his system. <i>\"I said I was sorry and that it was just my prgraming, not to mention the hundreds of times I said I was sorry for that file!

Anyone who says differently is selling something...\" William Goldman from the Princess Bride</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire life was a balance of expectations and routines, one after the other. From punching the ancient oak tree bark to strengthen her hands and feet, running for miles and sparring constantly with the tribe's boys, she was in the best condition for her age of nine. In her tribe, there was no exceptions once a child was able to walk and talk, you did whatever work needed to be done. Being the daughter of the chief, she was expected to be the highest standard for all of the tribe, and Frost took great lengths to be her father's example. Frost had spent years studying the ancient texts of their past, learning to hunt for food and resources in the forest with the hunters, and learning how to fight anyone and win. Yet her efforts were never treated as enough, her father always had more to give her and she did her best to finish what she started, but occasionally she wondered about her father's motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wonder she did as she went through the forest trees, her tribal cloth covering around her blue fur and her sandals moving through the rough soil. She was on her way to meet a someone, her prize hung on her waist, a brand new short sword that her mentor Aaron gave her as she put a few claws through her soft long hair in order to put it into a ponytail. She could hear the sound of the river stream, trickling down the hill, anxious to show off her prize when she stopped a few feet from the stream path, suddenly aware of a pair of eyes trained on her. Her hand went to her sword hilt, when she felt a breeze by her head and raised an arm to catch a soild kick that would've spun her head around. Frost then blocked several other attacks using her arms and shins to absorb the blows, before she grabbed one of her attacker's arms and flipped them over her shoulder, getting on top of them while pinning their arms to the ground with a smile on her face. \"Nice try Sammy.\" Frost playfully commented to her attacker, who in the sunlight was a lioness with an equally playful grin on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think.\" She smirked before she kissed Frost's cheek, starling the ice wolf until she felt something furry wrap around her bare waist. Before she could react, she found herself face first into the dirt with her arm pulled behind her back, the lioness letting out a small laugh as she sat on her back. \"Aren't you the one always telling me not to let my guard down? You should learn from your example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost however did not worry as she used strength to push off from the ground, the lioness startled with an eep as she was tossed off and Frost grabbed her arms, putting them up above their faces as she again rested on top of the lioness. \"You were saying Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha did a small pout but grew a smile as Frost let go and helped her back up, both of them brushing off dirt from their fur. \"Ha, still the best. I thought you would forget about my tail, but nice job with countering my counter.\" They both sat down by the stream and dipped their bare feet into the water, feeling the cool refreshing water as it drifted by. \"Nice new hardware Frosty, you must be proud reaching warrior status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked hard to get this far.\" Frost answered back with a grin, although she felt embarrassed about the kiss since Samantha had used it to trick her. \"Speak of hard work, how is working with your dad at his forge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness kicked over a stone with her toe, but answer in a normal tone. \"It's rough, but I'm better than I was before. It takes a lot on my arms, and my hands always need attention when work is over, but I'm not quiting. My dad wants me with him, every since Mom died, he wants to be closer to me so I don't feel lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm here for you. No matter what, I'll be there.\" Frost reassured Samantha, but felt herself grow a little more serious with her friend, a dark scowl forming on her face. \"I understand, ever since Asher died, my dad has been trying to keep me too busy to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha got quiet as she thought back to when the news hit that Asher Lynn was killed in an ambush, how it shocked everyone to the core when a signs that a rival clan of Night-Bloods were suspects of the attack that left their once soon-to-be hero with many stabs to the back years ago. \"No one saw it coming, my dad said that we used to be friendly with the Night-Bloods, now they're little more than a memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance!\" The ice wolf next to her exclaimed, the wound not healed as her friend had expected. \"Those traitorous back-stabbing monsters deserved what they got! My father did our clan proud when he lead the attack on that village of theirs, wiping everyone out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness worried about her friend's anger, putting her hand on Frost's cheek getting Frost's attention of her worried expression. \"Frost, you don't mean that... they were just like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They stopped being like us when they murdered my older brother.\" Frost countered sharply, standing up abruptly, when her closest friend just watched her, the ice wolf let out a small sigh. \"I-I'm sorry Sam, I've ruined our moment together, maybe we should meet tomorrow at the forge. I'll try to be in a better mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha just stood up and hugged Frost, pulling back on the hug to kiss her lips softly, turning the ice wolf's cheek red as she pulled away. \"I hope so, maybe we could talk about lighter things, like the shade of your fur when I mess with you. Just try to keep positive, and cool it when you get those thoughts. Just think of me and it will be better.\" She smiled as she patted Frost's cheek and ran off in the direction of the village, leaving the ice wolf wide eyed and with a goofy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She knows me too well.</i> Frost thought as she felt her heart slowly start to calm down from the workout it got when Samantha kissed her. She then moved in the direction of the village, going to see her father to show him her new sword and rank, hoping he would be proud of her and not question what she was doing out in the forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Living with the chief of the village has it's perks, as Frost lived in the largest house at the center of the village, while the rest lived in smaller homes. Each home was based on the weath of the family, a mix of straw was for the poor homes, wood for the stable homes, and metal which was for the ones who could afford to maintain it. Her home was most wood and reinforced with metal supports, one of the few second-story homes in the village, yet the best looking and well managed of them all. Elaborate patterns and pictures were painted to explain their history to the outlooker, but only the Keeper of History would tell those who proved themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost stood outside the door to her home, feeling a bit hesitant to go in as she was half-expecting trouble by her father, yet swallowing her concern to push the curtain away and went in. Her home's interior was decorated to honor past chiefs, weapons and other relics were scattered along the walls, each with their own story that she knew by heart. As she made her way through the foyer, she saw the curtain for her father's room and saw the flicker of light from under it, leading her to it as she called out into the room. \"May I enter father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, daughter.\" The deep voice of her father rang out from inside, letting her enter and kneel before to show respect to him. As she looked up and saw his grizzled blue fur covered by the fur robe he wore like his father and the one before, seeing that he was looking at a painting of Asher done years ago while a candle was lit on his desk. It pained Frost that her father spent so much time staring at the face of his son, when it only made him angry of what happened. As she thought, he turned to face her, his eyes sharp and his focus on her, something that made her shiver as he was a force to be under as he towered over her. \"I see that Whiteclaw gave you the sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father.\" Frost replied quickly as she unhooked it from her side and held it up so he could examine it. \"I fought until he had no choice but to award me the prize. I am now a warrior like you and grandfather before us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father picked up the sword and pulled it from it's sheath, holding it to the light before returning it to his daughter. \" It will suite you well as you work, now go and clean up, we are expecting guests tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guests?\" Frost asked as she rose from her place, hooking her sword back on her hip, unaware what her father was talking about and a bit hurt that he did not offer her praise for all of her hard work. \"You did not mention we were hosting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father stared her down until she looked away before responding. \"I wasn't aware I had to tell you anything daughter, I do not need your approval to do my work as chief. The only reason I mentioned it is that you need to be formal for this dinner, so get a bath and dress in the gown your mother prepared. We are playing host to the Ox clan, with their leader and wife coming for dinner, as well as their son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost frowned as the Ox leader's son was a notorious jerk like his father and was a handful of years older than her. Even with the visitors, she had a bone to pick with another thing her father mentioned. \"I'm wearing a gown? Dad, why can't I wear something else? The Ox clan aren't too picky with what they wear, why can't I go to dinner like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you need to look good for your suitor. Even he will be dressed formally as for the traditions of our tribe. Of course you will marry once you are older, but the marriage will lead to great trade and improved relationships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost sighed and frowned as this was one part of her responsibilities as the daughter of the chief, to marry off to someone she never met or cared about for the benefits to her tribe. Even though she had argued with her father for the last few months about the topic, he was content with sending her off. He seemed to laugh when she suggested that she should lead the tribe in his place, her father arguing that all other clans and tribes were led by men, and a female leader would spell weakness in his opinion. When she tried to compare herself with her brother Asher, who also was groomed for chief at her age, her gender seem to convince her father otherwise despite her skills that were equal to Asher at her age. Frost had another problems to this role that she was expected to play, firstly, she could no longer fight or hunt to provide for the tribe which made her angry since it was her life. Secondly, she would be expected to have children and one of her children had to be a boy in order to lead the tribe after her father, where he would take a role she could fill on her own if her father allowed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to her final problem, that she had no intention of having children with a boy. She had none of the feelings that other girls her age had about the boys of the tribe, the only person she had feelings and cared for was Samantha. According to her friend, her feelings were normal, but her tribe was very traditional and such acts were highly discouraged, so they met in private to talk. Frost wanted to talk about her father about how she truely felt, but with the stress of her other issues with him and how traditional he tried to hold her, she kept quiet. One other girl who expressed similar feelings was exiled to the woods away from the tribe, along with her close friend. So Frost was more than hesitant to admit anything, for her safety and of Samantha's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must behave for dinner, your mother and I are using your real name, so no nonsense tonight.\" Her father spoke as if she didn't have a choice when she moved to leave the room, but the rigidness of her own tone made him sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will only answer to Frost, and if we are showing them the true us, my 'suitor' should see what he will get..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, the name your mother and I gave you is far more beautiful, it's symbolism of your birth will be more attractive to the Ox's than 'Frost'. I know that your brother gave you that nickname for your powers but please humor us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Frost growled as she left, leaving her father's room frigid and freezing the flame of the candle in mid-flicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father equally growled in annoyance that his daughter was being so frustrating, but understood that like the rest of her family, she had grown up much too soon from the death of her brother. He peeled away the ice flame as the temperature grew back to normal, turning to shout up hall as his daughter made it to the stairs.\"Fine! But in exchange your mother will put makeup on you, and do your hair when she gets back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Frost yelled back as she stormed up the stairs, willing to deal in order to hold her ground.  She could already tell that tonight was going to be very unconfortable for her and her family, as the Ox tribe were always war-hungry and they were used to getting what they wanted, by force if it was possible. She remembered the Ox clan leader's son's name was Dante, and that he liked to mess with her by making her look stupid, something that was stopped by Asher in the past. She felt like punching him in the face the next time she saw him, but she was willing to try and play nice, at least so when the two of them are alone, she could explain why she was not a good choice and he could convince his father to drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... she had higher hopes to rule the world than for that plan to go smoothly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I look like an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost commented as she stared into a mirror, watching the reflection of her mother Rebecca work on her hair while staring at her own look. Her gown that she was to wear was traditional, a pale buckskin gown that covered most of her body to her ankles and a pair of beaded moccasins to cover her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a beautiful young woman.\" Her mother's gentle voice spoke behind Frost's head, braiding her long hair into two long braids that would rest over her shoulders. Frost watched the red fur of her mother's hands work through her hair with practice, a sour look on her own face. This had been their progress once Frost had stepped out of her bath and was given the gown. She disliked dresses and gowns alike, the simple breechcloth that most children her age wore was so much more functional. Frost had not figured out a way to fight in a dress without giving up her speed or flexibility, but apparently others had before her somehow. As for braided hair, when she ran it always smacked against her, so she prefered her hair to be free or in a simple ponytail. A last, she still had to honor her deal, though she had other reasons to be alone with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\" Rebecca answered as she finished one braid and worked on the other, her red fur glowing in the candlelight, as well as her gentle yet sharply toothed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to do this for Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother laughed before she answered, the amusement in her voice was hard to miss. \"Oh yes, I did indeed! My mother helped me just the same, but I'll never forget how uncomfortable your father looked in his clothes, like he'd rather be somewhere else than sitting at the table with his parent's and my family! Of course, back then, I was known to be quite aware how to twist a boy around my finger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Frost exclaimed with reddening cheeks with embarrassment as her mother chuckled, and finished up her last braid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll figure it out in time, it's how they act around you. The same goes for you, they can tell if you mean what you say or if it's all hot air. The trick is to balance it in your favor, just enough so they are guessing and want to learn more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost thought about what her mother said and wondered if that's how Samantha played with her, drawing some parallels between the two. She then decided to test how correct her worries were about her feelings for Samantha from her families perspective by asking her mother a direct question. \"Mom... if a girl likes...another girl, is that consider wrong?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I liked many girls that were at your age, we liked the same things and they grew to be my friends. They are the best friends I ever hoped to have, although I don't agree with all of their choices in life, I will always care for them and like them for our time together.\" Rebecca answered back calmly as she sat with her daughter, although Frost frowned as her mother misinterpreted what she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mom, I meant... in the love way. Is it wrong for a girl to love another girl? To... have feelings above companionship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the love way...\" Her mother repeated as face hardened in thought, making Frost's heart beat faster as she hoped that she was wrong about her thoughts, until she heard her mother's soft voice. \"I don't believe so, although your father believes that it is. He holds to the notions that men and women are only meant to be together from the ancient texts in order to continue the tribe's lineage, and that disrupting this balance puts others at risk in the tribe. But it is never that simple in my option, the heart wants what it wants, who are we to judge why a woman or a man should be with somone simular?\" Rebecca then knelt in front of Frost and gripped Frost's hands, looking gently into her daughter's eyes. \"I'm not sure why you ask dear, is something on your mind? You can talk to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt her body go numb as she was at the point where her next words would decide if she would be rejected or accepted as how she felt. Her heart couldn't stop from beating like a drum as her secret held in was about to be revealed. She thought carefully about her choice of words as her mother moved to face her daughter, a concerned look on her face for what seemed to bother her so much. \"Mom... I really don't like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Frost, Rebecca dear! Our guests have arrived, come down and greet them!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rebecca and Frost heard the the shouting from the door, but Rebecca simply held her daughter in place, not through with what she wanted her to hear. \"What Tara? You don't like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ladies, please come and say hello! Our guests have come a long way and deserve the courtesy of a greeting before we began arranging the plans for the better future of our tribes!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ice wolf just sighed however, lowering her head as she realized that her fate was already decided by her father, and just spoke in a low tone. \"It... It doesn't matter how I feel. Let's just go down and get this done already Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was rather worried at what seemed to hurt her daughter so much, but let go of her hands and watched her leave the room. She had never seen her daughter look so down, and as she followed after her, she was already thinking about their conversation and what it had to do with her interupted statement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Frost walked down the stairs, she was greeted with the sight of a monster sized ox who stood with his neck bent in order to avoid poking holes in the ceiling with his massive horns. He stood several inches taller than her father, wearing green silk robes to show his endurance and connection with their nature, with his clan's emblem on the back, although Frost imagined him with battle armor and a huge axe that would level buildings with a swing by the muscle that spanned his body. He had deep dark blue fur simular to her father, but his gut betrayed him even under the robes, bloated with many a feast. The Ox King himself was speaking to Frost's father, who strained his neck staring upwards and discussed tribe matters, but it was the king's son at his side who caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante stood about half of his father's size, he had much more growing to do but it was clear he had not changed. His black fur was as spotless as it was ebony and he seemed just as arrogant and stuck up as before with his frown as he looked over her home, like he was staring at something he stepped in. He also wore robes that matched his clan but they were red which did not surprise her as he was to project his ability to fight to the death for what he wanted and show off his looks that some girls went gaga over for her. However Frost felt that his outfit didn't suite him, as for an Ox, he was the most underhanded and cowardly. He was not much for open battle, but for tricks and lies, and that made her watch him carefully. Plus the fact his looks did him no favors with her, as she spent most of her time without caring what she looked like and went on what was comfortable.The idea that they would be married made her gag, but not as much as the thought of her having a child with him. Yet her thoughts were stopped when they caught eyes, silencing the house around them as the two locked their focus to read each other, trying to exerting their dominance over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frost dear, so glad you could join us, why don't you sit with us as our guests eat.\" Her father raised his voice to get her attention, quietly waving her off from her staring contest as he also addressed his wife Rebecca. \"Dear, tend to the fire and make sure we are well stocked to feed our guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost glanced over at the King and Dante and made her way to the fireplace, where she stood with her father until their guests sat opposite to them on the sofa, then they both sat down in their chairs. She watched as King Ares noticed their wooden bowls filled with dried meats and fruit as well as a pot of stew that filled the room, seeing him nudge his son before they both filled spare bowls with what they saw. Rebbecca immediately went to replace what each Ox had taken with fresh supplies as they ate, moving back and forth as the Ox King and Dante ate their fill. Frost felt less anger as she saw Ares treat their customs with such respect, something his son barely had, and sat with her father as he waited patiently for them to be full. It took a few minutes before King Ares put down his bowl with his son's and put his full focus on his host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Rebbeca for such a wonderful meal and helping us get out of the elements. And to you dear man for allowing us the honor of meeting in your home. I brought a gift to honor the occasion, I hope you accept it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's father sat patiently as the large Ox dug into his pockets and presented a single kinfe that looked like a relic from ancient times, but held the same symbol of his clan. Her father gently took the knife and examined it with a soft smile before he put it above the fireplace, returning to his seat once he was done. \"We will treat your ancestor's blade with the respect we have for our own. Thank you and the Creator for such valued company, but I suppose we must discuss our tribe's future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, we shall.\" Ares dug into his pocket's again and pulled out a paper that he handed to Frost's father, before he took a breath. \"This will be the symbol of our trust in each other, all you have to do is sign along with your daughter once we cover what shall be expected. Now, I hope it goes without saying, but we cannot have my son marry your daughter until we meet the requirements by both of our customs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Frost father spoke immediately. \"In our customs, she is much too young to marry, so we ask that your son wait until she is in her teen years. We also desire that there are two ceremonies, one for our tribe and one for yours, as we hold to honor both our ancestors and your own. Finally, the first born son will head our tribe and the second born son will lead yours after your son Dante.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAres however frowned before he scratched his chin in thought, speaking aloud. \"Very well, but our tribe has a tradition that the strongest sibling becomes King. This applied to me and my oldest brother, as it did for my great gran-father, so what if the first is the strongest and not the second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's father also frowned in thought with the Ox King but came up with a simple solution. \"Perhaps a third born? And the measure of strength could be between him and the second born?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be acceptable.\" Ares nodded, however he noticed Frost made a sour face when her father mentioned a third son, making a note of it but pressing forward. \"Our tribe also has a tradition where on the night of the wedding ceremony, the two must consummate their commitment. I trust this will not be an issue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt a part of her wanted to declare that she was never going to mate with Dante, but she knew how this would look, and possibly be misunderstood as spitting in the Ox King's face. Yet Rebecca passed her a look as she moved behind the two Oxes, as if she had pieced together what her daughter felt, but her father answered for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter will honor your custom, only give us time to educate her, and she will not insult your son once she takes his hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good. Now why don't we let the children go off to your daughter's room and talk, while we discuss details of our clans?\" Ares asked as he nudged his son again, snapping the black ox out of staring into space in boredom, giving Dante a firm look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, lets give them time to learn more about each other while we talk details. I'm sure they must be tired of hearing us ramble about the future.\" Frost father spoke with a smile as he turned his back to the Ox King and faced his daughter with serious eyes. \"Run along sweetie, please be courteous to Dante, as he will be your husband one day. Go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost did her best not to scowl in anger as she stood up and went to the stairs, letting the black Ox follow her, but refused to address him as she let him into her room. However she now had a way to speak to Dante in private and explain her case, even though he was a dick, she hoped he would back off her and tell his father to withdraw the offer. Yet even as she looked at him judging her room, she felt like the battle had just started and not ended, pleading silently that nothing would jeopardize her secrets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So this... is where you sleep?\" Dante commented in disbelief as Frost walked in and closed the door, shaking his head as he turned to face her. \"I half expected an Iron Maiden, or a bed of needles for your attitude when you address me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're at the cleaners...\" Frost answered sourly, her hands on her hips and a scowl clear for the Black Ox to see. \"Dante, why is your father coming here and asking my dad for me to marry you? Does my temper draw you like a moth to a candle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! If you're a candle wolf, then I am your wick, soon to be buired deep into you!\" He laughed heartily until he got a vicious slug to his gut, dropping him to his knees as Frost pulled back her fist, clearly not amused with her eyebrow twitching with barely contained anger. \"How should I know...? I figured you father made a deal... in order to have peace between us. I don't have much of a say either... do you think I care to marry you?\" Dante coughed out as he clutched his stomach, slowly getting up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost just looked at the black Ox and shook her head, considering the merit of truth to it, yet feeling no regret for hitting him. \"No... you'd rather have someone you can manipulate, you know I'd put you in your place. Fine, but you need convince your father to drop this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante scowled and sat on the bed, much to Frost's anger, yet he just narrowed his eyes. \"You think I haven't tried? He doesn't care, it's all about the fate of the tribes or whatever. I'd rather our troops raze this place to the ground, leave you troublemakers to the wild like you deserve!\" He however sighed and crossed his arms, making a small pouting face. \"Oh well, maybe we'll destroy another tribe like yours did the NightBloods, that could be our honeymoon. Besides the sex, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt her claws come out as her patience was being tested, but slowly relaxed and let them return, standing right in the Ox's face. \"There isn't going to be honeymoon or wedding. You need to know something about me Dante, but what we say does not leave this room. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Do tell...\" The Black Ox perked up, immediately and intrigued with that of a secret, especially from his future wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I don't like guys that way, I'd rather be with... well... girls...\" Frost mumbled out, feeling extremely uncomfortable with telling the truth as she had spent so long keeping it a secret to him. However, Dante's response made her feel even worse, with the cackle of laughter as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a lesbian?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" She asked back, not as familiar to it Samantha had described their attachment as 'gay', yet she felt like he was insulting her from his outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this rich, you don't even know what it's called! It means you get turned on by girls, you like them more than a guy! You're gay! No wonder this deal makes you worried! You don't want to get your cherry popped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost however just stared at him, steamed and clenching her fists tightly to sock Dante again, and nearly shouted at him. \"I don't know what fruit has to do with this, but I'd never want to be with a bastard like you!! Tell your dad to drop the deal or you won't get a single kid from me! I'd rather die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The Black Ox grinned, his sly smile maded her skin crawl as he got up from her bed and poked a finger in her face. \"Fun fact, I'm not the one with the problem. Your dad's deal requires that you get laid, preferably by me or your dad and mine might get angry. If you back out, you'd risk embarrassing your clan and putting them in danger. In my clan, putting others in danger counts as treason, which the consequence is death. I believe your clan shares these beliefs as do we, so why don't we make a little deal so everyone is happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Wolf growled as she felt that he had something planned, but sighed and crossed her arms again before she responded. \"And what deal could possibly be worth it coming from you Dante?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante grinned before he went over to Frost's desk, where her sword laid in it's sheath, picking it up and examining it. \"Well, I don't want to mate with you anyway, but as my father said, you have to consummate on our wedding day. So I propose that I screw whomever I like and you just play housemaid in our home, only to be considered my wife at formal events. You can do whatever the hell you want as long as my clothes and house are clean, maybe even find someone who likes you. Who knows, I may find you someone to play with while I'm looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Housemaid...?\" Frost bared her teeth in rage, the thought of being a servant to Dante made her entire body sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes. Clean my sheets, clothes and tidy around our home, make meals on time. And the tribes will never know the difference, well, until it is time to get a child.\" Dante commented as he pulled her blade out and spun it in the air, not seeing the dark cloud of hatred forming over Frost. \"I have to get a child from you, so I may just put my seed into you after my own fun and once you grow the children they want, you can do whatever. If not, I tell daddy about who you are and watch as your father get beheaded by my dad.Think about it, I'll see what you think on our next visit.\" The black Ox then drove her blade straight into the wooden floor and wiped his hands before he left Frost to herself, going to get his father to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the cold logic to what he wanted from her, but her heart burned to the thought of Samantha and the thought being someone servant in such a demeaning manner infuriated her. She was a hunter, historian of her clan, a Warrior! She was no one's housekeeper, especially to a manipulator like Dante. It must've been his way to get her back for how she treated him. If she was disgracing her ancestors, they wouldn't mean much if they wanted her to be a prisioner in what would be her own life after fighting for freedom and peace in the previous eras. As she pulled her blade from the ground and back into it's sheath, Frost knew that she would hate every second of Dante's deal. However, she could be able to live what she wanted from the start, between the bastard's plans for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost shook her head as she heard the Ox's leave their home, hearing her father call up with joy in his voice. \"Excellent, the groundwork is set with our clan's future. Tara, I am so proud of you for doing this for our clan, get some sleep. We need to prepared you in the education of marriage by the next year, so our friends can see your progress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scowled in anger before she got into her bed, furious on what she was forced into, but couldn't see many options that didn't lead her into danger for herself or for her own clan. Frost however sighed and turned her head on her pillow, hoping she could come up with something in the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"By the ancient ones, that sounds awful!\" Samantha exclaimed after Frost spent the better part of the evening telling her about the dinner and Dante. The lioness tried to keep herself contained and put down the hammer used to beat hot metal into shape on the anvil, rubbing her temples. \"That... bastard Dante trying to control you, I can't wrap my head around this hole you're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I wish I could've striked him down, but then war would've run it's course.\" Frost sighed as she leaned against the fencing around the forge, exhausted from the whole ordeal as well as her morning lessons. Her mother tried to teach her about being a proper wife, all of the little details about home care and how to act, in place of what would've been training with Aaron. The one good thing was that her mother seemed to support who she was, even offering some advice about how to be with other girls, much to Frost's delight. Her mother even offered to help nudge her father into accepting her, which would take time to whittle down his resistance to the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't do it, you could die and we get into a war. If you do and don't let Dante mate with you, the same happens. The only way this ends is with you miserable for the rest of you life with that pig!\" Samantha scowled as she tried to think of ways to get her best friend out of the situation she was in, but was failing. \"You can't do this Frost! You need to try and get your dad and Ares to back off... somehow! I won't let you suffer under him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost however shook her head, feeling almost defeated. \"It wouldn't work. My dad started the deal and thinks that this is the best for the whole tribe, he won't back out just because of me. Ares is just about as stubborn, even Dante couldn't sway his mind, he would listen less to me. No matter how I play it, I have to get married to Dante and make a child, or you and everyone are in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha kept scowling as they watched villagers go by on their tasks, right when the lioness got close to Frost and whispered. \"What if you run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis alarmed the young Ice Wolf as she made sure no one was nearby before she responded in a low tone. \"I can't leave! All I know is here, I wouldn't even know where to go beyond our hunting lands, let alone what dangers there are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if you had a map?\" Samantha answered back, her eyes serious as Frost tried to keep watch on passing people. \"My parent's have one hanging in our house, you could take it and flee to the east.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, listen to me.\" Samantha interupted as she grabbed Frost and held her close, staring into her eyes after she pecked Frost's cheek. \" You will be miserable with that pathetic excuse of an ox, the last thing I want is for you to be unhappy. If not running, you need to stand up to your father, make him change his mind so that you don't marry Dante. That way you can stay here... with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost immediately blushed as she always felt her heart beat faster with Samantha, yet swung her head around to see if anyone saw them, but was relieved when no one was nearby. \"I told you he won't listen! I've been after him for a while about it and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean you tell him the truth. About you, and who you really are.\" The lioness stated seriously, shocking Frost for a few moments before she continued. \"No more half truths, you stand proud about yourself and he will regret how he has been. At the least he will call off the deal if you won't lay with Dante.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Wolf choked past the shock and felt the nervousness she felt before with confronting Dante about who she was come back. \"I... I'm not sure I can do it... My dad holds to the old tradition, if he found out I'm gay, he might exile me! I can't leave you behind Sammy! No, the best choice is to continue hide it for now and find someway out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked a little disappointed, which almost broke Frost heart, until she sighed and hugged Frost. \"Alright, I'm sorry for pushing you into telling him and running. Just know that if he tries, I'll be right behind you, now get going or my father might come out and yell at us for slacking. I'll see you tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Frost grinned happily before she kissed Samantha on the lips, leaving the lioness a bit flustered as she headed out to train. She just wanted to avoid the confrontation and move through it quickly, even if it wasn't the right call. The lioness chuckled before she picked up her hammer and started to beat a white hot piece of metal into a blade.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frost had spent the last few days through her normal life routine, sparring with Aaron Whiteclaw, spending evenings playing in the forest and talking with Samantha about their feelings. She felt more comfortable being with her and tried to keep her mind off the idea that everything would change in a handful of years. Frost's mother had more of a chance to speak to her daughter and together grew a much closer bond, something Frost had wished in her past and was thankful it came. They had talked more about her feelings and Frost told Rebecca about Samantha which didn't seem to phase her. She wished the same was for her father, but he seemed like he was worse, watching her more and wanting to know where she went during the day instead of coming home immediately. Frost worried her cover was blown, yet she thought he was being protective as she was roped into an arranged marriage and he must've wanted to keep her from screwing up the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost rolled her eyes at her father, as she wasn't stupid enough to do something to get the Ox's attention, nearly a week from her father's deal with the Ox King. However, she did care for Samantha which they were more of a thing, yet they stayed quiet about it to the tribe. She had decided to meet her friend at the smith under the shade of night at the end of her friend's shift, hiding a pair of wild flowers she had picked for her behind her back. Frost had already come up with a cheesy line to present the gift as she walked quietly pass the homes of her village, knowing if she was caught sneaking out, her father would get angry. She made it to the smith and saw the lioness watching the forge fire burn before she turned to see the wolf with startled yet curious eyes and a whisper. \"Frost? What are you doing here this late? We can't be seen like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" Frost brazenly declared to her friend, which it caught her off guard, even more by the flowers that appeared in her hands. \"I wanted to get this for you when we were out today, wild flowers for my wild girl.\" Even though Frost tried to keep a straight face through her lame line, Samantha hugged and kissed Frost while surprised by this surprising side of the wolf, making Frost's heart and head soar with delight. They held each other before pulling back and smiling at each other, until they both heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost immediately flinched as she recognized the voice, spinning around to face her father who stood on the steps to the forge, too starled and terrified to speak as he watched them. Every single bad thought about how things would end if her father found out rushed into her head, stepping back instinctively from the possible threat her father possed. She prayed in her mind for help from the old gods, while simultaneously cursing her misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father's face looked completely confused, as if he couldn't understand what he was seeing in front of him, yet as soon as Samantha stood between Frost and him, he went off by sputtering incoherently. \"You're... you just... You DARE threaten our safety?! How can you do this to our tribe?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you?\" Samantha answered for Frost, despite the ice wolf's pulls on her shoulder, staring down Frost's father as if he was without authority. \"You sold your daughter away for peace, if anything, you are the one who messed up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's father narrowed his eyes before he back-handedly knocked the lioness away, ignoring her as she fell to the ground, instead grabbing his daughter by the back of her neck and pulled her away from the forge and her closest friend. \"By our gods, what have I done to deserve this...?\" He muttered to himself as he ignored his daughter frantically trying to remove the cold grip on her neck that made it hard to breath, flailing her legs as they went. They moved past the homes of the tribe, which saw their leader and her yet no one moved to stop him, some of the Warriors following behind him until her father spoke. \"Go to the blacksmith, keep him and his daughter under guard until I come to them. If they resist, make them submit.\" The Warriors simply nodded and left quickly the way they came, as if seeing a child dragged away was a daily occurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost realized where they heading, back to their home as it came in front of them, before her father picked her up effortlessly and tossed her through the entrance. The effort made the curtain come off with her, and alerted her mother at the pot in the fireplace what was happening, making her run over and untangling her daughter from the cloth. \"Tara?! What is going on, are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what's going on...\" Frost's father spoke coldly as he stood in front of the two on the floor, his finger pointed accusingly at his daughter with a face full of fury. \"She was kissing the blacksmith's daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you put your hands on her?!\" Rebecca hissed back at him, craddling Frost's head which got a cut from her head hitting their stone floor. \" Tidus, this is our daughter, not some orphan on the road, our daughter has the right to be with anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew about this?!!\" Frost's father howled as he grabbed Rebecca's shirt, yet she just stared him down when they locked eyes. \"The fate of our tribe rests on her, and you let her play around with other girls when she should be getting ready to marry to the Ox's?! My daughter will not lay with women, not when the fate of the tribe needs her child!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when Frost stood her ground, standing up before shouting right in her father's face. \"I don't want to marry him or have a child with him!\" She had gotten both of her parent's attention before she continued at her father. \"You never cared to listen to what I had to say, I never told you how I felt about girls because I knew you'd do this! I can lead the tribe just as much as you, as all of our ancestors have, but you can't accept that! Samantha is my life, I love her and nothing will change my mind! I know in my heart we can survive without the deal you maded to pawn me off like some thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus growled when Rebecca put her hands on her hips, watching her join her daughter's side after he let go of her shirt. \"How naive, you have no idea what you're talking about. I am the leader of this tribe, the decision falls to me, and me alone. The Ox Clan's military far exceeds our capabilities, the deal will save us, but only if you stop this nonesense! You will stay away from her or you will kill us all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop hiding behind her and lead the tribe to safety then.\" Rebecca got back into his face, her claws extended to strike yet she stayed back. \"You talk about leading us, but you're bending over to please the Ox Clan, even giving away your daughter to do so! What kind of man cowards behind a little girl to save his tribe?! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you?!\" Tidus narrowed his eyes at his wife, his eyes full of rage, before he struck her hard with a punch to her face. Both Rebecca and Frost were stunned at his actions, even when he knocked his wife down and continued to hit her on his knees that they didn't know how to respond. \"I have to make the hard choices to lead us from our doom! This is for the fate of our children decades in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt the walls of her home blur away as she watch her father attack her mother, every part of her body wanting to stop him yet equally feared for herself. She watched as her mother finally struck back, clawing her father's face and kicking him off her, wiping the blood from her face. Rebecca then grabbed a sword from the wall, the sword Tidus' grandfather used to finish the last war, swinging it at her husband's head like her old battleaxe. Yet it was not enough to Tidus as he kicked her in her gut, slipping the blade from her hand before he slammed her head into the edge of a metal shelf, shocking everyone in the room..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca gasped as she backed away, stunned by the extent Tidus went in their fight. She tried to move toward Frost before she collapsed to the ground with a deep cut in her head. Even Frost's father was shocked by what happened, quietly staring at his wife, as Frost ran to her side and tried to wake her. \"Help! Someone get a doctor!\" Frost cried out the door, holding her mother and trying to put pressure around the wound to keep it from bleeding. Tidus slowly went over to Frost and tried to pull her away, yet Frost simply picked up the blade and swung it at his head.\"You monster! You killed her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she could not hit him as Tidus knocked the blade away from him before he hit her so hard that she was knocked flat to the ground. \"That's enough out of you, this is all your fault! I have to get you to stop this behavior.\" The last thing Frost saw before she passed out was her mother laying face down on the ground with a small pool of blood formed at the edge of her head, while her father picked her up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frost slowly woke to the sound of locks shutting, her eyes adjusting to the dark of her cell, save the moonlight that beamed in from the window above her. Her head throbbed badly as she tried to sit up, knowing well that she had a nasty black eye from the swelling near her right eye. She looked around to get her bearings when she realized she was in a cell, then realized everything before she was knocked cold. \"Mom!\" She called out frantically, but the cell had no one else but her, a window and a metal door with a sliding metal slot on it at eye level. Frost then heard footsteps before the slot slid to the left and a pair of red eyes peered at her that seemed awfully familar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No yelling Frost, or you will get into more trouble.\" A strong deep voice spoke behind the door, yet Frost recognized the eyes and voice as Aaron Whiteclaw, her teacher. \"The rest here are not in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron! I'm so glad your here! What happened to my Mom!\" Frost moved to metal door, ecstatic that her mentor was outside. \"Please! Tell me she got to the doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause hung in the air as the eyes glanced away for a while before returning, Aaron talking softly as he did when he taught her. \"She's with a doctor, along your father now. It looked bad, but I trust the woman to pull through, she is not one to give up and neither should you. Try to be quiet though, everyone is on edge right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost slowly felt her legs give before she sat down at the door, taking a breath as she hoped her mother would be fine, yet she trusted her mentor's judgement and knew it was a matter of time. \"Why am I in a cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father put you here, said that you needed some time to change your behavior away from girls. Told us to keep you here until you cry uncle and stay under his control.\" Aaron answered distastefully, glancing away as if he was keeping watch. \"He also said not to feed you, something about 'an empty stomach changing your tune'. However, I snagged you something.\" Frost cupped her hands near the slot and felt something drop into them, realized he got her a cooked rabbit leg before she dug at it, feeling hungry as soon as she smelled it. \"I will not be apart of starving a child, especially my student and friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wipped her lips as she felt slightly better, yet her thoughts turned to the lioness in her heart, going back to her mentor. \"What about Sam? Is she OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost waited through another pause as Aaron seemed to be worried about eavesdroppers, yet her heart dropped when he finally faced her again. \"Things aren't good for her and her father, the blacksmith resisted the guards and they hurt him bad, maybe even Samantha and barricaded the door to their home. Your father seems like he wants to send a message to them, which could end badly.\" When he saw Frost start to tear up, he quickly put his white furred hand in to hold her hands. \"I'm truely sorry Frost, too many horrible things have happened tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost held her teacher's hands in comfort before she got up and wiped her tears away, ready to get to action. \"I need to save them, Aaron, I have to get out of here! Please let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....can't.\" Aaron looked down before he faced her again. \"I swore a duty to serve your father when I became leader of the Warriors, to defend the interests of our tribe and it's leader. He told me to guard this door, and keep an eye on you. I want to help you, but I cannot turn my back on the promise I made in his service, I just can't...\" When Frost turned away from the door holding her hands close together in prayer for Samantha and her mother, she heard the clunk of something else dropping from the slot in the door before facing it again. \"However, I WASN'T told to prevent you from escaping through the window, or to give you the key to unlock that gate keeping it close, allowing you to save your girlfriend. So I can keep my promise, and help my student do what she can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost grabbed the cold metal key from the ground and put her hand to the metal door with a small happy smile. \"Thank you Aaron, I may not see you again, but I will never forget this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get'em kiddo, I'll keep an eye on your mom and tell you when it's safe to come back. Just don't be surprised if I have to play the role of his servant in order to stay close to your mother. Keep you head down, get Samantha and her father and get to safety for a while.\" Aaron told her as she climbed up the wall and unlocked the gate, watching her climb through it while keep a straight face for the others patroling the cells, wishing her the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\nMinutes later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost snuck away from the prison with full stride to Samantha's home, she watched as warriors patrolled the village and moved around them until she got to the lioness' home. The front and back enterances were blocked with furniture and she could smell something weird the second she got to the side of the building, yet she couldn't remember where it was from. She slowly scaled the wall until she got to the roof and went to the hatch she used to sneak into the house to see Sam in the past, happy it was still unlocked after all this time. She quickly went down the ladder, down a flight of stairs before she got to the bottom, quickly talking as she entered the main room, spotting Samantha bent over the floor. \"Sam, grab your stuff and your Dad's, we need to go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samantha didn't move, Frost went to shake her out of it, and saw a sickening sight over Samantha's shoulder. Her father laid on the ground, each of his limbs were broken in the wrong direction, his nose bloodied yet he was still alive. \"They shoved us in here...\" Samantha spoke softly as she was still in shock, not moving from her dad. \"Dad tried to stop them... they... they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... hey...come here.\" Frost picked up Samantha and hugged her, shocked at how the guard treated the older lion, and wondered what would happen to her, Samantha and her own mother if they stayed. \"Sammy, I'm so sorry, but we need to get out of here. The Warriors are up to something outside, we can't stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave him!\" Samantha cried out, shoving Frost away and going back to her father's side. \"Frost, my dad is all I have left after my mom passed away, I can't lose him too! I just can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost grabbed the lioness' shoulder again, even after she tried to shrug her off. \"We can't lift him, he's at least 400 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" By order of Tidus Lynn, leader of the Ice Wolves, we commit your souls to the Ancients. May your end be quick and forgiveness eternal.\"</i> A voice called out as Frost glanced out a window to see several warriors with torches coming to the home, making her realize what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha! Grab your things now! They're going to burn the house with us inside!\" When Samantha didn't move, Frost shook her friend to snap her out of it, yet she clinged to her father as fire began to spread from the walls. \"Damn it, I won't let you die here, we have to go! Sam! Sam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost was completely stunned by her friend as the lioness turned to face her close friend, her face set like stone as they stared at each other. \"I can't leave my dad to die alone, not after my mom. It's what I want, more than anything, take the map and go far away from here.\" Samantha pulled out the map from her pocket, holding it to Frost with tears in her eyes the same as the ice wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I can't leave you like this...! I love you Sammy, I want... us to grow old together...\" Frost confessed before the map was shoved into her hands, being pushed away by the lioness she cared deeply for as flames danced around and between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, but my place is here, and yours is beyond these walls. You know I'm right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt every part of her wanted to grab the lioness and drag her away to save her, yet she found the willpower to put away the map in her pocket and slowly nod through the tears running down her face. \"Goodbye Sammy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Frosty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost didn't know how she got the strength to take the first step to turn away from one of the only people she cared for and the steps after to escape the fire. All she could feel was the hole in her heart that burned with a pain beyond what she had ever felt, and the drive to put that hurt into vengence on the one man who caused it to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frost flipped the hatch open and dropped from the roof before dashing away from Samantha's home and the guards watching it burn to the ground. She could heard noises from the house, but tried to keep moving as there was nothing she could do, even though she feel her heart emotionally killing itself for leaving her love behind. Her heart also burned with the fury to strike down her father, yet she held enough sense to understand rushing him with her claws would only have her killed, leaving her father's tale he spun to remain. She felt Aaron words ring in her ear on a loop as she stuck to the shadows towards her home.<i>\"Keep you head down... and get to safety for a while.\"</i> Frost had failed to save Sam and her father, but the least she could do was follow the guide of the last elder she trusted completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly she could, she got to the side of her home and climbed the stone wall she had under her window, careful to move past the ones that she had knocked loose on other climbs. Frost hung under her window before pulling herself up and glancing through it in case someone was inside, finding no one, she slowly opened the window she never locked and slipped in. Her first move was to go to the door and close it, although as she moved to pull the door in, she heard loud shouting downstairs from what she realized was her father. \"What do you mean she escaped?! How the hell did you lose sight of a nine year old locked in a 10 by 7 cell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sir, she climbed through the gate we use to deliver food, I don't know how but she must've unlocked it.\" Frost didn't recognize the voice but it sounded like he was one of the prision guards in charge with watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would've seen more if you and those bumbling fools weren't playing cards! Get everyone to find her now! Dismissed!!\" Frost creeped over to the stairs, listening in as her father flipped a heavy piece of furiture, fuming intensely. \"This day couldn't be worse. I find my daughter with a girl, I lose my temper and Rebecca decides to try and kill me for it, and now Tara is out there somewhere. Why couldn't she just behave, why did she have to make this so difficult?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is her way of expressing herself.\" Frost recognized the voice as Aaron, but didn't go down the stairs in case she was seen. \"You always said she had a strong spirit, does it surprise you she has her own opintions about you plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how she feels. We are on the edge of war, either she marries that old ox's son, or we have to fight. Their numbers will set our home on fire, unless we make nice. I'm doing this for the fate of all of our children, she will just have to understand when she is older. At least that lion and his daughter are no longer a problem, now I just need to get Tara to see things my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt a rage burn in herself as she moved away from the stairs and back into her bedroom. Her father blamed her for everything, took it out on her mother and on her friend. She needed to leave before she went down and made a huge mistake, going to her bed and finding all of her stuff laid out. Frost wondered why her sword and pack were already there as she thought her father took them, but chalked it up to Aaron, grabbing each as well as her bow and quiver. After slipping them around her shoulder, she headed towards the window to leave her childhood home, yet something was gnawing at her. If her mother was truly going to pass, she owed it to her to protect one of her most precious valuables from her father. Quickly darting across the hall towards her parent's bedroom, Frost went to the small chest above her mother's dresser, slowly taking out an ancient obsidian blade inscribed with runes. The blade, as her mother told her, belonged to her ancient ancestors when the Ice Wolves first were contacted by the Night Bloods. The blade was offered from the Elder of the Night Bloods at the time as a sign of peace, as well as food for the start of the village. <i>\" So much could have been different if they hadn't attacked us...\"</i> Frost thought quietly as she put the blade in her single strap satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave before she was confronted by her father, who stood in the doorway with the same blade her mother tried to use on him. \"Put down your things Tara, you are not leaving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. I am not your prisioner.\" Frost defiantly stated, pulling out her short sword and holding it for battle in both of her hands. \"Or would you try to kill me like you did my mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus growled and shook his head, his eyes burning with the anger he did little to hide. \"It was an accident. I made a mistake and she tried to kill me with this sword. Put down your blade, I don't want to hurt you but I will if you keep pointing that thing at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not after what you did to Samantha and her father! You set the guards to burn down their house with them in it! I loved her, and now she is dead because of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loved?\" Tidus scoffed at his daughter, slowly bringing the blade up as if he was also ready for a fight. \" You're too young to know what love is. What happened is best for all of us, that girl almost ruined the possibility of peace between our tribe and the Ox Clan. All you have to do in order to prevent war is marry Dante, have a few kids and everything goes fine. She was distracting you from your true purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost stared incredulously at her father, shocked by the manner he treated her and Sam, like they were just pawns in some kind of game of his. \" My true purpose? You killed my friend to marry me off for peace! You don't get it, I hate Dante, I don't care about your plan for peace or whatever game you're playing with the Ox King. I don't care about marrying and having kids because that's not who I am. All I wanted to do was spend my life with one person that I had feelings for, to support this tribe the way a true leader does, and now you robbed me of even that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being selfish, you can't let personal feelings decide what happens to this clan, to your people. You need to grow up and realize this phase will pass, and you will help your son to lead our tribe once I am gone. Stop pretending and be the woman you're suposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T BE SOMETHING I'M NOT!!\" Frost shouted before she started swinging at her father, even though he dodged every strike she sent at him enraged by how he could not see her for who she was and could only see the image he created of her. \"I KNOW WHO I AM, A PROUD MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE, AND THAT YOU KILLED OUR OWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus caught Frost's blade and put pressure on his daughter's attempt to attack him, taking a breath before he locked eyes with her. \"So be it, you've left me no choice. May the gods forgive me for harming you.\" Tidus then thrusted his hand into her face before the power of light blinded her, forcing her back before she blocked a kick that knocked her straight through the window lock....</span></div></div>",

Tidus stood strong with his blade in his left and in his right hand was a ball of pure light, which cut through the veil of night other than the home burning behind him. Her father was known for his light and heat based attacks, which was ironic since the \"Sun Warrior\" fathered a child that enjoyed the cold and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you want? For you to strike me down in rage?\" Tiidus asked of the young Ice Wolf that was once his daughter, yet pointed his blade at her like the foes of his past. \"So be it! I'll make you regret the day you dared threaten our tribe's future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost just growled as she charged the older wolf that was once her father, slicing at him and parrying his counter strikes like her mentor taught her. Her own powers had already kicked in, sending a terible snow storm throughout the town, almost forming a blanket of snow by the strong winds rolling through. As much as she had rage and adrenaline on her side, her father had decades of experience and several feet taller than her, so it was not long before she was knocked back hard to the ground not cut as he taunted her by whacking her with the side of his blade, but decently bruised. She however got up again and continued to strike as fast as she could continue to manage, yet was caught with a kick directly to her face after another blast of heated light in her face, making her struggle to see her father staring at her with unwanted pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you child, stay on the ground! You cannot hope to defeat me, just surrender, and you can lick you wounds in the cell until you pull yourself together.\" Tidus pointed his blade by her head, noticing a number of guards including Aaron run up and pull out their blades. Frost however had a different idea, as she sunk her blade through her father's left leg, yanking it out before she ran from his pained yells, ducking away from the guards who started to rush her. \"Aaahh! Someone shoot her! Whiteclaw! I order you to shoot Tara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron waited a few seconds before he addressed his general, giving Frost a few more seconds while also holding his men from firing their bows after her. \"Sir? That's your daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is no longer my daughter, now fire, that's an order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron frowned but slid his bow off of his shoulder, taking an arrow with his hand as he aimed and stretched his shot at the young Ice Wolf he trained, watching her enter the tree line as he tracked her. His different promises made his hand shake a little as he didn't want to hurt Frost but had to stay close to protect her mother. He gritted his teeth before he jerked his bow slightly upwards before firing, watching his shot soar through the tree line as well as a surge of the village's hunters and warriors going after her, following them as Tidus screamed for a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost heard a few of her father's howls as she ran by the trees in the forest, the soft crunch of the snow between her toes as she fled her home with her own members of the tribe chasing her. After an arrow nearly skinned her head after entering the tree line, Frost tried to keep her body low in order to avoid more attacks, feeling eyes on her as she kept going. She kicked up her powers until the storm made a blizzard form around them, making it hard to see her, yet the warriors were trained well for the cold tundra of their homeland. She had hide occationally in order to shake certain warriors, but the hunters were still on her trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after she got to a cliff that she realized she needed to double back, yet as she turned she heard a noise before her chest exploded with pain, seeing the feathers of the arrow that had just lodged itself into her chest. Frost felt her legs start to give as a hunter stepped from the trees, her vision rolling upwards to the sky as her body fell over the edge, too numb to move as she fell down the cliff...</span></div></div>",

Her chest burned with icy hot pain as her hand gripped the arrowhead that had dug through her chest, realizing that her chest was soaked red. \"That's my blood... that's a lot of my blood, gods...\" Frost struggled to examine her surroundings and saw that she was at the base of several large trees with branches broken all the way up from her spot to the base of the cliff in front of her. She looked around for the hunters as they were on her tail and one shot her, yet it seemed like no one followed up on her fall, assuming justly that she would've died from the arrow and the drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she moved to stand, her chest surged with enough pain to drop her back on the ground, clenching around the wound with a gasp. \"Gods... please make this bearable...\" Frost prayed as she gripped the shaft of the arrow in front of her, remembering her lessons with the town healers and knowing full well that she was going to hate it as she snapped the arrow's shaft. The jerk instantly made her yell in pain, but quickly bit down on the arrow piece that she snapped off from in her chest, knowing she had to stay quiet or be found. Tears ran down her cheeks as she gripped the arrowhead from behind her with luck and snapped it off after two attempts, trying her hardest to keep from scream out by breaking her knuckles on a tree to make it more bearable. The healers had told her that leaving in the arrow shaft would cause her pain, yet they also told her than an arrow in the chest has a high chance of infection if not treated the second it came out. She did not have the skill to sew up her wound and not any herbs or salves to keep infection away so she had to go with option B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost took a roll of bandage wrap and wrapped it around the wound without putting pressure directly on the wood, knowing her efforts would stop the arrow shaft from moving around and causing internal bleeding that she could not stop. It however did nothing for the pain ripping around the wound and throughout her right arm, making her wish she had anything to dull the bite, yet she stood and took her time walking from her landing zone. With her left hand she pulled out her map and followed away from her home and the owners of the piece of paper she was using, keeping a clear eye out for anyone. In her condition, she wouldn't last in any fight and she knew that at some point her legs would give, yet she damn was not stopping until she had to, not letting her father win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe traveled for a distance, enough that she made an inch on her map, having to turn off her powers in order to keep her strength during the journey. She nearly stumbled into the ground as she wandered past the forrest with the shade of darkness around her and towards what would've been a grassy plain, estatic when she saw a fire down the hill in the dark of night. Frost made her way to the fire, a step after the other until she finally collapsed at the edge, seeing figures start to surround her and pleaded through the fog in her vision. \"Please... I need a doctor...\" She could barely understand a word being said as she faded into unconsciousness, but could feel someone pick her up from the ground before she lost herself in the fight...</span></div></div>",

Frost felt warm yet she felt the cool of metal under her body and turned her head to find that she was in a cage for a small animal, shocking her out of the numbness of her nearly last dreams. Picking herself up off the ground, she sat up to figure out where she was and why she was trapped in a cage like prey, her chest burning in pain with each muscle used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost stared past the campfire to see into the camp she stumbled upon and was scared with her surroundings. She saw several more cages with a few full of others like her, finding two animals cooking a boar that seemed like her captors to her left. The two were dressed in the furs of animals, yet acted like they were crazed, hollering and laughing while drinking from large bottles. They seemed less likely to let her go and more likely to do other things, especially with the area next to the cages that was soaked in blood that looked like the butcher's shop back home. She turned back to the right and was shocked to see a pair of eyes staring right back at her, the eyes of a large winter lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion stared at her with unwavering focus, wiping his blade with a cloth that was stained red, immediately moving Frost away from his side of the bars. He had a scar across his left eye like someone had tried to blind him, and a weird metal thing hanging on his side. Frost's looks brought a toothy smile to the lion's face as he took the metal thing and pointed it at her, speaking to her in a language she had never heard before. When she didn't act the way the winter lion wanted, he pointed it in the air before his finger pulled a strand of metal and the sound of thunder erupted, making the ice wolf grab her ears. Never had Frost heard of an object that contained the power of lightning, the power this lion held alarmed her as her powers of cold seemed to do nothing to the large lion, as her own weapons were inferior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion let out a laugh while the two cooking the boar ran over and began to yell at him, pointing around the woods like they were meant to be silent and hidden, snatching the gun from his hand and tossing it into a bag piled up near their tents on the right of her cage. \"Wait a minute...\" Frost said as she moved to the right side of her cage and caught the sight of her bow and bag by the tent where a fourth was going through it. \"HEY! That's my stuff, get out of there!\" When the fourth didn't pay her any attention, she formed a ball of ice in her hand and tossed it at their head, not content with someone going through her cherished belongings. That didn't fly well with the fourth who stood up and went to the cage of hers with a machete, banging it against the metal and kicking the cage to scare her but leaned in and scowled at the ice wolf, her face illuminated in the fire as a purple leopard. The leopard seemed to speaking in what Frost assumed were death threats as she couldn't understand a word of their language but the motions of the blade in her hand were unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost bared her teeth to her captor, a mistake she face when the cage door was opened and the leopard's boot slammed her head into the bars of her cage, knocking her out immediately by the sheer force of strength, without even hearing the cage slam shut and lock...</span></div></div>",

The cages of the prey were loaded onto their salvaged cargo truck before being driven away by the only two not drunk or high to take the wheel. The winter lion and the purple leopard sat in the front while the two morons sat with the cages inside the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Status?\" The winter lion spoke into his old radio, watching the snow covered road while also watching the brooding teenager in the passenger seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're rocking back and forth here. Can you try not to hit every stone in the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion narrowed his eyes with annoyance as he purposely shook the truck, hearing groans through the radio. \"It's what you deserve for getting wasted on duty, now quit whining and keep watch on our stock.\" He eventually straightened out and continued on their trip, only to hear another insightful comment from the leopard beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were the best you could find? Those two morons spent more time getting sauced than keeping watch on the perimeter. It's no wonder that native girl stumbled in, when they were focused on their dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winter lion kept his eye on the road, but the edge in his voice was undeniable. \"The way I remember it, you were lighting up before their lips touched a bottle. We work with these two because it would be harder to do this by ourselves, as you remember.\" He watched the outline of a clearing appear at the horizon and made for it, yet also focused on the purple leopard girl he was in charge of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hurting anyone, and it helps me relax J'skar. You drink and I smoke, it's just a little to take the edge off.\" The purple leopard crossed her arms in defiance, staring out the window as they pulled up to the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar turned the engine off and watched as the two in the back started to move crates of their stuff and the stock out, turning to face the leopardess who was already out of the truck. \"Keep an eye on it or it will be an unhealthy habit. And watch over that blue girl, I think she might be the most valuable one of the bunch. You know the rules Ashley...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, pretty young girls who speak a different language are worth more in the right markets, without being too roughed up. Whatever, she tries to hit me with that ice again, I'll break her fingers. Rule or no rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar grimaced at the young girl's temper as he knew and told her it would be her downfall, yet she had to learn on her own like most of her life. He stepped out of the truck with the map and looked for a place to offload their cargo, pulling out his cell and flipping it open to dial a number, hearing the line connect before he spoke with warmth unlike him. \"Hello dear boy, I have some stock for sale... Yes better than the last ones... As a matter of fact I happen to have hold of an exotic... an, how you say, young tribe girl with white tatoos and an outfit to fit her form... The price?...

It didn't help that the two were at each other's throats since they set up the camp after she bite Ashley's fingers that went into the cage to drag her off the truck. The language barrier didn't help as several times the girl spoke in length in her language but Ashley had zero idea what it meant except for the ranting when the girl got pissed. Yet again the girl kicked over the bowl, getting Ashley to flip her off and walk away. \"Fine! Starve, but don't be asking for anything later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost however finally sighed as she had peace and quiet, pulling from her clothes a piece of metal ripped from the truck in order to try and break out, working on the lock while her purple captor smoked something from her pocket that smelled weird when the leopard exhaled. She knew that the group who had caught her were slavers, and knew that it wouldn't be long until they off loaded their stock by the number of others in her exact situation. Frost gripped her chest as another wave of pain came from it, gritting her teeth as her wound still hadn't healed and would most likely hurt for a while to come, yet she tried to focus despite the sounds of the other captured trying to convince their captors to be freed in their different languages with predictable results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice wolf was surprised that her wounds were tended to, after what she had seen from the captors, yet it seemed like they wanted her alive and not dead as she was close to after falling unconscious at their feet. She shifted her eyes to the winter lion and the two who enjoyed some kind of drink in the same bottle as before, watching them point at their map and her own from Samantha, wanted to break out and stop them for every crease they were causing. However her focus came back to her task as the snap of her metal tool signalled her lack of results, getting her to growl as she would have to spend another night in her cramped cage. Frost however perked up when she heard the butchering of her language to describe a town on her map, now understanding they were going to it when the lion used a word with it that she heard him say to a metal box before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her understanding was not hidden from the leopard who was still lighting up, who watched with interest as she had found the way to talk with the prey, but was too loaded to do it right. Ashley simply continued on her watch as the winter lion barked orders to the two nitwits to get them ready to head out to the meeting point in the morning</span></div></div>",

They had been playing a game all night, shuffling a deck and playing one card after another until one groaned out of disappointment. Gambling was discouraged back home for adults, but kids played a few staples while their parents were preoccupied. She knew that the truck was heading somewhere she could escape from, she just needed something to use in case she saw an opportunity. Frost had been eyeing a knife that one of the two had attached to his boot all morning, seeing the care put into it's blade that was not seen in anything else the two touched. She could work with a blade sturdy enough to pry the door open on her cage and sharp enough to damage any who followed after her. It was pure joy that the two were either too drugged by that drink they liked or too careless to put her cage right next to the one with that knife, which she quietly took and hid just as the truck began to slow down and make sounds like it did the last time that they stopped and pulled out the cages. Frost took breaths and tried to ignore the pain in her chest as it was finally time to act, ready as the rear door slid up and sunlight poured in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar squinted in the sunlight as he jumped out of the truck, seeing the remains of a tribe settlement in the distance through some trees. He pulled his gun out and loaded it as the truck was unpacked, making sure to scan the grassy area. Ashley joined him at his side, lighting yet another joint until her mentor grabbed it and stomped it into the dirt, glaring at her. \"I said take it easy, now get your gun ready. That customer is coming soon, but I don't trust that this deal will go smoothly without some persuasion. Follow the drill and make sure those two are clean too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that he was a repeat customer, he wouldn't be stupid enough to punk us if we are his source of slaves. Besides, he's not going to be able to cry cops with our lack of any decent life around here for miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar narrowed his eyes at the young girl that he took in and protected, putting his arm around her shoulder and pulling her in close. \"Never underestimate.\" He spoke as his yellow eyes stared into Ashleys, their eyes locked together like two pieces from the same puzzle. \"This guy is a means to an end and we are the same to him. All it takes is him to turn the Mobius Soldiers on us and we'll be locked in a hole of a prison or killed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, car coming from the south.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar and Ashley turned toward the car's direction and got their guns out and ready, prepared as the blip of a car slowly grew until it parked several feet from the two and their cages set up. The doors slowly opened until two tall mutts appeared and opened the rear doors for two others, one tall like the others and one shorter. The two in the front waited patiently as the tall and short mutts approached J'skar, the short dog dressed in an expensive suit with shades and a business hat grinning with his pointy fangs and stretched an hand out to the white tiger. \"J'skar, my good friend, bringing new meat are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ'skar slowly gripped his hand and squeezed it until the mutt was squirmed uncomfortably, his eyes watching the bodyguards every move before focusing on his customer. \"Do you have my money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please dear boy, we haven't even had a look at your selection yet. Rest assured we are prepared to pay, but only when we see something we like.\" The Customer walked toward the cages, looking as the two guarding them before looking through each one at their captive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n J'skar however raised his gun, causing both sides to raise their own weapons, aiming right at the Customer who just stood looking at the cages. \"That wasn't our deal. Proof of money first, then you got to see the stock. Where is my money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the trunk, you need to calm down before you cause trouble.\" The Customer waved away the tension and smiled as he found the ice wolf he was looking for. \"You said she was hurt, not that she has a hole in her chest. That is going to affect how much she costs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost wasn't sure about this situation as she sat in her cage, unable to understand their words but the looks the mutt gave her made her skin crawl. The white tiger and the mutt kept arguing between them as they gestured at her, clearly deciding what her life was worth. She readied the knife behind her as the two talked, waiting for the moment where she would run for her life. Frost looked at everyone and saw more metal objects that caused the thunder she heard before, scaring her that she couldn't hope to avoid those weapons that seemed worse than arrows from bows if they saw her escaping. She was snapped from her fear when the Customer rubbed his hand beside her cheek, immediately she opened her mouth and chopped his hand hard. It was reactionary, yet the Customer punched her hard in the face to get his hand free then back away after she fell backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH! She bit my bloody hand! If she infects me with some tribal disease I'll come for you J'skar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white tiger actually chuckled and smiled, showing his teeth to the mutt throw threats as he stood face to face, watching the Customer's rage simmer down to caution. \"You asked for the real deal, she's as fresh as can be caught. I'm not settling for less than a million, she will be a looker as she ages and she's covered with muscle to do hard work. Yes she is injured and she can't speak a damn word or understand one from us, but she is the best deal of your lifetime. Last chance, or we have her ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Customer was making up his mind, Frost took the time to crawl over to the lock and jam the knife into it while eyes were off her, yet didn't count on the watchful eye of Ashley who was scanning the horizon before she turned and pointed into the distance something that would alter their life's forever...</span></div></div>",

She felt the blade's sharp edge cut her finger as she tested it, swinging it the air to remember her ease and comfort with her old sword. It had been a decade since she was exiled from her home, and with the upcoming fight, she would come home a hero. Her father would have to acknowledge her role in their clan, and welcome her with open arms, which made her hands shake with the thought of it. She took a few breaths and calmed down until her hands were as steady and ready as a surgeon faced with the task ahead, putting away her sword to ease her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The Night-blood will die. Asher give me the strength to finish this once and for all.\"</i> She thought over and over, also praying to the old gods from the ancient times, not noticing the squirrel who stepped in until she put her hand on Frost's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frost, our newer recruit has completed the first test and in a few hours, he will face you in the second test.\" Princess Sally Acorn spoke, leader of the freedom Fighters and Frost's boss, seeing the tension over Frost's body. Her bodyguard barely spoke of her homeland, but the one thing Sally knew, is that the Night-Blood clan burned a rage deep into the ice wolf's core. \"\"Are you prepared to face him? I know there is a lot of bad tension between your tribes, but you cannot kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you have me do Sally? His tribe are backstabbing murderers, I will not let any of them live as long as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would ask you to restrain yourself.\" Sally answered back as her personal guard stood up and walked the length of her personal room, noticing the tribal cloth she wore, feeling that it held a status in her tribe as well as the white warpaint she wore all over her fur. \"And not condemn him because of the acts, which may or may not, have happened by his ancestors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice wolf however just stared at her leader and friend, her eyes narrowing accusingly as she put her hands on her hips. \"And what about his ties to the Anti-Freedom Fighters? I respect you Sally, but you have no idea what you are talking about! That Night-Blood is a danger to everyone here, and I will not let him hurt a single person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would be a valuable asset to our cause and he is offering a chance to redeem himself. I am not asking as a friend, but as your boss. He will not die or I will no longer need your services, I can't pass a resource like him without consideration, so if he wins fairly you will drop it. Do we understand each other?\" Sally stared into the eyes of her friend, who looked like she was hurting in her eyes from some past memory, crossing her arms and standing her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will keep him alive, but...just...barely.\" Frost growled as she stood up, the spark in her eye made Sally nervous, as she stormed out of the room. \"Whether he survives me is up to him...\" She knew Sally was close to confronting her about her issues, but she didn't care. Frost had one last hunt, with a prize greater than any animal she had took down. She would do anything to get back home, to be welcomed by her father and tribemates, the pain of homesickness was unbearable for her to deal with any longer.</span></div></div>",

While he was praying, two spirits came close to him as he was praying. One was a female nightblood and the other was a male nightblood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Male Spirit spoke first, \"My son, for the last time, will you slay the daughter of the clan who murdered your kin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightblood broke his prayer for the moment but did not look at the male spirit as he responded, \"I will not. She is not my enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Male Spirit then shouted, \"Of course she is your enemy! Her kind wanted us destroyed and wiped off the map. How long do you think she will remain your ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightblood answered back to the Spirit, \"Long enough to convince her that I am nothing like the rest of my kin, Father. I am not like the other Night-Bloods, you of all of the people should remember that or do you not remember when the moon turned red on the night of my birth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Male Spirit then retorted, \"Bah, you are no son of mine.\" After that, the male spirit was quiet as the female spirit came over to the Nightblood and placed her hand on his shoulder, smiling as she spoke kindly to him, \"Don't take his words to heart, my child. His honor drives him to hate the clan, but you...You understand that it wasn't your fight. But this Ice Wolf, she will not make this easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightblood responded to the spirit, \"I know she won't, Mother. But I will not make it easy for her either. I will not kill her, but I will prove that I am not like Father or the rest of my clan. She is driven by Honor, but she has been blinded by that honor. I must be the light to show her otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Female Spirit then added, \"I know you will do your best, my son.\" And with that, both spirits vanished and the Nightblood went back to praying, finishing off slightly more audible than before as he looked up, looking at the shut curtains that were in front of him while staying in his mediation: <i>\"Amonkira, Lord of Hunters, Grant that my hands be steady, my aim be true, and my feet swift. And should the worst come to pass, grant me forgiveness.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightblood was ready for this challenge and waited for someone to get him so it could begin...</span></div></div>",

The blizzard would mask her approach, and then she would strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not save her older brother or change what happened, but the least she could do was take down whatever Nightbloods dare poked their faces up. Frost had killed in her past, but not out of spite but survival under the harsh reality of the world, a small part of her wondered if she could actually deliver the killing blow. Yet all she needed to see was the image of her brother laying in the snow, stabbed in the back in cold blood by people who were once their friends, and she felt that hesitance melt away. Asher prided himself on a fair honorable fight, how they treated him so horribly boiled her blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she also was burning with the desire to know why, why there once friends would betray them, why it had to be her brother, and why this Night blood managed to survive.

Frost's anger was very apparent as the temperature started to get colder in the room before finally sprinting quickly towards the Night-Blood who has angered her, starting the beginning a very powerful clash of two swords. Each clash of their swords caused the very metal they were made out of chip slightly as this would become the toughest fight they would be in... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to clash and Frost slowly began to push Hypon towards the closest wall and with each step, her strikes became more aggressive, causing Hypon's defensive stance to alter towards blocking each strike. Hypon could tell that he was close towards the wall and then countered on of her strong slashes and disengaged, beginning to run towards the wall, causing the fight to turn into a chase. Frost followed after him and began to hurl more balls of ice and tiny shards towards him, that either were deflected by his sword, cut in half, or on occasion, hit the mark, but failed to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hypon made it to the wall with Frost behind him, he jumped just before running into the wall and used the wall as way to flip over Frost, using her anger and pride against her and cornering the wolf in her own corner. However, right as Frost saw Hypon use the wall as a springboard, she slashed towards him, even with him being out of her sword's reach, but  once Hypon landed in front of Frost, he then took his moment and dash towards Frost, going to make his point very clear towards the Ice Wolf by taking out her sword. When Frost prepared to block with her shortsword, Hypon could notice a weak spot in the metal because of the cold and the abuse from the duel; something he could exploit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon began to take the offensive and began to slash in the very place he assumed Frost would block his strikes and as he predicted, Frost wasn't noticing her sword's weakness that he did as she pushed Hypon back before doing a downward two-handed slash out of pure anger at her clan's most sworn enemy. Hypon then blocked with an prepared slash that would clash directly at her sword's weak spot. The result, however would shock both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost's sword shattered from the resulting slash, leaving only the metal just about the hilt left onto the grip remaining before Hypon then kicked the hilt out of Frost's hand, leaving her unarmed. She was stunned that her sword broke in her hand and then saw Hypon's katana end point pointed directly at her and heard her clan's most hated enemy ask her, \"Do you yield?\"</span></div></div>",

As Hypon waited for Frost to respond, he was surprised to see tears roll down her cheeks as she had shown only anger and rage to him, yet it was short lived as she wiped her cheeks quickly and faced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Frost growled and extended her claws as if she would still fight, until they saw a red light burning through her storm, that flashed repeatedly as if it was a message. Hypon saw the ice wolf glance between the light and Hypon, unable to choose but slowly let her claws return and move to be right in front of him. \"I... yield...\" She answered distastefully as if the words were shameful. \"You have me disarmed, destroying yet another piece of my life that I treasure. There is no reason for me to live when I failed my home and failed to strike you down, you might as well kill me here.\" When Hypon didn't move, Frost moved her head to the side, exposing the artery in her neck for his blade that could kill her with a single movement. \"My tribe killed your mother and father, my father led the attack personally, do it for them if that pleases you.\"</span></div></div>",

Everything I have done before this fight has been self-defense...I never meant to break your sword. It's time for you to open your eyes and see that I am not your enemy before your pride finally blinds you completely.

Think on that, Frost...before you lose more of yourself towards your own blind hatred...\" And with that, Hypon vanished from the snow-covered room and left the large training room, leaving Frost in the corner of the room alone in her own anger and slight confusion that he didn't end her life but took the one thing that she cared about...</span></div></div>",

He not only refused to kill her like she was raised to believe, he as seemed oddly distant to the issues their tribes held, like it was something he could just accept. She found the Nightblood strange for what was left of his kind and completely irritating beyond words, which did not help as he destroyed her sword and walked away with the hilt. Frost knew she had to find out what could possibly get this moral enemy of her clan to play peace, and to prove he was either a threat or Incompetent to remove his from the equation of Sally. That girl told her to drop it, yet nothing was stopping her from probing for info and checking credentials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Wolf sighed as she let the water clean away the paint and would greet her girlfriend at her job in Resources, knowing Patrica would either brighten her day or distract her from her thoughts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Hypon went through all of the forms with Espio to revoke his name from the Most Wanted list and confirm that he was now a Freedom Fighter. He was interested that they had a folder about an inch thick about his activities, yet he wasn't allowed to see it yet. After a long tour of the different sections of the base from the training hall to mission control, from the service wing to the science labs; He had a lot of ground to cover to stay on top of his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour ended as the two of them walked down the hall through the living quarters of his now team-mates, several not at home as the day had just began, until they reached his door. \"Alright, you'll sleep here. If you need anything, put in a requisition form and we'll get back to you. Welcome to the team.\" Espio shook his hand and left the wolf to ponder about his living situation and thoughts about how strange it was to work with the ones he used to fight. He then noticed the door open to his left, turning to meet his neighbor and finding the same Ice Wolf he fought a few hours ago right in front of him locking her door behind her. She was in was looked like gym clothes, a tight tee and shorts with sneakers that looked like she used perhaps everyday, almost looking rather cute with her long hair running down her shoulders. It seemed she recognized him too as when she saw him her eyes grew and her hands went to her empty side, bringing a frown as she took a step at him. \"Did you come to disgrace me again in front of my friends... what are you doing here Nightblood?

The rays made their way to the Freedom Fighter Base, blanketing the walls and piercing through window blinds to wake their occupants, without their permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light cover the carpet of one particular room that belonged to Frost Lynn, whom was woken when it covered her eyes, making her eyes twitch until she shielded them with a hand. \"Ughhhh...\" She grunted out as she pulled herself from her pillow, her head feeling heavy and stuffed with fuzz, rubbing her eyes as she tasted something weird in her mouth that was foreign to her. Frost was feeling particularly hung over, her mouth dry and her head hurt with the brighteness in the once dark room, her first thought was trying to pick up what had happened before she fell asleep. She thought for a bit before she felt the answer come immediately, making her blurt out her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That two-timing skank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost growled half-heartedly about the pain in her heart as she realized she was no longer with her girlfriend Patrica, once she had found a used rubber in the trash bin of their bathroom. She understandably went off at the lioness and threw all of her stuff out of the room, calling it off right there before slamming the door shut with a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a breath and tried to focus her mind as she realized that it was a few days ago but still tried to place what happened yesterday. Frost remembered drinking, a lot, and venting to her neighbor Hypon over the course of the days, until she hit a block. She tried to think after they left the base but her body needed cold water to wake up properly, so she sat up and got up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost realized however that her legs did not want to function, immediately feeling sore as she stood, making her wonder why they hurt until she glanced at her bed. Under the covers was someone curled up with the blanket covering them, immediately making Frost blush as she seemed to have brought a guest home. She didn't think it was Patrica, THAT she would've remembered blind-drunk as she was never the one for repairing broken trust, so who could it have been? She had obviously slept with them as she felt sore between her legs, her hips, her lips and her breasts, but for some reason she felt like her flower hurt more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"One step at a time...\"</i> Frost commented in her thoughts as she staggered to the bathroom, stepping over clothes placed around the bed, spying her pair of her underwear but left it alone as she opened the door and went inside. <i>\"I need a clear head to deal with that, and maybe it'll come back to me.\"</i> She went to the sink and turned on the cold water before splashed it on her face, feeling it waken her muscles and drip down onto her bare breasts. Frost shook her head as she felt herself relax and checked the extent of her soreness, tracing her hands around her body to find out what she had been through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost found her private flower had lost the one thing she had held after leaving her tribe, her virginity, making her alarmed and double checking to be sure but realized she had been taken for a rough ride. Her body stung a little with little love bites on her breasts and neck, but the barely brusies in her inner thighs made her stunned. When it came to her and her time, toys were never used, so either she let some girl use a strap on or... she picked up a guy, which made her brain hurt. She never felt the feelings the other girls had for males, and the idea of her going to a bar and getting loaded and picking up a guy was extremely unlikely. However, her getting loaded and picking up a woman to have revenge sex with to spite Patrica was more her speed, yet Frost didn't normally be submissive, so she assumed she was in a pretty bad state last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost glanced as her face in the mirror and saw her reflection glance back at her, a beautiful nude young wolf with no signs of rough-housing with no marks or bruises on her face, which meant whoever was in the bed was not too rough. She had a small feeling once she put together her examinations that it might've been her that was rough and the girl might've brought out a toy just to stay in it, making her sigh as she had a habit of over doing things when drunk. Frost glanced out at the bed from the bathroom as she wondered if she should at least make breakfast for them before she spotted something that would change her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person under the bed had poked their head out of the covers, and their face was that of her neighbor Hypon, the Nightblood. Immediately Frost's felt all of the alcohol she had drunk the day before rush up before she threw up in her toilet, not out of disgust, but from absolute terror. In her tribe, you could not have relations with another tribe that was declared war on, otherwise you'd be exiled or you would be disgraced from your home. She was already both, and the first thought that came to her mind was if he impregnated her, which if she was, it was a firm death sentence to be carried out by her father. As quickly as she could she tried to check for any signs that they had not used protection, looking through her own body and through the room as quietly as she could as not to wake up the Night blood. She had mixed feelings once she had realized that they had several used condoms on the floor, but they were the ones that her ex girlfriend Patrica's boyfriend had left in the drawer, on the one hand relieved, on the other hand disgusted that had to come to those. She slowly went back to the bathroom and brushed her teeth, doing several shots of mouthwash to get her panicked response out of her mouth, her legs almost giving out under her from the sheer shock of her discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Frost sat down at the edge of the bed, trying to wrap her head around what had happened. She was in completely new waters, she had never even considered relationship with a guy, physical or literal. Slowly she pieced together what it happened the night before when she and Hypon had left the base, remembering that they went to Emerald Beach where she had never been in order to make her feel better about what happened with her ex, saw the sunset that took her breath away before they headed back to the base. Frost remembered thinking about what she truly care for and wanted when they were making their way back, and found solace in the Night blood whom she had once hated and attempted to murder in cold blood months ago. She the remember the specific desire she had that jumpstarted their whole experience that night, that she wanted him to be repaid for taking care of her at her worst, and to take care of the burning desire she had gained for him throughout the night. Frost took another breath in before she decided to clean up a bit around her room before Hypon woke up, immediately feeling the need to cover her body so they wouldn't have any more experiences or see that her body had worked itself back into arousal by the memory of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Frost did not realized how the sunlight was piercing through the blinds gaps, now resting on the face of Hypon, stirring him awake just as Frost was slipping on her panties and her bra in front of him. Immediately he remembered the night that happened has he was in less of a state than Frost was, blushing at the memory and the sight of the young ice wolf bent over in the nude with her partially aroused flower in his sight, as he remembered how she had brought him back into room for their passionate embrace. Hypon wondered if he should alert Frost that he was awake, or let her be more comfortable before he told her as she moved towards the bathroom to most likely shower.</span></div></div>",

Hypon was mentally thinking about the night before as he rested in Frost's bed, remembering almost every single detail and thought from before the night ended with him falling asleep right next to his clan's mortal enemy as Frost continued to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon actually didn't think it would have gotten this far between Frost and himself last night, mainly wanting to help her move on away from the thoughts of her former partner leaving her for a different person. But when it moved on to the more romantic situations, Hypon did feel a slight amount of nervousness when it came to having sex with his neighbor and closest rival, but he didn't want to push Frost away as it might cause her to go back into her previous anger as he saw how dark Frost had fallen after hearing all the shouts between both Frost and Patrica along with the moments of Frost when she was in her drunken anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he heard Frost slowly walk towards the bathroom, he waited for the door to shut behind her before he waited to get up to sit up on the bed, dodging the last stare from Frost as she looked at the \"sleeping\" Nightblood before she shut the door behind her as she entered the bathroom. Hypon didn't know how to get a handle on current events as the previous months, Frost was trying to kill and get rid of him. But now, Hypon had just slept with that same person and felt somewhat confused, which really didn't happen much after sex for him. Hypon wouldn't have protected just anyone from his stares if their body was fully nude if he didn't fully respect them. Hypon figured that he would have to take these next days very cautiously, thinking that Frost was going to either ask him plenty of questions or feel strange towards him after the night they just had between them. Hypon then took a calm breath and slowly moved his feet into a meditating position, waiting for Frost's return as he shut his eyes and beginning his morning mediations.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea what to do next, what to even say to Hypon when he woke up, or what to say to her father. It reminded her of her first time seeing the world outside of her tribe, visiting that diseased raider village in order to get medicine, stuck with only her abilities and her will to move forward. She had done most of her life like that, but it was like she was swallowed up with feelings of fear and confusion, the beaten path dissolving in front of her. She couldn't even think of how her brother could've responded to all of her actions, remembering what a sweetheart he was, he might actually have approved once the shock wore off. He was big on not letting people overthink things, relying on instinct and not regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost tried to think about anything else, cleaning her body as flashes of the night before went in and out of her mind as she cleaned. She felt so strange, almost a different person entirely, as if she was watching someone else in the reins. She hated feeling weak and indecisive, it was not who she was, and she would be damned if she let herself drop into a void for doing what her heart wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Frost still had no plan for dealing with Hypon or her tribe. With a sigh, she washed her long hair to get out knots, trying to keep her feelings away enough so she could get in and deal with her situation. Frost made absolutely sure that she cleaned inside her, though she half expected it did nothing, it made her feel a little better. She turned off the water and dried off, staring softly at the door with mixed feelings, unsure how she should go about the whole ordeal. Frost however just took a breath before she wrapped the towel around her body and charged out of the bathroom like in combat. She only wished her legs didn't shake slightly as she stood in the room, seeing Hypon in his meditation pose. \"Hypon... we need to talk, about what happened last night...\" Frost as she immediately felt herself feel awkward as she was trying to keep the towel in place, despite knowing Hypon had seen her naked the entire night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Frost's attempt, Hypon opened one eye and saw not the warrior he fought, but the young woman trying to keep herself functional while dealing with the huge changes to both of their lives. He could tell she was almost as lost for words as he was to deal with the understated romantic and physical tension that instantly formed between the two of them.</span></div></div>",

The best I can say Hypon, is that I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hypon opened both his eyes, Frost glanced down reflectively as she was undoubtably having a crisis, keeping his focus on her as she continued. \"What we did... it's a crime and if my tribe finds out that we...did...it, they will come after me. If... we weren't safe while doing... our... stuff, and I get pregnant, my tribe will literally chop my head off. I know that I started this... but you need to know what I'm facing if my tribe ever find out, and what they would do to me, will be worse for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Wolf quietly let go of her towel as she let it rest at her hips, facing Hypon with her bare chest, but complete uncertainty as her eyes locked with his. \"I'm also confused to hell how I feel so different and how my body is starting to have the same feelings I have with my old partners, with you. This is something I'm not sure how to understand or go through, and... I'm a little uncomfortable about it.\" Frost tried to keep herself from showing how sore she was, or the fact her body seemed to like that soreness, to Hypon as she still wanted to be strong, despite her eyes did stray to see Hypon's full body a few times.</span></div></div>",

I usually don't make it a habit with having random sex with teammates, but I don't go looking for sex, it usually comes after me. But with you, it feels much different than the other encounters.

The last thing she wanted was to send messages to insult Hypon, or have him look at her body more, as she previously realized her outfit could be consider too exposed once joining the Acorn ranks. Frost slipped on a tee and a pair of short shorts, feeling a bit more comfortable as she waited for Hypon to come out, calm for the first time that morning even with feeling sore along her body.

Until the third day, no-one suspected anything more than a weird week. However, both got looks as they went on their business, as if they had a idea that something was going on. Eventually, Frost felt like she had to set the record straight with one of the only people she expected to understand her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the taxi she hired and went up to the door of the nightclub, knowing she was at work and their talk would be the most private it could be. When the bouncer tried to push her back as she stepped toward the entrance and not the line going down the block, Frost put the blade of her sword against his throat and put a gun directly in his friends face. \"I want to see your boss right now, you will not step in my way again or I will end you. I have no patience for your stupid procedures, put your boss on the radio.\" The bouncer's eyes bulged a little, before he slowly put a radio to his head and spoke into it with a very soft voice. \" Boss... there's a blue wolf lady that wants to see you, she has a sword on me and a gun on Dillon... says she wants to talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, all they heard was static until a sigh was heard and then a very sultry voice replaced it. \"Frost dear, that you? Please leave my bouncers alone, hiring new ones is a pain in the ass, and I should know. Come into my office and we will have your chat.\" Frost put away her gun and her sword before she walked briskly into the club, already forgetting about the bouncers as she wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible. She kept her eyes to herself as she made it to the back office and flipped it open, seeing a rather annoyed white bat pouring wine into two glasses. \" Who pissed you off this time girl?\" Rouge asked as she gave her a sour look as she zipped up her jumpsuit front zipper, like she was busy with a customer when Frost came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue I need to talk to you about a couple days ago, and some advice.\" Frost stared at Rouge, closing the door before she sat in the chair at the front of Rouge's desk, keeping herself focused on the bat and not the number of pictures in the room that would make her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threaten to kill my guards for some advise?\" Rouge raised an eyebrow, offering the wolf a glass but was surprised to see her reject it. \"This must be some serious business, why don't you start from the beginning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I've heard and lived every bad wake up story after binge drinking but yours made the list.\" Rouge commented as Frost wrapped up her story, keeping mental notes about the several different times where the blue wolf either blushed or averted her eyes during the juicy bits. \"So you thought since I work in the sex business, I would have all the answers about how you should be feeling right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" Frost answered back truthfully, although she didn't like how Rouge seemed to be gaming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge however smiled as she sipped the second glass of wine Frost refused, her first emptied with her lipstick stained on the rim. \"I think you and I are more in common than we thought, you see dear, I've had my own little experiences with Hypon. Back in GUN, we were rather close as partners, especially after I surprised him. You could say I was simular to you when your drink amplified your body's thoughts, although I went easier on the poor man. But we should be talking about you, and how you feeling about switching sides, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't understand why I feel this way. I've caught myself staring at him, watching him work, and I go red whenever he looks at me and he remembers that night. I act just like I did with Anna, except now I have to deal with the embarassment of a night where I hooked up with a guy I tried to kill several times, now everyday I see him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you this...\" Rouge started as she leaned forward and gave Frost the hard business look she gave only to serious matters. \"Do you want to kill him still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, I don't think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you care about him? More than some body craving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost thought hard about Rouge's question and slowly answered from her heart. \"...Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stick with him.\" Rouge leaned back in her chair, her eyes soft to Frost. \"As far as first times with a guy, Hypon's a decent one to lead on, embarrassing choices or not. If you want to experience more, he will allow you to try. I can't say if he will last a week or a year for you, but if I learned one thing running this business and my night job, when opportunity presents itself, you take it.\" She then downed her wine and wiped her face, standing up from her desk. \"Now get out of my club, without threatening anyone else on the way out please? I have to go bend back over for my guests I had to leave mid-sesson to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost cringed as she got up, remembering why she tried to leave Rouge before her complete openess about her profession made her uncomfortable.\" TMI, Rouge, TMI.\" Frost quickly walked to the door and turned to go down the hall before Rouge commented through a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think of it, you can stay for the show. I didn't say my clients were all guys, maybe we can see if you really did switch sides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Rouge!\" Frost exclaimed at the bat while her face turned crimson. She stormed out of the room in complete embarrassment, feeling her ears burn as Rouge shouted down the hall as she was trying to go confront Hypon at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time and place honey, and I might take you up on it for free!\" Rouge laughed again as she teased, but went the other way to see her guests, just toying with the Ice Wolf as it was just a jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would still charge full price.</span></div></div>",

Right now you need to get in her face and figure out what she needs, and then help her get where she needs to go to be floating again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon just listened to Knuckles and stepped away from the echidna, leaving the room with more to think about.</span></div></div>",

Just remember that you did ask for my assistance, Frost.\" Hypon then gently guided her into his bedroom, letting her sit down as he slowly took off his shirt before joining her and placing his lips against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for the action to start since Hypon had to catch up to where Frost was currently sitting on the pillar of desire, Frost teasing and rubbing against Hypon's chest before slowly getting out of her pink nightgown while getting him out of his shorts that were protecting the target that Frost required. Before even getting Frost in position for pleasure, Hypon reached over to his nightstand and put on some protection, knowing that Sally would kill him if he got her close friend and guard pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon and Frost then finally began the dance that Frost needed badly as the scent of her body began to spread throughout the bedroom, himself taking lead first before allowing her to take the reins when she got comfortable. Time could have stopped and Hypon and Frost still would not even care as they were focused on helping each other both to get to their respective peaks. After two long rounds of relieving Frost's sexual tension and ditching the used protection, they were fast asleep in each other's arms; Frost nuzzling against Hypon's chest as his arms held her close as if he was protecting her from whatever harm that may come her way as the clock read <b>4:25</b>.</span></div></div>",

She took her time opening her eyes as she was comfortable against Hypon, moving her head so the rays weren't hitting her too hard, but eventually she sighed and shifted onto her back. Her head hurt from her drink, but that was the only thing she was really hurting over, even though she could still feel what remained of their night on her body. Frost opened her eyes and tried to move towards Hypon's bathroom, leaning against her walls slightly as her balance was off and she could feel her soreness flare up between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get over the mornings if this is what I want...\" She grumbled as she gripped the door of the bathroom and got inside, going to the sink and splashing water on her face until she could cool off. Frost sighed again and this time drank enough water to help clean out her body in time, considering that she needed to get a clear head to speak to Hypon after she had basically begged him to take care of her... again. The drink helped her ignore all the reasons that were bothering her about being with Hypon, from their clans and years of belief that what he was were bad, yet she felt it in herself that she wanted to be with him. Frost slowly shifted from standing in the mirror to sitting on the toilet lid so her legs would stop shaking, thinking over what needed to be said and what should happen if she went with her heart or with her fears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side, if her father or clan ever saw them together or knew about their times in bed, they would consider killing him then punishing her in ways that scared her to her core. On the other, she felt like she needed him to balance her out, calm the rage that she had kept for so long, plus Hypon managed throughout everything to keep a level head and handle things even when it came to his rival needing him to clear a heat. On one hand, if they were ever have a child in the future, they would be shunned from her homeland and their child wouldn't be able to be a part of Hypon's community as it was gone save for him. On the other hand, she'd definitely enjoy trying with him ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost shook her head in surprise as she splashed more water in her face, cooling her off as she nearly dipped into thoughts that had kept her going towards Hypon for days, starting to get frustrated as she had felt this way before with a certain leopard of her past. It made thinking otherwise difficult, driving her to correct her itch with their care or it would bother her until she handled it herself several times. She took a few breaths as she considered how close her body and her heart felt toward Hypon, just like before except for the glaring difference between the two partners. Frost only hoped things didn't end the way they did before, taking a breath as she felt herself make the choice that seemed long overdue between them both. She did however have to address herself before she went out to Hypon, considering that the idea of more time together got her hot and bothered again. \"For crying out loud, it's like I'm a teenager again!\" Frost grumbled again as she quietly worked towards clearing away her urges, shivering as she considered the memories of her past times as a teen.</span></div></div>",

He sighed before getting up and sitting up in the bed, noticing that Frost was missing from his side but figured that she had gotten up before him, making his amount of worry diminish as he got up. Part of Hypon felt guilty in letting Frost get the better of him again as she was in no place to give him any sort of permission but the other half of him felt like he was protecting her from herself by allowing Frost to be near him so she wouldn't lose herself to the drinks. She was in danger and he would feel even worse than his neighbor hurt herself when he could have stopped it from happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon pushed that thought out of his mind as he moved away from the bed to find some \"better\" lounge clothes, picking out a tank top, boxers, and some gym shorts before going to the living area of the room, going to prepare breakfast for them and see if he still had any of his collection of hangover cure foods. Hypon was going to prepare a few things in case Frost preferred a more light breakfast, starting to work on eggs, toast, and some watermelon chunks that he had leftover from Vanilla's last visit. He hoped that this olive leaf that he was preparing to show Frost would help them finally have a chance to talk about the last few nights and give an opening to the conversation that they have been dancing around as he set the table, leaving out several jellies, jams, and a jar of honey for the toast he was making. He had his share of bad nights and hangovers so he was prepared to help himself or others, being a spotter when needed to help anyone suffering who wanted his opinion...Hypon may have been from a tribe of wolves but he was raised by a village who helped tamed his wild young emotions that came from raising a Night-Blood Pup. He wasn't the perfect person but he accepted his mistakes and he wanted to make sure that Frost didn't make anything stupid choices like he did in the past when it came to encounters with the bottle.</span></div></div>",

He did hear a small thud along with a word he wasn't familiar with, before some muttering that traveled from the bedroom to the kitchen. When he glanced back, he saw the fully nude Ice Wolf stand at the entrance with a small surprised look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... you really didn't need to go all out like this...\" Frost spoke with a hint of exhaustion, which seemed to be matched by the small shake of her legs as she went towards him. She seemed to stand by his side for a moment, watching him but kissed his cheek after a bit, turning as red as he did from the surprise of the action. \"I... um, I'll just sit down...\" Hypon didn't immediately catch the smell of arousal, but as she had pecked his cheek, it came in a low dose. He also didn't catch the way he started to look along her nude body when she turned to sit, but corrected himself as he knew how to control his own feelings. It did bring up moments from the past few days, but oddly of how Rouge was so comfortable in the nude around him to tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon however shifted his mind towards Frost once he found her rubbing her head. \"It's fine, eat up. It will help with your head.\" He watched her get a bit sheepish before going for the watermelon and toast that he placed down for her, as if she didn't think her side effects would be as apparent.

Eventually after the fog started to clear in her head and the Ice Wolf remembered that she was in Hypon's room and that if she was to step out into the morning, she would have to wear the pink nightgown without underwear she used to seduce him. Frost sighed and knew she wasn't a fan of parading out in that, so after she cleaned up after herself, she slowly stood up and went back into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking her head outside the door, she could tell that her Nightblood was not there, as well as smell with her sharp nose the breakfast he was making for them. Frost felt her stomach growl slightly as she had skipped dinner to protect herself from getting sick while drunk with Hypon, but felt that she needed to wear something at the table as she was his guest. Her options were limited, but she eventually settled for a t-shirt that was large on her enough to go past her waist and a pair of long pajama pants that she tightened around the waist to stay in place. Underwear wasn't a choice, but the basic modest was even if he could know her body by heart at this point. Frost felt another sigh exit her mouth as she still wasn't sure what she should do, but clearly it wasn't something that was going to stop and that she would have to have \"the talk\" with Hypon about all the nights and what they knew would end up coming at this point. After making sure she had what she wanted, she went to go and face Hypon after another night of too much drinking and sex pushed on him, immediately feeling her cheeks get red in memory of the night before despite her attempts to shake it off.</span></div></div>",

She sat down with him but closed the gap between them, resting against his shoulder. \"I am myself, it's to calm my nerves Hypon.

I'm not pregnant and as far as a few others, no one else knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a lot more than I was expecting and I won't lie and say I'm not hurt you didn't come straight to me about this.\" Sally replied after a breath, hugging Frost for a moment before she stepped away to her desk again. \"I told him to try and help you when Patricia was thrown out of your room, but wow. I can't imagine what you are thinking and going through with that on your mind. So all those nights this week you both were...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost immediately blushed deeply and shook her head. \"No! I mean, we sleep in the same bed, but no. Definitely not. We just... talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sleep together and talk? That sounds drastically different than before.

Sometimes in Hypon's mediations, he would appear in the Spirit Realm of his Ancestors or as they were known as \"The Ancients\" where all of his clan's past leaders and warriors gathered and lived in peace after death. A Night-Blood Clan Member is one of the few who can do this in their tribe as they were the living vessels to the Ancients chosen by them to protect the clan. Hypon felt a disruption during one of the past nights and finally decided to investigate the matter personally rather than it coming to him in the form of his mother or father. Hypon was sitting on his mat, surrounded by six candles, and began to meditate as a way to find the path in his mind that connected to the Realm of the Ancients, clearing himself of all personal thoughts that would cloud his path before finally saying to himself as he reached the doorway to his mind, knowing that it had to be opened by the phrase; \"The red moon shall guide the night-blood's path.\" And with that, he entered into the land of the Ancients...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon appeared in a small room, almost comparable to the one he was currently residing in at the base except that there was a grander view of the village circle than a wall and a nearby trash bin that he was used to see every day. He then heard a small knock at the front of the building, getting up quickly to see who it was and instantly remembering the face of his mother, Tahirah, and quickly hugged her as he had wanted to do for a long time before saying, \"Hello mother...\" Tahirah smiled at her son's greeting before answering back, \"It is good to see you, my son. But we should not keep the Ancients waiting for your arrival.\" Hypon instantly let his mother go from his grip and simply asked, \"What do they to tell me; surely you must know something about it...\" Tahirah was silent before walking down the hill that the house was nestled upon, answering as they walked down, \"You know I can't tell you everything, Hyperion. I would just prepare yourself for what is to come.\" Hypon sighed as his mother called him by the full part of his name, having to get used to it as he was back in the Realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of wolves walked across a path on the outskirt of the main part of the village, not talking much as Tahirah already knew how her son has been doing but admired how Hypon would continue to look around and look at some of the clan members who either came before him or only saw him when he was a pup. He always wanted to know more about the clan but knew that he was going to have to see what the Ancients wanted him to hear as they entered the center of the village square that was busy as usual while children ran, mothers shopped, and a collection of the older members were either selling their wares, enjoying the weather, or watching the young ones and making sure they weren't getting themselves in trouble. They arrived a large grand building made of stone that Hypon knew as the Assembly of the Ancients, taking a small breath as him and his mother stood at the door before she spoke, \"This is as far as I can lead you, my son. I shall see you inside,\" quickly hugging him before entering the Assembly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon waited a few seconds before following after his mother inside as he walked down the hallway, knowing exactly where to go. He walked straight down the stone halls before going down a set of stairs and entering the Grand Hall where a thousand ancients were waiting for him to arrive, five of them in very high spots near the center where he was to sit. The five members were the fallen clan leaders of the tribe, instantly recognizing his father's glare of disapproval while also seeing a collection of faces he knew from past visions and encounters in the Realm before taking his spot in the circle in front of the five. \"Greetings, Nightblood. I am sorry that we did not summon you earlier.\" This was the leader that came before Hypon's father speaking to him, knowing him well as The Dawnwatcher, the ancient that lead the clan to peace with the other wolf tribes. Dawnwatcher continued, \"We wanted to hear what you have to say about your actions with the...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawnwatcher was then interrupted by Hypon's Father, taking the title of Nightfang, \"Why do you take pity upon our enemy...the one who almost wiped out our kind!\" This caused a murmur to occur between the crowd before a third voice spoke, an ancient under the name Moonkeeper, who was the female clan leader that sat with the five, \"Nightfang, bite your tongue. We had already told you before that we will remove you from this if you can not keep your emotions in check. We know that your wife is present here and would love to drag you out of the Assembly.\" Nightfang grumbled, keeping an eye on his son as Moonkeeper continued, \"Nightblood, it has come to the assembly's attention that you have been comforting a rival clan chieftain's daughter. Would you care to respond to your actions?\" The other members out of the five were the twin leaders of the clan, Eclipse, and Solar, knowing Hypon's mission very well as he had brought this up to them before and hearing their thoughts upon it, Eclipse thinking that it was a crazy idea would never work while Solar thought that it could be a possible outcome if all the stars would align in his favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then responded, \"Ancients, as most of you already know; I finally want to make peace with the ones who almost wiped us out years back. Violence will solve nothing as it's one of me versus the entire clan of Ice Wolves. The anger that I know most of the clan members feel towards them for what they did is extreme, but I do not share their full venom towards them as they are not my enemy even though they should be. Killing any of them will not bring any of the fallen back and she needed my help after all the pain she has gone through.\" Solar then chimed in, \"Would you say that you might love her?\" This made Nightfang's eyes glare harder towards Hypon, letting his hatred show towards his son's choices as Hypon spoke, \"Honestly, I do not know. My heart and my mind aren't on the same page. All I can say is that she is an injured bird I am trying to nurse back to health...it's up to the bird to decide if it would like to stay or fly off into the sunset.\" This seemed to calm everyone in the room's thoughts about the one who would have been their next leader as Dawnbringer rose and spoke, \"Then I see no reason for this trial to continue as I move to dismiss.\" Nightfang then barked, \"I would like to say otherwise, Dawnbringer. The Nightblood's judgment is clouded and needs to be punished.\" This made Moonkeeper chime in, who was in the center between Dawnbringer and Nightfang, \"You would send your own through the trials just because he cares about one person out of entire rival clan? If so, then you are as much a fool as the ones who slaughtered us. I second Dawnbringer's decision to dismiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Eclipse and Solar's decision's as Hypon looked directly towards them, finally hearing Eclipse speak his mind, \"I do believe the Night Blood's reasons are just but believe that he should need to partake of some sort of punishment as we would have done to anyone who was caught sleeping with a rival chieftain's daughter. I second Nightfang's decision for punishment.\" Hypon then focused towards Solar, the youngest member out of the five, who finally spoke up, \"Dawnbringer was one of the few members of the clan who saw that our enemies could become our allies. Why is this no different?\" Nightfang spoke to answer Solar, \"Because this is the clan that wiped us out; I don't think that any of our other brother or sister clans thought about doing that before, Solar\" Solar wasn't scared of Nightfang's intimidation tactics as he shot back, \"Then you forget that at one point that all of the clans were at each other's throats beforehand, Nightfang. We had to compromise. I believe that the Nightblood knows what he is trying to do and see no reason why he should be punished because of your own hatred towards them.\" Nightfang was about to jump over Dawnbringer and Moonkeeper just to strangle Solar with his claws if Moonkeeper didn't force him back into his chair as Solar finished, \"I also agree with the decision to dismiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter keeping Nightfang away from getting to Solar, Moonkeeper then spoke, \"Then it is settled. Nightblood, you are free to leave whenever you feel ready. Tread carefully among the moonlight...\"  Hypon nodded towards the Ancients and got up to exit as most of the people who were watching began to leave the chamber, quickly spotting his mother and catching to her, not allowing his father to shout at him because of the Ancient's decision that didn't fall in his favor. Tahirah and Hypon made their way back towards the small home where Hypon appeared from, having one last hug before departing ways and closing the door as he prepared to make the jump back to the world of the living, holding back a few tears as he hardly got to be that close to his mother as he set himself up for the jump back, humming a small tune that he remembered from a lullaby she used to sing before finally waking up in the room where the candles were unlit and the room was covered in darkness as he got up to prepare for his early afternoon training session, not wanting to be late...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why is this so difficult?\" Frost took a breath as she paced back and forth, feeling nervous about her talk, so she took one of the only rooms on base that was quiet and no one ever went in when it was in use, the VR room. It was designed to show whatever you wanted, as long as the gear was equipped, so it seemed like the best version of a dry run she could have not considering everything that made her hesitate or uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been through so much when she was younger, much to her shock once she experienced the lives of normal children in Mobius, where she was groomed to be her father's weapon. Every day she worked to bring pride to her family, her tribe and not once did she consider leaving before her best friend Samantha brought it up. Frost held to that loyalty as a lifeboat, to the old traditions and the old gods that she worshiped, yet it wasn't the first time the waves rocked her boat and almost plunged her into the deep sea. The murder of Samantha of her father shocked her to her core in that her father was willing to kill to one of their own in order to keep control of her. After he sent their version of assassins to track and kill her, despite that she was no longer one of the tribe, exiling her from her homeland under the threat of death. Frost had almost removed the pains of her home, right before Hypon came into her life and splashed them in her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first believed that it was loyalty that turned her to strike down Hypon, as he was the enemy whose tribe had killed her brother and somewhere in her mind she believed her father would welcome her back as result. Yet she felt that all the helplessness from her past, all the things that had happened that she had to wear had turned into rage, putting Hypon's death as the best way to fix her problems. Frost knew nothing would change the distance between her and her father, yet she held that hope despite everything. Even holding to the idea of being with Hypon as a stab in the back of her tribe, as if it wasn't like her or that they even care about her after a decade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heartbreak of the past nearly consumed her, losing friends and lovers in what felt like the blink of her eyes. Samantha was kill for their affection, Ashley was in a high security hole for life after Frost turned her in, Anna had left her after she couldn't hold onto the world any longer and Patricia had cheated on her with a guy. She was scared of the if's, like if Hypon refuses her after she gave herself to him or if he catches up to her tribe and dies because of her. Yet her feelings in her heart for him, beyond the still lingering arousal of wanting him to repeat the first night, outweighed enough that she didn't call off the whole talk entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost looked towards the VR Hypon who was standing across from her, inside his room where she expected him to be once they talk, trying to come up with the words that showed that she was willing to go for the long run if he would have her. There would be no lies since he was one of the only people she told everything, no more one night stands since she wanted to be with him without clinging to alcohol to ease her through it. She wanted the whole experience of being in a relationship with him, the fights and the roses. Frost wanted to find the way to say that she loved him the only way she knew, but needed to work through getting the words out of her mouth than stuck in her mind and heart. She unplugged herself and went to the door, taking a breath as she knew the real thing would be much more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about an hour and a half of training at the gym area of the base, Hypon was heading back to his room. He had been practicing his reaction skills most of the time he was there as he wanted to test his speed. After the simulations bored him, he went a different direction and went to the sparring circles to test his speed against some of the recruits he recognized from Blaze's class. He enjoyed sparring against actual people rather than simulations as it added a different element of randomness. Other than sparring and fighting against the simulation, Hypon was a spotter for those who lifted weights and striking up a conversation with the people he had run across in either class, training sessions or any odd encounters that occurred around the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon took the long way back to his room, wanting to relax his senses as they were usually heightened when he was in combat of any type. However, once he turned the corner to his hallway, Hypon quickly noticed that his door was slightly cracked open. Leaving his door open and unlocked was something that Hypon did in his day-to-day as he was very protective about his stuff and information that he had inside that room. So Hypon seeing his door messed with sent a couple of red flags as he slowly made his way towards his door in a very thin, breathable clothes, making as little to no sound as he made his approach. Hypon had his share of enemies, but everyone knew that breaking into someone else's room was against several rules and could lead to being fined or kicked out, depending on the severity of the break-in and if anything was stolen. Hypon then took a moment to listen inside the room, wanting to see if anyone was still inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't hear anything that shouted that someone was still inside, but he kept his senses sharp as he began to enter the room and slowly close the door behind him, shutting it gently as to make it seem like someone was closing it from the outside. Hypon then slowly went down towards the ground as he left the starting hallway of the room before peeking into the kitchen area and living room and spotting no one or anything directly out of place. He then slowly relaxed by taking a few breathes and stood up before going to check by his desk area that was in the living room, seeing the same result as before as everything was still there. Hypon then looked across towards his bedroom door and seeing it cracked like he left it and thought that he may be just imagining everything and panicking over something minuscule like a cracked front door. He then sighed before he went to his bedroom, wanting to take a quick shower to get the sweat off his body. As he made it to the bedroom door, he quickly noticed that his neighbor Frost was relaxing in one of the chairs he had in there and quickly flinched as they made eye contact with each other. Hypon wanted to be mad at her for breaking into his room, but simply spoke calmly and looked at her curiously, \"Frost, well this is a surprise.\" When he knew she was coming or saw her coming, he was already mentally prepared for anything but in this case where she just suddenly had shown up; he was completely thrown off guard. He then added, \"Well, since you've made yourself at home; we should move on to my first question. Was the door unlocked or locked when you came in?\" He just wanted to make sure that he wasn't crazy about leaving open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost was quiet for a moment before finally answering...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hypon was training in the center of the gym area, bench pressing one hundred fifty pounds as Knuckles was being his spotter. However, Hypon could easily see that Knuckles was eyeing a nearby female who was also benched pressing nearby as he would forget that he was supposed to watch him. Hypon glanced towards the direction of where Knuckles was glancing at to see that the echidna was staring at a brown spotted saber-tooth, benching seventy-five pounds and instantly recognizing her from Blaze's training class as Roxanne before saying to Knuckles in mid-press, \"I know what you are thinking, Knuckles... I would advise against it.\" Hypon then finished his rep and placed the weight onto the rest before getting up and stretching his arms. He instantly heard Knuckles reply back, \"Oh, come on. Don't you think I have a shot at her?\" Hypon sighed before firing back, \"I didn't say that. I'm just saying that if you mess up; she is going to eat you alive. She is one of Blaze's proteges and a very strong fighter, but I can sense that you may not be in her league.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles took that as a challenge and began to make his way over to Roxanne before quickly turning around after noticing who was spotting the saber-tooth; their teacher, Blaze the Cat. Knuckles then hung around the sidelines, waiting for his opportunity to talk with her. This left Hypon by himself, who was stretching his arms and legs before getting up to wipe the sweat from his face and arms before hearing the pitter-patter of feet and hops of a very particular rabbit. \"Mr. Hypon, Mr. Hypon\" the voice echoed throughout the gym as Cream made her way over to him, jumping into his lap and almost causing him to fall back before smiling and hugging him. Hypon would watch Cream when he was on his days off, but since she was a Freedom Fighter-in-Training; she would usually run important messages for Sally. Hypon just smiled before picking up the rabbit in his arms and holding her close before speaking, \"Hello, little Cream. I thought I had you next week, not this week.\" Cream giggled slightly as she was in the arms of one of her sitters before responding, \"Oh, you do, Mr. Hypon. I just have a message for you from Sally. She wants to see you in her office for something.\" Hypon didn't know how to react to the idea of having a sudden meeting, but just smiled before answering back; \"Alright, Cream. Thank you for telling me about it. I better go and get ready. But first, let's make sure you don't hurt yourself on the way out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon then carried Cream on his shoulders as they made their way out of the gym area, catching the eyes of a few people as there was an age limit of being in the gym and they knew that Cream was way under the minimum. After they exited the gym, Hypon put Cream on to the ground and gave her a quick hug and kiss on the forehead as he usually did as he treated her like the little sister he never had, hearing a giggle out of Cream before saying, \"Now, I sure you have other messages to hand out, Cream, and I don't want to get you in trouble.\" Cream just smiled before hopping away down the hallway, leaving Hypon alone to his thoughts before walking towards the locker rooms to wash up and get dressed for his meeting with Sally, unsure what it could be about, but had an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>30 minutes later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was sitting in the lobby outside Sally's office, waiting for her to come and get him after telling the secretary that he had arrived. He just tried to remain relaxed as he waited for her to come out and greet him, hoping that it wasn't going to be a long one or a harsh one as it was the weekend and knew that Sally hated to do long and droning lectures on a Friday afternoon... </span></div></div>",

She simply gestured him in with a finger, her expression firm as he came in and sat in the chair opposite to her desk, making sure the door closed and locked before she sat at her desk with a small sigh. \"What seems to be on your mind Sally?\" Hypon asked politely as it seemed like Sally wanted to address something big, his first thought went to losing other fighters, but it turned out his second thought was the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've been fucking Tara.\" Sally answered bluntly, her expression unwavering like she spoke not as a friend but as a boss, who was given shocking news far too late. When he moved to speak, she put a hand up and stared him down like she was going to slap him for trying to interrupt. \"Honestly Hypon, when I asked you to take care of Frost so she didn't hurt herself, I was thinking of something different than for this to happen. I could say plucking her flower when she's in distress was a dick move, but frankly we are well passed that. We've talked today in fact, where she laid everything out to me instead of right after it happened, which I'm still trying to understand how she didn't come in or you.\" She did however soften up a bit as she leaned back in her chair, her eyes giving away more than her mouth could say. \"Tara is going to talk to you today about this, I strongly recommend you think about what you are going to say. But before you go, you should understand that I've seen this when we were younger, where she acted the same way with the doe eyes and the urges and it ended in ways that hurt Tara more than anything. That tough girl act she puts on only works for so long before she cracks, sometimes like it did for Patricia, other times in ways like I hope will never happen again. Go think about what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hypon stood up to leave, Sally remembered another thing, calling out to him as he held the door in his hand. \"Another thing, she has a high libido in the 'honeymoon phase', so... figure it out. I'm here if you need advise, but don't even think about getting careless or letting her get pregnant. She'll get moments where she'll tempt you, don't fuck it up. Get Out.\"</span></div></div>",

I choose her safety over you needing to know. Frost is a big girl; she is very capable of making her own decisions without needing your blessing especially when it comes to matters of the heart and if that makes me the bad guy in your eyes; I could honestly care less as I'm doing the job that was given to me my way and if had the same amount of trust you give Frost as you did me; we wouldn't be having this conversation.\" He could see Sally getting angry at him for his words before continuing, \"Sally, I respect as a leader but you don't need to repeat yourself when it comes to me.\" He then approached the door and then stepped outside of it before getting the last line, \"I care about Frost. She may have been my rival before but you can't even fathom how much I care about her after seeing a warrior of her caliber be at her lowest. I'm glad you care as much, Sal, but questioning my decisions only burns our bridge we have.\" After that, he shut the door leaving Sally in her office alone while he made his way to his room to prepare for Frost's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon did not care if he poked Sally directly with his words this time; he was told to protect Frost and that's what he was going to do.

His eyes scanned the area around the base, watching people leaving their jobs for dinner or replacing those who would be leaving for the night shifts, seeing their movements contrast with the darkening sky along with hearing bits of chatter between them. The Ice wolf was late to her own meeting with him, which he could understand given the weight of Sally's comments and his perceptions on what could be running through her mind, yet the small nip of a cold night's air to come was starting to hang on his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement from behind him stirred him to attention, along with the small metal pings of boot steps coming up the stairway, letting him a moment to breath before he heard the safety door squeak open with a small whine and the smell of the Ice Wolf to be available to his nose. He let Frost move to his side by the roof edge at her own pace, smelling a perfume in addition to the smell of her body, his eyes turning to see her staring out at the base. She looked uncomfortable with what was on her mind, like she was trying to fit herself into a mindset she had not worn for a while, yet she was there with him in the dusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost was the first to break the silence after a few moments of calm, keeping her eyes away from Hypon, yet her voice was directed at him. \"I heard about Sally's talk to you, sorry about that. She... she just worries about the past, she's seen me take to a few others before and they... didn't exactly go the way anyone wanted.\" The ice wolf crossed her arms as she glanced over to Hypon, looking like she was juggling memories in her mind and tried to lead up with the reason of their meeting in an awkward start. \"So... we had sex... which I forced on you, sorry about that, then we haven't talked about... those things better since so... I want to try and clear the air and be honest about how we both are on this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want that as well, but you still seem to be hiding how you feel. Like you're ashamed of it.\" Hypon answered her, picking right back up when she looked at him in surprise and quizzically. \"The perfume Frost, you are wearing it to try and cover for your body, which we both know since you showed me that it has not gone away.\" He saw her face with a blush deep enough that the fading light couldn't hide, her eyes darting to the side. \"You said it yourself, so if we are going to talk about this, we BOTH need to address everything without misdirection or dishonesty. I understand this isn't an easy topic, but I think this is well overdue at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Wolf by Hypon's side took a moment to get her head straight by his request, before she turned to face him without any filters in place. \"I think... I have feelings for you, beyond the obvious physical ones we both already know about and can smell for confirmation. Hypon... you are more than anything I was taught about the Nightbloods, you've handled hell that was made by my clan, the AFF and by me. You've done more than my ex's to keep me from going beyond my worst moments, and even though there is a lot of things I'm trying to get used to about liking you and the... guy part... of the equation, aside from the fact that we'll both will be brutally killed if my tribe ever finds out about us, I want to try and give this between us a chance.\" Frost moved closely to Hypon, holding his hands as moonlight slowly started to light the night sky while allowing herself to be open and honest about what she felt. \"I think you do too, so... what do you say if we just... give it shot? There will be a lot of work between us and adjusting to each other and our friends with their questions, along with -ahem- some addressing to be had for each others needs if that helps...\"</span></div></div>",

Considering that Frost had been in a state of arousal for a repeat performance since the night she got very drunk and took the reins, the Ice Wolf accepted the offer Hypon had put forward for her once he found out about it, on the condition that they take it after a date and that she wanted to be ready for it. So they decided to head out and take the night for just them once they were comfortable, a little wine and romance to set the mood, while they quietly talked about being careful for her first real event outside her comfort zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was Hypon that was a little bit impressed with Frost's resolve for keeping her body together as long as she did considering how aroused she seemed to be just by resting against him at night for the week. He had a feeling when Sally talked to him about her needs in the beginning, that this was a start of it, but mostly it allowed him to have a bit of fun with her as she seemed to enjoy the playings that normally turned his face red when Rouge did it to him. It was only fair that she finally got to cool off, despite the adorable blush she would have if he messed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Hypon learned more about Frost's sex life than he explained what they will do when it happens, which opened a view into her he had not considered in detail. First most, she wasn't exactly the type to be 'helpless' during, which matched with his previous unrestrained version that practically did most of the work that night. Secondly, she wasn't an idiot about what to do, but she did have questions about how things would feel that made sense for someone who never had broken that seal before and he answered her to the best knowledge he had. Apparently she had toys, but most would be tossed due to them being used for her now ex and Hypon was allowed to use them with her if he felt the need. He did however try to manage her expectations considering the timebomb she was, with her more likely over quickly than her normal runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon however was more focused when they got back from the date on the Ice Wolf who was guiding him to the bed and removing their clothes as they went. Frost kept kissing Hypon for the longest moments as she tried to get herself ready to handle the situation she was itching to get for a long time, however nervous she was to experience it without anything blocking her awareness.</span></div></div>",

It ended up reminding him that during the night she had done the same to his own member but didn't want to make her uncomfortable after she was about to have herself taking care off. Frost moved herself towards the middle of the bed and slowly spread her legs, generally more comfortable with her position but clearly was embarrassed as Hypon moved between her, her blushing almost adorably deep.</span></div></div>",

Frost hesitated at first but slowly embraced Hypon with a equal to their first time, wrapping herself to him as they enjoyed their moment, only broken up with her small moans. For a few moments, Hypon felt like a partner to the ice wolf in his arms, yet he wasn't forgetting what their goal was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost gasped as she felt Hypon rub her slit, giving him a small embarrassed smile as he kissed her neck and moved slowly down to tease her. After spending time to play with her breasts and kissing and massaging her legs and up her waist, she tried to keep herself from moaning out when he finally explored her. Hypon at first went painstakingly slow but firm with his licks, earning an impatient-to-cum look from Frost before he chuckled and gave her what she wanted, not unaware how she had gotten his own body quite ready. He however choose to ignore it as he knew she was not ready yet, but it seemed Frost had noticed the budge at his waist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was surprised when Frost flipped him so he was on his back, readjusting so she could face his own stiffeness while resting on his chest, already sliding down his pants \"I feel like a hog for taking everything and not returning it back, so here goes nothing...\" He slowly could feel her working on him with her hands and eventually her mouth, and kept up his efforts after flipping the light off so they could finish and sleep without hassle in the darkness. Hypon could tell Frost was attempting to put effort in the relationship that had formed between them, even if she was slightly uncomfortable and she was new to experiences most had already understood. They continued to work in the dark, almost competitively after Frost had pulled the blanket up so it covered them both, except for Hypon's unobstructed view of her behind above his head and the reciprocal view Frost had under the blanket, but neither of them were complaining...</span></div></div>",

However, as he thought about it, Hypon would have to do something that he rarely did before his father would have to summon him or worst, appear during his afternoon meditations and cause him more trouble than what is needed... But he didn't want to think about that as he slowly shut his eyes and held Frost close to his body before resting right next to her, waiting for her to wake up...</span></div></div>",

She had Sally crawling all over her when she figured out that Hypon had spent that night a week ago together, and then figured out that Frost did so again this morning. Frost immediately felt exhausted after explaining to Sally, which did not go over well with the Princess, as she expected her personal bodyguard to be in top form and to never hold secrets from her. What did hold in Frost's mind was that half of the base apparently were talking about Hypon and her, which made her hope she didn't run into Patricia, as the both of them might cause some chaos. Not to mention the rest of her exs and what was left of her family, who would have some choice words with her if not some actions. Frost just sighed and waited for the meeting to end so she could get her training done for the day and focus on her goals.</span></div></div>",

Prower, he is a blue fox and the brother of Tails \"Miles\" Prower from the Sonic Fandom. A little background on Eric for those who do not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Tails lived with their parents in a home far from the city. They lived happily under the leadership of Max Acorn or King Acorn until the betrayal of both Naugus and Dr. Julian Robotnik, now mostly known as Dr. Eggman. After securing his title of ruler, Eggman then began to roboticize all citizens of Mobius to become his slaves. At this point he visited the Prower family home while the soon to be Freedom Fighters made it to Knothole for the first time. Only Tails managed to avoid Eggman, the rest of the Prowers were not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a physical description of Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is a blue furry fox that is about 101 cm tall and about 34 kg, which is pretty much average compared to most of the characters in Sonic. He has green eyes and a rather mischievous smile to go with it. Eric is much thinner than Tails as being a prisoner for years can do that and helps in his abilities. After his encounter with Robotnik, Eric became a cyborg- half fox and half machine, containing multiple super computers. He has an A.I. named Cynthia who helps keep him alive in drastic situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collection of other stories included involve his sister Jasmine A. Prower, a tribal Ice Wolf named \"Frost\" Lynn, and Samuel Friar. A description of each will be present at the start of their chapters, and will detail their lives as they happened. Feel free to add, but please don't put random stuff in, and I have veto power if I don't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf in the stories, you want to change their appearance, please leave a description of what changed so the rest of us are not clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny questions, please email me on my account. Enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote- the quote by Andrew Ryan from BioShock is not my property I do not claim it as mine. I give all credit to the writers and creaters of Bioshock.</td>",
