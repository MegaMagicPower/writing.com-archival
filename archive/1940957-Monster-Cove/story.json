You\u2019ve only lived in town for a week but you couldn\u2019t believe it. This was the only place in the monster world where humans were in no danger of being smashed, eaten, tortured or enslaved by the monster denizens. The giant monsters as big as skyscrapers lived together peacefully with humans and interspecies marriage was 100% tolerated here. It was especially boggling considering where you lived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour house was built into the side of a tree in the yard of the mayor. Mayor Gacks, or Phyllis as she preferred to be called, scared you at first. She was basically a Cthulu like creature built like a wrestler. When you first met her, you thought she would eat you but she turned out to be much friendlier than you expected. Phyllis allowed you to live with her during your stay in Screamtown and gave you a nice tree for you to see all of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out your window to see monsters of all shapes and sizes crossing the street. Some were even carrying human significant others. You see a cerberus girl having her ears scratched by her human husband and panting like an excited dog. Maybe there was hope for Horrorville, Terrordale and Fearfield where humans were mostly considered food. There sure as heck was no hope for Panicburg. When Phyllis was elected mayor of Scream Town, she decided to do something about how monsters and humans didn\u2019t always have the best relationships and made Scream Town a haven where monsters could live with humans peacefully. Hopefully this would be the start of something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at the window you wonder what you\u2019ll be doing today. After all, you\u2019re still getting used to this new town.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take the escalator up to the \u201cbus\u201d stop. Of course, this was no ordinary bus stop. There were several other humans waiting for Hera Hind, the Ceryneian Hind who acts as the taxi in Screamtown. Phyllis appointed her in charge of human transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear thunderous foot steps and suddenly Hera appears in front of the bus stop. \u201cAll aboard that\u2019s going aboard,\u201d says the hind giantess. All the humans board different areas on Hera\u2019s body and Hera then looks down at you. \u201cWhere you riding today kid?\u201d she asks. One thing about Hera, she let humans choose where they got to ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d you say. \u201cI guess, the tail, Ms. Hind.\u201d Hera turns around and see see her mountain rear with her huge, stubby orb shaped tail in front of you. You climb on the tail among several of your fellow humans. You look down to see her exposed crack and turn away quickly. You had seen similar sights since you came to this town. For some reason, monster girls liked to sit on you. Suddenly Hera moves away in a flash and you appear at the human terminal in Springtime Street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody get off!\u201d yells the deer titaness. She turns around and twerks slightly as you jump off her tail onto the human terminal. You walk down and to your side you see all matters of flowers in bloom. You follow the crowd of human across a walkway where you see sunflowers reach the size of buildings. Some plants you couldn\u2019t even identity because they seemed like plants native only to the monster world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move through this flowers the size of trees, you wonder whether or not it was Latanya who planted them. Latanya the minotaur was the best gardener you knew. There was nothing she couldn\u2019t grow. She was responsible for most o the overgrow in the spring side of Scream Town. She was a nice girl. Of course, you met Latanya under strange circumstances. You got lost in the grass and became exhausted that day. You made the poor choice to lay down on an apple. Latanya didn\u2019t see you on the apple and swallowed you by mistake. Thankfully minotaurs have four stomachs and the first one doesn\u2019t contain any acid. But you were in her belly for 12 hours before she spat you out. There was no way you\u2019d eat a hamburger again after that experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Dr. Weisman\u2019s office up ahead. You remember that you\u2019re supposed to see her sometime the week for a check-up. Thankfully gargoyles were harmless to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you see the the bakery up ahead. You remember you applied for a job there and Maddie, the gorgon owner told you that you could start work any time in the week you were ready. She was a very understanding girl, but Maddie was the dottiest monster you knew. She was so absent-minded and literal that she accidentally baked you into a cake during your work interview. Thank goodness she wasn\u2019t dumb enough to remove her sunglasses and petrify you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always go to Cassidy\u2019s gym. But then again, you heard that literal harpy is brutal when it comes to workouts for humans. But she wasn\u2019t all bad. Just upset at the fact she has to raise her daughter all by herself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you really hope you don\u2019t run into that lou carcolh postwoman, Estelle. That dragon snail was oblivious when it came to humans (including you), who tend to get stuck like gum to her slimy sticky body. You don\u2019t feel like getting sat on by a giant dragon made of goo... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you do in Springtime Street.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get the idea to visit Latanya and see how she was doing. The giant green zebu-like minotaur was no doubt hard at work in her garden. Of course, a giant cow woman\u2019s garden is in reality a jungle. You see the anemones leading up to her garden and from the looks of it, the anemones stood 30ft tall. Of course, living in a tree, you weren\u2019t impressed and just look towards the garden. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d you say. \u201cIt looks like Latanya\u2019s garden has gotten bigger since the last time I saw her. I just better be careful. Whatever I do, I won\u2019t fall asleep on an apple.\u201d You remember all too well the time that Latanya swallowed you. You spent 12 hours trying to get her attention and you finally did so when she decided to chew some cud. Fortunately she could still hear your screams over her grinding teeth and spat you out. After Latanya gobbled you, you swore off steak and hamburgers forever, knowing full well what it was like to be inside of a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, you walk into the garden jungle, past grass leaves as big as trees. You were amazed at how big Latanya\u2019s garden had gotten. You could even hear Latanya humming to herself but you couldn\u2019t see her and try to follow the sound of her voice. The titanic bovine was bent over and was planting some birds of paradise while listening to a pair of headphones. Latanya was a titanic minotaur resembling a green zebu. Like most female minotaurs, she was tremendously fat, especially in her belly. Her rear was so big that it combined with her udder, made it impossible to find pants that could fit her, which was why she mainly only wore a tank-top and vest. She also had bright green eyes and brown hair worn in a bobcut. She was only in her mid 20s (or at least the monster equivalent since monsters had different lifespans than humans) but her hair was going prematurely gray. Her twin sister told you that Latanya\u2019s hair is merely dyed brown and that it went gray when she was in high school but you don\u2019t know whether or not Freya was telling you the truth or she was lying since the sisters had a rivalry. After Latanya planted her birds of paradise, she walks up to the hose and turns it on to spray the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you are lost somewhere in between her sunflowers and her roses. You let out a sigh. \u201cI should never have taken that left turn at the tulips. At this rate Latanya will either eat me again or sit on me without noticing.\u201d You then hear water rushing and then gasp. \u201cOh no!\u201d Latanya\u2019s hose unleashes a flash flood and you are pushed through the water screaming. You have to grab a rose pedal and use it as a canoe before you paddle up to the plant and climb the stalk. You grunt as you cut your hand slightly on one of the rose thorns and then jump to one of the sunflowers and begin to climb up. \u201cI think that I need to get to higher ground. The sooner I get Latanya\u2019s attention the better.\u201d You start to climb up the sunflower, a feat that takes you 20 minutes just to get 3/4 of the way to the top. You let out a sigh and then you see Latanya pulling at a weed and then try to call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLatanya!\u201d you yell not realizing that Latanya was wearing her headphones on. \u201cOver here!\u201d At that point the leaf that you\u2019re standing on breaks. It was there...</span></div></div>",

You look in horror because her mouth opens wide, showing a tongue as large as several football fields and the blackhole leading to all four of her stomachs. \"Oh no!\" you yell. \"Not again! Latanya! Wait! Ugh!\" But it was no use, you had landed with a splash on Latanya's enormous tongue. You stick in place due to the cow's thick saliva and as you try and get yourself unstuck, you heard a loud slamming noise and then you see Latanya's teeth had shut all around you and her mouth was closed, leaving you in the dark inside of the minotaur's mouth. You give a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you say to yourself. \"This is exactly like what happened the first time I met Latanya. At least she hasn't swallowed me yet. I don't think that she even knows I'm in here.\" You then give a gulp. \"Yeah, Rick,\" you say to yourself. \"That's <i>really</i> reassuring. I need to get her attention somehow. Latanya! Latanya! Can you hear me! I'm in your mouth! It's me, Rick!\" Unfortunately for you, Latanya's ears are plugged by her headphones and there was disco music playing hard. The minotaur giantess then starts to walk into her house, humming to the tune of the music, unaware of the passenger in her mouth. Latanya's every movement shake up her mouth and you find it harder to stand than it already was for you when you just had slippery saliva to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you shout. You have to grab hold of Latanya's gums in order to avoid falling into Latanya's throat. \"I can't believe I'm in this mess again,\" you complain to yourself. \"I'm the only person I know who could get swallowed by a cow, <i>twice</i>. I feel like Tom Thumb. Ugh!\" You groan because some of Latanya's saliva drips down and lands on your head. You then start to slip and slide and gasp because you were heading right for the esophagus. You struggle to climb but you keep on slipping and you're eventually forced to grab hold of the gum line of one of the minotaur lady's large molars that were as big as cars. \"Latanya!\" you yell. \"I know you might not be able to hear me, but are your taste buds numb or something! Latanya! Latanya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news is that outside, Latanya turns off her music player and puts her headphones down, but the bad news is that the next thing she does is...</span></div></div>",

I wrote this story for the plot)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatanya at that moment, looks into the mirror and sees her reflection. She shakes her head at what she sees as she opens her mouth and shows off her teeth. \"Yikes,\" she says. \"Those are getting really yellow. It looks like I'm going to have to bring out the strong stuff.\" Just you're luck that you're too far down in Latanya's mouth for her to see you and she takes out a pink toothbrush before spraying some paste onto it. \"This new brand I bought should have the old choppers sparkling like the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Latanya's mouth, because of how low you were, your ears are ringing from Latanya's speaking alone and  you grunt in pain as her speaking inflicts large gale forces at you. Then you realize something. \"Wait a minute,\" you say. \"Don't tell me that Latanya is actually...\" At this point, it is too late and Latanya opens her mouth to let in a brush as large as a billboard. \"Oh no! Latanya!\" You then gag and gargle as the brush sends a torrent of toothpaste your way and you begin to slide down Latanya's throat. \"Oh no!\" you shout. \"Oh no! Oh no!\" You thought for sure you were going to fall down and be eaten again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what happens next is arguably worse because Latanya's toothbrush comes down and out of desperation, you grab onto one of the bristles and hold on tight. You are then pushed along Latanya's enormous teeth as the zebu-like woman continues to brush. In the process, you are covered from head to toe in thick blue and white toothpaste and sink underneath it as you're trapped between the bristles and pushed all alone the mouth grunting and yelling. \"Latanya! Latanya!\" The sounds of Latanya's brushing drowns out your yelling as Latanya then proceeds to brush the top of her mouth and you're pushed against the ceiling. You see Latanya's uvula in the distance but it's too far to reach. You could only hope that this doesn't go on for much longer and then Latanya's mouth opens wide again and she begins to brush her tongue. You slip out and are on her tongue amongst the paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Latanya and crawl forward, hoping that she's notice you. At that moment...</span></div></div>",

Dr. Weisman was one of the nicest monsters in town but can get very serious about her patients. The last time you missed a check-up she came to your house and grabbed you herself. You were sleeping at the time so she pounded on the tree until you woke up. You walk through the human sized door and over to the human section of the waiting room. After ringing the bell thats there you feel the ground shake as Desdemona Weisman comes from a room in the back. She's quite a sight from your place on the floor. Her body is well toned and very muscular,  but not so much that you can't see she's a woman. In Addition to pink skin and long white hair, she's got a long beak, goat like horns on either side of her forehead, and pterodactyl wings. Her lab coat flutters as she walks, showing the black loincloth she wears underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking in the doctor looks down toward the human section and spots you. \"Hello Rick! Here for your check-up on time!\" she says. \"Yeah, I didn't want you shaking my house up again.\" you tell her jokingly. The gargoyle frowns but not in angry way. \"Now I told you when we first met that new human residents need to have a checkup during their first week in town and a few weeks after. You decided not to show up so I had to take matters into my own hands. I take my patients health seriously.\" she lectures you. \"Yeah but I've only been here for three weeks do I really need another one?\" you ask. \"Of course! I need to make sure that you're still healthy after spending some time in our co-existent town.\" she responds. Then she smiles. \"I see you got the message though, since you're here right now.\" You smile up at her and she bends down to pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Weisman carries you to a back room and sets you down on an examination table. She goes through her tools and comes over with a magnifying device over her eye and a specially made tongue depressor. The end she's holding is big enough for her, but the other end is small enough for a human's mouth. \"Say ahhhh.\" she tells you and you comply. She sticks the depressor in her mouth and leans in for a better look, her huge eye right in front of you. After looking around in your mouth she steps away and comes back with a similarly designed reflex hammer. She very gently taps your knees and such to test your reflexes. \"I see your reflexes are still good.\" she notes. \"Are you good at staying out of the way of monster residents? No unfortunate accidents?\" You rub the back of your head. \"Well for the most part yeah. I have been sat on quite a few times but I always end up fine.\" you say. The doctor nods. \"Yes, well that tends to happen. You're just lucky you happen to be a resilient one.\" she says. after she finishes she walks away for a second, giving you a view of her swaying tail and well toned ass.

She had a tendency to laugh at inappropriate times. You remember there was a doctor on the Simpsons who had a similar reaction. \"Oh no,\" says Desdemona. \"You're the only one. I just forgot to tell you that I recently hired a few nurses. I couldn't run the clinic alone forever.\" Don't worry. They told me that they know how to handle humans.\" With that she let out another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that was true. But still, monster nurses, that could get interesting.

Her relationship with you seemed strictly professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Doc,\" you say. \"Are all the nurses you hired coming in today.\" Dr. Weisman shakes her head. \"Ironically, two of them called in sick and won't be ready to start for a few days.

Ah... there she is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is there a shadow is cast upon you and you're about to meet Desdemona's new nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Just to make myself clear, when you add O.C.s, I\u2019d like you to list their first and last names.

Her body, however, was sleek and black like a seal's and had the needle-like dorsal fin of a lionfish on her back, and from the looks of it, it was retractable. She had stubby legs that were half flipper and half foot, and nimble-looking, human-like hands with sharp claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a few seconds to realize what she was: a Telekhine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you heard about them, they were mysterious smiths and sea demons native to the islands of Keos and Rhodes in Greece. They were said to have invented the art of metal-working and were also powerful magic-users. You guess that was why Desdemona had hired her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...perfect timing. I see you're named Thalia.\" the Gargoyle said to the aquatic dog monster, looking at her then at an application form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Thalia, Thalia Ironsea.\" she said, grinning as she nodded. Iron sea? You shrugged. Must be a Telekhine surname. You don't know that many aquatic monsters, so you can't tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think you can deal with some of the patents here? You seem pretty confidant. Care explaining why that is?\" your doctor asked the new nurse, to which the dog-seal monster smirks and holds up a flipper-like hand and it starts to glow, before a blissful look came over Desdemona's face and she seemed to become ditsy, as if she were drunk off distilled happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lasted a few seconds before it stopped and Desdemona blinked, looking confused, before glaring lightly at the new employee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked, that's my answer. Healing and mind-manipulation magic, not to mention I can forge things they can't break out of, so if they need restraint, I can handle it.\" she said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona laughed. \"Good! Now, since you're new, I'll have Rick here serve as your supervisor for a few days until you get into the hang of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThaila grinned. \"You're the boss! Where's Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as a cue, you clear your throat and she looked down, spotting you instantly. \"A human?\" Thalia said, her eyes gaining a spark you didn't like all that much. It was like she was looking at something she had wanted among the gifts under a Christmas tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah. Nice to meet you.\" you said, feeling nervous. In an instant, you were swept up, and slammed against something slick and furry, winding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now facing her cleavage and she was squeezing you so hard you though your eyes would shoot out of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona laughed again \"Human-lover type, eh? Well, then this'll be interesting for BOTH of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight down a groan. This was bad. While they didn't kill humans, human-loving monsters could be rather obsessive and dangerously playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you two, keep things professional, you are on in a doctor's office here.\"   the pink-skinned gargoyle said, getting Thalia's attention. The Telekhine blushed, straightened up, and set you on her shoulder. \"Uh...sorry boss, please don't fire me.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona shakes her head, \"I'll overlook it just this once, but if you're gonna act like that and I hire you, do it on your own time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newbie nodded. and you sighed, relieved to hear that. As long as she was at work,  Thalia would have to leave you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, boss!\" Thilia chirped, then looked at you, \"Shall we start with the tour of the workplace and my duties?\" </span></div></div>",

Stop!\" Thalia let out a giggle. \"I can't help it, you humans are so cute! I just had to move to Screamtown. Everywhere else, dumb monsters think that you humans are just food. It's so unfair. But here, cutesy wootsy humans live in peace with us big monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. This was nothing knew to you. A lot of monster girls you knew such as Manami, Josephine, Freya and Latanya were crazy about humans, especially you. But Thalia, she was acting as if you were a cute little pet or something. You let out a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thalia! Thalia! Dr. Weisman wants me to be your supervisor and give you the once over.\" Thalia gives a pout. \"Oh alright. So, have you known the doctor long?\" You shrug your shoulders. I'm just a patient here, but I've seen the entire doctor's office. Doctor Weisman is the best doctor this town has ever had. But I gotta warn you, I missed one appointment with her and she dragged me down to her office by force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Thalia share a laugh and then you pass by a room that Thalia looks in. Inside that room, there were jars of blood all over the walls and Thalia all but screams as she sees the jars. Inside the room, Dr. Weismen had strapped down a male yowie who was giving blood. You freeze at the sight as the Australian bigfoot's blood was pumped into the jar. \"I forgot,\" you say. \"That's the room where Dr. Weisman keeps all the blood.\" \"Blood?\" asks Thalia in worry. \"Yeah,\" you say, the blood bank is part of Desdemona's clinic. I forgot that there was a blood drive.\" In the room you see blood of all colors. Most kinds of blood were red but other types of blood were bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy blood was bright blood while kappa blood was a greenish color and looked like thick, thick sea water. One ogre had just finished giving blood and you saw that his blood was black. You and Thalia quickly run the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" says Thalia in embarrassment. \"I don't really like blood.\" You give Thalia a look. \"And you're going to work in a hospital?\" Thalia gives a nervous laugh. \"Don't worry,\" you say. \"I don't really like blood myself. Most of it goes towards humans and monsters that need it but Desdemona ships 1% of it to Winter Way.\" \"Winter Way?\" asks Thalia. \"The part of town in perpetual winter.\" \"That's where all the vampires in Screamtown live. It gets the least amount of sun of all parts of town so it's the ideal spot for a vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia lets out a laugh. What part of the clinic do you show her next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figure that you wanted to keep in shape, so it would be best to visit the Voltaire Gym. Of course, to a human, getting to the gym is a workout in itself that takes you half an hour. You have to rest underneath a giant mushroom before you can even think of going inside. Cassidy Voltaire was really rough with her clients, both monster and human. You don't think you've ever seen her smile. Of course, there was a reason for this. Cassidy used to have a human husband but he was murdered by Antoinette when their daughter was still in her egg. That experience turned the harpy's heart colder than the coldest part of Winter Way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were ready, you go inside and see all kinds of monsters in the gym. Mainly monster women that looked like they were built like amazons. There was a giant muscular red and gold striped python woman with a white underbelly. She was a type of dragon resembling an actual python with legs. Another patron of the gym you could see from your point on the floor was a muscular green peluda woman, a monster resembling a cross between a dragon and a porcupine. The peluda woman appeared to be working on her pectorals. You walk under a bench and look above to see a muscular gray and black furred orthrus woman with long black hair flowing from both her heads to her thick muscular ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a whistle and see a muscular 980ft tall axehandle hound woman looking at you seductively as she flexes her large chest. At the front desk of the gym was the proprietress. At 925ft tall, Cassidy was abnormally large for a harpy. She was a harpy resembling a giant muscle bound vulture with pewter-gray feathers. Her face resembled a human woman's with pointed ears and grayish brown hair and she had wings for arms with feathers in place of hands. The only clothing the bird woman wore were a red headband as well as a pair of leg warmers on her thick, meaty thighs. From the looks of it, Cassidy was eating a raw allosaurus. You climb up the stairs to her desk and ring the bell to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture giantess turns her head as she looks down on you. However, she doesn't speak, continues to scowl and bites the legs off of the dinosaur she was eating. \"Hello,\" you say. \"Cassidy. Mrs. Voltaire.\" Cassidy then downs the rest of the allosaurus as she continues to look at you. \"Not a lot of humans come to the Voltaire Gym,\" says the vulture harpy. \"They can't take what we dish out. They're afraid of me. It's not my fault I'm a perfectionist. After all, just because Screamtown is safe for humans, doesn't mean it wouldn't pay to be in top condition in case you had to run from a more unpleasant creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver in place before hearing more stomping. \"Mom,\" says a voice. \"I thought I told you to stop scaring the costumers. With that attitude, no humans will come here.\" You turn your head and see Libby, Cassidy's daughter. Libby was a harpy just like her mother and was just as tall and muscular as Cassidy but she resembled a pigeon rather than a vulture. She had light red-orange feathers on her back but white feathers on her thighs, underbelly and arms with blue feather tips in place of fingers as well as a pink tail with blue highlights at the end and blue talons. She also had paler skin on her face that her mother and blonde hair with pink highlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pigeon harpy smiled and looked down. \"Hi Rick.\" She says. Cassidy just lets out a scoff. \"A customer's a customer,\" she says. \"But remember, Rick, only the strongest humans can take the kind of workouts that occur in this gym. Are you up for it?\" Both harpies look down to question you. \"Uh,\" you say. \"I'm up for anything. So, which one of you will be training me today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy and Libby look at each other to try and figure that out.</span></div></div>",

I'll get right on it.\" As Libby stomps away, Cassidy turns and looks down at you. The giant muscular vulture woman looks down on you and it intimidates you. \"Alright little man,\" says Cassidy. \"You ass is mine today.\" Cassidy picks you up and you hear vibrations as the harpy woman takes you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that Cassidy was brutal when it came to her workouts as far as humans were concerned. It was her way of taking out the anger with the world. You heard that her late husband was the only human who made it through one of her workouts completely unscathed. As the harpy giantess looks down on you, she gives a scowl and a smile. \"Never trust a smiling vulture.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next room, you see a table with a lot of human scale equipment that you couldn't tell was either exercise equipment or medieval torture devices. One of them looked suspiciously like a stretch rack. As Cassidy laid you down, she pinched your muscles with her feathered fingers as you groan. The vulture harpy then shook her head. \"Well, I know what area I'm starting with first. Your upper body strength is terrible. I think I better do to you what I did to build up Averell's strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gulp. \"What do you mean by...\" Then you see the muscular bird woman turning around and her titanic butt is in plain view, which intimidates you. \"Cassidy?\" you ask. \"What are you doing.\" But Cassidy doesn't answer you and starts to sit down. You let out a scream and then hold up your arms, which turned out to be what she was aiming for as her ass stops as it touches your arms and you grunt as she starts to push down. \"What better way to build up your upper strength than to give you something heavy to hold up?\" asks the harpy with a smug grin. You grunt and sweat as you hold up Cassidy's massive ass. You don't know how much you can take and your knees are already shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long is Cassidy planning on sitting on your hands?</span></div></div>",

You were going to have to hold up Cassidy's mountain-sized butt cheeks for half an hour. The muscular harpy giantess continues to press down on you and it takes all your strength just to avoid collapsing. You were panting and sweating as Cassidy's tail feathers open up. She wasn't obese but since she was a skyscraper sized harpy, the vulture woman was still impossibly heavy. Now you know how Atlas feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Cassidy gets up and you gasp and get on your knees. Cassidy shakes her head and lets out a sigh. \"You're out of shape, Rick.\" \"Cassidy,\" you groan. \"Be merciful. You weigh more than a million times my weight.\" \"And that weight is all muscle,\" says Cassidy. \"My hubby only needed one hand to hold both my cheeks up.\" Cassidy then let out a sigh. \"We'll take fifteen minutes and then pick it up.\" You let out a sigh and then Cassidy opens you a bottle of water to pour over you. You instantly drink as much as you can to rehydrate but then you hear a strange creaking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to see Cassidy directing a werecrocodile man resembling an orinoco crocodile who appeared to be moving a vending machine of some sort. \"Just a little to the left. Over there. Got it.\" There was a loud pounding and Cassidy had to fly up into the air. \"Be careful you idiot! You almost put that thing on my foot.\" The orinoco werecroc let out a growl. \"Well excuse me,\" he said in a rather creepy sounding voice. \"You get what you pay for.\" \"Which reminds me,\" says Cassidy. \"When do I pay.\" The crocodile man let out a strange laugh under his breath. \"Soon enough,\" he said. \"You'll pay soon enough.\" With that, the croc left and you read the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orinoco?\" you ask. Cassidy put money into the machine and out came a bottle of a strange green drink of some sort and then she drank it before giving a gag. \"It's a new protein shake I ordered to increase business at the gym.\" You give a sniff and then gag. \"Ugh,\" you say. \"No thanks. Monster drinks are so gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither you nor Cassidy knew was that as the werecroc man drove away in his truck, he left Scream Town out of Winter Way and then took off his face, revealing it to be a mask of some sort. It was shadowed out but from the evil laughing shadow, underneath the mask, the \"croc\" was actually a female equine-based monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the gym, the fifteen minutes were up. \"Alright,\" says Cassidy. \"Time for round two.\" You hold up your arms and groan and then you look up and see that Cassidy's ass seems to have gotten bigger. \"Are you putting on weight?\" you ask. Cassidy's eyes pop out and she gives an angry shriek. You decide that it's best not to say another word you might regret to the humongous vulture-based harpy. Cassidy prepares to sit on you again except for some reason as you tried to hold up her ass you notice that it has gotten heavier and it seemed to be getting rounder with every second. Then you hear a grunt. Cassidy is feeling her stomach and it appears to be swelling and then you hear a ripping sound. Cassidy's legs are getting so thick that her leg warmers can't take it. \"What the?!\" yells the harpy lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and you try to use all the strength you can to hold up the vulture woman's massive booty but it keeps getting heavier and heavier and with a loud \"Boom!\" you collapse under the weight as Cassidy squawks and falls back. She then gets up with you plastered but very much alive stuck on her ass, flattened into her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been flattened into Cassidy's left ass cheek. From where you are you can see that Cassidy's ass seems to have gotten bigger and you look up to see large rolls in the vulture harpy's landscape-sized back. Cassidy has noticed this as well and feels around her hips. \"What the?\" she asked. \"Where is my hard muscular bottom? What happened?!\" As Cassidy is feeling all around herself, you look to see several monsters in the gym, but ONLY the female monsters, appear to be expanding in certain areas as well. You see amazonian monster girls with their enormous muscles quickly turning into fat and flab. You see a phoenix girl with bright dark red feathers and a yellow sash belt who while initially as muscular as Cassidy was expanding in the backside so rapidly that she could barely stand up. Next to her is a bright red-skinned manticore girl wearing kabuki tattoos who is groaning as she tries to hold up his swelling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy looks in a nearby mirror and sees that she now has a triple chin with a very pear-shaped body and slightly pudgy belly. She looks in surprise and even grabs hold of her face cheeks before Libby runs in. \"Mom!\" she yells. \"Something really strange is happening!\" Cassidy turns around and sees that Libby is just as obese as she is and even holds her rear to her daughter's, unintentionally grinding you between the four meteoric harpy cheeks.\" You grunt and cough because you swear you swallowed some feathers as your mouth was filled with blubber. \"Great Zeus,\" says Cassidy. \"What happened to us, Libby.\" \"I don't know, Mom. I... uh, Mom, Rick's kinda stuck to your butt.\" Cassidy blushes before Libby peels you off her mother's backside and then you inhale deeply just as Libby places you on to of Cassidy's tail. You look down to see just how massive the harpy lady's cheeks were. You even feel your foot sinking into the flesh. Cassidy is trying to ponder what happened when she notices that Libby has a bottle of Orinoco cola in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libby,\" asks Cassidy. \"Did you drink that protein shake?\" Libby nods her head. \"Yes, Mama. I saw every girl who came in grab a bottle of the stuff.\" Cassidy removes the bottle from her daughter's breasts and then inspects it. \"No manufacturing address, no list of ingredients, no sign of any nutrition facts. It's as if somebody didn't want this being traced. You manage to climb the rolls of the harpy's back, except you are quickly exhausted and you're only 5% of the way up to Cassidy's now virtually non-existent vulture neck. You have to lodge your hands tight between the rolls as Cassidy storms away with the bottle and lays it on the ground before picking it up with her very swollen talons. Cassidy then flaps her wings and you have to hold on tight to the bird woman's fleshy back because it looks like she's going to fly. Cassidy actually manages to fly up several miles into the air and you could only look in awe that she even can <i>fly</i> given how big and obese and heavy she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just want to confirm a suspicion, Rick,\" she says. \"Where there's one vending machine there's another.\" Cassidy decided to fly to the four corners of Scream Town in order to see if what happened to her was catching. First, Cassidy decides to fly over Summer Side. You look down and see Manami Urameshi and several of her friends at school. They had started to bloat themselves and the teenage hellhound girl at this point was 1000ft tall and she was sweating as her belly was bulging out and her school uniform appeared to be tearing at the skirt. Her cheeks now looked like chipmunk cheeks and her skull-face looked fuller than usual. You then hear flapping and Kandi Zotz flies by and wings at you. The elderly were bat looked more pear-shaped than usual and her breasts had expanded to the point where her dress has been reduced to a mawashi. Like the case with Cassidy, you wonder how Kandi could even stay in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Cassidy flew over Autumn Avenue. Chief Eileen Dinkley was chasing a red-skinned male asura thief who was sticking two of his tongues out at her. Eileen had bulged out significantly to the point where rolls of fat were covering her thousand eyes that seem to be irritated. The police chief stops to catch her breath as she tries in vain to try and catch the thief. Cassidy flies down lower to see Freya sweating and fanning herself. The mock turtle giantess, while already on the BBW side now sported enormous breasts and her udder was even bigger than her head. You look at her back and see that her shell looks very undersized compared to her much larger body. You spy a green bottle of Orinoco on a rock by Freya and you begin to think that Cassidy may be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cassidy flies over Winter Way. Chantal Cordeon, the black European dragoness, now sported an enormous belly and hips that he red bikini couldn't contain. You see that her human daughter, Kiki was on her shoulder and was now very spherical to the point where her curves seemed to disappear. But Kiki Cordeon wasn't even a monster. This plague affected <i>humans</i> as well!? From the looks of it it only females were infected. You then see Pauline Pride. While Pauline was fat before, now she looked even more massive with an ass large enough to be used as a serving tray and breasts that were big enough for her to hold a book onto, which is what she was doing now as she scratched her fattened face. She sees you on Cassidy's back and purrs as she waves at you. Then you hear flapping and see your hippogriff sister, Olga. She appeared to be taking more effort to try and stay in the air as everybody else and was panting heavily. Olga was so obese that there were several layers to her rear and back and she looked as though she had switched to walking on all fours, which would be more apparently if she weren't flying. Her wings however, looked small on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to laugh but Olga glares at you. \"Don't even think about it, Dweeb.\" \"Sorry, Olga,\" you say. \"But you gotta admit, you do look funny.\" \"Don't flatter yourself, Rick.\" \"Ms. Rowling,\" said Cassidy. \"Did you by any chance drink a bottle of Orinoco?\" \"You mean that new energy soda that hit town? They put a vending machine of the stuff right down the street and I got curious.\" Cassidy held up the bottle that was in her talons and then flew off carrying you. \"Wait for me.\" Groaned Olga who was so fat that she could barely fly right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Springtime Street, you see the blue Asian Dragon, Yang Beifong flying through the air and was now so big and fat that her elongated neck was puffy and made her head look like a bear stub at the end, to say nothing of her much bigger ass. \"Hi, Rick.\" She says. Cassidy flies down in front of Dr. Weisman's office before taking the bottle of Orinoco in her hands. \"I really hope that Desdemona can shine some light on what's going on.\" Inside the waiting room, you see several female monsters that had bloated due to that strange soda. First you see Penumbra Howler whose stomach was touching the ground and she was blushing as she stood up. Azzah Sobek was there as well and the werecrocodile woman's throat had expanded along with her butt that was making her dress tear apart. Her human husband Frank was waiting on her shoulder with her. You then see Noreen and from the looks of it, her breasts had enlarged to the point where the rhino giantess had to push them down in order to see where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy realized that she had better run down the hall as fast as her chubby feet could take her as you climb up her hair. \"It's not like Desdemona to keep people waiting,\" she said. \"Something's not right.\" Cassidy bursts through a door to a lab where Dr. Weisman is. \"For Greg's sake,\" groans the gargoyle doctor. \"You could've knocked.\" You look in surprise to see that Desdemona has been infected as well and is now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Desdemona was actually much bigger than any of the girls you've seen. The gargoyle doctor was so bloated that she would weight at least 3 tons had she been human sized. Desdemona's stomach was pinned to the ground and had shredded her shirt with her lab coat filled with holes while her naked and expanded breasts were now in full view. Her wings looked more like chicken wings than gargoyle wings and her ass was so colossal that it was higher than her head. Her tail was tremendously undersized and it looked like the gargoyle had four chins and her beak looked like it could barely move for her to talk. From the looks of it, Desdemona was completely immobilized by her new fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy was surprised herself. \"Dr. Weisman?\" she asked. Desdemona let out a sigh. \"Good day, Cassidy. You seem to have caught me at a bad time. I'm not 100% sure but it seems that there's a plague of nebutori spreading around Screamtown.\" \"Gee,\" you say sarcastically. \"What a surprise.\" \"Please excuse me,\" said Desdemona. \"I can't walk at the moment, let alone fly. Thalia, could you please come in here?\" Desdemona's Telekhine assistant walks in and you see that she's just as fat as Cassidy and most of it went into her belly. \"Hi, Ricky!\" she yells sweetly. Thalia snatches you up and then rubs you against her bloated chins as you grunt. \"Thalia! Thalia! Thalia! This is not the time.\" Desdemona let out a sigh. \"Thalia, the test results.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia places you on Desdemona's stomach and then presents a diagram that depicts scans of the nebutori plague. \"The nebutori is spread through a soft drink called Orinoco,\" said Desdemona. \"And since nebutori is extremely contagious, even women who don't drink the soft drink are being infected. At this point, I'd say that 90% of all human and monster women in Screamtown have been infected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with the chitchat, Dr. Weisman,\" says Cassidy. \"Don't you have an antidote for nebutori.\" \"I do,\" says Dr. Weisman. \"And I was the first person I inoculated. But my usual antidote had no effect. This appears to be a mutated strand of nebutori.\" You give a gulp. \"How long do we have to wait for...\" Desdemona rolled her eyes. \"Well, it could take weeks if not months. First I have to analyze this new match to find a way to make an antivirus and that's considerably hard at the moment since I can't even stand up.\" Cassidy let out a grunt. \"Goody, goody, gumdrops,\" she said sarcastically. \"50 years of body building, healthy eating and exercise down the drain due to a virus. A virus smuggled in a <i>health drink</i>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize something as you try to stand on Desdemona's pudding-like stomach. \"The nebutori was in the Orinoco cola,\" you say. \"I wonder if somebody did this on purpose.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" said Cassidy. \"Who would go to all this trouble just to make every woman in Screamtown morbidly obese?\" You then have a terrible thought. \"Maybe Antoinette?\" Desdemona and Cassidy both look in shock. Antoinette Curry was an evil Nuckelavee scientist who lived in Screamtown before you were even born. She was run out of town and imprisoned for experimental atrocities on humans and monsters, some of which she kidnapped and some were even children. Her actions were so horrid that she was sentenced to life in Under Gloom. However, she is believed to have died in an explosion during a backfired escape attempt. Yet some monsters in Screamtown believe that Antoinette is indeed alive and is plotting her revenge somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy lets out a shriek. \"If that Antoinette shows up in Screamtown, I will crush her head like a watermelon!\" Cassidy's human husband was killed by Antoinette's experimentations and as a result, Cassidy was one of the monsters in Screamtown who despised Antoinette the most. However, Desdemona grabbed one of her chins. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"I wonder if this really is Antoinette's handiwork. It doesn't look like her style.\" Cassidy then jumped on Desdemona's tummy, trapping you between her boobs and Desdemona's stomach fat in the process. \"There is no plot too bizarre for that... that... that Antoinette! She is the epitome of evil! She doesn't need to be caged, she needs to be shocked!\" You mumble and sink into Desdemona's fat as Cassidy got up. Clearly the harpy was enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona let out a sigh. \"Even if this is Antoinette's doing, we'll just have to resume life at a few megatons heavier.\" Cassidy let out a groan and then held her head. \"Just call me when you can get an antidote ready, Desdemona. Please.\" Cassidy then exits the clinic and flaps away, struggling to lift her fat ass off the ground and panting with every flap. Back with Desdemona, you try to climb up from the gargoyle doctor's sweaty and squishy rolls of flab. Fortunately she plucks you out and lets out a sigh. \"You're going to need a lift home. My brother should be here shortly.\" You raise an eyebrow. \"Othello?\" you ask. Desdemona nodded her head. \"Hera got infected so Othello is acting as the substitute bus until she can move again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide down Desdemona's stomach and then run out of the clinic to the nearest bus stop. You knew Othello well. He was Maddie's husband and Desdemona's younger brother. He was a gargoyle who resembled his sister except that he was light blue and slightly shorter than Desdemona, albeit he was MUCH smaller than her in her current state. As you reach the spot where humans would normally wait for Hera, you notice that there were mainly human women at the bus stop and every one was infected by nebutori. Each one was at least 12ft tall, meaning that it wouldn't be just monsters towering over you until Desdemona could find a cure. As you're waiting, you see Alala walk by and her horse half was so bloated that her upper body was minuscule in comparison and she was moving much slower than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you don't have long to wait for Othello who flies down wearing a belly bag much like the one Hera wears. \"All aboard,\" the gargoyle giant says. \"I'll be subbing for Hera until this plague is over and down.\" You walk in first and get into your seat. You really wonder how Maddie is doing. After all she was your boss and you wouldn't want her to be suffering too much from the nebutori. Before you can think anymore you hear a stomping sound and it wasn't big enough for a monster but it was still pretty huge. Then you look up and see something frightening. There was a Native American girl with long blackish brown hair who was infected by the nebutori. She looked 12ft tall and weighed a ton. She was so busy checking a text that she didn't realize that her large blue jean covered rear was directly over you and the two seats to the sides of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even scream, the young girl sits down and plasters you to her butt as you grunt. It doesn't help that she puts her headphones in and won't be able to hear your struggle just as the last passenger boards, Othello zips the bag and then flies off.

You take the escalator up to the \u201cbus\u201d stop. Of course, this was no ordinary bus stop. There were several other humans waiting for Hera Hind, the Ceryneian Hind who acts as the taxi in Screamtown. Phyllis appointed her in charge of human transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear thunderous foot steps and suddenly Hera appears in front of the bus stop. \u201cAll aboard that\u2019s going aboard,\u201d says the hind giantess. All the humans board different areas on Hera\u2019s body and Hera then looks down at you. \u201cWhere you riding today kid?\u201d she asks. One thing about Hera, she let humans choose where they got to ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you decide to ride on top of Hera\u2019s head and she lowers her head for you to climb up her antlers. You could feel them and discovered that true to the myth, they were solid gold. You climb up and sit down on a ruby lodged on one of the tips and sit down on it before Hera zooms off. How she could move so fast at her height with her massive belly, you didn\u2019t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she reaches a ramp and lets the humans down as they make their way to the beach. As you walk down the ramp towards the beach, you suddenly start to breathe heavily. You forgot that Summer Side was the hottest part of the town. Most monsters that lived here were either fire or water elementals born for tropical weather. By the time you finally reach the beach, you\u2019re drenched in your own sweat and gasp as you catch your breath. A nearby gargoyle accidentally spills a bottle of juice and you run under the orange shower to cool off. You forget how monster climates can be treacherous to tiny humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you\u2019re cooled off from the unbearable sunshine, you walk off onto the beach and see several monsters sunbathing, playing volleyball and even sailing. You even walk past a wereseal woman sunbathing on her stomach as human children are playing on it. You let out a smile and look out to see several surfers. One of the surfers was a close friend of yours; Josephine Biggs. Josephine was a grootslang, a monstrous cross between an elephant and a snake. She had the body of a pachyderm but the skin of a reptile with a serpent for a trunk. She sometimes let you surf with her. However, there was one thing she did that scared you. Josephine liked to hover her planetary rear a few inches away from your head and make it look like she was going to sit on you. She loved to tease you that way but one day you\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to flatten you for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look ahead and notice the high school in the distance. At this time, school should be getting out. You remember that one of the students at the school lived around here; Manami Urameshi, the friendly hellhound. Her family consisted mainly of hellhound girls and human guys. Maybe you\u2019ll see Manami coming home from school today. Manami was very petite compared to the older monster girls, but you laugh to yourself because you know it won\u2019t laugh. In Screamtown all the female monsters wind up either sumo-sized or in Phyllis and Desdemona\u2019s cases, muscular enough to make the Hulk look like a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you stop because you remembered a potential hazard. Kandi Zotz. Kandi was a giant elderly werebat and the biggest cougar you\u2019ve ever seen in terms of size and personality. The old crone wasn\u2019t bad looking for her age and she knew it. She was so lonely that she would spend her days combing the beach for human men. She snatches them up, takes them to her lair and then things get wild. One traumatized victim even told you he was trapped in her nether-regions for days. That bat was bad news. She almost grabbed you one time but you hid inside a bottle before she could snatch you. Why hasn\u2019t she been arrested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, there was that annoying sphinx Alex. She loved playing mean pranks on people, especially humans. One time when you were sunbathing, you fell asleep and while you were sleeping she tied you to a balloon. She\u2019s usually harmless but before she moved to Screamtown, she had a human boyfriend. She caught him cheating on her and bit his head off. As much as you hate Alex\u2019s stupid pranks, you don\u2019t want to anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a nice swim with do you some good, maybe you\u2019ll even see that mermaid artisan Joanne. Oh, what to do, what to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you're puzzling over how to spend your day at the beach, you catch a familiar sight out of the corner of your eye: Josephine. She was merrily stomping towards you, carrying a surfboard under her arm as her prodigious belly, hips and cleavage swayed and rippled with each step--which only seemed to put her usual white bikini under more stress than her heavy body already put on the swimwear. You honestly didn't know how that thing hadn't burst open yet--not that you'd ever say that to Josephine herself. Given how she teased you with her planetary rump, it was pretty obvious what she'd do if you made that sort of comment. You liked her too much to hurt her feelings like that, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jospehine comes closer, you realize she has company: Manami is walking alongside her, clad in a bright red one-piece bathing suit and carrying her own surfboard. The hellhound giantess looks chipper as ever, chatting with Josephine and giggling at some joke. Tagging along with the pair are a white-scaled dragon girl and a green where-rhino giantess, both generously portioned and wearing black bikinis (though they aren't nearly as pudgy as Josephine, nor does their swimwear look in danger of bursting at the seams), but they don't have surfboards with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, waving to the approaching quartet. \"Hey, Josephine! Manami! Over here!\" you call out. Seems you won't have to worry about finding something to do--some of your closest friends in town are already here. You keep waving you arm in the air until Josephine notices you. By then, they're all close enough to be in earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine is first to spot you. \"Well, look who dropped by, girls! How's it going, Rick?\" she greets, stomping over to you. The reptile/pachyderm titaness bends down and scoops you up with one hand, looking down at you with a smirk. \"Decided you'd stop by Summer Side for the day? Or were you just hoping for another look at the Blue Mountains?\" She sets her surfboard down and with her now-free hand, gives her mountainous butt a poke. \"You know you don't have to ASK for that, right?\" She adds, winking. You can't help but gulp at the thought of her sitting on you, and you feel yourself blush as the other girls share a little laugh at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Manami comes to the rescue. \"Oh, let poor Rick be! Besides, we're here for some surfing lessons...you can squish him under that oversized butt of yours later.\" She rolls her eyes. \"Already had to deal with my spikes putting holes in the swimwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJospehine turns to the other girls, thankfully slow enough so you don't get whiplash. \"Alright, Manami; I'll leave him be. For now, that is.\" She gives a devilish giggle, then holds you up so Manami and the other two girls can get a better view. \"So, we're all here, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he could come surfing with us?\" Manami suggests. \"He's told me you let him ride you sometimes, and...well, maybe he could help with the lessons? Or maybe ride on <i>me</i>.\" She gives you that adorable, bubbly, fang-filled grin she always does. And God help you, is it tempting...despite the dangers of riding on her when she was just a beginner when it came to surfing. \"He could hold onto one of my spikes, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon-girl speaks up next, reaching her head down...just <i>slightly</i> too close for comfort. \"Like, you girls kinda forgot to introduce us,\" she snarks in a VERY Valley Girl-like tone. The were-rhino rolls her eyes while Josephine and Mani wince at their faux paus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManami chuckles, rubbing the back of her head. \"Sorry, Katie; guess we got caught up reminiscing...anyway, Rick, meet Katie and Jessica,\" she addressed you, pointing to the dragoness and the where-rhino woman, respectively. Katie smirked and tipped a clawed hand in a half-wave; Jessica waved a green-furred hand with a more friendly grin. With introductions out of the way, Manami looked among everyone and asked, \"So, what now? I know Josephine and I are the ones hear to surf, but I wouldn't mind some lunch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally! I am, like; <i>starving</i> right now!\" Katie whines, rubbing her stomach. \"And I sooooo wanna talk more with you girls, and Rick here. Any other human would run screaming if they saw a monster girl's ass over them--I'd know, I've totally threatened to sit on 'em before--but he's, like; practically your boyfriend, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nods, leaning in--though not as uncomfortably close as Katie did. \"I want to chat with you all too--I've never been in a town where humans weren't afraid of me before...and I'm kinda hungry myself. But if you two want to just hit the waves now, that'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what'll it be for your day at the beach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gasp and see that it is a grenade. Manami screams and runs off as the larger girls step back. \"Rick!\" yells Josephine seeing you trying to run. Josephine jumps on the grenade, causing you to be tossed across the sand. \"Josephine!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, surprisingly the grenade doesn't go off. You thought for sure that being crushed under Josephine's weight would cause a huge explosion, but as Josephine gets up, you see that the \"grenade\" is just a football painted to look like a grenade. \"A fake?\" you ask. \"Kwa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" laughs a familiar obnoxious voice. \"Oh no.\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all hear flapping and from the sky with a boom descends Alexandria Luxor, the local beach bully. Alex was a titanic obese sphinx with scarlet fur and long strawberry blonde hair. You see that toothy smile with a pierced lip and nose and her blue jeans that are tight enough to look painted on her massive butt. Being a sphinx, Alex walked on all fours, which was amazing given how she was practically dragging that big belly of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated that sphinx girl. She was a prankster who was always pulling mean-spirited tricks on humans and monsters alike. That balloon thing was one thing but one time when you were sunbathing, she sat on you and you swear she ate ten bean burritos <i>on purpose</i> that day. It a wonder your lungs didn't melt. It would seem that she was up to her old tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" Says that sphinx with a smirk on her face. \"Alex!\" yells Josephine. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"Like yeah,\" says Katie as she breathes fire from her nostrils. \"We thought that was a real bomb.\" Alex just let out a laugh. \"Scares big monsters and teeny tiny little baby wormies too.\" She says in a condescending tone at your level. You grit your teeth and walk up to confront that troublemaker. \"Listen hear Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just smiles at you and shows you her terrifying teeth. She even sticks out her tongue and reveals a silver plated skull piercing. You step back. There was a rumor that piercing was the skull of her ex-boyfriend. Thank goodness it wasn't legal for her to eat you in Scream Town. \"I'd watch what I say, bite-sized,\" says Alex. \"You don't want to piss off a giant flying cat that just had <i>20</i> burritos, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated Alex, you back away. You definitely didn't want to mess with her when her tank was that full. Last time you thought you would go blind.\" \"Now listen here Alex,\" says Katie. \"Your jokes are totally not funny.\" \"Who is she?\" asks Jessica. \"Her name is Alex,\" says Manami. \"She's a prankster who's always causing trouble. Just ignore her. That's what my Mom says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex however lets out a scoff. \"Come on, I'm not <i>that</i> mean. Here.\" Alex hands Jessica what looks like a gift box. \"Welcome to the neighborhood.\" Jessica smiles and starts to unwrap the gift box. \"Wait Jessica!\" yells Josephine as her trunk hisses. \"Don't!\" But the were rhino opens the box and it explodes into smoke as the monsters cough. It didn't surprise you. Alex plays that same prank on all the newcomers. She gave you one of those exploding gift boxes when you moved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you gag as Alex grabs you and laughs. \"That never gets old.\" She says with a laugh before she flies away. Josephine blows away the smoke with her trunk. She raises her trunk and it hisses as Alex carries you away. \"Alex!\" yells Josephine. \"Give me back my boyfriend.\" But Alex just moons Josephine in response before flying off. You try to escape her grip but the sphinx has you too tight and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the perfect prank for you, Wormy.\" She says mockingly. What is that crazy sphinx gonna do to you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wish you had time to think, as you spot that werebat son of a gun flying in the air right now. In terms of what you were thinking about doing, perhaps you were thinking about getting some sun on you (even though the heat is unbearable because of monster climate), or maybe you want to go out for a swim. Well sadly you won't be able to since now you notice a werebat flying right about you. It is Kandi for sure, and she is one girl you don't like. She is a giant navy furred elderly vampire bat woman that is pear shaped, she also has a purple underbelly and long gray hair worn in a ponytail. Her large green wings are attached to her arms with sharp claws and monstrous thighs almost as big as Josephine\u2019s. For clothing she wears a dark brownish orange dress with a hood. You think that it would been okay for her considering her age to merry an old man and be done with it, but you see, she is a bit of a mess up woman bat thing, or something you can call. You see, she hits on young men all the time, and whenever she sees one, she would snatch them up with her claws and then takes them home to be her sex toy. Plenty of men had some good experiences, but many had bad experiences mostly, and someone even told you of that. You just had to be sure that you don't get caught by her. You escaped her multiple times, and for sure you will have to do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is even disturbing is that she always flies around with her badonkadonk (werebat's ass) shown all around. Is she trying to tempt younger man into wanting to go out with her? If so, you don't want to see it as not only its well... round and sexy for someone that is fooled, but it is also ugly and disgusting to look at. Also, public nudity is really bad for everyone. You just continue to walk around for a few moments before the Kandi turns around and notices a human to her eyes down in the sands. Finally, she has a new prey that she can get, and she swoops down for the bite. However though, she notices something. It is none other than you walking. Perhaps just trying to capture you is not enough, and just as she lands right in front of you, you gasped to see it was none other than Kandi. This is one monster girl that you didn't want to see at all. I mean, she might look fine in terms of looks for someone that is fooled, but you aren't. This is elderly, and it is completely wrong to be taken in by an elderly cougar like her. Still, this is not going to turn out well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there sugar poo. (I don't know cougar talk so bare with me here). How is life treating you?\" she said in some sort of super sexy voice just as she starts to cuddle and get closer to her with her big wings. You back away in fear, just hoping that you have something good to say, and hopefully you can tell her nicely to back off as you doesn't want to be her sex toy. Not now, not ever, and you mean it. \"Uh....uh...uh...\" you said in fear and suddenly awkward way just as you back up. \"It is going well uh..... uh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I am sure it is going... splendid. Mine is going splendid as well. Been giving tons of men some pretty gifts of fun. Do you want to come later and play with me at my house? I am rest assure that it will be a delightful time for both you and me. That I can assure you.\" Kandi then says in a very sexual way just as she continues to get close to you. You aren't sure what you want to do at the very second. You want to say no, but you remember all those times when you say it, she would chase after you for a brief moment, and while you want to do it, you don't want to offend her, so you figure a good way out of that scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... I will consider it sometime today. I will let you know.\" you told her, and then you try to sneak away by backing up until you are a bit far away, and then she smiled then. \"Well good, I am glad that you considered it, but why not we do it right now. Do you have anything you need to do right now, as you can put them off till later so we can get this out of the way at my special place now.\" Kandi then said just as she then starts walking towards you, with you just running for your very existence. You were hoping that she would buy into you \"Maybe\" answer, but she isn't the patient type, and heck, sometimes you heard that she would make them have sex whether they liked it or not. Now you were running for your life, hoping that you don't get caught by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, for all that sprinting that you do, you must be hard to please. Well I can surely please you with this.\" Kandi said just as she suddenly flies in a swoosh of air and then lands right in front of you with her ass being shown. Man not only does it smell for all the sex that she has from the others, but it is just disturbing, and it now put a stop to your escape. She was starting to get pretty close at this point. She felt that she had done it. She has now another toy that she can play with. You had to think of something quick, as you don't want to be her sexy toy. But hey, maybe you might have no option at all. Just as she gets closer and closer to you.</span></div></div>",

You walk down past a werecrocodile woman whose human boyfriend was rubbing sun tan lotion on her. Finding a good spot on the beach was important to a human in Summer Side. Monsters took up a lot of space so it wasn't easy. You also had to find a place where you weren't likely to be trampled or sat on. Since you moved to Screamtown, a lot of monster giantesses have sat on you. So far you've been plastered to Freya, Estelle, Alex, Olga, Latanya and Gabriella among others. It's amazing you haven't been squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find a nice place to set up the beach towel and lay down as you look around the beach. All over, there were monsters of all species enjoying the beach. You saw a werejaguar swimming as well as a kappa, a chinese dragon, a weretiger and a phoenix harpy playing volleyball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tremors and then look up to see a 1300ft pear-shaped Nidhogg woman. She was a cerise skinned monster resembling a cross between a dragon and a tyrannosaurus rex who had leather wings and spikes all over her body with hundreds of teeth. She was wearing a lifeguard's outfit and a pair of sunglasses and had blonde hair. You recognized her. Her name was Tyra Rex and she was the lifeguard. On her shoulder was her human partner. It was kinda funny. Most of the monsters were of species that regularly preyed on humans, but here they're perfectly harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you hear thunderous stomping and see one ogre with an angry look on his face that appeared to have kabuki paint on it. \"Where is that fleabag!?\" he yells. \"I'm going to tear that blasted sphinx apart this time.\" You let out a sigh. Another victim of Alex's stupid pranks. That sphinx was always playing some stupid trick. You hope you don't fall victim to one of her pranks anytime soon. One time when you confronted her about TP-ing your treehouse, she sat on you for an hour. That sphinx was one of two hazards of coming to the beach, the other being Kandi. That literal old bat would no doubt show you someplace unpleasant if she caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were starting to enjoy your tan...</span></div></div>",

This was a town where you could fall asleep on a beach full of monsters and not worry about being smashed or eaten in your sleep. You just fall asleep on your beach towel and snore away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, twenty minutes later, you hear a rumbling noise that wakes you up. You mutter and open your eyes just in time to see your view being obscured by an enormous black bikini bottom descending on you. You gasp and try to yell but in seconds, you're pinned to the sand by a monster giantess's ass. You let out a grunt as you're pushed into the ground. You knew this feeling all too well. For some reason your body could take a lot more punishment than it should be able to and you often find yourself being butt crushed by giant monster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all due to being constantly sat on by Olga growing up. Your hippogriff sister had an odd habit of sitting on humans as if they were eggs and you were her favorite seat cushion. One time you remember her going on a date with you plastered to her equine rear. Then again, she was hardly the last monster giantess to pin you down. Gabriella, Pauline, Eris and Estelle all sat on you by accident at various points and then there were monsters like Alex, Freya, Latanya and Cherry who sat on you on purpose. One time, Maddie of all people even sat on you and since she didn't even <i>have</i> an ass, you still don't know how she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this ass did not look familiar. She was a monster you had never seen before and from your angle, you couldn't tell her height, weight or species. She obviously didn't see you and you try to scratch and bite her butt, but you're stuck too tight for her to feel you. It was gonna be one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour you spend trapped under this oblivious monster girl's titanic butt cheeks and your entire body is numb. You don't have long to wait for the monster girl to get up and walk along the beach. Unfortunately, you had been underneath her for so long that you were plastered to her left butt cheek. At least from your point of few you could figure out what type of monster woman you're stuck to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Just to make myself clear, when you add O.C.s, I\u2019d like you to list their first and last names.

Phyllis appointed her in charge of human transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear thunderous foot steps and suddenly Hera appears in front of the bus stop. \u201cAll aboard that\u2019s going aboard,\u201d says the hind giantess. All the humans board different areas on Hera\u2019s body and Hera then looks down at you. \u201cWhere you riding today kid?\u201d she asks. One thing about Hera, she let humans choose where they got to ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want to ride kid?\u201d asks the deer giantess. As she bends down, you see her giant breasts forward and several humans climb inside. You run in and soon Hera lifts her cleavage up. It\u2019s very soft and you almost feel like falling asleep right before she starts running. It\u2019s a soothing ride in Hera\u2019s breasts until she reaches the terminal in Autumn Avenue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the ride Ms. Hind.\u201d You say. Hera nods her head and in a flash, she\u2019s off again. As you walk down the stairway, you see leaves the size of mountains on the ground. Nearby, several monsters were busy raking the leaves into piles. A never-ending chore when you live at a corner in perpetual fall. At least it was always a bumper crop given that you pass an apple that could easily feed you for a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead and see the library. You\u2019ve never thought about checking out a book but you\u2019re sure they have human sized tomes in there. Of course, you\u2019ll have to be careful. Ororo was emotionally unstable. If she didn\u2019t have her human son and husband to calm her down from her mood swings, she\u2019d be dangerous. You think that she might even have a mental disorder. Nevertheless, it was a good place to meet people. Maybe you\u2019ll see Noreen checking out books. Noreen was a huge wererhinoceros that you can honestly say is the pachydermic queen of the goths. She was the most mysterious monster you knew. The weirdest thing about Noreen, she never liked her name. As soon as she noticed her resemblance to Shego from Kim Possible, she decided that she\u2019d prefer to be addressed as Shego rather than her actual name. Some monsters are just plain weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the library was Angel\u2019s workshop. Angel was a weretiger and a steampunk genius who could build pretty much anything she put her mind too. She built working trams and zeppelins for the humans and built the clocktower in the middle of Autumn Avenue. However, Angel could be pretty ill-tempered at times and once stuck you in one of her armpits when you accidentally insulted her mother\u2019s cookie recipe. Angel\u2019s workshop used to belong to Antoinette, a scientist who was run out of town for her nigh demonic experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy Angel\u2019s lab you could see Freya working in her garden. In many ways Freya was like her twin sister, Latanya. Other than the fact that Freya is a mock turtle while her sister is a minotaur. Maybe you could score some strawberry milk from her. Why her body produces that instead of regular milk, you have no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly you see the forest up ahead. Maybe a hike would do you good. You might even be able to find Mabel. That sleepy mandrake was dormant so often you couldn\u2019t tell her from the regular trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, as you walk down the street, you see Chief Dinkley the Argus going down in her police cruiser. Her thousand eyes are all scowling. You feel really safe with her watching out for humans and monsters in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember the clock tower in the center of town. You don't know if anyone lives there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what to do?</span></div></div>",

There has to be a human sized section for you to look at. You walk through the human entrance and immediately feel vibrations. You look up and see the head librarian, Mrs. Ororo Parker. Ororo was a 950ft tall wereboar. She resembled a cobalt colored warthog with four tusks and long white hair reaching to her massive rear. She was wearing a tight black A-shirt that only hid her nipples and white spandex pants that looked like they would snap off any moment. At the sides of her hips they were coming apart and there were even some holes in the seat that exposed her panties. She didn't look bad for a woman her age or species. Too bad she was married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, Ororo was stacking books when she dropped one and had to bend over, giving you the view of her ass. It wasn't as big as Josephine's or Kandi's but it still looked big enough to crush a skyscraper. As you walk forward, you hear Ororo let out an angry snort. \"Ya better not be eyeing mah booty. Ah already have a husband and Ah don't like little perverts staring at me.\" You step back as Ororo stands up and then glares at you. Ororo wasn't a mean person but she was prone to mood swings. She could be nice and calm one second and then totally ferocious the next. She didn't eat humans but her sharp teeth and huge tusks still made her intimidating as she stomps forward and loomed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you hear a voice saying you. \"Mom, calm down. It's only Rick. He's probably here to check out a book.\" You turn around to see an African American young man around your age. This was Jasper, Ororo's son. Ororo may be a monster but her husband and son were both humans. You don't know whether or not Jasper is adopted or her stepson but you knew it wasn't likely that a wereboar could give birth to a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro bends over to get a closer look. \"Dammit Jasper,\" she says. \"Ah thought I told ya to stay off da floor. Ah coulda stepped on ya.\" \"Mom, I'm sure that Rick doesn't mean any trouble. I'll take him from here.\" Ororo snorts and then gets back to stacking books as you follow Jasper. \"She's in a mood today.\" You comment. \"She's just been overstressed lately,\" says Jasper with a sigh. \"I started dating a pegasus girl who moved across the street the other day and Mom's acting like an ice queen about it. Right this way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper led you across a network of stairways. Each section of the library had areas where humans and monsters mixed. There were copies of every book in human and monster sizes, except for the spell books of course. Spell books only came in monster size and Ororo kept those under lock and key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jasper,\" you say. \"Have you seen Noreen lately.\" \"Oh, you mean Shego? She's here everyday. You might see that rhino in the fantasy section. She likes your sister's writings.\" You smile at that. \"Now Rick, what kind of book are you thinking of looking at today?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well,\" you say. \"I was thinking about checking out the fantasy section. That's always a good choice.\" Jasper actually lets out a laugh. \"What's ironic is that this library even <i>has</i> a fantasy section. With giant monsters everywhere, what counts as fantasy these days?\" You let out a laugh at that joke. Fantasy might as well be another word for fiction in Scream Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper leads you up to a stairway that takes you to the fantasy section of the library. The two of you walk where you turn to see giant books lined in a row. Underneath them were shelves of smaller sized copies of the books for humans to check out. There were some good ones listed such as the Necronomicon Jr., the Zodiac Games and then you look and see that several books you instantly recognize. It was the Rainbow Galaxy Series that Olga wrote. All six books lined up. She told you she was almost finished with the seventh one. You know you're definitely not checking out those books. You already read each one of them a hundred times. Still, you wonder how Olga is ending the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle it myself from here, Jasper.\" You say. Jasper nods his head. \"Okay, Rick,\" he says. \"I gotta go check up on Mom anyway. She's extra moody today.\" You let out a laugh and shake your head as Jasper walks away. A mood-swinging mother was a dangerous thing, especially one that was a 950ft tall pig woman. You look through the shelf and see several books. You pick up one book that had seven eyes on the cover and try to flip through it, only to see that you can't read the words. \"Oh great,\" you say. \"It's in Lovecraftian language. One of these days I've got to ask Phyllis to teach me how to speak Old One.\" As you're reading, you hear stomping and realize that there was a monster coming near you. One that was as big as Ororo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see an enormous ass covered in skull print panties underneath a black and purple hoop mini-skirt. Underneath were a pair of black nylons and you look closer to see that this monster has thick skin. The monster bends over and you see long black hair, dark gray skin and black lipstick. There was no doubt about it, this was Noreen Steranko. Noreen was a goth girl and a giant wererhino who practically lived in the library's fantasy section. You also knew very little about her. The only person you knew her to talk to was Ororo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen didn't see you but you were at eye-level to her as she was looking through the lower shelf for a book. You figured you'd walk up in front of her mountainous eye and saw hello. \"Hi Noreen.\" You say. Noreen didn't answer. You then let out a sigh. \"Hi,\" you say. \"Shego.\" That got her attention. For some reason Noreen preferred to be called Shego rather than her real name. Admittedly she does sorta look like Shego, but A) How would she know who Shego <i>is</i>? and B) Why would she want to be named after a villain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, now Noreen's eye was on you. \"Hello Rick.\" She says. You actually got her to speak with you. That's a good sign. You then see Noreen's hand coming towards you and you assume she's going to grab you so you flinch. Instead, she grabs the book behind you and looks at it. It was a book entitled \"The Indigo Emperor\", you knew it because Olga wrote it. Noreen actually smiled as she looked at it. \"Your sister is a talented writer,\" she says. \"I can't wait for the Violet Ragnarok.\" You actually smile. \"I heard you have a sister as well Nor... er... Shego. What's she like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen shrugs her shoulders. \"Not much to talk about. She's really uptight; works in a mental hospital as a nurse. She sees the worst plagues of the monster mind everyday. Lucky.\" Huh. So Noreen's sister works in a looney bin. \"Oh,\" says Noreen. \"And she's married to some human she met in New York a long time ago. He kinda makes my skin crawl.\" You didn't know Noreen had a human brother-in-law. Normally that wouldn't phase you, but Noreen's sister didn't live in Screamtown. From what you heard, Noreen is from Terrordale. Monsters there eat humans like candy. You had no idea it was legal to marry humans outside of Screamtown. Guess you could learn a lot from Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to walk a little closer and then...</span></div></div>",

Since they were also Goths, you assumed they were friends of Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first figure was a silver skinned succubus. She had pink hair and purple eyes with black eyeliner and lipstick. From the looks of it, she had Lactose Overload Syndrome, since you couldn't see the top of her legs behind her massive boobs and you could hear the sound of milk sloshing. She was wearing a strained black bikini and thigh-high, high heeled boots. She looked incredibly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second figure was a grey furred werecat. She had short, spikey orange hair and green eyes behind cat rimmed glasses with similar makeup to the succubus. She was incredibly fat, at least as big as Latonya. She was wearing a gothic dress and an Ankh necklace. She was holding a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last figure was a grey male ghost. He had short black hair and blue eyes. He had a fair build, but compared to the werecat, he was a stick. He wore a simple black tee shirt with a skull and jeans. He didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys!\" Noreen said happily. \"Rick, I want you to meet my friends.\" She pointed to the succubus. \"First, this is Cori Dennick, but she prefers Ivory Sky. She's one of the perkiest Goths you'll ever meet, in more ways then one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ello there, Rick.\" Ivory said in a posh British accent. \"It's wonderful to meet you. Hope we can get along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, this is Sarah deCrata, but you can call her Crimson Sea. She's the go-to girl for history and magic. Also, her sisters a famous pool champion.\" Noreen said, pointing to the werecat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Rick.\" Crimson said in a slight Cajun accent. \"She's right. My sis is playing this weekend nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, this is Matthew Richards, but he prefers Indigo Earth. He's much nicer then he looks.\" Noreen said, pointing at the ghost. Then she whispered to you. \"Just don't get him talking about Doctor Who. Once he starts going, he never stops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" He replied in a heavy Scottish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greet all of them. They seemed nice enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen then noticed the book in Crimson's arm. \"Is that the body modification spell book? Crimson, why do you have that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Ivory's idea. She wouldn't tell me why she wanted it.\" Crimson replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it would spoil the surprise, love.\" Ivory replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good, so I'm taking the book back.\" Noreen said, grabbing the book from Crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. It'll be fun. Don't you want to see what I've got planned?\" Ivory asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen thought for a moment. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who knows what could've happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Crimson. \"We better head back to the Bloody Mona. Dusk and Morose are waiting for us.\" Noreen follows her friends and you ride on her shoulder only for Noreen to suddenly stop and twitch. \"Are you feeling okay, Shego?\" you ask. \"I'm fine. I'm too thick-skinned for anything to bother me. I'm just going to check out a few books and then I'll introduce you to the best Goth Bar in Screamtown.\" However, as Noreen was walking away, her skirt was looking tighter and tighter on her. Not that she seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen had arrived at the front desk for Ororo to stamp her books. \"I'll see you again in a week, Shego,\" says Ororo. \"I shouldn't even bother with the due dates with you. You've probably read half the library at this poi....\" Ororo then hears a ripping sound and then she sees Noreen's nylons appearing to tear apart. As Noreen takes her books, Ororo notices that the rhino giantess's illuminati-print panties are showing. Indigo and Ivory are in the air headed to the bar and Ivory lets out a laugh. \"Come on, Crimson! You're so slow.\" Crimson gives a growl as she drags her big belly on all fours. \"Hey. I can't fly like the two of you can.\" Noreen gives a laugh that surprises you. You didn't think she had a sense of humor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead there was the Bloody Mona. It was a Goth Bar that had heavy metal music playing. From the outside, it had stained glass windows and the walls, ceiling and floor were painted to look like they had blood stains all over them. There was a stage inside that was made out of plastic skulls of all species of monsters. Inside the bar, there were two more friends of Noreen's; Dusk a giant tan-skinned behemoth resembling a humanoid hippopotamus with purplish red hair worn in an afro mullet style and a purple star tattoo on her hip and Morose, a blonde haired trunko resembling a greenish cyan humanoid elephant with amphibious features such as gills and webbed hands. They were at the karaoke part of the bar and were singing so loud and fast that they sounded like they were speaking in a foreign language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson, Ivory and Indigo went inside first and Ivory waved at Noreen. \"Come on, slowpoke. I thought rhinos were supposed to be able to run fast.\" Noreen shook her head but as she came in through the doorway she got stuck and grunted, jerking you down her back. You yell and try to grab hold of her hair as you slide down and land your feet on her ass. You look down at the dark gray planetoids and you gasp in surprise because Noreen's ass had swelled up to be as big as a car and her panties had shrunk to the size of dental floss against the titanic cheeks. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Shego. I think that spell worked.\" Noreen grunts and crosses her arms. \"Tell me something I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory let out a giggle. \"Look at Shego. More like She-Bulk.\" Indigo and Crimson just glare at her and she gives a nervous laugh. All the spectators inside and outside can't help but stare as Noreen is embarrassed. She was obese before but it seemed most if not all of her fat had transferred to her butt and then some. \"Uh, guys,\" says Indigo. \"Slight problem. That door is the only way monsters can get in or out of the Bloody Mona.\" Ivory then gulps. \"Of course.\" Sighs Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

However, you don't fall far because right in front of you is Noreen's enormous rack. You slip into the wererhino's cleavage and get stuck as you start to sink between the gray mountains. You feel around your surroundings and discover that the skin is thick but soft. Noreen was pretty obese but a good portion of her fat went to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel vibrations and learn that Noreen was walking away, books in hand. This was terrific; the 950ft tall pachyderm queen of the goths and you were trapped in the canyon that is her cleavage. \"Noreen!\" you yell. \"Noreen!\" But she doesn't respond. You don't know if she can't hear you or isn't responding to you calling her by her real name, but either way, you're stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out to see a cobalt colored cleavage that was practically pushing against Noreen's. It had to be Ororo and at that moment, Noreen was at the book checkout with the wereboar librarian. \"Ah,\" says Ororo. \"Shego. Ah thought ah saw ya in here. Ya oughta have ya mail sent here since ah see you so often.\" \"What can I say, Ororo?\" asks Shego. \"Books are my friends.\" Noreen hands Ororo three fantasy books, including the Indigo Emperor and the wereboar gets a stamp ready to let the rhinoceros giantess know when she expects them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any luck getting Noreen's attention so you try to call for Ororo. \"Ororo!\" you yell. \"Ororo! Down here! I'm stuck in....!\" But before you could say another word, you sink further into Noreen's cleavage canyon and wind up getting a mouth full of wererhino fat just as Ororo has finished stamping the books. \"There ya go, Shego,\" says Ororo addressing Noreen by her nickname. \"All checked out. See ya in seven days.\" \"Thanks.\" Says Noreen as she puts her books in her purse and walks away, unknowingly carrying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. \"At least I wasn't carrying a book,\" you say with a sigh. \"Ororo would kill me if I took out a book without checking it out.\" You knew it all too well. Ororo was a stickler for the rules of the library. The last time a human illegally checked out a book from the library, the porcine giantess taped him to her armpit for the day. But being trapped in a rhino's cleavage made you feel just as helpless as the idea of being stuck in a pig's armpit. As Noreen leaves the library, you see her walk up to her motorized scooter and take off. As she rides down the road, her cleavage shakes, making you sink deeper and deeper. How on Earth could that rhino goth not feel you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before Noreen parks her scooter and you see her enter...</span></div></div>",

The mailbox had a door shaped like a skull and the windows were painted a sickly glowing green. Who designed Noreen's house, Tim Burton? Before you could ponder that, Noreen walks up to the door to take out a key. As she walks, her large breasts shake and you start to sink deeper into her heavy cleavage. As you're struggling to maintain your grip, you remember something, Noreen made one stop after the library before she came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, Noreen stepped into the fish market. You personally found that odd since Noreen was a vegetarian, you highly doubt that she ate fish. At the front desk of the market was a female landshark resembling an enormous and obese megalodon with pure black skin and long flowing golden red hair. For clothing she was wearing an apron along with nothing underneath besides a pair of blue jeans. \"Hi, Shego,\" says the landshark woman. \"Back from the library already.\" \"That's me, Nami,\" says Noreen. \"I'm here for the earthquake catfish you've been bragging about.\" Nami nods her head and roots around before taking out a container of demonic looking catfish that looked as big as blue whales. Noreen lowers her head to take a sniff at the catfish. \"Is the namazu fresh?\" asks the rhino woman. Nami lets out a scoff. \"It was swimming twenty minutes ago,\" says Nami. \"Geez. If you're not careful, Shego, you're going to spoil Delirium.\" \"Delirium?\" you ask to yourself. You take it that was the name of Noreen's pet. Now that made sense. Noreen was only at the fish store to buy pet food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present as you're watching Noreen unlock the door, you begin to wonder what kind of creature Noreen's pet is. It's obviously a carnivore, probably a fenrir, a chimeric beast or a Kellas cat. You know that Maddie and her husband own a gargoyle beast but you're not sure if they eat fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen opens the door and then yells out \"Delirium! Mommy's home.\" Noreen walks up to her front door and you look forward to see that on the table was a large plant resembling a purple tulip, except with blue tentacle like vines covered in spikes along with a large mouth with two maws filled with razor sharp teeth and a forked green tongue. You look in surprise. <i>That</i> was Delirium? Noreen's pet was a carnivorous plant? The plant lets out a slight shriek and you watch as Noreen takes out the fish she just bought and then tosses it to the plant who greedily devours it before Noreen strokes the plant on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver. That was one nasty looking creature. You really hope that Noreen has that thing on a human free diet. Noreen then puts her purse away and from your spot in her cleavage you see her pick up a feather dusty to do some cleaning. As Noreen is busy, you look around her place. There was a spider web print rug and a shelf with rather nightmarish looking stuffed animals on it. Then you look up to see a chandelier with candles that look like they have faces of agony. What was really creepy was that Noreen's sofa looked like a giant brain and her easy chair looked like a giant heart (the anatomy kind of heart). By her widescreen TV there was even a stack of horror movies. You then look into the kitchen to see that everything was painted in a pattern that looked like Beetlejuice's tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really gets your attention is Noreen's mantle. One photograph depicts Noreen with two of her friends. To her left side was a tan skinned behemoth woman, a monster resembling a thick skinned hippopotamus. The behemoth girl had purplish red hair worn in an afro/mullet style and was wearing a black leather jacket and shirt with a matching skirt that looked about ready to snap off. There was even a purple star tattoo on her left hip The behemoth woman appeared to have abnormally long fangs even for a hippo based monster. To the right of Noreen in the photograph was a greenish cyan skinned monster resembling an amphibious elephant with gills and webbed hands and tusks. She was a trunko, a sea cryptid resembling a cross between an elephant and a fish. The trunko girl had blond hair worn in spiked pigtails and was wearing heavy greenish black eyeshadow and lipstick, complete with a dark green dress resembling a trench coat. The behemoth and trunko were pachyderm based goth girls just like Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn and see a photograph of another wererhinoceros woman. She resembled Noreen except she was an albino white rhinoceros with long red hair reaching down to her generously sized rear. She also appeared to have a blue tattoo over her right eye that was shaped like a rhino's head. On her shoulder was a tan skinned human male who looked like he was in his late 20s to early 30s and had brown hair worn in a ponytail with a beard. That must've been Noreen's older sister, Whitney, and her husband. She looked like she was even bigger than Noreen. Next to that photograph was an older photograph of the sisters. In the photograph, Whitney didn't look that different except that she was missing her tattoo, but Noreen was only a child in the photograph. Whitney must've been <i>way</i> older than her sister. She looked old enough to be Noreen's mother in that photograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn and see a photograph that you thought depicted another of Noreen's relatives. She was a giant and fat wererhino with grayish green skin and a hunched back. From the shape and position of her horns, she resembled a Sumatran rhino. She had long reddish blonde hair and HUGE H-Cup breasts (in scale). From her appearance in the photograph, she looked 1175ft tall, even bigger than Noreen and Whitney. What was odd was that this blonde rhino woman was wearing a red tunic that looked like something a fairy would wear. In the photograph with the blonde rhino woman was a pencil-thin male spriggan who didn't even come up to her knee. The spriggan had white hair worn in a ponytail and a disfigured face. Like all spriggans he had split colored skin. The left side of his body was white while the right side of his body was black. He was wearing a similar tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Noreen pokes her left breast. \"You can stay there,\" she says. \"I don't mind. But don't distract me, I'm expecting company.\" You were shocked. You even look forward and see that Noreen was looking in a mirror when she spotted you in her cleavage. You let out a laugh. \"Sorry, Noree... er, Shego,\" you say. \"I kinda slipped and...\" \"Don't worry,\" says Noreen as she moves on to washing windows. \"I don't really care.\" You then look back at Delirium in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid of Delirium,\" says Noreen. \"She only eats bugs, fish and lizards.\" You let out a sigh. \"Say, Shego,\" you say. \"Is that Whitney in that photograph.\" You point to the white rhino woman. \"Yup,\" says Noreen. \"That's her. She's wound a bit too tight. Whitney works for the KDP.\" \"KDP?\" you ask. \"Is that like the KGB? Is your sister a secret agent?\" \"KDP stands for Kaiju Disarming Plant,\" says Noreen. \"It's a mental hospital. Whitney is the head orderly.\" You nod your head. \"And I take it, that's her husband on her shoulder.\" \"Xander,\" says Noreen. \"I don't like him that much though.\" You nod your head. He looks like the sly mastermind type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at the photograph with the blonde rhino woman. \"And that other rhino lady?\" \"That's my Mom, Susan Steranko,\" says Noreen. \"She works as a football coach at an all girl's school in Direopolis.\" You were surprised. That blonde rhino was her mom? She looked surprisingly beautiful given how old she'd have to be, taking Whitney's age into consideration. Noreen let out a sigh. \"She's an annoying busybody know-it-all who knows absolutely nothing about what she's talking about. And she's too stubborn to admit when she's wrong. Since Whitney doesn't want children, Mom is trying to push me down the altar as soon as possible. It's on my head and it's a pain in my ass.\" \"Uh-huh,\" you say. \"And where's the photograph of your dad?\" \"That's him in the photograph with Mom.\" Replies Noreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're surprised. There was no other wererhino in the photo with Susan. Only the spriggan man. Then you realize something... Noreen was half-spriggan!? Noreen's father looked like he was less than half the height of either of his daughters. You've seen some interspecies monster couples before. Maddie's husband was a gargoyle, you knew of a lesbian couple between a werewolf and a vampire but a wererhino married to a spriggan? They weren't even similar species and neither Whitney nor Noreen looked like they had fairy blood flowing through their veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Noreen,\" you say. \"Your dad is a spriggan. I thought he'd be another wererhino.\" \"Don't judge me,\" says Noreen. \"So I'm a hybrid, big fat fairy deal.\" You notice that Noreen's dad had a grim expression on his face. \"Would it kill him to smile?\" \"He <i>is</i> smiling in that picture,\" says Noreen. \"That's just how it looks with him. Dad's been in an ugly mood since Whitney was married.\" Ouch. You take it he didn't like Xander at all. \"What's your dad's name, Noreen?\" \"Grayson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat figured. Grayson. Makes sense. Whitney obviously sounded like \"white\" while Noreen sounded like \"noir\" the french word for \"black\". Suddenly the doorbell lets out an unearthly screaming ring that forces you to plug your ears. \"I gotta take this, Rick,\" says Noreen. \"Company showed up early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of company did Noreen mean as she answered the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noreen opens the door and you look forward from her cleavage and then look up to see the largest pair of breasts you ever seen. They made Noreen look flat chested by comparison. You then look further up to see the face of a grayish green wererhino blonde who utterly dwarfed Noreen in height. You immediately recognize her as Susan, Noreen's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noreen,\" says Susan as she forces Noreen into a hug. \"Look at you. You've really matured into a fine looking woman.\" Noreen grunts in pain and you gag. Not only are Noreen's breasts being squeezed together, crushing you, but you have Susan's even bigger boobs in your face and threatening to squish you. Thankfully Susan lets go of Noreen right before poking her in the left breast. \"You've finally got the Steranko chest,\" says Susan. \"It took you long enough. Did I tell you that my bosoms came in when I was little more than half your age. Didn't take Whitney that long to blossom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen simply rolls her eyes. \"It's good to see you too, Mom.\" Noreen looks down as her spriggan father, Grayson walked in. You could not believe it. Sure, Grayson was 300ft tall, so he was still a giant monster, but he was less than a third his daughter's size to say nothing of his height contrast with his wife. How did an ugly spud like him get his hands on that pachyderm statue? \"Hi Dad.\" Says Noreen. Grayson doesn't answer his daughter and you see he has a grim expression that looks frozen on his face, just like in the photo of him. Would it kill the guy to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pushes against Grayson with her foot. \"Grayson,\" she says forcefully. \"Say hello to your daughter.\" Grayson just lets out a grunt before he walks into the living room. \"I see he's in a good mood today.\" Says Noreen. What's surprising is that Noreen didn't sound like she was being sarcastic. Susan lets out an annoyed grunt. \"Sourpuss. Whitney and Xander have already been married for five years and he's still a grouch about it. But you can't blame him. I mean, when Whitney took the little guy to meet us, I didn't expect him to be... so microscopic.\" She said that last word in an almost condescending tone. You let out a groan and then Susan walks further into the house as Grayson takes a seat in the heart-shaped easy-chair and puts his fingers together like Sherlock Holmes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" says Susan. \"Hate what you've done with the place. It looks like the set of a horror movie.\" \"Please, take a seat Mom.\" Says Noreen. Susan takes one look at the couch and is disgusting. \"No thanks,\" she says. \"I'd feel really uncomfortable sitting on a couch that looks like a giant brain. Susan then notices Delirium and Delirium seems to hiss at her as Susan looks in surprise. \"What is it with you and those carnivorous plants anyway?\" Susan reaches towards one of Delirium's vines but Noreen stops her. \"No! Don't do that. She doesn't like having her vines touched.\" Delirium even growls at Susan, prompting the older were rhino to roll her eyes. \"You know,\" she says. \"That's a bad sign. I have a feeling that that plant is going to be the first of many. You turn 25 in four months, Noreen. The clock is ticking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen actually lets out an angry grunt. \"You're seriously going there again.\" \"In my opinion,\" says Susan, sounding as if she's giving an order. \"Being 25 and unmarried is a red flag.\" Noreen pounds her fist on the table, startling you from in between her breasts and Grayson just looks away while snapping his fingers to turn on the television. \"You always go on and on about that crap,\" says Noreen. \"Need I remind you, Whitney was much older than 25 when she married Xander and she's still more than young enough to...\" \"Except she put herself in a such a bad situation. Second in command of the KDP. She's not a nurse, she's a babysitter for a bunch of vegetables. I have nothing against hybrid kids, how do you think you got here? But Whitney doesn't want to be a mom. Heck, even if she did, who would look after the children while she's at work. A father the size of a toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes.\" you think to yourself. Now you see what Noreen was talking about. Since Whitney's in a position where she can't bring up a child even if she wanted to be a mom so it's on Noreen's shoulders as far as Susan's concerned. Annoying busybody was putting it mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you were surprised about was that Susan didn't notice you in her daughter's cleavage. What was she, blind? Then you remembered something. Wererhinos had terrible eyesight. One time you saw Noreen bend over on the library floor because she said she dropped a contact lens and in that photograph of Whitney, Whitney was wearing glasses. But from the looks of it, Susan didn't appear to be wearing either. You could understand that she's most likely too vain to wear glasses, but not contacts either? Obviously Noreen got her brains from her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen just rolls her eyes. \"Look,\" says Susan. \"I'm not that crazy about Xander myself, but at least Whitney is married. You don't even have a boyfriend. More than seventy different species of monster in this town and you can't find a date? I think you've been spending too much time in the library. You'll never bag a man that way. There's a beach nearby. From the looks of your skin, you could definitely use a trip there. I met your father on a beach.\" \"Because some beach bullies buried him up to his neck and you accidentally sat on his face.\" Says Noreen. In the background, it almost sounds like Grayson is laughing at that, but stops when Susan stares at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you manage to squeeze yourself out from between Noreen's boobs and gasp for air before Susan's ears twitch. \"What the?\" asks the older wererhino. Susan turns her head and squints her eyes before she reaches into her own cleavage and takes out a case for contact lenses. Once Susan has her contacts in, she notices you and looks in surprise. You gulp nervously and Noreen slaps herself in the face. \"And here comes the oil for the fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan gives Noreen a slight glare. \"And when were you going to tell me? You could've told me sooner before I made an ass of myself.\" You would make a wisecrack about that choice of words, but chose not to. \"Mom,\" says Noreen. \"Meet Rick.\" Hearing your name caused Grayson to move his eyes to face your direction without even turning his head as he gave a suspicious look. Susan meanwhile lowers her head and sneers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rick. I hope there's a good reason for you being in my daughter's cleavage. Are you Noreen's boyfriend?\" You were definitely not Noreen's boyfriend but would it be such a good idea to tell the truth in your position.Then again, nothing would do you any good since you're dealing with such an obvious windbag. Noreen seems to be just as curious to your response as her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you tell her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noreen was entering a strange building that looked like it was entirely made out of stained glass and yet it didn't look like a church since the interior from what you could see on the inside was decorated with red spots on the walls, floor and ceiling that resembled bloodstains. Then you see the sign on the top of the establishment and from the look of it, it read \"The Bloody Mona\". Noreen must've been entering a goth bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the bar there was heavy metal music blaring that forced you to cover your ears in pain. From all around, the bar seemed to be filled with monsters dressed in gothic and even emo attire. Mostly there were BBW goth girls that looked like they were built just like Noreen. There was even a heavy metal-esque stage made out of plastic skulls that had an obese golden furred were jaguar girl dressed in blood red leather doing some kind of exotic dance as all male monsters in the house were staring at her monstrous booty. You even get a slight nosebleed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Noreen walking her way towards the counter and from your position in Noreen's cleavage, the barkeeper was actually a male monster. From the looks of it, he was a skull faced and horned ghost of some sort wearing a red chain-covered cloak that obscured the rest of his body and appeared to have his face frozen in a screaming motion. \"Afternoon, Shego,\" says the ghost bartender in an echoing voice. \"What can I interest you in today.\" \"Black coffee, please.\" Replies Noreen. The ghost nods her head as Noreen takes a seat down on two bar stools that make a shrieking noise from her massive weight. Then Noreen reaches into her purse to take out one of her library books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you would bring a book to a bar.\" Said a voice behind Noreen. Then you hear the sound of more metal because two monsters, from the sounds of it, as gigantic and heavy as Noreen, sat to the sides of the rhino giantess. To the right was a greenish cyan monster girl who resembled an amphibious elephant with tusks, gills and webbed hands. She was a type of sea cryptid called a trunk and had blonde hair in spiked big tails with greenish black makeup and a dark green trench coat like dress. To Noreen's left was a behemoth girl, a monster resembling a very thick skinned giant hippopotamus. She had tan skin, purplish red hair in an afro/mullet style and a tight black leather jacket and skirt. She also had a purple star tattoo on one of her huge hips and abnormally long and sharp fangs even if she was a hippo-based monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Shego.\" Says the behemoth with a smile as you look in fear at her enormous teeth. \"Hey Dusk,\" says Shego to the behemoth girl right before turning to the trunko girl. \"Hi Morose. Thought I'd see you here. Good afternoon.\" Morose, the trunko, just lets out a scoff and sips beer through her elephantine nose. \"If you like good afternoons. Oooh, is that the Indigo Emperor? Mind if I take a look when you're done.\" \"No,\" says Noreen. \"But if I were you, Morose, I'd double check your underwear drawer for your library card.\" Dusk lets out a laugh. \"Oh please,\" says the behemoth woman. \"My folks set me up on a blind date with a human boy and it took him three days to get out of <i>my</i> underwear drawer. That's what they get for daring to ride the pachyderm express.\" Morose lets out a snicker and Noreen gives a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, Honey,\" says Dusk. \"When are you going to get a BF and get old lady Susan off your back.\" \"Don't get me started on that airhead, Dusk,\" says Noreen. \"She's in a rush to find some meathead to put a baby in my belly. It's tiresome.\" From your spot in Noreen's cleavage, you overhear the conversation and it would seem Noreen isn't getting along well with her mom. \"Yeah,\" says Morose as she sprays beer into her mouth with her trunk and the bartender hands Noreen her coffee. \"Like you could be a mom, Shego. I mean, have you looked at us? We barely look like we're out of high school. BTW, there's a concert in the park tomorrow. Our fave band has finally hit Scream Town.\" Noreen's ears twitch and you see that she's suddenly very interested. \"You mean the Astounding Ethereals? I am so there.\" Dusk lets out a scoff. \"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be building a band that will make those rockers sound like a church choir. You're welcome to join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three pachyderm goth girls laugh at that and Noreen's laughter causes her breasts to shake until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All around you, Noreen's breasts rippled. The laughter of the goth queen and her friends was like thunder that pounded against your ears, as you were squished and cajoled by two massive mountains of fat on either side of you, almost like you were trapped in a colossal moon bounce. And as she laughed and your surroundings jiggled, your body became loose and you quickly descended down the crack of her cleavage until you were just about to pop out of her shirt and fall hundreds of feet to the ground below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shego! Shego!\" you screamed in panic. You doubted she would hear you now when she couldn't before, but you were desperate. Even if you survived the fall--fat chance--the club was so crowded that you could be crushed underfoot without anyone even knowing! The edge of her canyon loomed perilously before you. \"SHEGO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped out of her cleavage like a cork from a wine bottle and plummeted downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*plop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit her coffee like a pebble dropped down a well. For a few seconds, only bubbles, nigh invisible to the gigantic, monstrous women around you, rose to the surface of Noreen's drink. Then, taking a powerful gasp for air, you surfaced from the dark depths of her coffee. You survived? You survived! You couldn't believe it! Old Man Reaper wasn't coming to claim Rick Rowling today! No siree, Bob! Sure you couldn't get the taste of bad coffee out of your mouth, it was surprisingly cold, and the smell of the drink was like an all-out assault on your nose, but still! Now all you had to do was get out of the giant cup of coffee before Noreen accidentally ate you alive! ... Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously you began to paddle to the side of the cup. At the same time, the goth girls' laughter began to die down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Morose said, a wicked thought coming to her. \"If she wants to be a grandma so bad, you know who Shego's mom should convince to ask her out?\" Morose asked with a smirk. \"Little Ricky Rowlings! I'm sure she'd walk down the aisle if he was the one asking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so shocked by this you actually stopped swimming and accidentally gulped down a mouthful of overpriced coffee. What.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen scoffed. \"Pfft, as if.\" She tried to keep her contractually obligated look of sullenness plastered on her face, but you could actually see a slight blush come over her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Mor,\" Dusk said, a playful gleam shining in her eyes. \"You really think a human like him would go out with... <i>a man-eater</i>?!\" Dusk asked with mock disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the coffee, you remained still... WHAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Dusk,\" Noreen said, her blush rising. \"You know I don't like people mentioning that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Little Ricky would be too scared that Shego would want to put <i>him</i> in her belly instead of a baby,\" Dusk went on, ignoring her friend's embarrassment and joining Morose in a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Noreen groaned. \"Yes,\" she grumbled in an annoyed tone, \"I used to eat humans. It was a phase. Everyone did it in Terrordale, and my sister helped me kick the habit, now can we please stop talking about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, c'mon, Dusk,\" Morose said. \"We've tormented the poor girl enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dusk said, \"I suppose I can't hold it over her head now that she's joined a more civilized society. You're still welcome to join my band, my carnivorous friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen sighed in annoyance. \"I swear, I will never eat another human again so long as I live, if only to be spared your jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your coffee prison, you let out a sigh of relief. You were certainly glad to hear that. Granted, not as glad as you would've been if you had heard her say, \"I have never eaten a human in my life. Period.\" But you'd take what you could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you were yanked out of your thoughts as the coffee began raging around you in waves like an ocean in the midst of a storm. It took you a second to realize what was happening, but when you did, you felt your heart drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. Oh no. Oh nonononononononono!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoreen raised the coffee to her mouth. In front of you, her black lips parted, revealing the gigantic pink carpet of her tongue, teeth as big as houses, and a black void in the back that led to certain doom to all that fell down it. Before you could do anything to save yourself, a tidal wave of coffee swept you up and carried you into the vast cavern of her waiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHEGO!\" you screamed. \"SHEGO DON'T SWALLOW! SHEGO IT'S RICK! PLEASE STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use, the coffee was sucked down her gullet like a whirlpool, and you were caught in the pull. You frantically paddled against the current. It couldn't end like this! It couldn't--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink walls of Noreen's throat squeezed you down hundreds of feet amidst of waterfall of coffee. You thought the fall would never end, but then you and the coffee landed in her stomach with a splash. Your heart beating frantically, you looked around your surroundings. You thought her stomach was huge on the outside, but inside it was a pitch black ocean that stretched on as far as I the eye could see. The smell of bad coffee mingled with the chewed remains of giant food that floated around you like islands made of pepperoni pizza, double cheeseburgers, and, seemingly, an entire chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. She ate you. The entire reason you moved to this town was to avoid being eaten by giant monsters! And now you were nothing more than an unknown crumb swallowed by the Queen of the Goths. You needed to get out of here fast, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Noreen's stomach rumbled deafeningly, and her stomach acids began to churn.

But we don't sign out those books to just anyone because we had a bit of an... accident a few years ago. There was a werewolf chick who wanted to sign out one of the books, but she was being very rude. Mom got annoyed with her, so she banned her from the library. Later that night, the werewolf broke in and stole one of the books. Mom caught her and tried to get the book back, but there werewolf cast a spell. There was this bright light, and when it went away, the werewolf was gone. No one's seen her since. Because of that, Mom restricts the spellbooks heavily to prevent it from happening again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him, surprised. You only knew that Ororo was protective of the books.

Pauline then took off her glasses and squinted to get a good look at exactly what she saw in the sky. \"Angel?\" she asked. Pauline blew on her glasses and desperately tried to clean them just to make sure that she wasn't losing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry Rose was walking back from home from the liquor store, drunk off of her woolly booty and she paused and let out a sigh as she sat on a bench. As Cherry stopped to drink more cheap wine, she looked up and saw Angel flying by. The shock of seeing the flying tigress was enough to sober Cherry up. Cherry was so dumbfounded that she took her bottle of wine and poured it into an open sewer grate by her feet. The wine froze instantly and blocked the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Howler was outside shoveling snow and then looked up and dropped her jaw at the sign of Angel in the sky. \"I was beginning to wonder why they called her \"Angel\" when she had such a toxic mouth. Maybe this is why.\" Penny even took out her phone to snap a photograph of what was transpiring. Angel saw the flash and gave a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a Thanksgiving Day parade float. Things couldn't get any worse.\" You climb up Angel's tail and up to her ear. \"Angel,\" you say. \"You should never say that things couldn't get worse. Things always get worse when you say that.\" \"Bug off!\" yells Angel who can only watch helplessly as Eris and Gabriella fly towards her. Eris gives a huff and a puff. \"I'm out of shape.\" She says. Gabriella then turns her head. \"Excuse me, Eris,\" she says to her maid. \"But you're not the one wearing a corset underneath.\" You overhear this and blink before looking at Gabriella's ponderous belly. \"She's wearing a corset?\" you ask. \"If that's how fat Gabriella is <i>with</i> the corset on, what happens when it comes off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you give the matter any more thought, you hear the sound of a trumpet playing. Gabriella reaches into one of her nylons and pulls out a phone. \"Hello?\" she asks. \"Oh, good day to you, V.V. What?! Good googley moogley! Angel! Bad news!\" Angel gives a growl. \"Whoop de doo,\" she says sarcastically. \"And I've had nothing but good news all day. And if you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic! What is it now!\" Gabriella gives a look of worry. \"V.V. just called me and said there's about to be a...\"</span></div></div>",

Pauline was humming to herself as she held up a graphic novel she had no doubt she planned to check out of the library. \"I'm going to enjoy reading this issue of Dawn Breakable.\" Pauline then noticed Ororo crouching. \"Ororo?\" she asked. Ororo blew on her finger and then gestured to the book. Pauline, not understanding the significance of the situation, gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?! Ororo! Some joker put fireworks in your book. I'll bet it was that troublemaker Alex. One of this days, that obnoxious sphinx is going to get run out of town for all her nasty pranks.\" Pauline walks up to the book and you shake your arms. \"Pauline! No!\" Jasper then realizes something. \"Wait,\" he says. \"Nemean lions like Pauline are indestructible.\" Ororo gives a snort before speaking to her step son. \"Indestructible and immune to magic aren't the same thing!\" At this moment, Pauline reaches the book of Chaos and calmly shuts it, but then it spews a bolt of magic in her face that forces Pauline to close her eyes. Pauline growls and drops the book at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline!\" you yell. Pauline gets on her knees and begins to breathe in and breathe out. \"Are you alright?\" you ask. Pauline nods her head and then picks you up. \"I'm fine, Rick. It takes a lot to hurt a Nemean lioness. My mom once dropped one of her earrings into a boiling pot of noodles and casually fished it out as if it was nothing. Then there was a time my cousin Maggie wasn't paying attention when she was chopping meat and broke her cleaver on her wrist.\" Pauline laughs to herself and then holds her stomach as Ororo gets up. You climb Pauline's hair as she gets up and you see that for some reason she seems taller. In fact, she seems to be twice as tall as Ororo. Ororo and her family look up in surprise. \"Are you wearing high heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline gives a blink. \"High heels? I don't even wear shoes. Ororo, what is...?\" Suddenly, Pauline grunts and from the looks of it, the book placed a curse on her. She was growing bigger and bigger by the second. You stand on her shoulder and you see the black fur-covered landscape extending. The strands of lion hair were already as big as trees to you. Now they were becoming as big as skyscrapers as you hold on tight to Pauline's hair. Pauline is in seconds bigger than any of the book shelves in the library and several of the other patrons gasp. One teenaged gargoyle even takes off his headphones and looks up in fear at Pauline who is grunting and crouching down because her back was touching the ceiling. \"H-Help, m-me.\" Grunts Pauline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls then begin to crack as Ororo bites her lip. \"Oh no,\" she says. \"Don't tell me she's getting bigger. My insurance policy just expired. As the walls crack, so does the ceiling and in seconds, the growing Pauline manages to smash right through the roof and screams as she gets bigger and bigger. Outside, several spectators look in shock. The normally stoic Noreen and irascible Angel look up and they both look as if their eyes are about to pop out of their heads as their jaws are dropped. Chief Dinkley pulls up her police car and her hundreds of eyes focus on what's happening. \"Good grief,\" says the chief. \"This is bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Pauline stops growing, she has reached a height of...</span></div></div>",

The chubby rattlesnake-haired woman was humming to herself as she was slithering by. \"Excuse me, Ororo,\" says Maddie. \"I hate to tell you this, but I think somebody or something is making a lot of noise in your library. It almost sounds like somebody is shooting fireworks.\" Ororo gives a growl and Gordon slaps his face. \"We know,\" grunts the wife of the couple. \"Maddie, this is a bad time. Hit the road.\" Maddie gives a blink that's visible behind her sunglasses. \"With what? Come to think about it, why would I want to hit the road with anything? Phyllis spends a fortune trying to keep the roads in one piece around here. Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie noticed the Book of Chaos spewing out fireworks. \"Ororo,\" says Maddie. \"I think your book is on fire.\" You give a gasp. \"Maddie!\" you yell. \"Do not go near that spell book! If you know what's good for you, you'll stay away.\" Maddie however, didn't understand. \"But Rick,\" she says. \"Books <i>are</i> good for you.\" You let out a groan. Sometimes you wonder how Maddie could possibly be your boss. She was a humongous ditz who didn't understand the concept of metaphors. The snakes on her head even hiss in exasperation. When somebody's hair has more sense than the person under it, it was a bad sign. Maddie slithered closer to the book and a jolt of magic struck her and made her yell. \"Maddie!\" you and Jasper yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gives a cough and her glasses slip, forcing everyone around to cover their eyes before Maddie fixes them. \"It's alright,\" says Maddie. \"The glasses are back where they belong. Ororo, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but I'd say that book is too dangerous for you to keep in the library.\" Ororo snorted angrily. \"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous!\" Maddie blinks. \"I don't think that I could live without a brain. Urk!\" Maddie then felt her head in pain as veins appeared on her forehead and her snake hair gave a hiss. Maddie gave a dazed look and slithered in a zigzag pattern and then a strange expression appeared on her face. She then slithered down a hallway and took three books off of the shelf. One of them appeared to be a book on history of the world, another appeared to be a book on physics and the last of them appeared to be a book on engineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie?\" you ask. \"Are you feeling alright.\" Maddie then turns to face you. \"I am feeling quite alright, Ricardo. I wish only to check out the literature I've selected and leave peacefully.\" You and Ororo blink but Ororo checks the gorgon giantess out with no problem and Maddie leaves, pausing to read as she slithers away. You were beginning to wonder if that spell had any effect on Maddie at all. Should you check and see if she's alright?</span></div></div>",

You walk under her wooden fence and approach her as she tends to the vegetables. \"Hi Freya.\" you say. Her head perks at the sound and she scans the ground until she sees you. \"Rick!\" she says and stops to pick you up. \"How are you?\" As she makes small talk you can feel her eyes all over you. Freya is a little overly fond of human men, and you seem to be her favorite. \"I'm doing great. I just decided to drop by and say hello.\" you tell her. She giggles and her cheeks go red. \"I'm glad to live in a neighborhood where a cute little guy like you can stop by and say hi.\" she says. \"Your garden is coming along nicely. Everything looks delicious.\" you tell her. Even though its perpetually Autumn here she can still grow many vegetables that are usually associated with other seasons. Some still grow faster though. This must be due to whatever magic locked the seasons. Her sister Latanya has similar success with her flower garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to have a snack?\" Freya asks and gestures to her crops. For a garden that fits in her front yard she has a lot to choose from. Then again she does have a big yard. \"Thats sounds great.\" you say and scan the garden, looking for something to snack on. She's got giant versions of many vegetables like carrots, eggplants, onions, tomatoes, and more. There are also vegetables native to the monster world that you don't really recognize. There are some that are a strange dark blue color and others that look like black spheres with spikes. You decide to hold off on trying the monster vegetables, but you definitely plan on having some one day just to try them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some tomato?\" you suggest. \"Sounds good!\" Freya says and picks one from its vine. She then takes you and the tomato to her kitchen and cuts a piece small enough for you. Freya's vegetables (the ones you've actually had) are always delicious. They're much better than the ones in the human world. As you gobble your tomato down Freya munches n the rest of it. \"Care for a drink?\" she asks. You nod expectantly. Like her sister Latanya, Freya has an udder capable of producing milk, but her's makes strawberry milk. You don't know why but its so good you don't care. Freya stands up and lifts her udder to the table.  \"Would you like to drink straight from the source?\" she asks seductively. She inches closer and her udder brushes against you, causing her to moan slightly. \"I'll take a glass.\" you saw reluctantly. Part of you wouldn't mind taking her up on that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya finds a human sized glass and squeezes a small portion of pink colored milk into it. You drink it up and she giggles slightly. \"Would you like some more?\" she asks. \"That would be grea-\" you say until a shadow looms over you. Her udder is right above you and she squeezes a large amount (to you) of milk right on you. By the time she's done you're drenched. \"Oh, sorry!\" she says but also snickers. \"I think we should get you cleaned up.\" she says and lifts you to her face. Suddenly her grips loosens and you fall down the into the neck hole of her shell. As you tumble down the inside you see that on the inside her body is still that of a minotaur, but is still attached to the shell in certain places. While her under belly on the outside has a set of boobs, she also has a set inside as well. You wonder if one is more sensitive than the other. When you hit the bottom you bounce on the area where her udder hole is. Unfortunately its to small to slip out of. \"Freya! Help me out of here!\" you call up.

As you wonder further in you notice the large birds stalking you as you clime over the root systems of odd trees. You notice a large three legged crow fly at you when you duck under a few more exposed roots. As the bird try's to get at you squaking at you you hear a yawn. \"What the heck.\" Says a tired feminine voice as vines wrap around the bird and throw it away from your location. \"What ever is under me could you please come out.\" You crawl out from under the trees roots to see a woman's head looking down at you. \"So who are you?\" The woman (you assume Mabel) asks. You hold out your hand hand you introduce your self. \"Rick Rowlings pleasure to meet you miss.\" She waves you off and yawns again. \"Listen if your going to take a walk in the woods bring a friend and you won't be bird food.\" She then grabs you and begins to move back to the forest's entrence and places you on the side walk before moving back into the woods. Chief Dinkley notice you and pulls her cruiser over and steps out. \"Is every thing alright Rick?\" She says nervously you nod. \"Ya I'm fine but I was attacked in the woods by some crow thing attack me.\" She looks angry but looks at the woods. \"Their some feral monsters called a yatagerasu they are a pain to humans but they usually leave other monsters alone.\" You then ask about the girl and she sighs. \"That was Mabel she's so tired by the nature of the town that she comes off slightly self-centered but she can be really nice if she's not in autumn avenue.\" You sort of expected that being the how plants act during different seasons but maybe her activity not her personality. Your about to go back in there to talk to her when Dinkley grabs you. \"Your not going in without a guide or else you could get hurts do I'd feel horrible if that happened.\" You nod as she carries you back through the heavy trees but oddly enough you still could not identify Mabel from the other trees but Dinkley goes up to one vermillion tree and knock on it. \"Mabel please wake up you have a guest.\"the tree shift and bend before Mabel's body bends and appears out of the trees center. \"What is it officer I haven't done anything.\" She was really drowsy as her voice was whisper quiet for monsters anyway. \"Rick here wants to talk to you.\" Your about to speak when Mabel's eyelids begin to droop. \"Is there anyway for you to stay awake?\" She then puts her hand to her chin and thinks. \"Ya if ya move me to springtime street or summer side.\" \"Well then I'll ask Phyllis and be done with it..\" You yell at the nearly asleep mandrake who smiles. You and Dinkley walk out of the forest as Dinkely asks. \"Do you think Phyllis will go with if.\" But after she says that you notice.</span></div></div>",

Of course, this was no ordinary bus stop. There were several other humans waiting for Hera Hind, the Ceryneian Hind who acts as the taxi in Screamtown. Phyllis appointed her in charge of human transportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear thunderous foot steps and suddenly Hera appears in front of the bus stop. \u201cAll aboard that\u2019s going aboard,\u201d says the hind giantess. All the humans board different areas on Hera\u2019s body and Hera then looks down at you. \u201cWhere you riding today kid?\u201d she asks. One thing about Hera, she let humans choose where they got to ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up towards Hera\u2019s belly and see her belly button up ahead. You decide to climb into the naval this time. It was as deep as a cave and several humans were bundled up in the fear. As Hera takes off you wonder how she could have a belly so big when the rest of her body is so muscular. Soon Hera reaches the terminal and you exit her naval as you descend down to the snow covered streets and a chill of wind fills the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold onto your coat tight and shiver as you walk through the snow. The snow piled up like small mountains to humans and Winter Way was so cold that going outside dressed improperly could be practically lethal. Most of the monsters that lived here were furry monsters that were used to the cold. You had to get inside to escape this cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first monster that came to mind to visit in the winter part of town was Gabriella Gallops, a giant unicorn (or alicorn if you\u2019re gonna be technical) who was a powerful sorceress. Some people think she\u2019s the one responsible for the town\u2019s weird weather. Fortunately Gabriella was very friendly and you think the pot-bellied pony might actually have a crush on you. She said you could come to her citadel anytime and her maid, Eris the gryphon would let you in if she was too bust with spells and potions to do it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was your big sister, Olga. Olga was a hippogriff that hatched out of an egg your parents found long before you were born. Sure, Olga teased you and used you as a seat cushion but she was a good sister regardless. You remember one time she trapped a bully picking on you in her beak and threatened to swallow him if he didn\u2019t leave you alone. Perhaps you should pay your big sis a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you were kinda thirsty and in need of a nice hot meal. Fortunately, there was a restaurant called Narnia nearby run by Pauline, a Nemean lioness sommelier. Despite being a lion based monster, Pauline didn\u2019t eat humans but mainly because humans give her horrible gas. In fact, her cousin-in-law was a human who lived in Dreadberry. Maybe you could see if the food there is any good. You hear the wine got a good review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you heard about the yeti fortuneteller V.V. who lived in this side of the town. You never used to believe in fortunetelling but when live in a monster town and your older sister is a giant bird with a literal horse\u2019s ass, you figured anything was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you could do some mountain climbing. You heard Phyllis say that there were hot springs up the mountain, but climbing up all that snow would probably be a bad idea without a monster. Still, you\u2019d like to know what kind of monsters lived up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as long as you didn\u2019t run into that weresheep jerk Cherry. She is the only resident in the town to hate humans. Last time you ran into her, she spat at you for no reason and you were stuck to a loogie the size of an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bracing yourself once again for the cold you begin the trek to the unicorn's home. Its a little bit of a chore to get there with the snow, but thats true of most places in Winter Way. You press on and eventually reach the massive doors of the citadel. There's a huge door knocker shaped like a unicorn's head way above you, and a similar human sized one down at your height. Gabriella is quite fond of humans so she installed one for them. Grabbing hold of it you knock on the door a couple of times and wait. You assume this door is magical seeing as how the smaller door knocker works just as well as the giant one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after knocking the huge doors open and standing there wearing a black maid outfit is a fat gryphon with the lower body of a pale lioness and white feathers on her upper body. She looks around before looking down and spotting you. \"Oh, hello Rick!\" she says as she stoops down to offer you a talon. You climb aboard her her hand and she stands back up. \"Have you come to see Miss Gabriella?\" she asks as she closes the door. \"Yeah, I was in the area so I decided to stop by.\" you say. \"Well I'm sure she'll be happy that you braved the snow to see her.\" the gryphon says. You bet she will. Gabriella is very fond of humans, but you suspect she may be especially interested in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEris walks down a long hallway and stops by a door that larger than the rest. She knocks several times but there's no answer. She knocks again before opening it slightly to peek inside. You see Gabriella there standing by a desk with an open book in front of her. She's surrounding by potions and vials and seems to be absorbed in her work. Eris backs away from the door and brings you to her face. \"She appears to be a bit busy. You can come spend time with me until she finishes if you'd like.\" she offers. \"Or you can go and try to get her attention yourself.\" You think about your options and decide to...</span></div></div>",

There are parchments and empty potion bottles littering the floor. You also see a couple of scorch marks, presumably from some random spells. You can hear her muttering and writing things down as she stands at her desk. Soon you reach her and stare up. She truly is huge, and you can barely see past her big belly, not to mention her massive breasts. From what you can actually see of her face she looks to be concentrating hard. Eris was right, she really is engrossed in her work. You try to think of how you will get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gabriella readjusts her feet and you see the bottom of her gown coming toward you. You dive to the floor to avoid being swept away and end up rolling underneath. When you look up you see the giant unicorn's huge ass, clad in a blue thong. You can't help but get lost in this scene before you hear a loud clopping to your left. Suddenly you remember the giant hooves that could crush you like a bug. In a mad dash you head for the bottom of her gown and lift it up to escape. Meanwhile, at that moment Gabriella lets off a spell she's been experimenting with. The spell bounces off the walls of the room and heads right for you. Can you get out of the way?</span></div></div>",

It was right in that moment, when the spell was only a few seconds away, that you remember the muscles in your legs were still existent and unparalyzed and pushed them off the ground, your arms coming over your head as you tuck and roll (or throw, in this case) yourself to the right as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust behind, you can hear the whistle of the ball lightning fly past the spot where you once stood, twinkling down the rest of the hall.

What was it for, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cure for hunger!\" She replies, the familiar pep in her voice coming back as she returns to the spell book on her desk. \"Nothing complete, not even an absolute cure, I mean, but a nice temporary treatment for anybody who's really starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...damn.\" You mutter, impressed. \"How's it coming along, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that beam I'd just shot off was a very primordial incantation, but so far, I've got the basic skeleton in order.

When you reach the entrance of the huge building you head through the smaller human door to the side. Once inside you feel the comforting warmth and look around. The entrance area has large stand where the greeter takes the customers. There is already a couple being taken care of in the monster area. You walk around their massive feet head over to the area where the human patrons are taken care of and ring the bell. A few seconds later the ground shakes and you look up to see a giant vampire peering own at you. \"Hey there!\" she says with a smile and reaches down to pick you up. \"Which section would you like sir?\" she asks as she carries you. \"The human section please.\" you answer. This restaurant has three different sections. There's one where humans and monsters can eat together, one for only monsters so they don't have to watch where they walk, and one just for humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire reaches the human section which, not surprisingly, is the smallest one. Its tucked away in the corner of the restaurant but is by no means any less comfortable. Its pretty much a miniature version of the rest of the place. \"I'll be back in a few minutes to take your order.\" she says and sets you down at a one person table where a menu is waiting. You open it up and look through the choices. Its almost all human food like pizza, pasta, and stuff like that. There are also a few monster dishes that are served in human size for anyone who would like it. The menus in the other sections are similar. The monster section serves human food in giant portions and the combined section serves everything. You scan the menu, seeing some good looking food. You're thinking of having something with dinosaur meat, which is a pretty common monster food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you decide on your order a shadow appears over you and you look up expecting to see your vampire server. Instead you find that its a fat Nemean lioness with black fur and glasses. She's Pauline, the owner of the place. The other patrons look to see who's come but then go back to their meals. You couldn't feel her approach because this section of the restaurant has a specially made floor. Its been enchanted to prevent monsters from making the ground rumble so they don't cause the customers to drop any food. You're pretty sure that was Gabriella's work. Pauline gestures her paw toward you and you nod, telling her its okay. She then picks you up and steps back so as not to disturb the other humans. \"Hello Rick, how have you been?\" she asks. \"I've been doing good. I was a little hungry do I decided to stop by the best place in town.\" you answer. She smiles and rubs your head with a giant furred finger. \"Thats my favorite little human.\" she says. Pauline is pretty nice to humans and doesn't eat them since they upset her stomach. When you first came to town you got lost in the monster section of the store and Pauline accidentally sat on you. This incident allowed you to get to know her a little and now you're closer to her than any other human in town. You come here often and like she said you're one of her favorite customers. Pauline then...</span></div></div>",

She passes by your vampire server and taps her on the shoulder. \"This human will be eating with me, so don't worry about taking his order.\" she says. The vampire nods and continues her work. Pauline carries you toward the back of the restaurant and enters a room that appears to be her office. \"We'll be eating in here if thats okay.\" she tells you. \"Sounds good.\" you say. \"Its like getting the VIP treatment.\" She scratches your head and chuckles. \"Well you are my favorite little human.\" she says. She then sets you down her desk and starts to head back out. \"I'm having dinosaur lasagna. Is that okay with you?\" she asks. \"Yeah, I was planning on having dinosaur anyway.\" you tell her and she exits to get the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pauline is gone you look around the office. Its pretty typical, with lots of documents and some file cabinets. She must handle a lot of paperwork. On the same desk as you is a framed picture of Pauline with another Nemean lion, this one with white fur and just as big as her. You wonder which of her relatives it is. You know she has a cousin in Dreadberry serving as the sheriff. You also know that her cousin's also married to a human. It makes you feel good that even outside Scream Town there are monsters living in peace with humans. You imagine he's not as safe as he would be here though. There's another picture with lots of monsters in it, all of them different kinds of cats. It must be her family. There are Nemean lions, manticores, splintercats, hellcats, cait siths, and even a mer-lion or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scan the room the door opens and Pauline enters with a large plate. She places it on a table nearby and moves you to the table as well. On the plate is a rather large helping of lasagna. It looks just like human food, but its got dinosaur in it instead of beef. Pauline sits down and cuts off a small piece for you and provides you with human  sized utensils. \"Dig in.\" she says with a smile. You start eating and look up at her. \"Awesome as always.\" you tell her. \"Your place has the best food.\" She answers after swallowing her own bite of food. \"Thanks, and I gotta say thanks for staying put. We don't want you getting lost and ending up under my rump again.\" she says. \"That sure was a strange first impression.\" You grin up at her. \"Well its a fantastic rump.\" you say, which is true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I noticed the pictures on your desk. Is that your family?\" you ask. \"Oh yeah.\" she answers. \"Pretty big group of cats huh? I'm lucky enough to be one of the Nemean lions of the family. It comes in handy being pretty much invulnerable.\" You continue to eat as she talks. \"I think the only non-cat is my cousin Maggie's husband Neil. Maggie is the white lion in the photo over there.\" You thought so. \"Do they have any trouble in Dreadberry being a couple?\" you ask. \"Not really. Maggie is the sheriff so that helps. I do know that lots of monsters there would love to eat him though. Maggie's mom doesn't like him at all either.\" Pauline says. The two of you keep talking and then...</span></div></div>",

It's a common mistake, but seismosaurus has a much milder flavor compared to other sauropods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh. She sure had a taste for dinosaurs. \"So,\" says Pauline with a purr. \"Are you doing anything this weekend, Rick?\" \"Me?\" you ask with a blush. \"No, no. Maddie doesn't need me at the bakery this weekend since she's visiting her sick mother, so I guess I'm not doing anything.\" Pauline gives a purr and leans forward onto her desk as she has her behind in the air shaking. Her breasts are right in front of you and each one looks big enough for you to live on. You look up and see the lioness showing you her sexy fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" Pauline says. \"There's a new movie that comes out this Friday at the cinema downtown.\" \"I heard,\" you say. \"Kappa Gaidan, that new action film. It got a good review; almost as many stars as Gargoyles of the Galaxy.\" Pauline nods her head again. \"You know,\" she says. \"I'm not doing much this weekend. How would...?\" You pop your eyes in surprise. \"Are you asking me out?\" Pauline lets out a purr. \"So,\" she says. \"Is it a date.\" You quickly think it over and smile. \"It's definitely a date.\" Pauline purrs and then scratches the top of your head before blowing you a kiss. \"See you Friday night.\" Says the lioness before she turns around and shakes her booty. You definitely couldn't wait for Friday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the weekend comes and on Friday night, you're getting ready for your date by applying on some cologne when you get a call telepathic message from Phyllis. \"Looks like somebody is in for a good night.\" You gasp and jump back. \"Phyllis!\" you yell. \"Don't do that!\" \"My mistake,\" says the Lovecraftian voice in your mind. \"I'm an Old One, that's how we say hello. So, who's the lucky lady.\" \"Pauline.\" You reply. \"Ah,\" says Phyllis. \"The lady lion. Good choice. Your odds are good. Her cousin has been married to a human for twenty years. Good luck Rick Romeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and then you hear flapping and a thump before you turn to see a big blue eagle's eye looking into your window smugly. \"Hey there Little Bro.\" \"Olga,\" you say with a sigh as you adjust your jacket. \"What do you want, Featherbrain.\" Your sister just lets out a laugh. \"Oh, I heard about your little date. It's gonna be hard seeing the movie when your girlfriend is using you as a seat cushion.\" \"She's not my girlfriend,\" you say. \"Yet. And she only sat on me once. She isn't a freak like you.\" \"Still, I didn't expect you to be a cat person.\" You then give a smug grin. \"Technically, her species is related to yours. You're basically a cousin to a gryphon and gryphons are classified as birds <i>and</i> cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga rolls her eye. \"Low blow. You do know that Nemean lions are one of the top 10 most predatory monsters to humans in all of Mons Terra, right? Quite a brave risk. Of course, if Pauline does swallow you, it could give her a wind strong enough to blow down a brick wall.\" \"You'd know, you're <i>full</i> of hot air. After all, you're the older one and you're still single. Doesn't Mom keep asking when you're gonna be ready to lay eggs.\" \"Watch it, Rick,\" says Olga. \"Remember, if you weren't my brother, I could eat you with one gulp. Anyhoo, good luck on your date, Cassanova.\" You secretly stick your tongue out as that horse bird flies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a knocking and smile. That must've been Pauline. You rush to the door, all ready for your date and open up as Pauline lets out a purr. \"My,\" she says. \"Aren't you one hot tamale.\" You look in awe because Pauline had dressed up as well, which you found remarkable because she usually goes around naked.

The furry black mountains make perfect shelter from the cold and Pauline's Black Widow costume stops you from falling out. You wonder if Pauline is taking you back to Narnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're right here,\" says your lioness date. \"Home sweet home.\" You look forward to see a good looking house that looked like it was made of jagged rocks in the shape of a miniature castle, fitting with the whole lion thing. You let out a whistle. \"Amazing.\" You say. Pauline smiles. \"I like to think so.\" Pauline walks into her home and places you on the coffee table as she puts some wood in the fireplace, giving you a good few of her jiggling, spandex clad feline booty. You actually wouldn't mind if she accidentally sat on you again with that perfect feline figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look and see several paintings, including one of a bear holding hundreds of balloons and another one of a unicorn in front of a burning mountain. You then notice Pauline's closet and see something amazing. You wonder why she'd even have a clothing closet since she's naked most of the time, but inside the closet you see several costumes, including a Wonder Woman costume, a Spider-Woman outfit, a Black Canary costume and even a Batwoman outfit. \"Wow,\" you say. \"I never thought of you as someone who'd be into human Comic Books, Pauline.\" Pauline lets out a purr. \"Neil is the one who introduced me to them. Though it took me a while with the small print.\" You let out a laugh as Pauline walks into the kitchen to prepare dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice a photograph that features Pauline and her cousin Maggie, but in the photograph was an abnormally muscular green skinned manticore who appeared to be wearing a white shirt and gym shorts. This manticore had wings as well which was very rare. \"Hey Pauline,\" you say. \"This is another photograph of you and Maggie, right? Who's the manticore? I've never seen one that could fly before.\" \"Oh,\" says Pauline as she gets the oven ready. \"That's Maggie's sister, Fiona.\" You let out a whistle. \"She's even buffer than Dr. Weisman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline stops and turns to face you. \"That's an old photograph, Rick. Fiona has really let herself go since.\" \"She has?\" you ask. \"What happened?\" Pauline lets out a growl that causes you to jump. \"Fang happened. As much as Aunt Cattleya doesn't like Neil, Fang is the one she should be after. That weretiger was married to Fiona for years and then he blatantly cheats on her and then leaves her on Valentine's Day.\" \"Ouch.\" You say. Pauline lets out another growl before getting back to her work. \"If I ever see that jerk again, I'll stick his saber teeth where the sun don't shine.\" You start to wonder why Maggie's mother would be so hostile towards a human son-in-law when her monster son-in-law turned out to be a real heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that's when you notice something else that catches your attention. You see another photograph of Maggie but on her shoulder was a human male who looked like he was in his forties given his graying hair. You take it that was Neil. But that wasn't what got your attention. Accompanying them in the photograph was a blue skinned mer-lioness teenager who looked like she had the eyes of a human rather than a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline,\" you say. \"Would Maggie and Neil happen to have any children?\" \"Only one,\" says Pauline. \"Their daughter, Sapphire. And before you ask, no, she isn't adopted.\" \"Wait,\" you say. \"You mean it's actually possible for humans and monsters to have children together?\" Pauline has to pause before she answers you. \"Well,\" she says. \"It was kind of a miracle. Neil got stuck in Maggie's.... tunnel of love, for a few days one time. When you're married to someone who could swallow you whole, you tend to get stuck to certain parts of their body. I swear, Cattleya all but fainted when she Maggie was pregnant.\" Pauline laughs to herself and you conclude that she has quite an unusual family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Pauline walks and lays a large dish on the table with a whole roasted pterodactyl that looked like it had been stuffed to the point where it nearly burst before it was killed. To the side was a mountain of mashed potatoes and several buttered palm trees. \"Wow,\" you say. \"Pauline. \"You've outdone yourself.\" Pauline lets out a purr. \"Not quite.\" Pauline takes up two bottles of wine. \"I know I'm a sommelier, but I think I'll let you choose the wine for the meal.\" You figure you better choose carefully. After all, monster wine was much stronger than human wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wine do you choose?</span></div></div>",

You don't know much about wine, so you just make a wild choice. \"Okay then.\" Pauline says and proceeds to grab a couple of glasses. One of them is giant for her and yours is human sized. Why would she have a glass so small in her house? It like she planned on bringing you here from the start. As she pours her glass she gives you a sly smile and you smile back. She really is a smart woman. She pours some for you and amazingly doesn't spill a drop. You suppose she's used to serving humans given her profession. She sips her glass and you have a taste of your own. You're taken by surprise at how strong the flavor is. Its really fruity and delicious. \"I take it you like it?\" she asks while swirling her own glass. \"Yeah, it tastes great!\" you say. \"Well thats probably because its made from monster grapes, so the flavor is much stronger than human wine.\" she explains. You take another sip and enjoy the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you drink you start to eat and talk. \"So you poured that really well. You didn't spill any at all.\" you note. \"Yeah well I started out as a waitress, so that kind of stuff is natural for me.\" she tells you. \"The first place I worked at was a monsters only restaurant, so humans generally didn't come or they might end up in the food. Then I left and found a place that actually did serve humans, but it was a really small joint. I learned to serve humans and monsters there, and eventually became a chef.\" You listen intently and drink your wine. She continues to refill your glass as you do so. \"Since I gave up eating humans before that I really felt a connection with our clients. After moving from job to job I finally settled here and started up my own place. Business took off since humans and monsters live together comfortably here.\" She scratches under your chin and purrs. \"Then a cute little human moved in and found himself under my rump, and the rest is history.\" she says. You smile up at her and  pat her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you talk you find yourself getting a little woozy and fall onto your butt. \"Wow, I didn't think it would hit you like that.\" Pauline says. \"Huhh?\" you say a little dazed. \"Monster wine is a lot stronger than human wine, but you've only had a couple of glasses so I didn't think it would be a problem.\" she says. You stand up and stumble forward but she catches you with a furry finger. \"I'm fine.\" you say. She picks you up and holds you to her face. \"You don't look fine.\" she says. You respond by leaning closer and kissing her on the lips. Instead of leaving it at that you proceed to start licking as well. \"Well thats all the proof I need!\" she says and gives you a huge kiss in return. After a little make out session she throws you in her cleavage and makes for the bedroom. \"Get ready Rick.\" she says with a grin. After she pulls you out...</span></div></div>",

When she's done she lays on her bed and grabs you from the table. \"Good night Rick.\" she says with a smile and places you on her boob. When she does you feel her fur and unconsciously cuddle into it. Pauline begins purring at this and drifts off to sleep happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up on a soft bed. You feel around and find that its furry. You open your eyes and see that you're surrounded by black fur. Looking over you see a gigantic breast in the distance, meaning you must be on the other one. You turn over and lie on your stomach in time to see Pauline waking up as well. She lets out a yawn, giving you a view of her sharp teeth, and looks down at you. \"Hey there sleepyhead.\" she says. You smile nervously and rub your head. \"Good morning. Did we uh....?\" you say and she giggles. \"No we didn't. You passed out from the wine..\" she tells you. You blush in embarrassment but she rubs your head. \"Don't worry, I think its cute.\" she says. The two of you lie there for a while and actually fall asleep again before finally getting up. Pauline prepares a delicious breakfast for the two of you before you head out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really enjoyed last night.\" she tells you as she shuts her door. The cold air of Winter Way hits you but its no problem thanks to Pauline's fur. You're surrounded by it in her cleavage. \"Me too.\" you say. \"Any chance of a second date?\" she asks, to which you quickly say yes. As Pauline walks down the sidewalk your sister happens to spot her. \"Hey, Pauline!\" she calls out. You curse your luck but knew it was probably going to happen. They are neighbors after all. Olga runs over and greets the lioness. \"So how did it go with my shrimp of a brother?\" she asks. \"Oh I'd say it went well.\" Pauline answers. Olga then spots you in her boobs and grins. \"Stayed the night huh? I never thought you'd have the guts little bro!\" she teases. \"Nothing happened!\" you tell her. \"Its true.\" Pauline says. \"He had some monster wine and was out like a light.\" Olga laughs and scratches your head. \"I figured as much. Rick's always been a bit of a lightweight.\" she says. You swat her talon away and fold your arms. \"Thanks but I think we should go.\" you grunt. \"Didn't mean to embarrass you!\" Olga says before walking away with a laugh.

If she doesn't have any clothes on her boobs will be free so they won't be pressed together for you to ride in. \"Its nice to look good every once in a while but I don't really need clothes.\" she tells you. You're not really going to complain if the giant sexy lioness goes nude. She then pats your head and gives you a smile. \"Besides, there will be a lot of opportunities for you to get to know my girls.\" she says and squeezes them together. You blush and smile back as she heads for the center of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pauline reaches your home she lifts you to the door. Before you step off she gives you a huge kiss and you return it. Feeling your tiny lips on her gigantic ones makes her purr loudly and she lets you off of her paw. \"Thank you for the wonderful night, even if I did fall asleep on you.\" you say. She leans closer so her gigantic eye takes up the whole window. \"Don't worry about it, we'll try again next time.\" she says. With that her eye moves from the window and you hear her stomping away. As she gets further away her whole body comes into view and you see her jiggling booty in her spandex outfit. She looks back with a grin and jiggles it for you, waving her tail sexily as well. You stare out the window with a dreamy expression as she goes. You never thought you'd be in a relationship so soon, especially not with someone like her! She's got huge boobs, a nice butt, she runs a successful business, and she's indestructible to boot! Things are really looking up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are snapped out of your daydream when another eye appears in front of you. In contrast to Pauline's sparkling blue eye, this one glowing red. You jump back in surprise and fall onto your butt. \"Phyllis!\" you shout while catching your breath. \"You almost gave me a heart attack!\" She chuckles and her voice fills your mind. \"Sorry about that. You looked pretty distracted.\" she says. \"I take it your date went well?\" You walk up to her eye and she steps back you can see her face. \"Yeah, I had a great time and she really seems to like me.\" you say. Phyllis nods her head. \"Well I'm happy for you. Pauline has a good head on her shoulders.\" she says. \"This is what Scream Town is all about. Monsters and humans getting closer together.\" With last night's events still fresh in your mind you get ready for the rest of your day. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

When you're all cleaned up and dressed you climb down the tree and head for Hera's drop off point. When you get there you wait a little bit until a flash goes off and the giant deer appears. Several humans hop off of her and she lowers her hand for you to get on. \"Where ya riding today Rick?\" she asks. \"I'll take the head this time.\" you tell her. She drops you onto her head and prepares to depart. \"Where to?\" she asks. \"Springtime Street.\" you answer. You admire her golden hair and antlers for a minute and in a flash she's already there. Moving at the speed of light is pretty convenient. Hera drops you off and gives you a little wave. \"Alright, see you later!\" she says and dashes off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way toward Maddie's bakery and enter through a small door near the back. You've only been working here for a little while but you like it. You come in to the kitchen and are faced with a huge snake's tail. Maddie is at the counter mixing something before the place opens. You head the special stairs she had put on the counter for you and climb to the top. When you reach your destination you walk toward the gorgon as she works. \"Hey Maddie, I'm-\" you say before you are hit with a stray glob of batter. You get up and wipe your face, tasting the stuff as well. Its delicious, much like everything she makes. Maddie glances down and notices your batter covered form and wipes you up on her finger. She begins to lower her to your tongue but stops when one of her snakes hisses in her face. She looks closer and finally sees you. \"Oh! Sorry Rick! Guess i wasn't paying attention.\" she says. This wouldn't be the first time. Maddie is a real scatterbrain. Its a good thing her snakes seem to be able to look out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're all cleaned up she finishes mixing. \"Thats pretty good.\" you say. \"Strawberry, right?\" Maddie nods. \"Yes, fresh from Latanya's garden.\" she says. \"I added a little something too. I got some of Freya's milk for extra flavor.\" It did taste pretty flavorful. That must be because Freya's udders give strawberry milk. \"Sorry again for almost eating you.\" she says. \"Its okay.\" you tell her. \"But be careful, I don't think my new girlfriend would be happy if you did.\" Maddie stops her work and looks at you. You're pretty sure her eyes are wide behind her sunglasses. \"Girlfriend?!\" she says with a grin. \"Who's the lucky lady?\" She lowers her face to you expectantly. \"Well its Pauline.\" you tell her. She squeals and claps her hands. \"Thats wonderful! How did it happen?\" she asks. \"Well she asked me out and we really hit it off.\" you say. \"Well I'm happy for you. Now its time to open.\" she says. After popping her cake into the oven she grabs you and slithers to the front of the store. She flips the sign on the door to OPEN and you start the day. You get some good business and later when her cake is done she's in the back putting on the icing while you man the counter. Then someone comes in. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

It was Pauline walking in with a smile on her face. \"Hey Ricky,\" she says seductively as she walked into bakery. \"Sorry to pop in while you're at work.\" You couldn't say that you minded. After all, your new, naked, lioness girlfriend was walking in to visit you. Maddie slithers up to Pauline and shakes her hand. \"Congratulations, Pauline,\" she says. \"So you were the one who finally bagged the new guy in town. You are one lucky lioness. Very lucky. I can just tell that you're going to make a wonderful couple, just like Othello and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Othello?\" you ask. Pauline just let out a giggle. \"Come on, Maddie. We haven't even gotten that far.\" Maddie giggles in embarrassment and rubs the back of her head. You could even swear you heard your gorgon boss's snake hair groan, if snakes could groan. Guess it isn't easy being attached to someone as dotty as Maddie. Maddie slithers behind the counter and then you spy who Maddie was talking about. There was a photograph of her on the counter; it depicted the gorgon giantess on the beach, except she wasn't alone. In the photograph with her was a blue gargoyle male that looked similar to Dr. Weisman, right down to the beak. But what caught your attention was the fact that Maddie didn't have her sunglasses on in that photograph. Surely she couldn't be addle-minded enough to leave her gorgon eyes exposed so anyone could look into them and get petrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie lowers her head above you and smiles. \"That's just a photograph of me and my husband, Othello.\" \"I didn't even know you were married, Maddie.\" Pauline purred and nodded her head. \"Of course. In fact, Maddie is Dr. Weisman's sister-in-law.\" That made sense. Dr. Weisman's first name was Desdemona so it would make sense her brother would be named Othello. \"But how can he look into your eyes and survive?\" you ask Maddie. Maddie actually has to think about that. \"That's actually a good question.\" Pauline bursts into laughter. \"I dunno?\" she asks sarcastically. \"Maybe because gargoyles are immune to the Medusa gaze. Think about it? How can you petrify a creature that already evolved to be immune to turning to stone in the daylight?\" Maddie nods her head. \"I guess that does make sense. I remember now. That's probably why most gorgons end up with gargoyles. You and Pauline both let out a laugh before Pauline lowers her head to your level in order to whisper to you. \"You just had to get a job under the most air-headed monster in Screamtown,\" she says in a teasing tone. \"You know, last week, one of her hairs actually bit her to warn her about a manhole.\" You'll admit, Maddie wasn't the smartest monster, but she was a pretty good boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend and your boss then continue to talk. \"Have you told the family about this?\" Maddie asks. Pauline rolls her eyes. \"I'm kinda going to wait. Aunt Cattleya's already pretty sore about Maggie marrying a human. She's blow her top at the thought that a human could potentially be her nephew-in-law.\" \"So Pauline,\" says Maddie. \"What can I do you for? Cake? Donuts?\" \"Actually,\" says Pauline. \"I was going to see if you had any syllabub.\" \"Oh,\" said Maddie as she clapped her hands. \"Goodie gee! One syllabub coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Maddie's tail stood up straight. \"Syllabub?\" she asks. \"What the heck is Syllabub?\" You had never heard of syllabub yourself either. Was that some kind of monster delicacy. Since Pauline was in the food industry, you should expect her to know about some culinary delights that you didn't know anything about, but syllabub?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What part of the monster word do they serve syllabub, Pauline?\" you ask. Pauline lets out a giggle. \"Syllabub isn't a monster delicacy, it's an English delicacy. It's made from milk cultured by acids like wine or cider and sweetened and flavored.\" \"I've never even heard of syllabub until now.\" Said Maddie. Pauline purred. \"Then I guess I'll have to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note to Readers: I only found out what syllabub even is today myself)</span></div></div>",

You can't help but think about her huge ass, massive boobs, and beautiful black fur. Not to mention those sexy glasses. You then shake yourself out of your daydreaming and try to focus on work. Can't get too distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the bell on the door and see a customer walk in. You recognize her as Manami's mother.

She walks over to the counter and looks around before spotting you. \"Oh! Hello Rick!\" she says and bends down to get closer to you. The fur on her face is actually white and looks skull-like. This can intimidate some people, with her being a hellhound, but you know her family is very nice. As she does you get a view of her furry red cleavage. You stare at her massive boobs for a second before snapping out of it and looking up to her face. You know you have Pauline now, but Mrs. Urameshi is very attractive. Her husband is a lucky man, but then again so are you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Maddie?\" she asks. \"In the back.\" you answer. \"Pauline is showing her how to make some fancy dessert.\" She looks interested. \"Really?\" With those two working together I'm sure it will turn out delicious!\" she says, then grabs a container from a nearby shelf. \"I'm just here to grab some cookies.\" You walk over to the register so you can ring her up. Maddie had a special register for you installed. Its human sized and when you use it the regular one opens. Luckily this town is full of nice people, so they're nice enough to put their money in for you and take the right amount of change. \"So whats new in your life?\" she asks. \"Well I'm dating Pauline now.\" you say. The hellhound blinks and then her face is before you in a flash. \"What?!\" she exclaims with a smile. \"You and Pauline?\" You blush and nod. \"We went on a date and really hit it off.\" you tell her.

We just used my magic fridge.\" Maddie says. Maddie has a small fridge that Gabrielle enchanted for her. When you put something in it, one minute is like one hour for a normal fridge.

He passed out and was sleeping like a log.\" Pauline tells her. \"Aaww! Thats adorable!.\" the hellhound says. You turn red as the three women talk about you. Its a little embarrassing but not too much. Looking up you are surrounded by them, and you see three sets of gigantic breasts. You think you can handle a little gossip. You're glad the wine is deluded a bit by the dessert. You don't want them to know you can't even hold human wine that well when you drink it straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be going now! Congrats again on bagging the new guy!\" Mrs. Urameshi says as she leaves. \"He's so young too!\" Pauline laughs. \"Well its hard for a monster girl to find a human her age!\" she says. You wonder how old she actually is, not that it matters. Monsters age differently so thats to be expected. Next...</span></div></div>",

Looks like your shift is over Rick!\" You look at the clock as well. \"Wow! Time sure does-\" you start to say. You are cut off when you are suddenly lifted into the air. Pauline brings you up to her face and smiles. \"I'll take the little guy from here Maddie.\" she says as she eyes you. Maddie grins. \"Well don't let me hold you up! You two get going!\" she says. Pauline walks out of the store with you in her paw. When you're gone Maddie sighs with a smile. \"Those two are so good together.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline walks over to her car and gets inside. You don't usually ride in cars here in Scream Town. Usually Hera is your transportation. \"Uh, where should I sit?\" you ask as she starts up the car. There aren't seat belts for humans in here and its not like she can just put you in her cleavage, what with her being naked. \"Don't worry, I thought of that.\" the lioness says and grabs a roll of scotch tape from the glove department. She tears off a piece and carefully tapes you to one of her breasts. \"There you go, one of the best seats in the car.\" she says and scratches your head. She then begins the drive home while you enjoy the feel of her furry boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pauline arrives at her house she rips the tape off with you still stuck to it. Then she carefully removes you and gives you a kiss. \"There won't be any alcohol tonight Rick. I want you awake.\" she says with a purr. She heads right for her bedroom and tosses you to the bed. You watch in amazement as she dims the lights and comes back over. The sight of this black lioness towering over you with her gigantic boobs and butt leaves you breathless. She sits down on the bed so that you're right between her legs. Looking ahead you see her fur covering is gone and that her huge pussy is exposed. You go red and she giggles. \"Don't be shy Rick. Get to it.\" she says. You sigh and look to her face. \"Pauline, I have to tell you...I don't know what to do. I've never done this before.\" you tell her. \"Sex with a monster girl isn't so different, its just a much larger scale.\" she says. \"No,\" you say. \"I mean I've never done this in general.\" Pauline looks at you and then snatches you up quickly. \"You're a virgin!?\" she asks. You nod while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline takes a couple of seconds before speaking again. \"Wow, I knew you were young but I didn't think you were this innocent! Its so adorable!\" she says with a grin. It seems like she likes the idea of you being a virgin. \"Don't worry, I'll tell you what you need to know.\" she says and lies onto her back. She then moves you to her boob and sets you down near the nipple. \"Now stimulate my nipple.\" she says. \"Rub it, scratch it, bite it, whatever. Just make sure I can feel it.\" You walk up to the giant nub and do as she says. First you start rubbing and it begins to grow. Soon you get into it and hug it before gently nibbling on it. The world beneath you in shaking and Pauline jerks around due to your actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she grabs you again and drops you between her legs, where her towering pussy greets you again. \"Okay, now get in there.\" she rumbles from above. \"Are you sure?\" you ask. \"Trust me, you'll be fine.\" she says. You hesitantly walk toward the dripping cave. When you reach the entrance you grab the lips and climb inside. Pauline shudders as you do and you are knocked to your butt. Looking up you see some sort of nub and get curious. You begin climbing the lips to get to it. \"Ooh! What are you up to down there?\" she asks. When you reach the nub you jump onto it and wrap your arms around it. Pauline jerks violently. \"Whoa! Thats my clitoris Rick! Very sensitive!\" she says while panting. You squeeze harder and she bucks a little, knocking you off. \"I like the initiative, now get in there!\" she says and points to her vagina. You approach the opening and step inside. As you walk through this cave Pauline's breathing becomes heavier. Curious, you begin feeling the walls and she starts moaning. Soon both of you are totally aroused and Pauline climaxes, washing you out. You realize that you came as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline picks you up and brings you to her face. \"That was great.\" she says with a contented sigh. She licks you a few times and then stands up. \"Now we need to get cleaned up.\" she says and heads for the bathroom. You do need to wash up. Both you and your clothes are covered in her juices, and a little bit of your own as well.</span></div></div>",

You give a smile as your girlfriend turns on the water in the bathtub and adds in the bubble soup to make glowing topaz colored bubbles form right before the two of you get in the tub. Pauline lets out a giggle as you hold on tight to her breast as your lioness girlfriend submerges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in heaven. Pauline places her glasses on the bathroom sink before getting to work. She holds you tight and rubs you against the soap. You knew what was coming next. It isn't long before your lion girlfriend uses you as a scrub brush and rubs you all around her big beautiful body. First your uses you to scrub each armpit and then the scrubs under her massive breasts that you were chewing on earlier. Then she turns around in the tub and winks at you. \"Here it comes.\" She says seductively. Before you know it, Pauline is rubbing your soap covered body against her mountainous ass. You really don't mind the reintroduction and fully embrace your next destination as you're scrubbed between the win mountains and even rub the \"valley\" in between as Pauline moans in absolute pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make it more interesting, Pauline shampoos all over her big black furry body and you swim through the sea of bubbles right up her mane-like hair and make the big sexy kitty purr. You look back to see her tail is even twitching as you put your hands through her fur. After an hour of scrubbing, both of you exit the bath. You're exhausted and laying on Pauline's left breast as she holds them both up and smiles down at you. \"That was awesome,\" you say. \"I can't wait to tell a certain hippogriff about the big sexy black kitty that punched my virginity card.\" Pauline lets out a purr. \"Aren't you the little charmer. Come on, let's get dried off. Pauline walks into the next room and lays you down on a small washcloth to dry yourself off before walking out to get a towel for herself, all while shaking her hypnotic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on the washcloth, you see Pauline has another photograph of Maggie and Fiona that given Fiona's muscular body, was taken before Maggie was married. In the photograph you saw who you assume is Cattleya, Maggie's mother. From the looks of it, Cattleya was a chubby brown-reddish furred splinter cat with her hair worn in a ponytail with a white streak in it. She sort of looked like an aged Pumyra given that her hands were covered in white fur that made them look like gloves. Her most striking feature was her massive rear. It was even bigger than Maggie and Pauline's asses combined. That was not surprising. Splintercats were described as being \"high-behinded\". Then you notice a male monster in the photograph. A golden furred Nemean lion with a thick blonde mane and muscular body, you're guessing Maggie and Fiona's father. From the looks of it, Maggie got her looks from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've found that old photograph of my mom's brother and his family.\" Says Pauline as she walks back tithe her towel and begins to dry herself. \"So that's Cattleya,\" you say. \"Mean looking pussy isn't she?\" Pauline shrugs her shoulder. \"Mom never understood what Uncle Leon ever saw in her. She's got a mean streak but Aunt Cattleya isn't all bad.\" You didn't know about that. From the looks of it, Cattleya didn't look like she'd be too friendly of humans and Pauline did say she didn't approve of her younger daughter's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why exactly does your aunt hate Neil so much?\" you ask Pauline as you watch her drying her titanic ass. Pauline lets out a sigh. \"Aunt Cattleya is one of those monsters that sees humans as only useful as food.\" \"Like Cherry?\" you ask. Pauline nods her head. \"Exactly. Cattleya would hate it here in Scream Town. She despises Neil and one time she actually tried to eat him.\" You shiver. Cattleya sounded horrible. You've heard of some bad mother-in-laws but she seemed to take the cake. \"By any chance,\" says Pauline. \"Does Maggie's dad treat Neil any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline then takes her towel to her face before answering you. \"Uncle Leon is dead, Rick,\" she says. \"He passed away before Maggie met Neil.\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"I'm sorry.\" You wouldn't say it but if Cattleya is that vicious towards Neil, you think it might actually be a good thing for Neil to have never met his father-in-law. Usually they're even meaner than the mother-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you watch Pauline take a hair dryer and you see her hair move with the wind as you drool. You're no tiger but you definitely hit the jackpot. Suddenly the phone begun to ring. \"I'll get it.\" Says the black lioness. Pauline reaches over to get the phone, pinning you underneath her boobs in the process. You weren't complaining about this. \"Hello,\" says Pauline. \"Oh, hello.. How's it going? Me? I'm doing great. I just got out of the tub with my new boyfriend. Yes, you heard that right. I have a boyfriend and he's really hot. Until half an hour ago, he was a virgin. Oh, you're coming to Scream Town in a few days. That's great, I'll introduce you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part had you stunned as Pauline hung up. \"Pauline?\" you ask. \"Who was that on the phone? Who exactly is coming to Screamtown?\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly you have a thought. \"Is Cattleya coming?\" you ask. \"I doubt it.\" Pauline says. \"Like I said, she's not too fond of humans living as equals so I'm sure she wouldn't be comfortable here.\" You sigh in relief and she strokes your back gently. \"Even if she did come, I wouldn't let her eat you. Neil's lasted this long hasn't he?\" she says. \"I guess so.\" you say. Pauline then turns off her bedside lamp and gets comfy. \"Good night Rick.\" she says. \"Good night.\" you say back. \"I love you.\" Pauline sleeps with a huge smile tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later Pauline has you at her house and is waiting for Maggie to arrive. Suddenly you see a car driving toward the house. \"Thats probably her.\" Pauline says. When the car stops the doors open and a Nemean lioness who you recognize as Maggie steps out of the drivers seat. She looks remarkably like Pauline, except her fur is white as opposed to black. They even have the same build. From the back seat emerges a giant heavy set mer-lion. She's got cyan scaly blue skin and long blue hair. They walk up to Pauline and you notice something on Maggie's shoulder. As they get closer you see that its her husband Neil. \"Pauline!\" Maggie says and gives her cousin a big hug. \"Hey Maggie, Neil.\" Pauline says. \"Hey there Sapphire!\" Pauline beckons the mer-lion over and gives her a hug as well. \"Hi auntie.\" she responds. Maggie spots you on Pauline's shoulder and smiles. \"Pauline, is this the boyfriend you were talking about?\" she asks. Pauline grins and presents you in her palm. \"Yup, this is Rick.\" You wave nervously at everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" Maggie says and offers a claw. You shake it and then Sapphire walks over. \"Hello Mister Rick.\" she says politely. \"You don't need the mister.\" you tell her. Seriously, you can't be more than five years older than her. Pauline plucks Neil from Maggie's shoulder and places him with you. \"Hey there son.\" he says and offers you his hand. \"Hello Sir.\" you say as you shake it. \"Oh, just call me Neil. Just looking at you makes me feel old enough.\" You and he share a laugh and Maggie leans in. \"I agree, he can't be much older than Sapphire. Nice going cousin.\" she says teasingly. Pauline rolls her eyes. \"So you're going to tell me you're not older than Neil?\" she says. \"Point taken.\" the white lioness says. After that...</span></div></div>",

She was very bottom heavy as well, her ass being larger than either Maggie\u2019s or Pauline\u2019s. You recognized that wrinkled old face. It was that Cattleya woman Pauline warned you about, Maggie\u2019s mother. Pauline seemed surprised to see Cattleya as well. \u201cCattleya!?\u201d yells Pauline in surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Cattleya gives a hiss. \u201cI was staying with my daughter, granddaughter and that parasite because my place is being fumigated when you called. Funny thing about splintercats, even in old age, we\u2019ve got sharp ears. Now where is this other creep I have to look about.\u201d You give a gulp. She sounds pissed. Cattleya zooms in on you and puts on a pair of glasses in order to see you. Her ears may be sharp but her eyesight isn\u2019t doing well apparently. The moment Cattleya spotted you, she hissed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to put up with 20 years of that piece of garbage Maggie married. If you think I\u2019m going to tolerate my niece, not even a blood relative even, dating another one of you humans, you have another thing coming!\u201d Neil just lets out a groan and then Maggie lets out a sigh. \u201cAunt Cattleya,\u201d says Pauline. \u201cYou\u2019re being very rude. Rick and I haven\u2019t even been dating long.\u201d Cattleya lets out a scoff. \u201cLet me tell you something, Pauline. Humans may upset your stomach, but....\u201d \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d you ask smugly. \u201cAfter all, in Screamtown, you eat a human, you go to jail.\u201d Cattleya gives a huff and turns around to see an obese vampire giantess walking by with her human son and husband riding on her shoulders. \u201cThis town is insane,\u201d said Cattleya. \u201cHumans are only useful as food. It\u2019s as if Maggie\u2019s madness ran through from this world gone mad.\u201d Cattleya then gags as she then spies a male werehyena proposing to a human woman and then shivers as she sees a group of human and monster teenagers skating on an frozen lake nearby. However, she doesn\u2019t bat an eye at a very pear-shaped gargoyle giantess flying overhead with her boyfriend in her cleavage (then again, even Cattleya can\u2019t expect gargoyles to be hostile towards humans).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with everyone here?\u201d asked Cattleya. \u201cUgh. I\u2019ll be back later, Maggie. I need to find a bar in this town.\u201d Maggie shakes her head as her mother walks away. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Pauline.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d says Pauline with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if Cattleya can do anything. Come on inside.\u201d Sapphire shivers slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me twice. I wish I was born with fur and not scales. How can you live here, Pauline? It\u2019s colder than a...\u201d \u201cSapphire!\u201d yells Neil. Pauline just lets out a laugh and Maggie, Sapphire and Neil follow her and you into Pauline\u2019s house. Inside, Sapphire makes herself right at home by the fire as Maggie laughs at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie lays Neil on the coffee table where you are. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe someone else in Maggie\u2019s clan is dating a human. You should\u2019ve seen Cattleya spitting nails when she heard the news. I love it when that battleaxe gets all flustered.\u201d \u201cHas she always been so nasty?\u201d you ask. \u201cYou have no idea, kid. She\u2019s been busting me ever since I married the most beautiful cat in the world.\u201d Maggie gives a purr and strokes Neil\u2019s head with one of her toes. \u201cFlatterer.\u201d \u201cPauline told me Maggie\u2019s the sheriff back in Dreadberry.\u201d You say. Maggie purrs and holds up a badge she brought with her as she sips some coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Back when Neil met me, I was only the deputy. I took over when the previous sheriff retired. But there was some fierce competition for the position.\u201d You gulp. \u201cAs for Dreadberry.\u201d Maggie lets out a sigh. \u201cNot everybody there is really fond of humans. Not just my mother. In Sapphire\u2019s school alone there\u2019s a gryphon science teacher who likes to take humans apart.\u201d You gulp. Being the brother of a hippogriff, you didn\u2019t think a gryphon could be that evil.\u201d \u201cAnd then there\u2019s Meagan.\u201d Says Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \u201cMeagan?\u201d you ask. \u201cWho\u2019s Meagan?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Pauline. \u201cCousin Maggie wasn\u2019t Neil\u2019s first love. Before Neil met Maggie, he dated a werefox.\u201d \u201cWerefox? Neil, you like your girls exotic.\u201d Neil let out a groan. \u201cMeagan was very possessive. I felt like a prisoner with how she treated me. So I dumped her. She\u2019s been trying to eat me ever since.\u201d You begin to sweat. You\u2019ve heard of some psychotic exes before but that was a new level. \u201cAnd that stupid Meagan Reynard lives across the street from us.\u201d Said Maggie as she stirs her coffee. Sapphire then gave a laugh. \u201cYeah, she almost had Dad on a bun last weak, but Mom caught her in the act and curled her up into a basketball. She got her chunky butt stuck in the hoop for half a day.\u201d You raise an eyebrow. \u201cMeagan Reynard and Maggie Reaver. That\u2019s funny, Neil. Your wife and your ex have the exactly same initials.\u201d Neil then rubbed his chin. \u201cI never noticed that before.\u201d Then Neil and Sapphire let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d you say. \u201cDo you have any friends who approve of the relationship.\u201d \u201cSeveral,\u201d says Neil. \u201cFirst is my sister, Meryl. She\u2019s the one who introduced us.\u201d \u201cAnother human living in Dreadberry?\u201d you ask. \u201cShe sure is bold.\u201d Maggie gave a scoff. \u201cGood luck getting anything out of her.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Neil lets out a sigh. \u201cMeryl had an unfortunate accident with propane a long time ago. She used to sell it for a living but her boss was as inept as they came. His carelessness with a propane tank caused an explosion. Meryl was burnt to bones. But after we buried her, it turned out the ground was enchanted because she rose out of the ground as a giant skeleton.\u201d You were now very pale. \u201cYour sister is a skeleton? Mine\u2019s a hippogriff.\u201d Neil raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe\u2019s adopted,\u201d you say. \u201cMom and Dad found her egg before I was born.\u201d \u201cYour older sister, then?\u201d asks Neil. \u201cMeryl is my younger sister.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry at the fact that Neil technically outlived his younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Maggie. \u201cMy other friends are kind of eccentric. My best friend Barbara Anne is a plus-sized cheetah model who is very picky when it comes to mates. Then there's Lily, that minotaur conspiracy theorist. Then there's Penny, a wereseal. However, I have yet to meet her husband and I'm not sure what species he is. Next is good old Fortuna. A gargoyle. Her daughter, Pearl is one of Sapphire's friends.\" \"Really? What's Pearl like.\" Sapphire lets out a sigh. \"In layman's terms, an angry dwarf. She's not as big as other gargoyles and is quite snippy as a result.\" You could believe that. Gargoyles were among the biggest monster species in the world and adult female gargoyles usually reached around the 1000ft tall era. Desdemona was even bigger than that. \"Well,\" said Maggie. \"Bad tempers must run in the family. Fortuna's older sister is a prison warden.\" You gasp. Maggie couldn't be speaking about Destiny Sirtis could she? You heard of her. She was a prison warden well known for having a horrible temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say. \"I've heard of Maggie's job. What about Neil's?\" \"Well,\" says Neil. \"I work at a salon and spa for giant monster women. I mainly paint nails, clean toes, massage backs. What do you do for a living, Rick?\" You gulp because you wanted to know whether or not to tell them what you do for a living. \"Well,\" you say. \"I work in a bakery.\" Sapphire gives a smug grin. \"That's a real manly job.\" She says in a teasing tone. \"That's right,\" said Pauline. \"His boss is a gorgon giantess.\" \"I hope she treats you right,\" said Neil. \"I have two bosses, one good and one bad. One of them is a nasty leviathan while the other is a wooly mam....\" \"A woolly mammoth!?\" you yell. \"Wait, mammoths aren't monsters, how can....?\" \"I've always thought she was a subspecies of loxodon.\" Said Maggie. You all let out a laugh. \"Come on, Maggie,\" says Pauline. \"I need a little help in the kitchen.\" </span></div></div>",

Pauline nodded her head before letting out a purr and then laying on her stomach, giving you a full view of her glorious ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My folks are gonna be in Screamtown in a couple of days,\" says your lioness girlfriend. \"I can't wait for them to meet you.\" That made you worried. These monsters were from out of Screamtown, therefore they're from a city where it's perfectly fine for monsters to eat humans. And they were Nemean lions (you think), one of the five most dangerous human eating monsters in the world. And you already knew that Pauline's aunt was against human/monster romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you say. \"Pauline.

You wonder if Maggie and Neil sleep like this.\" You moan in ecstasy before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days pass and you're standing on Pauline's shoulder as she's waiting for her folks to arrive. You're somewhat nervous. Meeting your girlfriend's parents was always hard but your girlfriend was a giant indestructible lioness and if that was any indicator of what your potential future in-laws were like, you had every reason to be afraid. You then suddenly hear a rumbling sound and see a car that looked a lot like it had been pieced together by parts of different cars even the clashing colors and how asymmetrical it looked. What you were looking at was a literal monster truck. You turn pale white at the sight of it as it blows away the snow on the street and then pulls into Pauline's driveway, forcing Pauline to get out of the way of the driving snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the car came two monsters, Pauline's parents. Pauline mother, who was driving, was a large dark red furred Nemean lioness with long black hair and a scar on her face shaped just like a crescent moon (whatever could've done that to a Nemean lioness, you don't want to think about) Like her daughter, she was stark naked. Pauline's father was another Nemean lion, although he looked cream-furred and paler than Maggie. From the looks of it, he was an albino were lion and he looked like he was dressed as a Roman gladiator. He also had a large and thick mustache that connected to his eyebrows and mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline!\" yells Pauline's mother. \"Look at you!\" Pauline walks up and hugs her mother. \"Hey, Mom. I see you're still driving around in Frankenstein's car.\" Pauline's mother gives a scoff as her husband is laughing. \"I keep telling her that if she keeps putting that thing together from scrap metal, it's going to break down.\" Pauline's mom just gives a growl. \"I'll have you know, Felix,\" she says. \"I'm still the Monster Truck Race champion of Screech Valley.\" Your eyes widened. \"Pauline's mom races monster trucks?\" you ask yourself. \"That's a red flag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" says Mrs. Pride as she looked around. \"Where is that boyfriend you mentioned. I can't wait to meet him.\" \"Right here, Mom.\" Says Pauline pointing to her shoulders.\" Pauline's father squints and has to put on a pair of glasses to get a good look at you while Pauline's mother immediately notices you and gives a grin. \"Oh, you must be Rick. Sara Pride. Nice to make your acquaintance.\" Sara smiles at you and holds out one of her claws as you give a nervous grin upon looking at her sharp teeth and then shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara immediately notices that you're nervous and gives a confused look. \"What's the matter? I don't bite.\" \"I don't think he believes you, dear,\" says Felix with a laugh. \"You gotta admit, we're Nemean lions. Any human would be cautious.\" \"No!\" you yell. \"It's not that. It's just that. Pauline told me about Maggie and Neil and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara seems offended. \"Don't even begin to compare me to that idiot Cattleya. If she were here right now, I would show a Batmobile so far up her fat ass that she'd vomit Christian Bale. What my big brother saw in that bitch I'll never know.\" You give a sigh of relief as Pauline leads her folks into the house.</span></div></div>",

My house is actually in a tree in her yard.\" you answer. Felix chuckles. \"I guess thats a good thing about being a human, you don't need much space.\" he says. \"From our perspective yeah.\" Pauline says. Sara leans over and looks at you. \"So Rick, when do you plan on moving in with my daughter?\" she asks. \"It would be a lot better than living in a tree.\" You feel like you're on the spot. \"Well I never actually thought about it, I mean we haven't even been dating that long and...\" you ramble on. Pauline sighs and puts a claw to your mouth to shush you. \"Its a little too soon to be thinking about that.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sits down in the living room and Pauline gives your head a scratch. You can't help but still be nervous. Not that you're afraid of being eaten, its more from meeting your girlfriend's parents. \"So how's the restaurant doing?\" Sara asks as she sips on some iced tea. \"Oh its great, business is booming. It also helps that we get both human and monster customers.\" Sara beams proudly at her daughter. \"You've always been a sweet girl. I knew you were onto something when you put the human section in!\" she says. Pauline shrugs with a smirk. \"Well its not like its a whole lot of space.\" she says. Felix laughs. \"What did I tell you?\" he chimes in. \"And where do you work?\" Sara asks you. \"I work at the bakery on Springtime Street.\" you answer. \"I don't have an official role, I pretty much just help wherever I can. My boss is really nice so that a plus.\" \"Ever thought about working at Pauline's place?\" Sara asks. Pauline sighs. \"MOM.\" The red lioness puts a paw up. \"I'm just looking out for you two.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about I get started on dinner?\" Pauline says.

You turn to see Sara's face inches from yours. You jump back with a start and the lioness grins. \"Please, don't be so jumpy! I promise you're fine with us!\" she says. \"Its not that, you just surprised me.\" you say. \"You think he'd be used to giant lion faces by now, or do you and Pauline not kiss much?\" Felix says with a laugh. You turn red at look down, making Sara prop your chin up with her claw. \"Relax.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you try to stay calm and the three of you start talking. \"So you don't get along with Maggie's mom?\" you ask. \"Here we go.\" Felix says. Sara shoots him a look before answering. \"Yes we butt heads often. How my brother, rest his soul, fell for her is beyond me. I guess love is unpredictable.\" You can vouch for that. Sara continues. \"She was always hard to deal with, but I tolerated her. It wasn't until their first daughter, Fiona, was born that the problems started. Fiona didn't seem interested in eating humans and treated them like pets. Cattleya couldn't abide by this and tried to drill her hatred of humans into her daughter. It was the same when Maggie was born. My brother did a good job of letting them be themselves so they grew up still friendly with humans.\" She smiles and chuckles. \"It sure is great that her daughter ended up marrying one too. It drives her nuts, not to mention her other daughter has a thing for him too.\" You tilt your head. Maggie's sister likes her husband?\" you ask. Sara waves her hand as if to brush this off. \"Yes, but there's a lot of baggage there, so just ask Pauline about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all continue talking and Pauline calls from the kitchen. \"Almost ready!\" she says. \"So did Pauline eat humans much when she was a kid?\" you ask. \"Not really. They've never really agreed with her so she didn't eat them often. When she got older she decided that the pain wasn't worth it and quit cold turkey. After that she became really friendly with humans, some more than others.\" she gives you a smirk as she says that last part. \"What are you telling him?\" your girlfriend asks as she comes out with the food. \"Alright everyone, come on.\" she says.

Its a good thing me and her brother were there to hold Sarah back.\" he says. \"She's that tough?\" you ask. \"Oh yeah, female monsters are generally stronger than males. They really wear the pants.

Sarah's already red fur shows more red underneath as she glares at Felix. \"I hope you're not telling him anything that would give him a bad impression of me. I don't want my son-in-law to be scared of me.\" You and Pauline try to interrupt but Felix does first. \"Now now, they're good stories. Besides, its good to prepare him for married life.\" Pauline gives her father a look. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" she asks. He just laughs it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later everyone is preparing for bed. Felix is already in the guest room while you and Pauline are waiting to use the shower. Just then you hear Sarah call out. \" \"Its all yours!\" Pauline heads to the bathroom with you on her shoulder in time to catch her mother coming out. You find yourself staring at the older lioness fresh out of the shower. You know she was already naked but she seems more seductive right now. Suddenly she reaches over and scratches under your chin. \"Hey now, I'm married and your girlfriend is right there.\" she says. Pauline bops you on the head as her mother walks away. \"Sorry.\" you say. \"Its okay, you're young.\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline enters the room and draws a bath. When its ready she steps inside with you in her paw. \"This feels good after today.\" she says with a smile. \"I actually think it went well.\" you tell her. She sits you on her shoulder as she begins washing. \"Of course it did. I knew they would like you!\" She lifts her leg up in order to scrub it, the sight making your heart skip. Then she does her breasts, taking each of the massive orbs in her paws. You watch from up on her shoulders and your heart races. Just then she grabs you and gives you a grin. \"Your turn.\" she says. The lioness gives you a good scrubbing, lathering your whole body with soap. After a quick dunk in the water she holds you up in front of herself. Once you wipe the water from your eyes you are greeted by the sight of your girlfriend's naked body. She's like a massive goddess in an ocean. Her black fur is dripping wet, distracting you for a second. You then feel yourself being pulled forward, closer to her boob. With her other hand she cups the mammary and holds it steady. \"Have a seat.\" she says, and sets you on her nipple. While she holds your new perch steady with one paw, the other begins rubbing her leg sensually as it rises from the water. \"This is what you were watching before, right?\" she asks. The two of you are already clean, so at this point she's just giving you a show. After a little more playing around she decides its time to finish up and gets out of the bath.  Then the two of you head to her bedroom. \"Don't wear yourselves out!' Sarah calls from the guest room as you pass by. Pauline rolls her eyes and enters her room. She then settles into bed with you on her breast. \"Good night\" she says and gives your head a rub. \"Night.\" you respond and snuggle into her fur. </span></div></div>",

Sarah turns her head and smiles at Pauline carrying you on her shoulder. \"Well, good morning, lovebirds,\" says your girlfriend's mother. \"I thought you'd like to try someone else's cooking for a change, Pauline.\" \"Thanks Mom. Smells good.\" You give a smile. It looked like you'd see if awesome cooking runs in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Pauline's telephone begun to ring and Sarah grabs it to answer it. She then turned to face you and Pauline. \u201cI think this might be a prank call. It\u2019s for a... pipsqueak.\u201d You let out a groan. \u201cOlga,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s just my sister, Sarah.\u201d Sarah hands the phone to Pauline who then holds the phone up to you. \u201cHey, bro,\u201d says your hippogriff sister on the other line. \u201cHow\u2019s married life?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet, Olga,\u201d you say. \u201cAnd for your information, Pauline\u2019s folks are visiting.\u201d Olga gives a snarky laugh on the other side of the phone and you roll your eyes. \u201cOh, grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Olga remembers something. \u201cOh my gosh! That reminds me of why I actually called. I kind of got a call from Mom earlier and I sort of told her about you and Pauline.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d you yell in shock. Olga let out a nervous laugh as she held her beak. \u201cYeah. She said that she wants to know exactly what kind of woman that you\u2019re dating. Knowing her, she probably has already left the office by now.\u201d \u201cGood grief.\u201d You say as you hang up. Pauline just gives a blink. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Rick?\u201d she asks. Sarah and Felix turn their heads and you let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlga just told me that my mom is heading to Screamtown.\u201d Sarah lets out a laugh. \u201cOh, is that all? So not the drama. I doubt she\u2019ll find anything wrong with our Pauline.\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d says Felix with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure Pauline doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about from a tiny human.\u201d You give a nervous laugh. \u201cUh... yeah.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to worry about me if you let your pancakes get cold, little man.\u201d Warns Sarah.

This giant woman is a 1200ft tall harpy. However, unlike Cassidy and Libby who had human-like faces, this harpy\u2019s face consisted of a large beak filled with teeth as sharp as knives and pointed leather ears. This particular harpy had the wings, legs and tail feathers of an archaeopteryx, an extinct bird that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. She had quite an amazing plumage of feathers arranged in the colors red, black, blue, green, pink, gold, cyan, gray, violet and silver in that order from the top of her wings and tail feathers to the bottom. She also had long blonde hair. Bodyshape-wise the harpy was quite obese with E-cup breasts and an enormous rear. She was wearing a pair of prescription sunglasses and a suit and tie like an attorney would wear. From the look on her face, she didn\u2019t intend any harm to the humans at her feet but was mildly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is getting to be really annoying,\u201d says the archaeopteryx harpy. \u201cI hate it when they do that. It\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m a monster.\u201d \u201cMaybe if they knew about Rick, they\u2019d leave you alone.\u201d Says a voice coming from the ear of the giant harpy. The harpy as it turned out was carrying a human with her; a middle aged and completely bald human male. The harpy let out a scoff to her human husband. \u201cThen they would only ask questions. I had no idea it would happen at the time, okay?\u201d \u201cWell, Kate, you do come from a single-gendered race so there was no way Rick would end up a harpy.\u201d Your mother then reaches the wharf and then opens her wings to fly off towards Screamtown. Your father has to hold on tight to the harpy lady\u2019s ear canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d says your mom. \u201cAs soon as Olga told me about Rick\u2019s new girlfriend, I knew I had to check her out. I\u2019d like to see the woman I have to be careful of. I heard something about her being a Nemean lion and if memory serves, along with werewolves and wendigos, they\u2019re among the top 5 monsters humans must avoid at all costs.\u201d \u201cDear,\u201d says your mother. \u201cThey live in Screamtown. No monsters are dangerous to humans in Screamtown.\" Your mom snaps her teeth. \"I know. I just don't like to take any chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your mom was on her way to meet your girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

As she begins driving she asks about your family. \"So what are they like?\" You think for a second before answering. \"Well my dad's pretty normal but my mom can be a little overbearing.\" you say.

I can't b...\" Your mother puts her finger over your father's mouth before she adjusts her glasses. \"Well,\" she says. \"I'm a little irked that you didn't wait, but times are changing. Just be careful in the future. Now that I know what my son's girlfriend looks like, I'd like to see where you hang your mane.\" Pauline places you back on her shoulder and moves towards her car. \"Uh,\" she says to your mother. \"I could give you a lift if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother just opens her wings and rises into the air before Olga follows after her and Pauline leads both your mother and your sister as she drives back to Winter Way. \"Yikes,\" says Pauline. \"Your mom sure is frightening, Rick. I can see what you mean.\" You let out a sigh. \"She can be hard to deal with, but her heart is in the right place.\" Pauline then realizes something. \"That's a fine looking suit that your mom is wearing. Is she a businesswoman?\" You shake your head. \"A lawyer actually. She's stationed in San Francisco.\" Pauline is shocked at that. \"A 1200ft lawyer? Yikes. Aren't people afraid of her in San Francisco.\" \"Well, they know she doesn't eat humans but they're still not used to such a huge harpy stomping around. Although, one time, she got her ass stuck between two skyscrapers.\" Pauline lets out a loud and whispers to you. \"I can see why, it's as big as Cattleya's if not bigger. Yikes. Speaking of which, my folks will be surprised. You think that your mom is a human.\" You bite your nails. \"Uh, yeah. It's gonna be hard to explain to Felix and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Felix and Sarah drop their jaws when they see your mother. \"You're Rick's mother?\" asks Sarah. \"How is that possible? You're a harpy!\" \"Harpies don't even give birth to male offspring,\" says Felix. \"That's why they have to mate with other species of monsters.\" Your mother nods her head. \"Nature can have a strange sense of humor. A few years after we found Olga's egg and hatched it, I produced an egg that was unusually small. It wasn't long before Rick came out of it.\" Sarah and Felix stare at you in their daughter's hands and they can't believe what they're hearing. \"It's one thing for Maggie to give birth to the half-human Sapphire,\" said Felix. \"But this is unreal. Our future son-in-law is half-harpy. I didn't think there could be such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stares as your mother sits down in three chairs at once and places your father on the table. \"You would not believe how we met,\" your dad says. \"It's a real funny story.\" Felix and Sarah seem reluctant to find out and then Sarah decides to change the subject. \"That's a lovely plumage you have, Kate. I can see where Olga gets her coloring.\" Olga nervously grits her beak. \"Actually,\" she said. \"I'm adopted. But it is funny that we both have such colorful feathers. Mom is a very rare and very ancient variety of harpy.\" Your mother nods her head as Pauline in the background is very nervous. She knew that your mom had no ill will towards her, but she was still visibly intimidated.</span></div></div>",

She's an amazing cook.\" Your father lets out a laugh. \"Well that's a good thing.\" Your dad then gestures for Pauline's folks to lower their heads before whispering to them. \"Kate only knows how to cook spaghetti. Every time she's tried to make something else, it ended in disaster.\" \"Shut up, Jake.\" Says your mom. Your father then gives a look of panic that your mom heard him and Sarah gives a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe that Rick's mother is a harpy,\" says Felix. \"And an archaeopteryx harpy at that. That's not a harpy that you see everyday.\" Sarah lets out a laugh. \"And look at that badonk. It looks like it's bigger than Cattleya's. Oh would old dust mop head be incensed to see that.\" \"Don't remind me,\" you mumble under your breath. \"I've been under it quite a few times.\" You then notice that as Pauline turns the oven on, your mother is watching her like a hawk. \"I'd like to see what's for dinner,\" says your mom. \"I'd prefer to have something other than pasta for a change.\" Pauline then bites her lip. \"Then I guess lasagna is out of the question.\" Your mother picks her teeth with her claws before speaking. \"I hate lasagna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline begins to sweat. \"Mental note,\" she thought to herself. \"No lasagna for the scary harpy lady.\" Your mom lifts her lenses and shows her golden eyes again. \"Rick,\" she says. \"Your girlfriend seems very nervous. I really hope she isn't afraid of me.\" Olga then twitches her clawed fingers. \"Mom,\" she says. \"You can trust Pauline. There's no need to be so judgmental.\" Your mother then stares down at Olga. \"Don't forget that you're not even dating, Olga. You're not one to judge.\" Felix and Sarah themselves are intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes,\" says Sarah. \"I hope we don't have another Cattleya on our hands.\" Felix nods his head a few times. \"Cattleya?\" asks your dad. \"Cattleyas make my nose explode. Let me tell you, one time in high school, I helped put together a float for the parade but they kept having to rebuild it because I kept blowing the flowers off. They had to finish it with paper flowers.\" As your dad laughs, you nudge him in the chest. \"She's talking about her brother's wife. From what I heard that splintercat is quite mean.\" Your mother turns and glares slightly at Felix and Sarah. \"You compared my backside to that of a splintercat?\" Sarah smiles nervously as Pauline is going through the lazy Susan to take out ingredients for dinner. \"Uh, not that that's a bad thing. I'm sure that Jake doesn't mind. You gotta admit... Felix, help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nervously steps back before your mom puts the sunglass lenses back on her glasses. \"You don't like this Cattleya woman do you?\" Sarah shook her head. \"No. No I don't. For a cat, she's a total...\" Felix covers his wife's mouth. \"My wife and her sister-in-law can't be in the same room without the two of them getting into a fight.\" \"That can't be a pretty sight,\" says your dad. \"A cat with an unbreakable head against a cat with an unbreakable body. But who doesn't love a good cat fight.\" Your dad laughs at his own joke as Olga groans. \"Dad.\" She groans. Felix let out a sigh. \"Don't hold anything against Sarah, Kate. She just has a problem with her in-laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother gives a scoff. \"You think that you have family issues? Olga and I have some birds in our family that are complete birdbrains.\" You let out a sigh. \"Mom,\" you say. \"Please don't upset the Prides by complaining about Aunt Laurel.\" \"Oh, oh, oh,\" says your dad. \"You think that Laurel is the most triggering? Of all your mother's sisters, the most annoying one is none other than Oreo. She's still trying to join them in Baltimore. Just because she's an oriole harpy. Geez.\" \"Sisters?\" asks Pauline. \"As in more than one?\" You nod your head. \"Mom is the oldest of 8 sisters. Each one a different type of bird. But the rest of them drive her crazy. They're the reason she moved to the human world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" says Sarah. \"A family of big cats whose daughter is dating the son of a family of birds. There's a joke in here somewhere. I just know it.\" Felix then gave a cough. \"Well, I doubt you'll have anything to worry about Pauline. She's an excellent cook. Uh, Pauline, what exactly is for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a gulp because you're really hoping that whatever Pauline cooks, your mother will like it.</span></div></div>",

The poor boy needs to be careful living with monsters.\" she says. \"Well I think he's done fine so far.\" Sarah says as Pauline walks back into the room. \"Thats because he found a town where human relations are good. Anywhere else and the poor thing wouldn't survive.\" Kate says. \"Don't make it sound like I'm a wimp mom.\" you protest. \"Humans live all over the Mons Terra.\" She rolls her eyes. \"Yes, and even more are used for food.\" she counters. \"Besides, you were always a momma's boy.\" Olga adds with a smirk. \"She was overprotective!\" you blurt out. \"Yeah, and you didn't go running to her for everything.\" your sister says sarcastically. You turn red while the Prides listen to your family talk. Pauline pats your head and smiles, although you can see her stifling a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with relying on your mother.\" Kate says. \"Yeah, and you didn't encourage him at all.\" Olga says with more sarcasm, then turns to Pauline. \"She practically had a heart attack when he said he was moving to Scream Town.\" Your mom raises an eyebrow and looks at your father. \"Well, I wouldn't talk if I were you.\" he says, causing the hippogriff's smile to falter. \"Kate didn't like to let Rick out of her sight, but he and Olga were inseparable.\" your dad says. \"I remember she would carry him everywhere when they were kids, even through high school. She loves her little brother more than anything.\" your mother says with a smile. \"It makes me proud.\" Olga is visibly flustered, something Pauline has never seen before. \"I was just looking out for him! He would have been eaten alive in high school! Literally!\" she tries to explain. \"And I'm sure there's no particular reason you moved to the same town as him?\" your mom asks. Olga can't respond, causing you to laugh. \"Can it shrimp.\" she mutters. \"And as if that wasn't bad enough, imagine having seven more harpies doting on you. Kate's sisters are crazy about him.\" your dad adds. \"Hmmph.\" your mother grunts at the mention of her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think lunch should be ready.\" Pauline says and gets up. \"I'll help you dear.\" Sarah says and follows her. Your father looks at Felix, the only lion left. \"I'm sorry if my wife is a little brusque.\" he says apologetically. \"You don't have to apologize.\" he says with a laugh. \"I know what its like to have a...strong wife.\" He chooses his words carefully. \"And let me assure you, Pauline will be the same. If anyone threatens your son she'll handle it.\" \"Hmm.\" your mother says sceptically as the lionesses bring out the food. It seems like Pauline made a meatloaf, with bread and assorted veggies on the side.  Once everyone starts eating your mom takes a bite. \"I have to admit, this is delicious!\" she says out loud. You and Olga sigh in relief as she shovels food in her mouth, while Pauline and Sarah look proud. \"Well since my restaurant is pretty successful I can get the best dinosaur meat.\" Pauline says as everyone eats. Looks like everything's going good so far.</span></div></div>",

The two men share a laugh until a finger pins your dad to the table. \"Ack! Sorry honey!\" he yelps while struggling under your mom's finger. At the same time Sarah has her husband's ear in a death grip. \"Okay, okay!\" he cries. Both women sigh and give each other a knowing look. \"Look forward to this.\" Sarah says to her daughter. \"But thats why we ladies are in charge.\" Your mom chuckles and lets your dad up. \"Don't worry Pauline.

No I ...\" You stop short when she gives \"the look.\" She smirks and nods at your girlfriend. \"See?\" Your dad sighs and shakes his head. \"Thats what happens when a human has two giant women controlling his life while he grows up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Rick and his sister have a good relationship.\" Sarah says happily. \"Oh believe me, if Pauline mistreated Rick Olga would have been over here in a flash. She might not do much against a Nemean lion but she'd definitely do her worst.\" Kate says. \"Trust me I know the feeling.\" Sarah sighs. \"I swear that sister-in-law of mine is such an insufferable mongrel.

She tosses you gently and Olga catches you. \"Mom, we're not kids anymore!\" you both protest simultaneously. The two of you look at each other and sigh. Pauline giggles at your predicament, making your shoulders droop. At first you were just worried about your mom not getting along with Pauline, but now she's making you look like a pushover! Not to mention Olga's getting the treatment too, but thats kind of funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax you two.\" your dad says as Pauline takes you back. \"Yes, she loves you a lot, but thats good!\" your mom assures you. \"Besides, at least its not like my sisters. Try having seven of them, all driving you crazy.\" She turns to the Prides. \"We already told you about Oreo, but thats just the tip of the iceberg. There's my sister Lenore, that raven is as gloomy as they come.\" Your dad jumps in as well. \"What about Shanta? That crow is nutty as a fruitcake.\" You listen to your parents and remember your childhood with your aunts. They certainly were a colorful bunch. \"Although the one thing they had in common was that they were all crazy about Rick. They doted on him and spoiled him like crazy.\" your dad continues. \"Oh! That reminds me.\" your mom says. \"All of your aunts heard about your girlfriend and want to come visit as well.\" Your stomach drops. \"I don't when they'll get here so there's a chance they may show up all at once.\" It drops even further. \"I just hope they show up after we're gone.\" she says while shaking her head.

They're the biggest bunch of busybodies I've ever seen.\" \"Come on,\" scoffed Sarah. \"They can't possibly be any worse than Cattleya. I'm sure we won't have any trouble with a bunch of harpies.\" Felix nodded his head and Pauline gave a smile as she placed you on her shoulder. \"Well,\" she said. \"I guess if we have company coming, I better figure out what I'm going to cook for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything else, a cacophonous noise filled the air. It was a shrill sound as if somebody was singing <i>Push it to the Limit</i> (the 80s song) and very badly. Upon hearing the noise, Felix and Sarah cover their ears and meow in pain. \"What the hell is that noise?\" asks Felix. \"It sounds like a banshee with laryngitis.\" Your mother rolls her eyes as she took the liberty of putting on a pair of earmuffs. \"That would be Aunt Laurel,\" you groan. \"She's the closest to Mom in age of the sisters.\" Pauline's glasses start to crack, as do the windows and your lioness girlfriend growls. \"What kind of harpy is she?\" Your dad cracks a nervous smile. \"You're not going to believe this,\" he said. \"But she's a canary harpy.\" \"Canary!?\" yells Sarah in disbelief. \"That's not the singing of a canary. That's the sound you get when you flush an accordion down the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt's singing resonants through the air and even causes the snow on Pauline's roof to shake and fall off as the pinecones fall off of nearby trees. V.V. is nearby and her crystal ball shatters at the sound of Laurel's horrible noise. \"I swear,\" says your mother. \"That sister of mine butchers 80s songs worse than any slasher can chop up a victim. She's too tone-deaf to realize how horrible she really sounds and insists she has perfect pitch.\" The singing suddenly comes to a stop as there's a knock on the door. \"Guess who-oo!\" yells Laurel. Pauline is about to get the door but your mother stops her before she can. \"I better get this,\" the archaeopteryx harpy says before she takes you from Pauline's shoulder. \"You don't know Laurel like I do.\" Your mom places you on the back of her neck right before she opens the door and reveals Laurel behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt Laurel was a 900ft high harpy with the wings and legs of a bright yellow canary, albeit with the torso and face of a tan-skinned woman with long whitish-blonde hair and black lipstick with a mole on her chin. Body shape-wise, she was very fat and pear-shaped and wore a pair of gray fishnet stockings with a black tank top and shorts along with a dark blue jacket and choker. \"Hey, Kate,\" said Laurel. \"It looks like I got here first.\" \"That's because you're so impatient.\" Says your mom with a groan. Laurel then notices you on your mom's shoulder and snatches you up as you grunt and presses you against her cheek. \"Ricky!\" she yells. \"It's bee <i>too</i> long since I've seen you.\" Laurel then holds you up and kisses you so hard you're covered in canary spit in seconds. \"Hi, Aunt Laurel.\" you say with a sigh right before your mother takes you back from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga comes in and smiles. \"We just finished having lunch, Aunt Laurel,\" she says. \"But I'm sure there's something left for you.\" Olga then grunts as Laurel hugs her tight. \"Olga!\" she yells. \"It's great to see you too! I'll bet you're as excited as I am that your brother finally found a girlfriend. I trust this is her house. Now where is the lucky lady.\" Olga bites her lip right before Pauline walks forward. \"That would be me, Ms. Rowling,\" says the black lioness giantess. \"Pauline Pride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel takes a good look at your girlfriend and her jaw drops as her look of excitement turns into a look of shock. \"A Nemean lion?\" she asks. \"I... I wasn't expecting that.\" Laurel smiled nervously and shook Pauline's hand with one of her talons as her eye twitched. Sarah and Felix look in concern. \"What's wrong with her, Jake?\" asks Sarah. Your dad lets out a sigh. \"Laurel doesn't like cats that much. Thankfully she's the only sister like this, but I guess it has something to do with her being a canary.\" Laurel then turned to you and your mother and smiled nervously. \"A Nemean lion? Seriously? Uh... not that there's anything wrong with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother let out a collective sigh as there's another knock on the door. \"Oh no,\" mutters your mom. \"Not so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly which of your aunts is at the door? </span></div></div>",

She's wearing a pair of tight jeans and a red shirt with a large black coat covered in pockets, She's also got on a pair of skull earrings. \"Kate! I knew it! The spirits told me someone familiar would be here!\" the crow says and gives your mom a hug. \"Well thats obvious if you go to visit someone now isn't it?\" your mom says as she returns the hug.

I'm Sarah and this is my husband Felix.\" The red lioness says. \"So what are these spirits you mentioned?\" Felix asks intrigued.\" \"Shanta here  is very much into the occult.\" your mom says. \"I'm not \"into the occult\". I converse with the spirits and have gotten a better understanding of the universe.\" Shanta tells her. Your parents roll their eyes while Sarah chuckles. \"Yup, that sounds like someone I know.\" she says. \"What was that?\" Shanta asks. \"I have a cousin named Una who...shares the same interests as you.\" Pauline explains. \"She's actually something of a witch doctor.\" The crow's eyes light up. \"Oh I'd love to meet her! She must have some amazing remedies!\" The Prides all look at each other for a second and Sarah speaks up. \"Well her concoctions, despite usually working, have some unexpected side effects most of the time.\" Shanta laughs and shakes her head. \"Well the powers that be are mysterious.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad to see you guys are used to this kind of crazy.\" your dad says. Shanta turns to him with her hands on her hips. \"Oh really? Who was it that predicted you two would give birth to an amazing child after you gave up on trying?\" she asks. Your dad just looks down, clearly not having an answer. \"Although I have to say all this is pretty outrageous.\" she goes on while looking at Pauline. \"No matter how many times I tried divining the spirits always implied that Rick would be single forever. Thank you for making him happy!\" She shakes your girlfriend's hand again while she and her parents snicker. \"Aunt Shanta!\" you yell from your mom's shoulder. You don't need her telling them more about your embarrassing years. \"Oh hush, I can tell that this lady will stick with you no matter what!\" You just hope she won't tell them about all the \"rituals\" your aunt held in order to try and help you get girls. Thankfully she's noticed Laurel. \"I know you must be nervous sis, but life is full of surprises.\" she tells the canary. \"Yeah sure...\" Laurel says, still a little uncomfortable with the lions in the room. \"Think of Rick okay?\" Shanta asks. At this Laurel lightens up a little, then you hear another knock. \"Uh oh.\" you say. Who could it be?</span></div></div>",

She's about 750 feet tall and has a slim figure with an average sized chest. She's wearing a black t-shirt and black jeans with a black leather jacket. She's also got on a lot of black mascara. \"Lenore! Fancy seeing you here.\" Your mom says sarcastically. The raven walks inside and gives her a quick hug. \"Hey Kate. I just figured it would be polite to meet Rick's new girlfriend.\" she says a touch apathetically. When she sees her other sisters as well she sighs. \"I guess I should have known you guys would be here too.\" she says, rolling her eyes. \"You think you're the only one who wanted to meet Rick's new lady friend?\" Laurel asks, wrapping her arm around Lenore's shoulder. \"Although she might be a bit of a surprise.\" Shanta shakes her head. \"Well you're the only who's shaken up about it.\" she comments. \"So its just you guys then? What about Kester or Pannah?\" Your mom coughs to get her attention. \"No, they're not here yet, but with the way things are going I wouldn't say it will be too long.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts now that Lenore's attention is on you. She grabs you from your mom and gives you a peck on the head. \"Hello Rick. Its been too long.\" she says, with an obviously more upbeat tone. You can hear your father chuckle. \"Just like always.\" he says to your mother. From across the room Olga whispers to the Prides. \"Aunt Lenore's always been a little gloomy, but whenever she's with Rick she just lights up.\" she says. Now Lenore turns and heads for the lions, specifically Pauline. \"So you're Pauline?\" she asks. Your girlfriend nods and Lenore hands you back to your mother. She offers a wing and Pauline accepts for a handshake. \"Please treat Rick well.\" the raven tells her. \"Of course.\" Pauline says with a smile. \"Nothing will happen to him as long as I'm around.\" With the pleasantries out of the way Lenore looks the lioness over. \"I  love your fur by the way. Rick has great taste in women.\" Pauline gives her a smile and thanks her while your mom rolls her eyes. \"Anything black with this one.\" she mutters. \"Hello there, we're Pauline's parents.\" Sarah introduces. \"I'm Sarah and this is my husband Felix.\" The introductions this time are much more subdued, thanks to your aunt's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenore gives Olga a hug after she meets the Prides. \"Hello Olga, I see you're doing well. Looking out for your brother?\" The hippogriff nods with a smirk. \"Yeah, the little guy wouldn't get far without me, but I guess he's got Pauline now.\" The raven folds her arms and nods, as if remembering something. \"It seems like yesterday poor little Rick couldn't get a date to save his life. I would come over sometimes and talk to him when he was feeling depressed.\" Pauline and her parents lean in to hear more, making you bury your face in your hands. \"He went through a phase where he would get rejected and mope around all day. I was the best to deal with it so his mom would call me over.\" Kate scoffs. \"More like you would barge in worried about him.\" she mutters. The sight of Pauline smiling at this information makes you groan. You love your aunts but this is killing you! It isn't long before there's another knock. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

The door opens to reveal two women standing there, both of them your aunts. \"Kate!\" The taller once exclaims as she enters. She's your aunt Pannah, a harpy eagle. Unlike those who've arrived so far she's an anthropomorphic bird like your mother. She's 950 feet tall and has a very fit body with large breasts. She's built kind of like an amazon. Her feathers are white from her head to her neck, and then black down to her hips, where they turn white again. Her hair is white as well and reaches down to her back. She's wearing a tight white tank top and a pair of black jeans. \"Hello Pannah.\" your mom says as they hug. Pannah spots you on her sister's shoulder and her eyes light up as you wave. \"Rick!\" she cries and snatches you up. She hugs you to her cheek and then brings you to her beak for a kiss. \"How's my little nephew?\" she asks as she tosses you into the air and catches you. \"Pannah! I told you to stop that!\" your mom shouts, scolding the eagle. \"Oh come on! He's a bird! He loves being in the air!\" Pannah says. You're not scared but you are getting kind of nauseous. After the third toss you find yourself landing in a different set of talons, looking up at a new harpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman is almost as tall as your aunt Pannah but is a kestrel. This is your aunt Kester. She's got a similar build as Pannah but her bust is smaller in comparison. The feathers on her head are white with gray spots. The same feathers are on her legs and stomach as well. On her back and wings however the feathers are gray with black spots. She's wearing a tank top like Pannah but black instead of white. She's also wearing a pair of tight blue jeans. \"Hey there Ricky!\" she says and brings you in for a kiss. Now that you've been covered in both of your aunts' saliva you look at the two of them. They smile at you before your mom snatches you up. \"Why don't the two of you introduce yourselves?\" she says, gesturing to the Prides. \"Oh, right! I'm Pannaah Rowling! Nice to meet you!\" aunt Pannah says. \"And I'm Kester!\" the other adds. \"I'm Pauline. Nice to meet you.\" Pauline says. \"A lion huh?\" Pannah asks, checking your girlfriend out from all sides. \"I heard she's a NEMEAN lion at that.\" Kester says. \"That would make you pretty tough.\" Sarah clears her throat and the two birds of prey head over to her. \"Believe me, she takes after her mother.\" Felix tells them. \"I'm Sarah, Pauline's mom, and this is my husband Felix.\" the red lioness says. After they've been introduced Pannah and Kester head back over to Pauline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind these two, they've always been pushy. Somehow being twins just makes it worse.\" Kate tells the Prides. Thats true. Pannah and Kester are more athletic than your other aunts. When you were younger they would drag you out to their workouts and try to set you up with random girls. On more than one occasion they've gotten quite rude with girls who turn you down. \"Hey, we're just active!\" Kester tells her and they make their way over to Olga. \"Its been a while.\" your sister says as she gives them both a hug. \"Yeah, it seems like only yesterday the two of you were in high school.\" Pannah says. \"Yeah, and you two showed up at school to beat up those girls who were bullying Rick.\" the hippogriff adds. \"What?\" Pauline asks. \"Don't worry, I arrived to stop them before they get themselves arrested.\" Kate assures her. \"Well those girls shouldn't have been messing with our little Ricky!\" Kester says. While you deal with more embarrassment you realize how many people are here. Its a good thing Pauline has a big house. Who arrives next?</span></div></div>",

Your dad shrugs his shoulders. Kester then turns to Pannah. \"Bet you 20 skulls it's Pele.\" \"You're on, sister. \"Said Kester. Sarah walks up to the door and opens it. As soon as she does, she lets out a loud scream as the new guest intimidates her. The monster at the door was wearing a black colored and high tech looking diving suit with an abnormally shaped helmet that had iron tubes connected to an air tank on the woman's back. It was impossible to tell what species of monster she was but she was as tall as your mother but had an even larger behind that appeared to be taking up much of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah steps back in fear and Pauline and Felix look in worry before the black-suited lady walks in. However, neither you, your parents, your aunts or Olga are afraid and you let out a groan. \"Damn it, Pele,\" says your mother. \"How many times do I have to tell you to take that ridiculous thing off indoors.\" The giantess in the diving suit removes her helmet to reveal that she was a harpy with a face resembling that of a pelican with an enormous blue beak with long aquamarine-colored hair. Like your mother, Pannah and Kester, she was a harpy resembling an anthropomorphic bird. \"Sorry.\" She muttered in embarrassment. Your girlfriend and her parents looked in surprise as Pele took off her diving suit to reveal her white wings that had blue spots and her long blue webbed-talons. Her enormous behind bounced as she managed to remove the last of her suit. Underneath, she was wearing a pair of cargo pants and a striped tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prides all blinked and stared at Pele. \"Pauline,\" you say. \"Meet the youngest of the Rowling sisters, my aunt Pele.\" \"Youngest!?\" asks Pauline. \"She's as big as your mother.\" You then grunt as Pele snatches you up. You let out a sigh. \"I guess I should've expected this.\" Pele presses you into her chest and squeals. \"Ricky! It's been too long! I still can't believe you have a girlfriend now.\" You laugh nervously. \"So I've heard, Aunt Pele.\" Your pelican aunt then kissed you, further coating you in bird saliva before she noticed Pauline. \"Oh! Is this her.\" Pauline holds out her hand and takes you from Pele before shaking Pele's wing. \"That's me, Pauline Pride. And these are my parents, Sarah and Felix.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Felix were staring at Pele's rather large behind and Felix even walks up to your mother to whisper into her ear. \"Not to be rude, Kate,\" he says. \"But Pele's... uh... how do I...?\" \"Pele has Glutos Syndrome.\" Says Kate. \"Glutos Syndrome?\" asks Sarah. \"What's that?\" \"It's a very rare disorder,\" says Laurel with a whisper. \"It only affects adult women. Gives them a rear that makes the rest of them look undersized.\" \"Oh geez,\" says Sarah. \"I'd hate to see how it would affect a splinter cat like Cattleya. Wait... how come...?\" \"Glutos Syndrome isn't contagious,\" says Lenore. \"Just incurable.\" Sarah and Felix nod their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline then looks at Pele's diving suit. \"What's with the Darth Vader of the deep outfit?\" asks your girlfriend. \"Pele is a diver, Pauline. She makes a living by salvaging treasure and other artifacts from under the sea and selling them to museums, collectors, etc.\" \"You meet a lot of interesting monsters underwater,\" says Pele. \"For one, I've never seen any town in the monster world where the mermaids surface as much as they do in Screamtown. Usually mermaids don't get along well with land dwelling monsters. Back on a diving trip in Terrordale there was this rather nasty British-accented mermaid who kept trying to attack a human lifeguard. Brrr. It sure is cold around here. Perfect.\" Pele laughed and kicked back, using her large rear as an improvised chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Pauline. \"It seems I only have one of your aunts left to meet, Ricky. Oreo was it? What kind of harpy is she.\" \"An oriole,\" you say. \"And I thought she'd be here by now.\" \"Oreo is usually fashionably late,\" sighs your mother. \"We'll hear from her real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother is right because it isn't that long until you get a sign from Oreo's arrival in the form of...</span></div></div>",

The object that destroyed the window is soon revealed to be a baseball that lands in between Sarah\u2019s breasts as the red lioness looks in surprise. \u201cWhat the...?\u201d Pauline lets out a groan. \u201cDamn kids,\u201d she says. \u201cWho would play baseball in this weather.\u201d Your mother let out a sigh. \u201cKids didn\u2019t do that. Oreo can\u2019t be far behind.\u201d Pauline gives a growl. \u201cWell, when she shows up, I\u2019m giving her a piece of my mind. Do you know how inconvenient it is to have a broken window in a part of the town that\u2019s always winter.\u201d Shanta follows Pauline to survey the damage and then grunts in pain as she steps on some of the broken glass that she clearly couldn\u2019t distinguish from all the ice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near baseball season.\u201d Says Felix. \u201cEvery season is baseball season as far as Oreo is concerned,\u201d says your dad. \u201cShe tried to join the Orioles but was turned down because she was too big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline lets out a sigh and then walks up towards the closet to dig out a broom. Your lioness girlfriend goes to tend to the broken glass and then looks out the now broken window to see another harpy flying down from the sky. This harpy was a slightly fat and big bellied oriole-based harpy with bright orange and black wings. She also had golden orange hair that was slicked back and reached down to her rear. She was wearing a baseball outfit and a pair of glasses as she flew down and landed in front of the broken window and climbed inside when she noticed your mother and the rest of your aunts. \u201cOh, dang,\u201d she grunted. \u201cAm I late again?\u201d Shanta nodded her head. \u201cAs always, big sister.\u201d \u201cYou must be Oreo.\u201d Says Pauline with a sigh as she turns to your aunt. Oreo looks in surprise at Pauline. \u201cA Nemean lion?\u201d she asks. \u201cHuh. That nephew of mine really knows how to pick them.\u201d \u201cHi, Aunt Oreo.\u201d You say with a sigh. You don\u2019t even react as Oreo grabs you and presses you against her enormous lips and then shakes hands with Olga. \u201cHey, you two,\u201d says Oreo. \u201cCongrats on the new G.F., Rick. Now all we need is to find a mate for Olga.\u201d Olga gives a scoff. \u201cSpeaking your mind as always, Auntie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turns to Felix and rolls her eyes. \u201cThat one has no sense of tact.\u201d She says. \u201cBut I gotta say,\u201d says Felix pointing out the baseball in Sarah\u2019s cleavage. \u201cShe\u2019s got some impeccable aim.\u201d Sarah glares at her husband and then grunts as Oreo snatches the ball right out from where it was. \u201cThere\u2019s my ball.\u201d Sarah grits her teeth angrily at Oreo and even growls. Oreo ignores her and puts her ball under her hat. \u201cThat reminds me,\u201d says Pauline. \u201cYou\u2019re paying for my window.\u201d Oreo lets out a sigh and then takes out what looks like a ledger of some kind to write into it as Pauline looks in surprise. \u201cOreo breaks a lot of windows,\u201d says Pele. \u201cShe\u2019s racked up a debt of more skulls than she actually has.\u201d \u201cNot that it matters,\u201d says Pannah. \u201cOreo is terrible when it comes to managing money.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asks Oreo. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019m not good when it comes to financial decisions. Sue me. But seeing as Pauline is dating our nephew, I can assure you, I\u2019ll pay for the window.\u201d Your mom takes off her glasses and lets out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gang\u2019s all here.\u201d She says. Laurel gives a scoff. \u201cPish tosh, Big Sis,\u201d says your oldest aunt. \u201cI\u2019m sure they won\u2019t cause too much trouble. Just wait\u2019ll the wedding.\u201d Your dad gives a look of shock. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit early? Rick and Pauline just started dating.\u201d Lenore gives a sigh. \u201cThis coming from the husband of the only Rowling Sister to actually be married?\u201d You let out a sigh and shake your head.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For some reason, despite the intense cold screaming at any part of your body not covered, you decide to go mountain climbing. And not just any rinky dink human mountain, either. No, you wanted to climb a <i>proper</i> mountain. And looking up from your current vantage point, the mountain seemed to stretch out for many miles, overlooking the quaint small town like a gigantic monolith of rock and snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, human mountains, from what you remember, looked almost...pitiful, in comparison to monster mountains. Following the same sense of scale as the rest of the monster world, the mountain seemed to stretch up infinitely before you, and you weren't even at the base! It looked like a terrifying, exciting, terrible and great idea. But as you walked towards the base of the mountain, a process that would take several minutes, you wondered how exactly you were going to go about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, humans can't climb the thing alone. It's mountain sized... to the <i>monsters</i>, so of course it was unreasonably large for any human beings. But after a fair amount of walking, you see a comically large lodge, aptly labeled \"Scream Town Mountain - Help Center\". Perhaps they'll have some information inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for a few <i>more </i>minutes, and walking up the human-sized stairs, you eventually reach the front door to the lodge. Monsters, who you don't bother to get particularly good looks at, enter and leave at a fair rate, but you've yet to see a single human that isn't you. Which makes sense, given how daunting of a task the mountain climbing will be, but it's at least a little concerning, leaving you wondering if this was a bad idea after all. But you step inside the human-sized entrance anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, it's a fairly typical lodge. Aside from some minor human accommodations, it's a normal lodge, sans it being up-sized for monsters. A warm fireplace surrounded by chairs and couches sits in the corner to your right, with several monsters whom you don't recognize talking about something. Directly in front of the entrance at the other end was a help desk, where you spotted what you could only assume was a satyr standing at the front desk. Which is kind-of funny, when you think about it, because it's a mountain and satyr's are kinda like goats... okay, yeah, she probably wouldn't be too happy if you said that, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of you, at the left of the entrance to the place, was a wide set of stairs and a human elevator, leading up to the second floor. You had no reason to go to the second floor until you get some information at the help desk, but it'll be worth checking out later. Maybe that's where the supplies are? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAscending a human-sized spiral staircase to allow you to reach the top of the help desk, again, takes another few minutes, but living in this world has given you enough stamina to get through these tasks well enough. At the top, you stop and take a breather, and take a look at the help-desk lady conversing with another monster, who you ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your vantage point, she just looked like a fairly slimly built human woman, albeit monster-sized at what you could only guess was 700 feet tall, a little short for the regulars of the town, although her chair gave her a boost. She had brunette hair, tied up into a ponytail (which looked strange in tandem with her large, protruding goat horns), and she was wearing a blank white shirt that simply read \"Scream Town Mountain\" on it, as if this place was some sort of brand. You also spotted a name tag. \"Cindy\". You'd have to remember that. Looking further down, where her shirt ends you find that she apparently didn't subscribe to wearing pants, although her bottom half was entirely goat-like in typical satyr fashion, so it did the job of covering up what needed to be covered anyway. Yeah, she was a satyr alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she finishes her conversation with the monster above you, and looks down at the desk, having noticed you during her conversation. \"Anything you need, sir?\" she asks extremely politely, a trend that seemed to persist throughout the town. For the most part. \"Yeah, I was wondering. How can a human hike up the mountain? I've always wanted to go mountain climbing, and figured I'd do it here.\" \"Is there anybody with you? A monster, maybe?\" she asks, looking around. \"Nope, it's just me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satyr looks at you in confusion for a moment before reaching to her side and grabbing a pamphlet, and opening it up, skimming through it. \"Here,\" she says, turning it to face you and pointing at the corner of the page, \"Our pamphlet states that humans cannot hike up the mountain alone. It's far too dangerous for a single human.\" You frown. \"Come on, isn't there something you can do? I was hoping I'd be able to hike today...\" \"Well, luckily for you, humans aren't totally out of options.\" she says, flipping through the pages of the pamphlet. \"There's a tram system on the second floor that can give you a ride straight to the top, if you're interested in the hot springs and don't want to go through the trouble to hike all the way up. Alternatively, you can rent a vehicle in order to drive up our specifically paved human roads, where there are multiple points along the way to park and camp for awhile, while enjoying several of our scenic views.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something, at least, but it still left you unsatisfied. \"Anything else?\" you ask, and the satyr shakes her head. \"Unless you have a monster with you, there's nothing I can do, honey. Maybe you can ask some of the monsters over by the fire place if they'd like to go with you?\" she says, pointing at the few monsters near the fireplace that you couldn't get a good look at from here. \"Oh well. Thanks anyway.\" you tell 'Cindy', and she smiles. \"Oh, and the rental hiking supplies are upstairs.\" she says as you begin to make the trek down the staircase that brought you up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But as you step down the staircase, you feel a tad disapointed. There goes any hope of you hiking up alone, just you and the wilderness... except, maybe you still can. Although you're not <i>supposed </i>to, you could rent the supplies and begin to trek up the mountain yourself. Security looked pretty lax (or rather, <i>there is no security</i>) so nobody would be able to stop you if you tried. But maybe the Satyress is right, and it is too dangerous. If it's a monster sized mountain, odds are monster sized animals live on it. What if there are dinosaurs? Dinosaurs were native in the monster world, after all, and you let out a shudder as you consider the possibility of a dinosaur catching you off-guard. Still, that hardly deterred you from your goal, so by the time you reach the floor again, you've decided to...</span></div></div>",

Dizzy, you try to stand up. You look up and see a giant pair of brown eyes staring at you. This must be the new neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was around 645 feet tall. Her hair was short, spikey, and the same color as her eyes. Her body reminded you of Hera, with tan skin, slim arms and decent sized breasts in a black bikini top, but a huge, fat belly dominating her frame. You looked and saw that her lower half was that of a Clydsdale horse. She was a centaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to her and realize that she was expecting you to say something. So you opened your mouth and said hi to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the floodgate of words opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HimynameisAlalai'm26yearsoldIjustmovedherefromGreeceareyouRickit 9;snicetomeetyouhowlonghaveyoulivedhereisthereagymdidyoumeet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was speaking a million miles a second. All you could gather was that her name was Alala, she was from Greece, and she was 26. You couldn't understand anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, could you slow down?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stoped talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Sorry about that. Mouth sometimes runs away. Must be my energy. Hate standing still. Gotta keep moving. Lost a lot of weight that way. Not in my belly. Don't know why. Don't really care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was still talking fast, but at least you could understand her. You decided to get to know her a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like your new home?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Not my home. Temporary. Actually moving to Autumn Avenue. Waiting for house to be ready. Is there a gym here? Asked taxi lady. Couldn't understand me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be referring to Hera. \"Yeah. It's on Spring Street. Want me to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish your question, Alala picks you up, drops you on her belly, and bolts out the door. As you cling on for dear life, you realize that she is talking again. You could barely understand since she was running her mouth like a race car again. All you could understand was that she was talking about...</span></div></div>",

That was fast. \"Now what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taxi Lady. She looked familiar. Reminded me of someone. Went to college with. Name escapes me.\" She replied. She didn't even sound winded from her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taxi lady? Oh, you meen Hera Hind?\" You replied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERA HIND. That's her name. Knew her in college. Back home in Greece. Transfer student. Shared room with her. Great friends. Surprised to see her again. Must catch up. Want to work out with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last question caught you off guard. One minute she was talking about Hera, then suddenly she wants to work out with you? You said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy was certainly happy to have a new gym member. She said she would not rest until she slimed up Alala's belly. You didn't know how long the workout lasted. Alala had jumped from one workout to another, not even given you a chance to catch your breath. By the time she was done, it was night. Alala said she had to leave, get ready for when her house on Autumn Avenue was done. You said goodbye and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited by the depot for Hera. When she showed up she was alone. She said you were her last customer before she turned in for the night. You chose to sit on her ear since you wanted to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hera, you studied in Greece, right?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the new arrival said she knew you from there. Do you remeber someone named Alala?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Alala Tatopolus. She was my roommate when I was studying there. I actually ran into her today. She is much skinnier than she was back then. Though her belly's just as big. Least I'm not alone in that regard.\" She said, patting her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and noticed that Hera wasn't going as fast as usually. \"Hey, why aren't you running?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my last customer, you wanted to talk, and it's late. Just thought that I'd take my time for once\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you made it home. You thanked Hera and got off her ear. Before you entered your home, Hera asked you a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phyllis is having a house-warming for all the new neighbors tomorrow. She's wondering if you would be able to make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you going to be able to make it?</span></div></div>",

I've decided to change that).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and smile. \"I'll be there faster than Garfield finds lasagna.\" Hera nods her head and then turns to run back the other way.\" You smile and you're about to climb up to your treetop home when you see a light going on in the house right next door. If your memory served you right, that was another house that was just sold and had a new family moved in. You decided that since your mother raised you to be a polite and hospitable person, you'd pay them a visit.\" In 15 minutes, you arrive at the door of the new neighbors with a strawberry cake. Of course, it was only big enough for humans to eat, but then again, it's the thought that's important. You walk up to the human-sized knocker at the bottom of the door and then you ring it loud. The sound creates an echoing noise that alerts the residences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up and you look and see three pairs of huge hooves. You look up and see three succubi. The matriarch of the family had ivory-oclored skin with red cat eyes and black lips that looked natural. Her hair looked like it was half dark purple and half electric blue but it was clearly dyed. She had a decent figure with a large butt and hips and was wearing a gothic outfit much like Noreen. However, to your surprise she didn't have wings. There was also a young male human on her shoulder that looked to be only 19 and was playing a handheld video game before he saw you and put the game on pause. You take it that the young man was her son, seeing as mixed families were common in Screamtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn and get the attention of the other two succubi smiling down. Both of them looked like the daughters of the older succubus. There was a red-skinned 22 year old bubbly looking succubus who shared her body shape with her mother and was dressed like a cheerleader. From the looks of it, she was still in college. The oldest child was a 25 year old succubus with lavender skin and LOS. She was more stoic looking but she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Screamtown,\" you say. \"I'm Rick.\" The oldest succubus bends down and picks you up. \"Oh,\" she says. \"How darling. Look children. We have a new neighbor. My name is Holly Telburn and these are my son, Connor, my daughter Michelle, and my oldest, Amber.\" Michelle giggles and looks down on you. \"Yayzies! We have a new friend! I'm Michelle!\" You give a look. \"Uh, I kind of figured that out.\" Connor slides down his mother's arm and shakes hands with you. \"It's good to meet you. Come on in.\" All three of the succubi walk in and carry you as you look at the interior of the home. It was gothic in design and had video game posters on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rick,\" says Holly. \"What do you do for a living.\" You smile. I work at Maddie's bakery. I even made a cake for you, guys. Of course, it might only be big enough for Connor.\" Holly walks into the kitchen, places you and Connor on the table and holds up the cake. She gives a nervous look but shrugs. \"It's the thought that counts. I myself work as a guard for a warehouse by the docks. It pays well. Connor just graduated from high school and works as a copy boy. Michelle is still in college and as you can see, she's on the cheer squad.\" You saw that Michelle was still practicing her cheer moves and dancing. However, in contrast, Amber was looking rather stoic and staring out. \"And Amber?\" you ask. Holly smiles. \"Amber works as an architect. Plus she actually pays rent around here. Don't mind her, she's a little distant. But she loves us all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"Sounds a lot like my mom. She's a huge archaeopteryx harpy that works as a lawyer. She has 7 sisters. In order from oldest to youngest, there's a tone-deaf canary harpy, a gloomy raven harpy, two athletic twins consisting of a kestrel and harpy eagle, a baseball loving oriole, a shaman crow and a pelican diver with Glutos. Then there's my dad. He's a real wiseacre. Finally there's my sister, Olga Rowling.\" \"<i>The</i> Olga Rowling?\" asks Connor. \"The writer? That's amazing. Mom's a bit of a writer herself. Holly lets out a laugh. \"Well,\" she says. \"I dabble in dark poetry and dark fiction from time to time. By the way, is there a goth bar around here.\" \"Yes. One in Autumn Avenue.\" Michelle giggles. \"Oh, that's great. Maybe mom will find a plus-sized goth girl.\" Holly lets out a sigh. \"Michelle.\" Michelle just blushes and Holly shrugs her shoulders. \"To be honest, I'm divorced. It didn't work out with my previous marriage. But hey, I'm not one to dwell on it. Oh, by the way, Rick. Would you stay for dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"I'd be honored to, Mrs. Telburn. What are we having?\" Holly gave a smile and her kids smiled as well. \"Well, to celebrate the fact that we're new in town and we're going to surely make lots of new friends here in Screamtown, I'd say that tonight, we're going to have a nice delicious feast of....\"</span></div></div>",

A short and wide bungalow, with a wooden door, and a couple of windows which, unfortunately, you couldn't see into at the angle you were currently at. Coming to the door, you give it a few loud knocks, waiting as you hear the thumps of a monster's footsteps from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the door swings inwards, and you find yourself gently grasped between two enormous talons! Holding you is a massive hippogryph, her fur a stormy grey and her feathers and avian faux-scales a bright gold. The edges of her beak curl upwards in a smile, as she deposits you into a palm. \"Hello there, Rick! I'm Vivian, Vivian Goldpine...\" she croons. \"I got the e-mail from Phyllis, don't worry! I wouldn't dream of hurting you or any other human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, you estimate the hippogyph to be around seven hundred feet tall - give or take a few feet either way. \"Would you like to come in? I don't have everything set up just yet but I'm almost done unpacking...\" Not wanting to be impolite, you accept Vivian's offer, and the hippogryph walks into her home, closing the door behind her as her tail swished back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are placed onto a large wooden table that seems to take up a fair amount of space in the room. You can see that the room you're in is also connected to two others. \"Would you like anything to drink, Rick? Maybe some tea?\" Vivian asks from up above. \"I'll just have some water, thanks.\" you reply. As Vivian walks into what is presumably her kitchen, you check out the stuff she has on the table you're on. First off is two different books by your sister, Olga, stacked on top of each other. Both are filled with bookmarks. There's also a large notepad with an accompanying ball-point pen, and a small journal bound in faux-leather bearing a small sticker with the word 'writing notes' written on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Vivian was a writer. Perhaps she took inspiration from your sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table underneath you shakes ever so slightly as Vivian returns, a mug of tea held in one hand and a teeny-tiny cup of water presumably pinched between two of her talons in the other. The glass is handed to you, as Vivian takes a gulp from her mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas the hippogryph noticed your interest in her writing?</span></div></div>",

Santeria what are you I've seen succubi and you don't look like one?\" She chuckles a little. \"Oh is that's what's on your mind well I'm a devil.\" You tilt your head. \"I know your a type of demon I just want to know what kind.\" The three women turned their collective view towards you before Santeria speaks again. \"No dear I mean actual devil controllers of demons watchers of sin rulers of evil. At least that was the old human view of us.\" Your eyes widen in shock. \"But I thought Devils where well myths among monster I mean it said their were only ten total.\" She nods her head and Reimu follows. \"Yes ten in total exist me, my sisters, and my father but he vanished years ago. why are you shocked you've probably seen weirder things walking down the street.\" She had you there but still the stories about Devils where they had access to magics no normal living creature could get to and it did nothing to them they where near invincible to every thing.

We are going to have so much fun together, like me.....\" she said, although the last part was sung instead of said.

You wait to see who might be coming out, and what you were about to see is a one heck of a surprise. The door opens, and revealing it to be none other than a human mother. She has dark blue eyes, long blue hair, and she was wearing some business suit as well. She looks appealing to be sexy, but what you would see next is unlike anything else. The woman was smiling at you just as you come in. \"Well I can tell your friend has came to see me and my daughter. I am Leumya, how are you?\" she asked just as she shakes your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's a pleasure to meet you. Say, you are small to move in a huge house like this, why is that?\" you asked her. She smiles, then the ground rumbles and you see that reason for yourself. The giant girl was 150ft tall, and she appears to be 10 years old. She too has blue hair and dark blue eyes, but there is one thing odd about her. She has only one eye. Is she a cyclops? The small girl smiles just as she picks you and Leumya up. She was wearing some girly clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there little one, who are you?\" the cyclops smiled. \"Well I am Rick.\" you replied to her. \"It's nice to meet you. Who are you?\" \"I am Grace.\" the cyclops girl replied. \"I can see you got acquainted to my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Leumya smiled. \"Say, you can tell she has one eye, as I was once in love with a male monster (don't worry, he is not in it) and then he gone to war, but we did love each other, so I had a baby, and my baby was one unique child. She is Grace, and she is a cyclops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is strange. A human mother who gave birth to a monster girl, now that is something you don't see any day. We saw someone similar with a concept like that but in reverse (Chantal/Kiki) but this is unlike anything you ever seen. You just wonder about that mystery of a human giving birth to a giant monster girl. Guess we will go into detail soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright Grace, are you ready to head to school?\" Leumya smiled just as she looks up to her gigantic one-eyed daughter, who has a completely bright smile on her face as if she loves school. Normally kids these days would hate school for all various reasons, but not this girl. She wants to learn so she can gain new skills that could help her in the future, so it is important for her to learn at school. Even you remember doing that. \"Oh I am ready for school for sure mom.\" Grace smiled just as she picks up her mother and places her in her shirt pocket, but then she grabs you after you said. \"Say, do you don't mind me accompanying you two?\" you asked them politely. Leumya and Grace smiled and shook their heads up and down, and then Grace picks you up and places you in the same place Leumya was right then. You have got to admit though, they are some strange neighbors from time to time, from Chantal giving birth to a normal size human girl, to a human woman giving birth to a giant monster girl (well for note she starts off small and then grows big), they are some interesting neighbors in town. Grace then proceeds to start walking on the street all the way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, there is something I like to tell you Rick. Where we are heading is to the Screamtown Elementary School, and both I and Leumya go there. I go to learn, while Leumya is one of the teachers at the school. Also, my homeroom teacher is really nice.\" Grace smiled just as she walks about at least one mile to get to the school. After all Leumya cannot drive a monster-sized vehicle thanks to the fact that she is a human, so Grace takes her to work. \"Well that is a good way of putting it.\" you replied to Grace. \"It is true, in a size like this, I have my daughter take me to work. She does this everyday, and then after school we go home. Was thinking about getting her a monster bike to make her travels easier.\" Leumya replied just as she takes in the fresh air of Screamtown. Also, with Grace's giant walking, it is easy to tell that the fresh air is very nice to breath in. You even agree with this as well. The air is really good to breath in as well. This town is pretty good you must admit. After about 30 minutes, mostly due to the fact that Grace has to stop and watch traffic, they eventually reach the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school looks like any plain old school that normal people would go to. They are boys and girls, and monster girls (since there is no male giant monsters, but if there was, then it still works, not that I am asking for it.) are playing with each other on the playground, which consist of a jungle gym, a slide, and a few other toys as well. Heck, even the human kids have their own set, but they also play with the monsters as well. After all, the humans and monsters get along in this town, unlike every other town in Monster Land. Grace goes in and checks in for the day, and even mentions that they have a visitor. Of course you sign in to visit the school as a guess, and then Grace casually walks to her homeroom teacher's room. \"Alright, we are here. Trust me, my homeroom teacher is really really nice.\" Grace smiled just as she told Rick. \"She really is.\" Leumya smiled. \"I have heard only great things from her about my daughter, and that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see.\" you told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace then opens the door to see an angelic figure in the room. Sure parts of it look human, but it is an angel, and a very muscular one as well. We see a halo floating about the girl's head, and some big eagle like wings as well that would almost take over the entire desk itself. The girl looks absolutely beautiful to your eyes, with great brown hair, tan skin, some decent size breast, but the stunner was the white dress that she wears. I mean it is like that of a princess and boy is she hot to look at. She also has blue eyes as well. Her abs and all that other good stuff is really hard to the bone and is amazing to look at. It would be normally a bit disgusting to look at, but still her dress covers up her muscle parts. She happily flies over to Grace and smiles at her. \"Well hello there, I haven't expect to see you so early, and who's that there, are you bring a guest with you?\" the muscular angel said, noticing you in there. She turns and looks at Leumya with a smile. She can tell you are admiring her for your looks. \"Say, don't be shy little human, what's your name?\" she asked you politely. \"I am Lola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.... Ri....Ri.... Ri.... Rick.\" you said, struggling to get the right words to come out of your mouth as you just continue to admire her looks. She then pulls you and Leumya out and brought them to her desk. \"Don't worry, all men who look at me at least once get that type of stare. I told Grace that one time before.\" Lola admitted just as she places you on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he is a visitor, and he accompany us to take Grace to school.\" Leumya told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he did. Well that was very sweet of him.\" Lola replied with a very good smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Well, I am new to this town, I just moved in about 3 weeks ago here. The other towns are pretty rowdy, so this town suited me best. Perhaps if I ever start a family I will have them move here.\" you admitted just as you continue to admire the sweet sexy looks of that hot muscular angel. Hopefully she is not on steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we all?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shrugging, you decide to pick a house at random and head for it...well, maybe not <i>quite</i> at random. You may have had a little bias going when you headed for the nicest house on the block, that didn't raise any red flags in your head about (yet another) potentially crazy neighbor. Or at least one that wouldn't keep trying to sit on you. <i>Then again,</i> you muse with a smirk,  <i>I DO in a tree out in a Lovecraftian giantess's front lawn.</i> The house was definitely a looker, though: a two-storey townhouse of whitewashed stucco, with a polished slant-metal roof and a balcony on the second floor overlooking the freshly-cut lawn. You whistled when you spotted French doors up there, complete with what looked like fancy lace drapes. This place wasn't just nice, it was downright <i>ritzy</i>! It looked like it belonged in a richer neighborhood than this part of town. Maybe two tax bracket higher; three at a stretch. Idly, you wonder just how much this place had cost. More than your payroll, definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such modest grandeur was marred by the sound of an argument coming from the back yard. You couldn't make out many words, but it sounded like things were getting heated. Raising an eyebrow, you cross the street--checking the way twice, once for cars, once for monsters--and walk around the skyscraper-size fenceposts, looking for a way in the backyard. By now, the argument (presumably involving your new neighbors--is coherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--think I'm some kind of jumped-up pirate or something? Kid, you need to lay off the movies and read a newspaper.\" A grizzled male voice intones, laced with annoyance and snark. \"First off, I'm retired. Second, the name of my job was <i>private military contractor</i>, goddammit. NOT 'mercenary'!\" The last bit was all but shouted, and...more than a little angry. \"Mercs are thugs and killers, I had rules to follow and standards to keep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl--definitely from a monster, a werewolf by the sound of it. \"You weren't in a REAL army, you carried a gun and you got paid to kill...sounds like a mercenary to me! Yeah, you had <i>rules</i>....so long as they don't get in the way of your paycheck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found a human-sized gate, but hesitate with your hand on the handle. Whatever was going on in there, it wasn't pleasant--and what was all this about mercenaries, anyway? Walking in on this argument could just make things blow up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you hear a new voice break in, this one female and carrying a slight Middle Eastern accent, as well as a light chuckle. \"You mean like how the only reason my husband isn't in your gut right now is that eating him would get in the way of <i>your</i> paycheck? --Don't give me that look, I saw you sucking in drool when you thought we weren't looking! ...Quiet now, aren't you? Not even denying it; Ra above... Just do us all a favor and get out. Now. You've done your job and we're already paid you, you have no reason to even be here antagonizing Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short silence, some grumbled profanities, and a gate slamming on the other side of the fence. You count to ten in your head to make sure the antagonistic monster--who was he?--isn't coming back, then knock on the gate. \"Um, pardon me? My name is Rick Rowling; the mayor sent me to welcome you to Screamtown. Ah, if this isn't a good time--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry--we're fine, just one of the moving crew talking trash. No need to stand out here, please come in!\" The apparent \"wife\" invites. Shrugging, you open the gate and walk through onto what looks like a pool area in progress: the brick floor had already been laid out, but the pools haven't been dug yet. Only outlines painted on the bricks hint at them (one sized for humans, the other for monsters). When a shadow suddenly covers you, you look up...and find a titanic were-croc woman in a red dress, at least 1200 feet tall, towering over you like a scaly skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" You reflexively cringe away and take a step back. With her that close, you had almost (accidentally) looked up her dress, which wasn't the best first impression, but more important...<i>how had you not noticed her before?</i> It was almost like how regular crocs could float by unnoticed until they snapped at their prey. You try to toss that comparison out of your head, looking up at her and smiling awkwardly. \"Er, sorry about that, ma'am...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were-croc  woman simply chuckles at your reaction, moving a clawed hand in front of her snout. Her friendly smile nonetheless reveals fangs the size of train cars, and she had a lithe, slender frame and a graceful air about her. But she wasn't scrawny, either--as she bent her knees, reaching toward you with her clawed fingers, you could see the muscles subtly rippling in her arms beneath her dark green scales and their muddy-brown spots and stripes. And while not as prominent in the....ahem, chest area....as most of the other women in town, she wasn't exactly \"flat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait...why is she reaching for me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can protest, you're gently--but firmly--pinched between the werecroc woman's fingers and gently set down in the palm of her free hand, sitting across from a generously-muscled black man a head taller than you, and dressed in a grey jacket and black trousers. A military \"dog tag\" hanging from a wallet chain hooked to his left pocket and a scar running from his left ear to the corner of his mouth give the man a piratical appearance, but his posture is easygoing and relaxed. \"So you're our welcoming committee, eh? Well, I'd take you over that punk from the moving crew; that's for damn sure.\" He extends his hand with a grin. \"Frank Sobek. The lovely croc-lady is my wife, Azzah Sobek.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake his hand, trying not to wince at his tight grip. \"Rick Rowling. And yeah, like I said, Phyllis sent me.\" You feel the \"ground\" sway beneath you as Frank's werecroc wife heads inside, humming a tune. \"And pardon me, but the name...Sobek? Like the Egyptian river god?\" You raise an eyebrow, just as a cool gust of AC washes over the three of you as Azzah opens the door with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Frank both look up when Azzah laughs: a sort of musical hiss. \"Well, what do you expect for an Egyptian were-croc? One has to show pride in their heritage...or at least go for a name with a little prestige.\" She winked a reptilian eye at Frank, who snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>still</i> don't see what was wrong with 'McCarren'...\" he retorted, in a tone that sounded half-kidding. \"And we both know you don't <i>really</i> buy that 'descended from an old god' line your parents kept feeding you, Azzah. You told me yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzzah giggles again, setting you and Frank down on a granite countertop. A quick look around confirms she brought you to their kitchen: boxes in various states of 'unpacked' are neatly arranged around the room, and you spot what looks like decorative hieroglyphics made of bronze hanging on the wall. <i>Fancy,</i> you muse, <i>I might even want some of my own...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief scraping noise catches your attention, and you look back at Azzah as she pulls up a chair and sits down, leaning over the counter. Her laughter dies down, the light flashing off the gold wedding ring on her right hand as she uncovers her mouth. \"It's just the principle of the thing, dear!\" She quips, patting Frank on his broad shoulder with a huge finger. \"And besides, it <i>was</i> more my parents than me who insisted on it.\" She shrugged. \"Oh, but we're leaving Rick out...sorry about that, dearie.\" She subtly flicked a clawed finger at you: politely getting Rick to shift the conversation back to you, no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle at their banter. Frank and Azzah seemed a pretty young couple (Frank couldn't have been older than thirty, Azzah not much older than that), but they bantered like they'd been married for quite a while. But there was something else on your mind...<br>\r\n\"No problem, ma'am. But there's something I need to know: Frank, what was all that about earlier? I...heard you say something about your, ah, job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Former</i> job,\" Frank insists. He sighs, mumbling something you don't quite catch. Azzah seems to pick up on something, and slowly reaches her head down to give Frank a quick nuzzle. He smiles at the gesture, kissing her snout as she pulls back. \"...Sorry, that punk just riled me up more than I thought, I guess. Anyway, I worked for Taurus Security Operations. They hired both humans AND monsters; only PMC outfit that does that.\" He squared his shoulders, cocking a proud grin. \"Even met Azzah on the job in Egypt...we got called in about a giant croc woman using the Suez Canal as a hot tub...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzzah blushes bright crimson, at her husband's memory yelping something in what sounds like Arabic. \"F-Frank! We have a guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the name Frank mentioned that made your eyebrows go up. Taurus Security Ops...you didn't keep up with the news all that well, but you'd heard that name before. Especially what its operatives were known for....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A couple of seconds later the door opens and you see a huge harpy woman standing over you. She looks about 900 feet tall and has a voluptuous figure. Then you notice her feathers. They're a golden orange color, and the tips of the feathers on her wings are a sapphire color. \"Excuse me!\" you call up. She looks down and smiles when she spots you. She reaches down to pick you up and you find yourself sitting in her palm, which also happens to be part of her wing. Strangely you feel a sort of warmth thats unlike the usual heat in Summer Side. Its very comforting. The harpy leans in close and smiles. \"Hey there, my name's Reba Nixon.\" she says with a warm smile. \"I'm Rick.\" you say. \"I'm here to welcome you to Scream Town.\" Reba gives you a pat on the head. \"Why thank you! I heard this place was nice, but a welcoming committee?\" she says. \"Well I wouldn't call it a committee since its just me.\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I have to say I rather like the idea of this place.\" Reba says as she takes a breath of air. \"Humans and monsters living together. I haven't seen much coexistence like this in all my years.\" All her years? She looks a little young to say that but then you realize that monsters have different life spans than humans. Some could be as young as you, but then others could look just as young but be much much older. \"So you've seen a lot huh?\" you ask, trying not to allude to her age in the process. That would be kind of rude. \"Oh yes.\" she says. \"I've been around for a while, being a phoenix and all.\" A phoenix! That explains the warmth you're feeling, and her bright color scheme. She sees you slight look of shock and chuckles. \"You probably already know that we phoenixes are reborn whenever we die. We burst into flames and then rise from the ashes. I personally don't even remember how many lives I've had so far.\" She stares off into space as if reminiscing as she talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh you look pretty good for your age?\" you offer, trying to keep the conversation going. Reba looks at you before smirking. \"My age? Are you calling me old?\" she asks. You look away as she laughs. \"I'm kidding! I know I'm much older than anyone in this town.\" Then she looks at her body and back to you. \"To be honest the only thing I sometimes don't like is what I get reborn as. My body is usually different every time. Sometimes I get reborn into a fat body, and one time I was a kid until I grew up again!\" you listen raptly as she tells her story. She's turning out to be an interesting person! \"My last body was pretty gorgeous. I had an hourglass shape and everything! Still, this one is fine too. It may be bigger, but at least I still look great! Besides I've heard some men prefer the bigger ladies.\" She then moves you closer to her chest, giving you a view of the mountainous cleavage in her blouse. You are then pulled away as she chuckles. \"Kidding!\" she says, but kind of wish you could look longer. Then...</span></div></div>",

The grass was extremely overgrown, even by monster standards, the paint was peeling, there were holes in the room, and all the windows were either shattered or boarded up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground begins to shake as footsteps approach, and a massive shadow looms  overhead. \"Hi Rick!\" You know that voice, and turn around smile as you look up at your grootslang friend, Josephine. \"Hello Josie.\" She bends down and her snake/trunk gives you an affectionate lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to Summer Side?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phyllis told me they're we're some new neighbours in town, so I decided to pay some of them a visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine picks you up and holds you in her palm. \"I could give you a lift if you want. Then later we could go back to my place for some lunch.\" So you spent the morning going door to door with Josephine welcoming the new arrivals to the neighborhood. For the most part, they seemed friendly enough. But there was one, a grumpy old werewolf named Walter, that rudely told you to piss off and slammed the door in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Josephine took you back to her house. She sat you on the table and started fixing lunch. She always kept human food on hand for when you came to visit. As you ate a sandwich she made for you, your mind drifts back to that strange house you saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josie, can I ask you a question?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering...do you know anything about that abandoned house down the block?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine freezes, and looks up from her spaghetti and eyeballs with a mix of fear and hesitation on her face. \"Why do you ask?\" You shrug. \"I just thought you might know why it was abandoned, since you've lived here for quite a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....it's abandoned because a serial killer lived there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was awkward silence. Then you burst out laughing. \"That's a good one, Josie. I actually believed you for a second!\" Josephine scowls. \"I'm serious! That's Kitty's old place!\" You only laugh again. \"Kitty? Sounds more like a stripper's name than a serial killer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephine snorts angrily. \"It's no laughing matter, Rick. Fifty years ago, there was a rakasha that lived in that house named Kitty Kooger, but the news called her The Summer Side Slasher.\" \"What's a rakasha?\" \"Basically a weretiger, but able to use magic. Anyway, she would lure unsuspecting monsters into her home and...\" Josephine hesitated to continue. \"And what?\" You ask \"Let's just say the stuff she did to them was unspeakable, and leave it at that. She was eventually caught, but was released on a technicality. After that, the residents of Summer Side formed a mob, and...well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They killed her. No one has lived in that house since.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish your lunch, you bid Josephine farewell, and head back to your home in the tree. That night as you lay in bed, you think about what Josephine told you. So, even Scream Town, the nicest place to live in the monster world, has it's dark secrets. In this case, a local mass murderer. You figure at least it was a long time ago, long before you were even born, now there's nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're on your usual morning jog when you pass by Kitty's house. It looked a creepy and foreboding as ever, but there was something about it, something hypnotic that forced you to stop and stare at it. You know curiosity killed the cat, but you just had to see the inside of the house for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending an hour fighting your way through the jungle that was the front lawn, you reach the front door and crawl under the small space beneath it. Just as you expected, it was even creepier on the inside. Old furniture, peeling wallpaper, dust everywhere, etc. Then, you hear a voice whisper on the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, Kitty's coming for you....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you had enough this place, and you scurry back under the door and outside. Just as you make it out, you hear a loud scratching noise on the other side of the door, like claws on a blackboard. You run back across the lawn, and all the ay home, not daring to look back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you're just getting ready to go to bed, when the phone rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, it doesn't sound like you. Alex, is this another one of your stupid pranks?\" You then hear evil laughter on the phone. \"You fall asleep and I'll get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear more demonic laughter and you think that you even see a shadow of a feline humanoid on your wall, but you found that impossible. No monster could possibly fit in your house. You turn to see where the shadow is coming from but there isn't anything there.\" You shrug your shoulders and lay in bed where you hear more vicious sounding laughter. \"Alex!\" you yell. \"Phyllis warned you about making crank calls! Stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to chalk this experience off as one of Alex's pranks given the feline shaped shadow, but otherwise it didn't seem like the sphinx was in any way responsible. You drift off to sleep and it isn't long before you're tossing and turning in bed. In the dream, you appear to be on the beach in Summer Side but there doesn't appear to be anyone here. \"The beach? What's going on? Josie? Manami? Joanne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see several dinosaur shaped footprints, only at monster-sized. They must've belonged to the Nidhogg lifeguard, Tyra Rex. \"Tyra?\" you ask. You hear stomping and then you follow the tracks closely until you reach a black nidhogg's toe. \"Tyra?\" you ask. But then you look up and gaps. You see a skeleton resembling a cross between a T-rex and a dragon; a skeletal Nidhogg and it was wearing a lifeguard's uniform. Tyra, or what looked like was left of her, turned her skull and growled at you and you stepped back. Suddenly you see something cast a shadow over you and then turn your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding right behind you was what looked like a giant tombstone and to your horror, it had your name written on it. Then suddenly, a large orange and black hand with elongated claws snatches you up screaming as you're pulled beneath the sand into your grave. You look around to see that you're in some kind of dark room with no walls, floor or ceiling and there is blue fire everywhere. You hear squawking and look all around to see that there were giant crows flying all around the area when one of them drops what looks like a toy box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk forward and out of the box springs a giant orange and black tiger woman who lets out a loud roar. The tigress looked skinny and of average size in contrast to Angel's colossal size and fat body shape and she appeared to be wearing back pants with a black and red striped sweater and a fedora. She also had a menacing look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" you ask the tiger woman. The tigress holds out her claws dangerously close to your chin. \"Kitty Kooger,\" she said. \"At your disservice.\" You feel a claw poking behind you and turn to see another Kitty Kooger and gasp. \"May I eat you?\" asks the tigress titans. \"You look salty.\" Kitty licks her lips and you have to run as both Kitties laugh wickedly. You look back at those horrors as you zigzag and run through the bright blue flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you see a third kitty appear with a growl as she tore her pants off and revealed a strange fire breathing portal with razor sharp teeth where her womanhood should be. You try to run back but hundreds of noodle-like tongues stretch out and grab you, pulling you in through the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on what appears to be a giant pizza with eyeballs all over it staring at you. You shiver in place before Kitty appears and laughs fiendishly as you see that she has her mouth stretched out with her lower jaw splitting <i>vertically</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty slashes a slice of pizza with her claws and you yell in pain as she severs your right arm in the process and then devours the slice greedily before she belches out a storm of ghosts and laughs maliciously. You could only scream and you're afraid for your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it looks like you're about to be tiger chow, you hear a voice shout \"WAKE UP! and there's a ripple that distorts the entire dream. You stand up even with your severed arm and recognize that voice. It's Phyllis. She must be using her psychic abilities to disrupt the nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty lets out a roar and reaches to get you and that's the moment you wake up and pant. But as you do, you look down and gasp because you were still missing your arm. \"Oh thank goodness,\" says Phyllis's voice. \"You nearly bought it back there, Rick.\" There's then a bright light and you look up to see Phyllis, Desdemona and...</span></div></div>",

Still no one comes so you assume this monster must not be home. You turn and start walking away but a strong gust of wind blows you back and land on your butt in front of the door. You get back up but another gust comes and blows you down again. You wonder whats going on when suddenly a third burst of wind lifts you up into the air. Instead of being blown back however you find yourself being tossed around in mid air. You continue to tumble around in the wind until you stop and appear to be floating. The ground underneath you feels solid enough but you don't see it. As you look around from this height a huge woman's face abruptly appears right in front of you. You scream in surprise and fall backward, then notice that the ground is now visible. You see that its the hand of whoever the face belongs to. Now that you know whats going on you get a look at the woman holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has very light skin and long flowing blond hair that reaches her waist. She's got a slim figure with slightly big breasts, and looks to be about 600 feet tall. \"Hey!\" this woman says with a smile. \"Hey.\" you respond. \"My name's Rick, and I came to welcome some of the new neighbors to town. Is this your house?\" She nods and introduces herself. \"Yup! My name's Sylvie Windsor, and in case you couldn't tell I'm a sylph!\" she tells you. That explains what just happened. Sylphs are spirits of air who can move as the wind and turn invisible. \"Well you made quite a first impression.\" you say as you stand up. Sylvie lightly blows a puff air and knocks you back down, giggling at her little prank. \"Sorry if I scared you, but it was just too fun!\" she says. You stand up again and she offers a finger which you grab and shake. \"Welcome to Scream Town. I think someone as positive as you will fit right in.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that introductions are over you and her make smalltalk. \"So as you probably already know Scream Town is a place where everyone can live together in peace.\" you say. While you talk Sylvie begins floating in the air, taking you even higher than you already are. \"Oh I know. Thats what makes this place so cool! I already had a look around using the wind. You've got quite an assortment of folks living here.\" she informs you. \"Well thats the point.\" you say. \"The mayor wants humans and monsters from all over to know this is a good place for everyone.\" Sylvie seems like a nice if not playful girl. You think she'll fit in here. What do you do next?</span></div></div>",

You wonder what she has in mind. You wanted to get to know the new neighbors so you decide to go along. \"Okay, that sounds-\" you say and before you can finish she's off. She flies through the air while holding you in her hand, taking care not to let you fall. She's making twists and turns that while fun, are starting to get to you. This roller coaster ride stops however and you look to see where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you look down you see that Sylvie has flown you to Springtime Street and wonder what she has planned. \"So what are we doing?\" you ask. \"Having fun!\" she replies and flies toward what you recognize as Latanya's house. The minotaur is tending to her garden when you get there. Sylvie makes herself invisible, making it look like you're floating again. As Latanya reaches for some flowers Sylvie blows a puff of air out of her mouth. Her wind powers make that little puff much more powerful and the flowers blow everywhere, leaving petals falling from the sky. Latanya's hair is also messed up, giving her a silly look. Sylvie flies away while laughing and you can't help but smirk as well. Next she heads over to the bakery, where you work. Peering in the window you see that Maddie is mixing some batter. Sylvie points a finger at it like a gun and shoots wind right at the top of the bowl. It doesn't make a big mess, but some of the batter flies into Maddie's face. Once again Sylvie flies away laughing with you in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the bakery Sylvie heads over to Summer Side. \"Sylvie won't it look strange that I'm floating in mid-air?\" you ask. She turns visible again and rolls her eyes. \"You're so tiny, who's gonna be able to spot you this high up?\" she says. She once again turns invisible and flies over a group of monsters. Among them is Josephine eating an ice cram cone. Sylvie sends a gust toward her that knocks the ice cream right into her cleavage. When the grootslang tries to fish it out she ends up getting sticky ice cream all over her breasts. While you feel a little bad you know that Sylvie's pranks are harmless. Not to mention seeing Josephine like that is a pretty great sight. Sylvie also sends a little gust at Manami, who is with Josephine. The hellhound girl lets out an EEP as her skirt flies up. She pushes it back down and turns slightly redder than usual. Sylvie flies up higher and laughs as she does a few loops. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

She can seemingly solidify or dissipate herself at will depending on if she wants to interact with others. Her skin is pale white/grey and her eyes glow with a dull yellow. She usually opts out of wearing clothes, instead shaping makeshift clothing from her smoky body to cover up any features for the sake of modesty.<br>\r\nDescription: Misty recently moved to the area. She is kind of a nerd and is rather shy around other monsters, and slightly less so with humans. However, she does has a mischievous side to her. If she manages to trust someone enough to open up to them, her personality seems to pull a 180, showing off a playfully dominant attitude. She's usually quicker to befriend humans as they are much less intimidating than other monsters. Though she may be dominant and bossy to friends, she never means any harm and is mostly just playing around. She apparently works as a night watch and inventory control at a store or warehouse. She never bothered to explain further than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that that is out of the way:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the house to your left. As you walked down the side of the walkway, you noticed a fog seemingly growing thicker. By the time you reached the door you could barely see 3 feet in front of you. After ringing the human level doorbell, you listened for footsteps or anything. It seemed silent. Maybe noone was home. As you turned around the fog seemed really thick, \"Hope I don't get lost in the lawn here.\" You mutter to yourself as you glance back at the door. \"Can I help you?\" A voice echoed all around you causing you to jump. You looked around, but didnt see anyone, not even a shadow in the fog. \"Um... Hello?\" You called out. Suddenly two giant glowing pale-yellow eyes seemingly materialized out of nowhere right in front of you startling you once more. \"Oh... I I'm sorry. I guess I should have gave you a heads up first. My name's Misty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the eyes as the voice echoed around you once more. \"You're... A cloud?\" You inquired trying to piece this all together. \"No... Well okay sorta in this case. So... Can I help you?\" You stared at the eyes, puzzled by her. \"Um. I was just stopping by to welcome you. This... Is your house right?\" The eyes seem to make a nodding motion and flow back to the door. \"Come on in... If... If you want that is.\" The eyes seem to fade and the mist starts to get thinner. Within seconds, the door opened slightly, giving you just enough room to walk inside. Inside, the room was rather dark, but you could still see some books, a TV with 2 video game systems and a table with cell phone, puzzle book, and some little (by the house's scale) figurines. \"Welcome.\" Turning around, you saw the fog starting to gather in one spot. Slowly taking on a humanoid form. As the process ended, you saw a fat, pale white woman with decent sized breasts staring down at you, her 'hair' was a dark shade of grey constantly flowing down her back. \"Hi... Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduce yourself to her an stand there awkwardly as she tries to think of a topic for small talk. \"So what are you exactly?\" You ask unfamiliar with her species. \"I'm an enenra. We're creatures of smoke and fog. I.. If you want I can maker self smaller if that scares you less.\" She offers but you quickly shake your head. \"Nono. You're fine the way you are.\" This smoke girl seemed friendly, though she was clearly quite shy. Even around someone so small by comparison. Maybe a tour of the house to break the ice. Or travel around the town with her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meg prefers a more primitive dress style based on her species' more barbaric cultural history, commonly wearing revealing clothes made from skins and furs, and rarely anything over that. She typically walks around barefoot as well.<br>\r\nDescription: Though both her heads have their own thoughts and preferences, they both consider themselves to be one creature named \"Meg\". Shared traits between the two include enjoying athletic activity, being something of a slob, and incredibly messy. The right head likes the idea of befriending or even marrying a human, while the left thinks of them more as cute potential pets or toys. Despite this, both halfs of Meg are friendly enough. What happens depends on which one is in control at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked the house the seemed the closest and made your way to the door. You spotted a few boxes outside the door and some dirty footprints on the way giving you a decent idea of how big this one was. As you reached the door you heard two voices talking inside. You couldn't quite make out what they were talking about, but both were clearly female. As you rang the doorbell, you heard both shout \"Comming!\" in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door swung open you just barely dodged a gigantic, dirty brown foot stepping outside to see who was there. <br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"There's no one here. Dumb kids and their stupid jokes.\" <br>\r\n\"Wait what about the other- oh look a human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you saw two identical faces looking down at you. The newcomer was seemed friendly enough, though she did smell a little and looked like she just finished working out based on her sweating and the one head panting a little. \"Um hi. I heard you just moved in and wanted to welcome you.\" The right head smiled \"Aww aren't you sweet. Why not come in and make yourself at home.\" The left head nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the home you were astonished at the state it was in in such a short time of being occupied. There were boxes, discarded clothes, even some food on the floor. \"S-so has the move been rough for you?\" You ask trying to be polite to your host. \"Nah, everything was over almost right away. We didnt pack too much so it was an easy move.\" The left head replied. \"Though it would be a lot easier if SOMEONE'S junk wasn't cluttering the weight room.\" The right head said.<br>\r\n\"At least half of it is your mess.\"<br>\r\n\"There's banana peals all over the corner. I don't even eat bananas!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh and I TOTALLY wear that sweatband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back away a little. \"If this is a bad time.\" Both heads turned back to you. \"Oh don't worry about this. It's nothing too big we just need to figure out what to do with this junk. Maybe after we get to know you. After all you're the first neighbor to visit. We need to celebrate.\"</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve already put in a good word about you.\u201d You smile at that before Olga finishes her sentence. \u201cBest seat cushion I know.\u201d \u201cGee,\u201d you say sarcastically. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long before you sister lands and lays you on the ground. She hands you a note to take a quick look at. \u201cI wrote down the three addresses with the new arrivals. If they give you any trouble. Call me.\u201d \u201cThanks Sis.\u201d You say. Olga turns around and shakes her large rear and horse\u2019s tail over you as she smirks. \u201cBirdbrain.\u201d You think to yourself as you walk away to get acquainted with the new neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Just to make myself clear, when you add O.C.s, I\u2019d like you to list their first and last names. And just to make it interesting, for each of these three spots for O.C.s, I will offer a 1000GP reward.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You head towards the nearest address and walk up to the house. There is a mailbox in the yard that says HOWLER. Its just as normal as any of the other houses so you might as well see whats up. You walk to the door and ring the bell. Conveniently all house's in Scream Town have doorbells at human and monster height. After a couple of seconds a rumbling signals the houses owner coming. The door opens and standing there is a chubby werewolf girl with an amazing rack. She's got red fur but her ears, paws, and tail are black. After looking around she looks down and sees you. \"Oh! Hello!\" she says and bends down to pick you up. As her paw reaches for you she stops suddenly. \"Sorry! I forgot to ask! Is it okay to pick you up?\" she asks politely. \"Of course it is.\" you say. She grabs you in her paw and lifts you  up to her face. \"I'm Rick, and I'm here to welcome you to the neighborhood.\" you say. The werewolf girl smiles. \"How nice! I'm Penumbra Howler, but most people call me Penny.\" she tells you. \"How about we get out of the cold?\" She then carries you into the house and shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks through her home you look around and can tell she's still unpacking. It seems pretty well furnished and looks great, despite being unfinished. She sets you down on a table near the couch. One thing you do see is pictures of many other werewolves, probably her family. One picture has a group photo and there are quite a bit of wolves in it. Its amazing how diverse her family is. There are gray wolves, brown wolves, black, white, and even a golden furred one. Most of them appear to be on the heavy side. In the group photo Penny is next to another red wolf, only this one doesn't have black in her fur. She's also taller. While you estimate Penny to be about 650 feet tall, this one looks about 1000 feet. There are several pictures of Penny with this girl, even pictures of them as children. \"Thats my sister, Autumn.\" Penny says when she sees you looking. \"She's really tough and always looked out for me when we were kids. I bet she could even beat a gargoyle! She's so tough she lives in Panicburg with no problems!\" Penny seems to really look up to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you do for a living?\" you ask. She goes red and gestures for you to look around. \"Well you probably can't tell because I'm still working on it but I'm an interior designer. I decided to redo the house when I moved in so thats why it looks more hectic than it should. I'm not that good though.\" You look around again admire the place. It might still be in progress but it definitely is good. She picked great wallpaper and carpet, and she has a little moon motif going on. \"I think it looks awesome!\" you tell her. Penny blushes and smiles widely. \"I became interested after my sister became an architect. I'm not cut out for building places, but decorating and designing is my passion. The two of us have even worked together sometimes. Its so great to get to work with my big sister!\"  Penny seems really nice and innocent. Strange for a predatory species like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it you don't eat humans?\" you ask. Her head droops and she looks at you nervously. \"I used to, but I felt bad for them, so I gave it up. I won't lie though, I still really like the taste.\" Then she gets rather flustered. \"But I won't eat them! Please don't hate me!\" she pleads. You chuckle and walk up to her paw. \"Don't worry.\" you say as you climb aboard. \"You seem like a sweet girl, one of the nicest I've met in fact.\" Penny grins and her tail wags. \"Thank you. I hope the rest of the neighborhood is as nice as you.\" she says. What do you do next?</span></div></div>",

Man this girl is really timid for a werewolf. When she's done stammering she goes over to a wall that has no wallpaper and begins to put some up. Its sort of a midnight blue color with a white moon here and there. As she works you can't help but look at her rear, which is pretty darn nice. She finishes with the wallpaper and turns just in time to catch you. You quickly look away but she clearly knows because her cheeks are a little more red than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo...how long have you been in this business?\" you ask. \"Oh years.\" she answers. \"I started a little while after my sister started her business. At first I felt like I was just chasing after her, but soon I realized I love this job. Seeing people's faces when they see their homes and love it makes me so happy!\" she says. \"So do you get a lot of business?\" you ask. \"I do alright.\" she says. \"In addition to people's homes, I've also done work for restaurants, shops, and things like that.\" Her work must be really good for her to get that much business. You doubt she'll admit that though, this girl seems pretty humble.\"Is there anything I can do to help?\" you ask. Penny tilts her head. \"Let me think, there might be something someone as small as you can do.\" Then she backtracks that statement. \"I wasn't implying you're useless or anything!\" You hold up a hand. \"Its okay, its okay.\" you say. She may be timid, but god is she cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" she says and rummages around for something. What she finds is a human sized paint brush. \"I found a set of human sized art tools at a yard sale and bought them on a whim.\" she says and hands it to you. Then she picks you up and holds you up to the border of her wall. It looks pretty done but you guess she wants to work on it some more. \"I was going to do it myself but I bet it will be easier for you.\" she informs you. \"I wanted  some stars and moons on the borders but they need to be really small. I could do it but it would be quicker this way.\" You nod and begin painting as best you can. She gives you some golden colored paint and carries you from each spot to the next, telling you where to paint. She even stands on a ladder so you can get the higher places. When its done she looks around proudly. \"Good job!\" she says. \"Really? You think?\" you ask a little nervously. \"Of course! I'm so glad to have a helpful friend like you!\" Then she lifts you up and gives you a friendly lick, then another. She stares at you for a second before... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over and over her giant tongue assaults and she looks like she's enjoying herself. \"Uh Penny?\" you say. She licks you a couple more times before stopping. When she realizes what she was doing her face becomes flushed. \"I'm so sorry! You just taste so good! I swear I would never eat you!\" she cries as she sets you down on the table. You look up and see that she's really shaken up. \"Penny, its fine. I trust you.\" you tell her. \"Really?\" she asks and bends down to your level. Her giant face is right in front of you with a hopeful look. \"Yeah, you seem like really nice girl.\" you tell her. Penny's tail wags back and forth and she smiles. \"Thank you! I don't want my first friend in town to end up hating me!\" she says and snatches you up. She hugs you to her chest and you enjoy the feeling of her soft boobs. \"Oh, did I hug you too hard?\" she asks as she pulls you away. \"No, its fine.\" you say looking at those giant pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we take a break?\" you suggest. \"That sounds good.\" Penny says and carries you to her kitchen. Like the rest of her house this room has a night sky motif. Her table and chairs are painted midnight blue, and the backs of the chairs have stars and crescent moons carved into them. \"I gotta say the more I see the better this place gets..\" you comment looking around. \"Its nothing, really.\" Penny says happily. She puts you on the table and goes to the fridge. She rummages around with her large rear in your face and comes back with a plate of cake. \"Here, lets have a snack.\" she says. You sit there and wait as she cuts a slice of cake. You walk up to the gigantic cake while Penny returns the rest to the fridge. You reach out and run your finger along the icing and taste it. Its delicious!. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table shakes a little while you sample the cake and soon Penny is back. \"Couldn't wait?\" she asks with a grin. \"Sorry, but its so good!\" you say. She breaks off a piece for you and begins eating her own. As you chomp on your portion you stare up at her eating hers. Her gigantic maw devours enough cake to fill a room with each bite. Although she doesn't eat humans her teeth look just as deadly nonetheless. \"Hey my piece doesn't have any icing.\" you say. Penny jokingly takes a finger and wipes frosting all over you. Both of you laugh but then she frowns a little. \"Is that okay? You're not mad are you?\" she asks. \"Its fine, this stuff tastes great anyway.\" you say. She then picks you up and eyes you a little hungrily. \"Go ahead.\" you say with a grin. She smiles and then licks the icing from your body. When she's done you ask if she'd like to go outside and see more of the neighborhood. She agrees and heads outside with you in her paw. She gives you another couple of licks as one of the neighbors walks by. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unbeknownst to you or Penny, the neighbour passing by was none other than Olga, your hippogriff adoptive sister. At first she just gave a glancing look, as the two of you passed by, Penny giving you licks while you kept a deadpan expression. But then she did a double take and screamed at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RICK??! HEY, YOU! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING TO MY LITTLE BROTHER?\" the two of you froze, and Penny slowly turned around, her tongue still hanging outside her mouth. Sensing trouble, you took a step forward and waved your hands to Olga, but she was too incensed. The wolf merely trembled, afraid, as the hippogriff lady stomped right to her face with a glare that could kill a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olga! It's not what you think! She's not trying to eat me!\" you shout at her, opening your arms wide as if to protect Penny. It was an odd spectacle, to say the least, as if a human the size of a amoeba could shield a huge giant of a wolf. You prayed inwardly that Olga would back off, or at least calm down enough to reason with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, luck was on your side, it would seem, as Olga regarded you with an indignant expression. \"Rick? Why are you defending this mangy mutt? Did you hit your head or something?\" She leaned closer to you, her titanic eyes making contact with yours. \" She. Was. About. To. Eat. YOU.\" as if you needed her to spell it out. This was all a huge misunderstanding, and you were clearly not willing to deal with that, so you put on a stern face and cross your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, Olga, she was just being friendly. Olga, meet Penumbra, or Penny as she likes to be called. She just moved in recently, and I was showing her around the neighborhood.\" Penny merely nodded, having been rendered mute by your sister's outrage. Speaking of which, while she did indeed calm down, Olga still cast a few looks that overflowed with suspicion at the wolf. With a grunt, she straightened herself up, and gave you a pat on the head with one of her talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If you say so... but I'm keeping my eyes on her...\" she mumbled, turning to Penny, her anger now abated somewhat. \"As you heard, I'm Olga Rowling, his adoptive older sister. I happen to live nearby.\" she said, and the shy wolf just muttered an almost inaudible 'hello', which puzzled Olga a bit. \"Aren't you a little too shy for a wolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whose fault is that?\" you ask, sardonic. Olga rolls her eyes and shrugs. \"Where were you going, anyways?\" you ask her out of curiosity, as well as to divert attention from Penny, who, even though the misunderstanding had been cleared out, was still quite nervous and intimidated. Not that you could blame her, Olga was always the overprotective kind of big sister, even while growing up as kids. You still remember that one time she scared off a minotaur and a western dragon that had tried to bully you, when you were kids. They were so terrified of her, they turned a new leaf, and never bothere anyone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to go to the library on Autumn Avenue, Ororo has a few reference books I can borrow for my next project.\" hearing this, Penny's ears twitched, and you felt her hand shake a little more than before. Both you and Olga notice this, and look to her. Was she... anxious? Happy? Both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...umm, miss ... a-are you the one who wrote 'The Heart in the Stone'? The book about the wandering Golem?\" when Olga nodded affirmatively, Penny let out a fangirl-like squeal and began hopping in excitement, with you fighting a losing battle to remain balanced in her paw. \"I love your works! I remember the description you made about the architecture, the interior designs in the castles and places in that book, it was very inspirational!!\" Olga was just as surprised as you, but pleasantly so, given that she wasn't expecting to meet a fan of her works. \"Can I have your autograph? Oh please please pleeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, settle down, girl. Be careful with Rick.\" admonishing the enthusiastic wolf with a chuckle, the hippogriff took out a pen from her purse, as well as a small notebook. Ripping a page from it, she left her signature and handed it to Penny, who took with with extreme caution with her free hand. Suffice to say, it was an amusing sight, if one could find humour in it, just a few moments ago, Penumbra was as shy and withdrawn as a mouse, and now, she was practically glowing with joy. \"Ugh, I almost forgot, I'm getting late, I promised Ororo I would be there soon, so we could go for a coffee.\" poking you on your chest with one massive talon, she sighs. \"Look Rick, just stay out of trouble, alright? And you-\" turning to Penny, who was still fawning over the autograph, her eyes practically shot out beams of radiance and happyness. \"- don't even dare to think you're off the hook. If I know something happened to him while he was with you...\" Olga points at her eyes with one hand, and then to Penumbra, who swallowed and lowered her gaze to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...s-sorry about before, I promise I won't do it again, miss Rowling.\" you cannot help but give your sister a look, and she gets the message, scratching her beak with a sigh, she looks away, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry too, I kinda went guns blazing without even knowing what was going on, alright? Maybe I'll drop by some time for some hot tea, it's not every day I get to meet a fan like you.\" pulling her sleeve up, Olga looks at the time and groans. \"We'll talk more another time, okay? Stay out of trouble, you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the two of you watch as Olga, waves and walks off to Autumn Avenue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind her, she's always like this when it comes to me being with strangers.\" you chuckle, and Penny giggles nervously. \"Besides, you actually got something out of this meeting, I had no idea you liked Olga's writing.\" with a blush, your lupine friend resumes walking at a leisurely pace, down the snow-covered sidewalk. Casually, both you and Penny keep exchanging stories related to your respective youths, with you telling her how many times Olga rescued your butt from dangers, and Penumbra telling you about her large family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

She gently prods you with her tongue and rolls you over it like a piece of candy. \"Penny! Penny! What are you doing!?\" You shout, but you get no response. After awhile she pins you against the inside of her cheek while lapping at you with her giant tongue. Outside, Penny moans in bliss as she continues to savor you flavor. She closes her eyes and finds herself whisked away to a world of color and soft music. She sits down in a nearby chair and starts to hum a little tune to herself. Inside her mouth it sounds surprisingly gentle, however, the song she was humming wasn't the biggest thing on your mind as you attempt to push her tongue off of you. \"Penny!\" You shout again. The wolf girls ears twitch and her eyes flutter open, she looks down at the table she's sitting at to ask answer you and realizes you aren't there. Here eyes then widen as she realizes where you are. \"Oh no...\" She mutters to herself. Inside of her mouth, all movement stops and you find yourself sitting in the center of her tongue. After a few moments you feel yourself sliding down her tongue toward the front of her mouth, her fangs and lips part and the tip of her tongue slides over her lower lip allowing you to slide out of her mouth and into her waiting paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you land in her paw you fall flat on your back and lay there, dazed and confused. You stare up to see Penny's face with an apologetic expression glued to it. \"I'm so sorry Rick... I didn't mean to... I'd never... I just...\" Her eyes began to tear up as she searched and grasped for the words to explain her actions. Eventually, all she was able to do was quietly whimper as tears streamed down her cheeks. She was sure that she'd lost her very first human friend. You felt like you were supposed to say something to her, but you weren't sure what. After a few minutes, she calmed herself enough to talk, \"I'm sorry Rick... I'm sure that you'd like nothing more than to get as far away from me as possible. I don't blame you... I just want you to know that I could never and would never eat you.\" She then stood up and started walking to the front door, \"I'll let you get out of here so you can forget about this whole thing, and you'll never have to see me again,\" She said between sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny wait!\" you called up to her, prompting her to stop and look down at you. \"Yes?\" She asked as she stared at you sullenly. \"I believe you, and I still want to be your friend.\" Penny stared at you dumbfounded, \"But... I... I put you in my mouth! How can you be around me without being afraid I'll eat you?\" She asks incredulously. \"Because,\" You reply, \"You said you wouldn't and I believe you.\" Penny shook her head, \"Rick, I appreciate what you're trying to do but I know that I scared you. You really thought I was going to eat you, I won't force you to be near me when it causes you constant dread\" Penny replied. You shake your head emphatically, \"But it doesn't cause me dread! I can prove it!\" Penny stares at you skeptically, \"How?\" She asks. Hmmm, how indeed, that's a good question. So how are you going to prove that you're not afraid of her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Penumbra is unpacking, you can't help but continue to look at her photographs. \"Penumbra,\" you say. \"You certainly have a big family.\" \"Well,\" says Penny. \"I <i>am</i> a werewolf. Werewolves usually have big families. My grandmother's grandmother had a lot of children.\" You look through the photographs and it would seem that Penny's family came in a large variety. They were mainly women and from the looks of it, they were as heavily built as Penumbra and her sister, some even moreso. There were only three skinny girls that you could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne photograph depicted a group photo. There was one obese brown furred wolf girl who wearing what looked like a black jacket with a purple skirt with giraffe like spots and a pink shirt with striped stockings. Next to her was a pear-shaped werewolf girl resembling a dire wolf with her hair worn in a ponytail. Another wolf girl in the photograph was a gold furred wolf woman who was wearing a red hood like Little Red Ridinghood. You almost laugh at the irony. Another of the wolves was a fat gray furred wolf girl with a reddish tint in her fur like a lunar eclipse. She was wearing a tight sweater on her entire body. Another wolf in the photograph was a girl who resembled more of a collie than a wolf from her red and white fur. She was stark naked but her fur was covered in paint stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are a lot of your cousins like you, Penny?\" Penny nervously bites her lip. \"Well, we're all artists. Artistic talent runs in the family. But, I don't recommend you meeting any of my cousins. At least not the ones that wouldn't come to Screamtown.\" \"What does... oh.\" You realize that a lot of Penny's cousins are probably human eaters. \"Right there in that photograph,\" says Penny. \"Those are a few of my cousins.\" First she points to the one in the black coat. \"That's cousin Lupa from Horrorville. She's a fashion designer.\" \"That would explain the outfit.\" \"I'd be careful around her,\" says Penny. \"Humans make up most of Lupa's diet. Next to her is April.\" She points to the dire wolf girl. \"Looks like all the humans that one ate went straight to her hips.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" says Penumbra. \"April doesn't eat humans. She actually has a crush on one.\" \"Maybe she should move to Scream Town.\" You think to yourself. \"Uh, what about the one in the sweater.\" \"That's Selene,\" says Penny. \"She's really anti-social. Lives in the mountains. She's a carver. Over there in the hood is Cousin Miranda.\" \"A wolf in a red hood,\" you say. \"That's ironic. Does she eat humans?\" \"Afraid so, but she has a human friend.\" You look up in confusion. \"He's a special case,\" says Penumbra. \"Edgar, I think his name is. He's immortal so he can actually be eaten by my cousin and survive.\" You shiver. \"And the collie woman.\" \"Colleen,\" says Penumbra. \"You don't have to worry about her, she hates humans. Thinks they taste terrible. The first human she ever put in her mouth, she immediately spat back out.\" You let out a laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at another photograph that depicts several werewolf girls that look like they're from different parts of the monster world. One in particular is a British looking white furred wolf girl with long flowing black hair in a purple gown with long sleeves. Then you look and see a photograph that depicts a family of three that also has a rare example of a male wolf in Penny's family. It consisted of a female werewolf resembling an obese akita. The akita wolf woman was wearing nothing but a bikini that looked like it was made of dinosaur bones. Her husband was a light gray furred and muscle-bound wolf man with long white hair and a beard who was wearing nothing but a speedo and a vest that was shaped like a wolf's head. From the looks of it, they had a daughter as well. The daughter resembled her mother but with her father's fur color and blonde hair. She had a large and fat torso but with muscular arms and legs, though not as thick as Autumn's. She was wearing a pair of glasses and what looked like a football uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my cousin Nova and her husband Bradford,\" says Penny. \"They live in Direopolis.\" \"Direopolis?\" you ask. \"Noreen's mom lives there. That's one pretty unwelcoming looking bikini on Nova.\" \"Nova is an artisan who crafts jewelry and swimwear from bones of dinosaurs... and humans.\" Says Penny. You shiver in place. \"And their daughter.\" \"Clancy?\" asks Penny. \"Clancy is actually the only wolf in the family who isn't an artist. Instead she's on her high school's football team.\" \"Interesting career choice.\" Penny lets out a sigh. \"Nova says that football is probably the only future Clancy has,\" says Penny. \"She flunked art class and she's a terrible hunter.\" \"Ouch.\" You think to yourself. That probably doesn't help her self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last photograph you notice is one that depicts another family, except this one depicted a mother with two daughters, twins from the looks of it. The mother was a gray werewolf that looked obese even by the standards of the women in her family, in contrast to her hourglass figured daughters. One twin was a black furred wolf girl with blue eyes while the other was an albino white-furred wolf with red eyes. For some reason, the white wolf looked familiar. \"And what about these three?\" you ask Penumbra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenumbra looks at the photograph nervously. \"Oh,\" she says. \"I hoped you wouldn't notice that one. That's my aunt Diana and her daughters; Hecate and Persephone.\" \"Persephone?!\" you yell in horror. \"You're related to Persephone!?\" You heard about Persephone. She was a vicious cannibal who preyed on other monsters as well as humans. She had a rather high body count and was locked up in Under Gloom for her horrible crimes.\" Penumbra sees the fear on her face and frowns. \"So you've heard of her. Persephone is the... black sheep of the Howler family.\" \"Interesting choice of words,\" you say. \"I don't mean any offense.\" Penumbra let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persephone's arrest didn't do the family much good. Aunt Diana took it the hardest. Watching her daughter be convicted for cannibalism sucked the sanity right out of her. Hecate on the other hand, despises her sister and considers her crimes to be unforgivable.\" You lower your head. \"I'm sorry, Penny.\" Penny smiled nervously trying to change the subject. \"As you can see, I have a lot of cousins. In fact, I have three cousins here in Scream Town. I don't think you know them. One lives in Springtime Street while the other two live in Summer Side and Autumn Avenue respectively.\" You then hear a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Penny. \"That must be them now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is at the door?</span></div></div>",

She looks about 900 feet tall. Her breasts are huge even in comparison to her size. She's wearing a button up shirt that is pretty tight on her breasts and a pair of tight jeans. The other two are both pear shaped and around 750 feet tall. One of them has bright orange fur and wild looking hair that reaches her butt. She's wearing a low cut shirt that shows off her huge boobs and a pair of jeans. The other has midnight colored fur and straight hair that also reaches her butt. She's wearing a t-shirt, also with a pair of jeans. When they enter they all give Penny a big hug. \"So glad you moved to Scream Town!\" the gray wolf says. \"Yeah, its been so long since we've seen you, and now you live in the same town!\" the orange wolf says happily. The blue wolf smiles. \"How are you adjusting?\" she asks. \"Oh I'm doing well.\" Penny answers. \"I've got my redecorating underway and I even made a new friend already!\" she says gesturing toward you. You suddenly feel like you're on the spot with all these wolves focusing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark gray wolf walks over and leans down in front of you. \"Whats your name little guy?\" she asks. \"I'm Rick.\" you say a little nervously. When the wolfess notices your tenseness she gives you a smile. \"You don't have to be on edge.\" she tells you. \"If I ate humans I wouldn't be living in Scream Town.\" That does make sense. You relax a little and she offers her claw. You grab it as best as you can and shake it. \"My name is Remy by the way.\" she says. Remy Howler? Why does that sound familiar? Then it hits you. \"Are you an author?\" you ask. She grins and nods. \"Yup, and a best selling one at that.\" she says. You've actually read a few of her books since Scream Town's library provides both human and monster sized editions. She's actually pretty famous, right up there with authors like Cadence Deadman. \"Scream Town is a great place to live. I live on Springtime Street.\" she continues. \"Its peaceful and everyone gets along, so I can concentrate when I need to.\" She's lightly scratching your head as she talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Remy scratches you like a small animal the other two wolves walk over. When they get there you notice just how alike they look. The orange wolf bends down with a smile, giving you a great view of her massive furry breasts. \"Hey Ricky! My name is Skolla! I live on Summer Side.\" she says brightly and rubs your head. The midnight wolf smiles as well, but its a more reserved smile. \"Hello, I'm her sister Hatie, and I live on Autumn Avenue.\" she says. Seeing them standing over you sparks something in your memory. They look kind of familiar. Then it hits you. \"Wait a minute! You guys are-!\" you say before Skolla butts in. \"Thats right! Skolla and Hatie Howler! Otherwise known as Ragnarok!\" she says. These two are a famous singing duo called Ragnarok. You've heard some of their songs and sometimes catch them on TV. They're really talented. What are the odds of having so many celebrities in your very own town? Not to mention such attractive ones. They all stand over you and you're surrounded by giant boobs. Remy seems really laid back, and by the way Skolla and Hatie are looking at you, it seems like they're flirting. </span></div></div>",

She walks over and gives you a little pat before heading to the kitchen. \"I'll get us something to eat.\" she calls from the other room. Skolla leans down so that her face is right in front of you. \"I see something pretty tasty looking right now.\" she says slyly. You back up a little nervously and bump into something large and wet. Turning your head you see a huge wolf nose. Hatie is leaning down as well. \"Relax, she's not talking about eating you.\" the midnight wolfess says with a smirk. You smile meekly, unsure of what to say. With two giant werewolf beauties flirting with you, you're kind of at a loss for words. Never mind the fact that they're also celebrities. Skolla knocks you over with her claw and Hatie proceeds to lightly scratch your belly. You struggle but also smile at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming sound approaches as Remy walks over. You're staring at the ceiling so the first thing you see are her humongous boobs blocking your view. \"Okay you two, let the little guy breathe.' she says and plucks you from the table. She places you on her shoulder and pets your head. \"No need for too much excitement huh?' she says with a smirk. \"Uh thanks.\" you tell her. You find yourself glancing down at her boobs every so often. Its not like you can help it, they're huge even by monster standards! \"Hey can you blame us?\" Skolla says. \"Look how cute he is!\" Hatie nods in agreement while Remy rolls her eyes. \"I'm sure we'll get to know each other better.\" Hatie says. Skolla buts in as well. \"And we share everything.\" she adds with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny returns with a big bowl and sets it down. You look down and see that its filled with cattle. Remy reaches down and grabs a handful. You watch in horror/amazement as she shoves it in her mouth. You know she doesn't eat human but the sight of her gigantic sharp teeth grinding up that many cows is unnerving. You look over and see the other three digging in as well. Penny glances at you and swallows her food. \"Oh! I'm sorry Rick!\" she says and runs back to the kitchen. When she returns she has a plate with a single helping of beef she cooked. \"I know humans don't eat raw meat so I prepared this for you.\" Remy sets you down on the plate and you walk toward your meal. While a single cow is nothing to these giant women its way too much for you. Thankfully Penny was nice enough to cut out the head, legs, and other various parts you wouldn't eat. You don't have any utensils but don't want to be rude so you dig in with your bare hands. As you munch on the beef you become aware that you are being watched. Looking up you see that all of them are hovering over you smiling. \"I'll admit, that is pretty cute.\" Remy says as you look up with beef juice on your face. Skolla squeals with glee and you all continue to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you've had your fill you sit back and pat your belly. \"I take it you're done?\" Remy asks and grabs the rest of your cow. She licks it off of her claw and burps. Now that thats over you...</span></div></div>",

Hatie steps in with a smile. \"Doesn't seem like there's much a human could help with though, so we could take him off your hands.\" she says slyly. Skolla is more conspicuous. \"Thats fine, right?\" she says as she snatches you up. Penny is caught off guard for a second. \"I guess..\" she says. \"Great!\" the orange wolf says and quickly exits with her sister on her heels. Penny is left with Remy, who shakes her head. \"I hope they're not too rough on the little guy\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know whats happening as you feel the outside air on your face. You're sitting in Skolla's brightly colored paw as she's walking down the street of Winter Way. \"Well Ricky, its time you got to know us now!\" she says with a smile. \"My place is closer, so we'll head there.\" Hatie says. Skolla grins and brings you to her face. \"We didn't drive, so we'll be going on foot.\" she says before placing you in her cleavage. \"I need you to hold on as tight as you can okay?\" she says sweetly. You do as she says, unsure of what she means. Suddenly the world shifts as she drops down on all four. Before you know it she's running on all fours, her sister beside her. You grasp her orange fur tightly as her boobs are tossed about. As the breast you're on thrashes about you are slammed into the other one. You don't whether its good or bad, but don't really have time to think in between collisions. You just have to endure it until its over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Skolla begins to slow down and you her boobs stop thrashing around. The world shifts again as she stands up and starts walking again. Hatie follows and you look up to see a nice looking house painted dark blue. Hatie heads to the door first and unlocks it, letting Skolla inside. You look around from her cleavage and check out the decor. There are a lot of dark colors, but it doesn't give off a dark atmosphere. There are also various moons around the house. The dark blue wallpaper has crescent moons in different spots and you see a picture of a full moon on the wall. \"Like it?\" Hatie asks. You nod and look around more. \"Yeah, it seems really relaxing.' you tell her. She smiles at the compliment and Skolla takes you out of her boobs. \"Later on we'll go to my place, but for now lets kick back here.\" she says and gives you a lick. </span></div></div>",

You hope that they are nice and all, and you hope that they are friendly, and from what you can hear in there, that there is a lot of panicking on so many levels. \"We got someone meeting us today sis.\" said by some sort of a young human girl's voice. The door then opens, and what revealed soon to be was a european dragonness. She is a black dragon with sharp teeth, big breasts that is cover by her red bikini, sharp ears, fangs, claws, etc. Pretty much any thing you would see in a monster. Her name is Chantal Cordeon, and she is a European dragoness, a around 1000ft dragonness to be exact. Her eyes are red as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I have panicked a little bit. It's just this place is freaking cold! I am Chantal.\" she said nicely, but shouted on the cold part. \"I am Rick. Nice to meet you.\" and appearing is a girl who is wearing a sweater, sweat pants, that are both pink. She has black hair, green eyes, and she looks adorable. \"I am Kiki. I am her daughter.\" she revealed. This is kinda surprising, you didn't expect her to be a daughter of a titanic monster dragon who hates the cold. \"I don't like the cold as well, I totally wish we could live in the summer or spring areas.\" (she is 4'6 or something case you ask.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree on so many levels with you.\" Chantal said, just as she comes and picks up her daughter and has her ride her shoulder. \"Well it's nice to meet you Rick. This is our home, it's typical, and my daughter has a mini-home in this house where she lives in without problems. We get along well just great.\" Chantal smiled just as she licks Kiki, to her annoyance. \"Stop it!\" Kiki smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

We just came for the necessary stuff, like Kiki a miniature home since this house is massive for her in it's current state, and also gave some to charity. Still we have a money, and it will collect interest.\" she tells him, showing her the house. The house is cheap, that's for sure, as it's has only one bedroom, and the house has one bedroom (miniature house is in there) and most importantly, it's not super big, but not small at all. Just about right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, I don't share the information with anyone. I have heard many winners from some websites on how people would start asking for money and stuff.\" Kiki even added as well. \"I won't ask for any.\" I told them. \"Good. Say, we are going to go to the beach today, want to join?\" they asked him. \"Uh, no, because I am a bit busy today, but another time maybe?\" I told them, just to stay on their good side. \"Okay.

The house was pretty typical, it does have what she needs (school supplies, HDTV, other girly stuff), and thankfully Kiki is able to cook as it has an easy cooking system inside. It was a nice house, but nothing fancy by any means. \"Say, just like your mother, you live cheap as well.\" you told them. \"Of course silly, and it isn't big and stuff. I also got a few rooms when my young human friends come here to stay for the weekend and stuff.\" Kiki said just as she shows you the remainder of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can totally see this. Sometimes that is exactly what I need. I am currently playing in the monster lottery, with the prize money being 258 million. I always dreamed of living in a mansion and all.\" you said to them, and then Kiki stops you for a second. \"Just for you know, if you are planning that, remember... annually so you don't have to pay the MIRS (the monster version of the IRS) much, and do not go with the lump sum, and I just live with what you got just in case. You know what happens if you start blowing your money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes.\" you told them, knowing that you got the point all that well. \"From the looks of the home, you might have given me a good point proven true. I got to get going, I will see you girls later.\" Chantal then takes you and Kiki out of the house and back outside and then they nicely say \"Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go now?</span></div></div>",

She had very large breasts, wide hips, a huge butt, and some rather long legs. But what really caught your attention was her belly. It was enormous, easily the biggest you'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan monster looked down and saw you. She smiled brightly. \"Oh. You must be Rick. I was told you were coming. My name is Olesya. I am a Rusalka.\" She said proudly in a thick Russian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Rusalka?\" You asked, unable to tear your eyes away from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Russian water nymph.\" She answered. Then she realized you were staring at her belly. \"Oh. You like my belly, don't you? Yeah, I've been getting those kinds of looks for a while now. Comes with being pregnant with octuplets. Would you like to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally tearing your eyes away, you agree and enter the house with her. You enter the living room and begin talking. You found out that she was going to start working at the local clinic as a nurse. You also learned that she loved spy movies, especially the 007 series. She was bi-sexual and had a dragon boyfriend who got her pregnant. When he found out, he dumped her. When you asked when she was due, she responded that her boyfriend, who could do some magic, cursed her so that she could never give birth. You were going to say that was hard to believe, but then you remembered that you lived in a city full of giant monsters, so you just changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night fell, you said you had to go home. But when you got up to go to the door, she asked a question you were not expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, would you like to stay just a little longer?

Darkly Yang moved to Scream Town for one purpose and one purpose only, to duel Gabriella Gallops. Yang considers herself one of the world's great magic users and she thinks the only way to prove that is to beat Gabriella in a wizard's duel, though the unicorn giantess has thus far refused. Still she became a quick friend of yours after you showed interest in her magic and species' history. Yang is still young for a Dragon and as such is very vain, prideful, and arrogant. She uses her shape shifting powers to stoop aging and retain her beauty. Despite her often rude and arrogant behavior, Yang is very smart and knows almost as much about magic as Gabriella, though if you say that to Yang it'll get you a face full of flame. She also has a heart of gold and makes for one of the most loyal friends you could ask for. She loves humans, though that may be because humans in Asia once worshiped her kind as river gods. It is unclear at time if she wants to be your friend or your master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSummer Side- Summer Side is the hottest section of Scream Town and is permanently locked in summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Josephine Biggs<br>\r\nSpecies: Grootslang<br>\r\nHeight: 1200ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous blue skinned reptilian monster resembling an African elephant with large tusks and a snake for a trunk acting as a second mouth.

Kandi has had her eye on you and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re narrowly avoided being snatched up by her multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alexandria \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlex\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luxor<br>\r\nSpecies: Sphinx<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft (On all fours) Full Height Unknown<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese scarlet sphinx with neck length strawberry blonde hair and enormous white wings bigger than her entire body.

While she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad person, this tigress has a volatile temper and prefers to be left alone when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a particularly nasty mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Eileen Dinkley<br>\r\nSpecies: Argus<br>\r\nHeight: 1275ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant yellow skinned monster girl with one thousand eyes all over her body and orange hair worn in a bobcut.

She usually opts out of wearing clothes, instead shaping makeshift clothing from her smoky body to cover up any features for the sake of modesty.<br>\r\nDescription: An OC by Pyro. Misty recently moved to the area. She is kind of a nerd and is rather shy around other monsters, and slightly less so with humans. However, she does has a mischievous side to her. If she manages to trust someone enough to open up to them, her personality seems to pull a 180, showing off a playfully dominant attitude. She's usually quicker to befriend humans as they are much less intimidating than other monsters. Though she may be dominant and bossy to friends, she never means any harm and is mostly just playing around. She apparently works as a night watch and inventory control at a store or warehouse. She never bothered to explain further than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan \"Meg\" Ferr<br>\r\nSpecies: Ettin<br>\r\nHeight: 900ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A tall, muscular, two-headed humanoid giant with a brownish skin tone. Both of the heads have messy, long, dark red hair and green eyes.

She typically walks around barefoot as well.<br>\r\nDescription: Another OC of Pyro's. Though both her heads have their own thoughts and preferences, they both consider themselves to be one creature named \"Meg\". Shared traits between the two include enjoying athletic activity, being something of a slob, and incredibly messy. The right head likes the idea of befriending or even marrying a human, while the left thinks of them more as cute potential pets or toys. Despite this, both halfs of Meg are friendly enough. What happens depends on which one is in control at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWinter Way- Winter Way is the section of Screamtown where it is perpetually winter.

However Eris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magic is far inferior to Gabriella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and she can barely get her spells right. You know about this behavior but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve decided not to tell Gabriella to avoid getting Eris in trouble with her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Pauline Pride<br>\r\nSpecies: Nemean Lion<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A fat black furred lioness with golden blonde hair.

She hates the fact that monsters and humans live in peace in Screamtown, especially because under the laws of the town, she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed to eat humans, which are her favorite food. Because of this, she is a heavy drinker to make up for the humans she can no longer eat and is even more aggressive because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Penumbra \"Penny\" Howler<br>\r\nSpecies: Werewolf<br>\r\nHeight: 650ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A chubby red furred werewolf girl with black ears, black paws and a black tail.<br>\r\nDescription: An addition by Infinitebull.
