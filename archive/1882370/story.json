As the infernal beeping of the wretched machine wrested her from her peaceful sleep, her senses slowly flooded back to her; the misceallneous noise of other students racketing about in the halls falling into order; the sunlight creeping in through the crack in the blinds taking form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up out of bed, and made for the bathroom, slowly approaching the mirror therein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how she hated mirrors. They reminded other people of what they had. They only reminded her of what she'd lost. Everytime she looked at one, at herself, all she could think about was the fire. Oh god, the fire. It had taken everything from her. Her home, her parents, even a part of herself. As if at the order of a cruel judge, Hanako had been given horrendous burn scars on half of her body, a sort of branding, perhaps, the fire claiming ownership of the wretched girl with no house or kin. She certainly felt like it owned her, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping deeply, Hanako snapped out of it and put these negative thoughts out of her head as she approached the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it, she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh, yes, Hanako remembered the fire. She remembered the scars. But, mostly, she remembered the torment. She remembered the jeers and taunts of her peers, people she thought were her friends, torturing her over the most devastating moment in her entire life, every day being reminded of the event that took her parents and disfigured her for life. But that wasn't the only reason she was bullied. She was also the fattest kid in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fire, Hanako was inconsolable. She had gone taciturn, rarely speaking, shied away from people, left her room only when necessary. She had no friends at the Orphanage. The other children were too intimidated by her scarred appearance to even so much as approach her. And at the end of the day, she preferred it that way. Like they would be able to comfort her. The only thing that gave her any comfort was food. When her parents died, she filled the whole that they left with delicious, glorious food. Creamy cakes, chewy cookies, cold ice cream, if she could get her hands on it, she would devour it whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fire, Hanako wasn't just at an average size for her age, she was rail thin. But when she became a comfort eater, this quickly came to an end. She EXPLODED. In her first month at the orphanage, she gained twenty pounds, her once slim belly becoming saddled with paunch. Although it went unnoticed by her, the school bullies were not so unobservant. They were relentless. She heard every insult in the book. \"Fatty\", \"Godzilla\", \"Tubby\". And the more they pushed her, the more she ate to escape it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all consuming yet fleeting pleasure of food was the perfect release for all of her troubles, and she could barely go a minute without it. Over the years, she got fatter and fatter, her once concave belly now a massive blob of fat bursting outwards in front of her a yard, shaking violently with every step of her plump feet. She could barely get her thunderous things through doors, much less her impeccable ass. Her gaunt face had ballooned into a fat, blobbish affair, looking like she was hiding soccer balls in both of her cheeks. By the time she was sent to Yamaku, she clocked in at 600 pounds, and she had gained another 100 while she was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako had been too big for Yamaku's uniforms 400 pounds ago, as well as most clothes in general, so she went nude, never leaving her room. She had studies and homework delivered to her room, as well as any library books she might've wanted, or food if she was hungry. It was the perfect life for her. She never had to socialize, never had to reveal herself to the people who would only hurt her, and she could have anything she wanted on a whim. Of course, she didn't really have any friends as a result. Well, except her. She had met Lilly a few years ago, as she had been tasked with bringing Hanako her homework for that day. The mail slot on her door that things were normally delivered through had rusted shut, so Lilly had asked to be let in. When she received no response, she betrayed her normally polite nature and barged in on a terrified Hanako. But that terror faded into relief as Hanako realized something; Lilly was blind. She couldn't judge her. She couldn't she how horrible she looked. Hanako didn't just smile, she beamed. Lilly was not so happy. \"Excuse me, but I've been sitting outside for five minutes asking if you could let me in, but you've chosen to totally...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I... I'm sorry...\" nervously stammered Hanako in a voice that reflected her soft figure in it's quiet and subdued tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I apologize.\" said Lilly, regaining her composure. \"I didn't mean to insult you, I was just frustrated. My name is Lilly. Lilly Satou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Hanako...\" replied Hanako, growing more nervous at the sight of the beautiful girl in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly was tall, and yet, not imposing. She had an air of kindness about her, an air that could almost be described as motherly. Her glorious blond locks flowed from her head like a golden waterfall, punctuated only by a black hairband. Her face was soft and caring, her body voluptuous. She was everything Hanako wasn't. And it scared the hell out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly asked to stay, she was worn from her long walk to Hanako's dorm. Hanako tenatively allowed her company, and they sat and talked. They shared a fair few interests, literature, traditional games, even certain aspects of their personalities. Suddenly Hanako realized why Lilly terrified her. It was because Lilly was the girl that she used to be. That she would've still been, if not for that damned fire. She sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" Lilly asked, unable to see the subtle tears flowing from Hanako's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she sighed. \"Nothing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation wrapped up soon after that, Lilly grabbing her cane and saying her goodbyes. But before she left, she asked something of Hanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, dear. Do you think you could let me touch your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako cringed. Doing so would reveal her true self. But refusing her would perhaps drive away the only friend she had made in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Hanako sighed reluctantly. She was going to find out anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly cautiously gaited towards Hanako, but before reaching her face, she walked straight into her massive gut, with an audible \"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collected herself, but said nothing. Her trim body wrapped around Hanako's titanic midsection, she slowly lifted her hands up towards her face, and began to feel around it.  She gingerly patted her hands around the soft, doughy flesh of Hanako's face, her faced scrunched awkwardly. Not a disgusted scrunch, to Hanako's relief. An inquisitive scrunch. An interested one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly drew her hands away from Hanako's face and thanked her, grabbing her cane and heading out on her way. Hanako just sat there on the bed in mild shock. She slept well that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that night was many years ago, and now an even bigger Hanako leaned on a bathroom counter and examined herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. She had stopped caring about her physique a while ago. Honestly, she even kind of enjoyed it. It was nice, being enveloped in that much squishy flesh every single moment, every movement producing a sensual quiver in at least one part of her body. She waddled over to her bed and cracked open a fresh 3-liter of cola and a bag of chips. Today would be a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an entire day of binge eating and watching TV, Hanako slowly arose from her bed and looked over at the clock. 3:05. Somebody would likely be about soon with her homework. Sure enough, she soon heard the sound of knocking at her door, followed by what sounded like a feverish attempt to cram something through a broken mail-slot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hanako's surprise, her courier decided that privacy wasn't an issue and headed straight in, Hanako shrieking a bit in shock. What she saw was a mildly handsome boy about her age, with unkempt brown hair featuring a single cowlick. They just stood there and stared at each other awkwardly for a few seconds, the boy almost fully not expecting to walk in on a morbidly obese girl in the full nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, stares were exchanged between the two individuals. It had been a year since a schoolmate had entered Hanako's room, but unlike Lilly this one was fully capable of sight. No prior warning was given to her, leaving the massive girl to be left in her nude form in the sight of a stranger. She could only imagine of the thoughts running through the boy's head, as she was most likely the fattest person he'd ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Hanako, her unexpected guest seemed to be rather calm about the ordeal. While he was guilty of staring at her huge frame, he handled it well. His eyes never stopped darting, never focusing solely on something like her bare breasts as she had feared initially. He also wore a blank expression, for the most part. Though shock was clear in his eyes, this was natural human instinct due to him being faced in a situation he wasn't expecting, along with Hanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly ten seconds passed before the male student backed out of the room with the package in hand, closing the dormroom door partially to avoid anyone else seeing the nude girl before him. It was then, he spoke to the girl for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry about that...Ikezawa\" His pause indicated a glance at the parcel he was tasked with delivering, to show some politeness on his part. \"I really should have knocked before entering like that, I really am sorry...do you want me to slide the package past the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako was surprised. She had never expected him to act in such a manner, as he genuinely sounded sorry for intruding into her room. Already, her impression of him was quite positive. Having learnt from the experience with Lilly that while back, she felt a brief surge of confidence, a feeling which didn't come to her often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..No...you can come in...\" Despite her confidence, butterflies ran rampant in her stomach. She awaited both eagerly and dreading the second, this time invited, entrance of the new face into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fast with the door, quickly opening and shutting it to stop any outside sights. Once inside, he got a look of the domain of the massive girl before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first noted the bed. Half eaten snack foods littered the covers, from opened bags of chips to torn packets of cookies. While this seemed like a lifestyle of slobbery, this was debunked by the almost full bin of wrappers and containers, showing that the inhabitant had been eating the foods before he had entered instead of abandoning them. The bed itself was huge, easily three times larger than his own, obvious specially made to compensate for the size of it's intended user. Low to the ground for easy access, the mattress on top dipped downwards like a bowl despite the catering to such a weight. A television was directly opposite to the bed's position, clearly for easy viewing. It was currently turned on, providing the only light source in the room, but was currently on mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the room was standard Yamaku affair, for the most part. Windows were in the room, but the curtains were shut to the fullest extent. Once again, there was a very obvious reasoning behind that. A bathroom was in the corner, with a visible sink and mirror from where he was standing. The doorway had been modified, due to the contrast between the new and old plaster on the walls. In this case, expanded upon to make for a wider entrance. Another new addition he noticed was a fridge freezer. Not a small one, but a full sized one. Running with a low hum, it was no doubt where all the food she enjoyed came from. Just how exactly the food was stocked was unknown to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, his eyes came to the girl before him. Both stood in the room in silence, eerily similar to the first encounter just then. To avoid deja vu, the boy spoke up to strike a conversation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Speaking up, the male thought it would be best to introduce himself, as he was the guest in the gigantic girl's room. \"Hello, I'm Nakai. Hisao Nakai.\" He thought for a moment, thinking of what else to say. \"I'm mostly new to the school and I was told to deliver a package to your room.\" Hanako noted how he stated the obvious about the package. She worried a little, thinking he was nervous in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence again, but not for long. \"Should I just...put this on the desk?\" He lifted up the package slightly, gesturing his head over to the same desk the TV was situated at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..that'd be...f..fine..\" Hanako replied. Nodding his head, Hisao walked over and placed the package over to the desk. Walking back over, the silence struck again. Clearly, he was having trouble starting a conversation. Hanako couldn't blame him, as he said he'd just recently started at the school. He must barely know anyone, let alone know what to do in a scenario like this. In a normal circumstance, she would feel bitter about something like this, but with this boy, he'd shown some courtesy to her, making the burn victim feel a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to prevent the conversation from dying, Hanako took it on herself to salvage it. \"Thank you...Hisao...I'm Han...Hanako...\" She internally cursed her speech impediment, the constant stuttering making even the simplest of sentences hard to say. She was at least glad people were patient when she talked with them, but it didn't help the fact she had the damned thing in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako Ikezawa...\" Hisao thought out loud. He remembered her last name as seen on the package. \"That's a nice name.\" He thought on what else he could add to the conversation. He was able to retrieve a slight brainwave to aid him. \"So, do you know what was inside that package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...it's my..homework...\" Hanako kept things going, as the conversation was building steam. \"I d..don't attend..classes...so they bring it...to me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" Hisao added. It was only small, but the conversation had gotten started. Hanako felt pleased slightly, having pulled off the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was beginning to feel tired. Being the massively overweight girl she was, she preferred to sit or lie rather than stand. She'd been standing for a while now, leading her to start feeling worn out due to this. Slowly, she moved her huge frame around to the bed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a...moment..\" She told Hisao, who watched on as she shifted herself around to the side of the bed. She sat herself down, each fat-laden roll shaking as she did. This was followed by Hanako heaving her legs up onto the bed, which she did slowly with one leg after the other. Once her entire body was resting onto her specially made bed, she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako looked on at Hisao, who was now laying eyes on the very same nude obese girl from before lying on her bed. She looked on intently at him, as if she was expecting her guest to continue their conversation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling the 'air' in the room getting a bit stagnant, Hisao quickly tried to think of a new topic to bring about, to keep their little conversation alive. As he had just started at the school, he thought it would be best if he could make some friends or at least a few acquaintances right off of the bat. However, in his panicked thought, the young man simply said what came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a reason why you don't attend classes?\" he said.  A small wince came from Hanako, which was to be expected from someone as socially stunted as her. By seeing her expression, he grew concerned but did his best to keep calm, as to not offend the poor young woman any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not comfortable with answering that's fine. I could even tell you why I'm here, if that makes you feel better.\" Hanako looked towards the young man, finding his expression a bit warm, not like all of the ones she had seen when she was growing up. They were often cold and hurtful, but she didn't mind his at all. Another thing that highly surprised the girl was his willingness to talk about his disability. With the ones that were not physical in nature, many would be rather hesitant to speak about it as it would often bring about painful memories and the like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, its fine, as long as you tell me why you're here.\" she said, hating the fact that her stammer persisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I tend to be shy around others. I don't mean not talkative or wanting to be left alone, I usually get panic attacks and start hyperventilating sometimes. So the school lets me stay in my room and gives me lecture notes and my homework. I take exams in front of a teacher, but other then that, I don't have to attend classes.\" explained Hanako, trying to suppress the painful memories that soon boiled up from her mind. Nodding, the Hanako was a bit surprised he didn't look at her with eyes of pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for bringing up any painful memories. So the reason why I got sent to this place is right here.\" said Hisao, pointing towards his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have arrhythmia. Any additional stress to my heart could send me into cardiac arrest.\" said Hisao, recalling the fateful snowy day he had nearly died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my. It's not often that we get people with life-threatening disabilities here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't too bad. I just need to be on meds for the rest of my life and avoid anything really physical. Guess that ruins my chances of being a baseball star huh?\" joked the young man, trying to hide behind his own laughter. Hanako let out a small giggle as well, which Hisao found quite cute. </span></div></div>",

Given how he'd just met Hanako, the impact was as much, though it still left him a little awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Hanako dear, you have a visitor?\" With a girlish chuckle, the new figure could be seen for all she was. If her blonde hair and blue eyes didn't make her stand out, her size certainly did. While not as big as Hanako, this girl was clearly not too far off, a grand belly flopping out in front of her, along with easily the largest pair of breasts Hisao had ever laid eyes on, making Hanako's look small in comparison. The blouse she wore was pretty obviously too small, her breasts squashed in there tight, also leaving a lot of soft belly on display, a true testament to how huge she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes....this is Hisao, we j-just met...\" Hanako answered in her usual tone, still remaining on the bed for now. Her purple eyes locked onto a very large bag being carried around by the new girl, slowly making her way into the room with a cane in front of her, her plush sides and wide hips sliding against the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! I told you someone would come around to stay sometime.\" Continuing inside, the warm smile on this new girl's soft face felt calming to Hisao, the rounded cheeks and triple chin really complimenting her bright smile. Letting her by to Hanako's bed, Hisao caught a full glimpse of her oversized ass, a grand affair with both cheeks clearly imprinted in her tight skirt, still keeping her decent but not doing anything to hide how big her rear was. Finding a nearby chair, the girl took it and plopped herself down on the seat, her butt oozing out as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got your snacks all set here Hanako, don't you worry now.\" Passing the bag over to Hanako, she smiled a little more as she took it to glance inside, whilst the new girl turned her attention to Hisao, being able to know where he was based on his footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for the late introduction Hisao, I am Lilly Satou and I'm happy to meet you. I'm a long time friend of Hanako's....as you can see!\" She giggled as she patted her belly, a soft jiggle being made as she placed her plump hand on her exposed skin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a sad truth that in life, not everyone can start off equal. While there are various factors that can come into play, a very simple one is your upbringing. Every child is brought up in a different environment, different backgrounds along with different people. There's no doubt that a child brought up in a middle class family in a first world country is going to have a significantly more pleasant childhood than a child in a working class family in a second world country. It is one of the many parts of life that one must come to terms with, as one cannot choose their own fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, fate appeared to shine on the girl in focus. This girl is Lilly Satou. A very lucky girl indeed, this child was brought up with a very loving family, having two caring parents bringing her up along with her older sister by the name of Akira. Despite their vast differences, the two girls both loved each other so. To add to this, both parents to young Lilly were most successful. Her father owned a worldwide business, his fortunes and wealth constantly growing due to the workforce he headed. Her mother was also successful in her own right, while not owning a massive company she still had a relatively high paying job. This large amount of income from both sides meant that Lilly along with her family could live in the lap of luxury, with any of her desires able to be granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, not everything was so great for Lilly. Ever since her birth, Lilly had been completely blind, her eyes simply refusing to work. This made her early life difficult to adapt to, as both her and her family needed to learn and adapt to the condition bestowed upon her. Many different methods were brought in to assist with Lilly, as she initially having a guide dog for a while. Over time, as she learnt to handle her blindness on her own as she grew older, she gave her guide dog up and went for the more traditional cane, which she continued for many years after. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nDespite all this, Lilly remained a proper girl. In a strange case, she was a 50/50 split of Japanese and Scottish, her father hailing from Inverness while her mother came from Akita. Due to this, both parents remained in their respective countries most of the time, meaning that Lilly and Akira both found themselves hopping from one country to the other occasionally. Both grew to be very smart, as upbringings from British and Japanese nannies alike made them fluent in both mother tongues of their parents. While both learnt the trade of manners over time as well, Akira was clearly the more rebellious child, soon growing out of them. Lilly decided to keep with the mannerisms, growing fond of the ladylike mood. She kept true to the traditions of her nationalities and made herself sound eloquent as possible, which inadvertently eliminated any signs of an accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as great an upbringing one can have, it can always have it's drawbacks. By the time the two girls hit their first teenage years, there became less and less time for the family to act as one. Being a CEO is no easy task, Lilly's father had been working hard to keep his company in the best shape. While he could afford to make exceptions at a younger age, now that Lilly was no longer a child he felt he couldn't anymore. New opportunities opened up for Lilly's mother, effectively grounding her in different areas across the globe. At least Lilly's father was perpetually in Scotland,  her mother was going from country to country every few months. There was no chance of seeing her at that rate. To make matters worse, Akira was a few years older than Lilly. Being further in her schooling, she decided the best route would be to follow her father's footsteps in business. More than pleased at the choice his daughter had made, her father made sure she had the best opportunities she could get. This led to Akira being moved from Lilly's school to another, one that suited the courses and needs of pursing a career in business. Thankfully, she never left the country, but the new school and much larger workload Akira had taken on for school meant that there was much less of her in Lilly's life. Stranded in Scotland with the entire family busy with their own endeavours, Lilly found herself very much alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to take up hobbies to pass the time. She would wander her father's house from time to time, searching to know if there was anything hidden from her grasp which would amuse her. Most of the time, this would not be the case. It was only until one afternoon in July that Lilly found something to do. Wandering once more, Lilly had grown tired of searching the house and decided to rest herself. On the way back to the living room, she could hear a kettle coming from kitchen. She was aware of her father's many staff which kept his sizeable house in good shape, but she had thought they would have been long gone by late afternoon. Entering the kitchen, she soon found out about the maid inside keeping an eye on the same kettle she had heard. Noticing her entrance, the maid began to talk to the young Lilly. As their conversation continued, it lead into what the maid was making in the kitchen. Happy to answer, she showed how she was making a little something for herself after a long day's work, brewing some hot tea along with making a cake, which she intended to share with other staff for later times. Having took interest, the maid gladly offered a cup of tea and a slice of the cake to Lilly, which she gleefully accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit her. The very moment the forkful of cake and dash of tea passed her lips, Lilly experienced a taste like no other. She blissfully enjoyed the rest of her offering, thanking the maid for such a great meal. She had never tried food like this ever before, all her previous meals being sorted out by either family or the the same nannies she had grew up with. To know that such foods were accessible to her on a daily basis made Lilly all the happier, as she felt she finally had something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Lilly started to focus on these meals. Every day, she would join the maids of her father's staff to learn about cooking and brewing. Knowing of her condition, the maids learnt along with her, them learning how a blind person could bake or brew, then passing the knowledge onto Lilly herself. After every cake was baked and every pot was brewed, Lilly rewarded herself by enjoying the meal before her. Not just the sole slice of cup, Lilly knew of the tastes that awaited her and could not stand for only a slight taste. She would enjoy whole cakes and pots, with every new flavour she learnt about opening new opportunities for her in cooking and brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, such an attitude had an effect on the girl. The cooking led to an expansion of Lilly's body, her slim frame plumping out as she furthered her culinary logic. The maids were aware too, noticing the curve of her belly grow and the softness of her skin billow out. Not wanting to stop her from the hobby she had grown to love, they merely accompanied her growth with large clothes to suit her, which Lilly greatly appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime marched on for Lilly. Her father began noticing the changes to her daughter, but rather than say something that would potentially hurt the feelings of his lovely daughter, he merely avoided talking about it. He was impressed by her skills, but secretly did not approve of what she was doing to herself. Akira and her mother also took note of her much larger body, but both of them were just happy that she'd found a hobby that she could enjoy, especially due to her disability. Lilly's abilities grew too, as knowledge of cakes moved onto knowledge of dessert foods in general, and brewing of tea moved on into other beverages, both hot and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Lilly's figure changed over time as well. Her belly continued to surge outwards, dropping past the waistbands of her skirts. She now possessed a pair of long jiggling legs, the thighs just as thunderous as the expression would allow. The developments of her body led to the major growth of her mammaries, rounded orbs of pure fat that sat atop her belly like a King and Queen on their thrones. Her divine face became thicker and rounder, with a crevice of a double chin which defined her looks. Her arms were just as long as before, but the additional flab made them look shorter. Plump fingers didn't diminish the quality of her cooking or brewing. Her rear end began testing the mettle of any skirt she wore, the width and scale making her hips look narrow in comparison. You didn't need a physician to tell you that Lilly was tipping the scales at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs years went by, Lilly's condition continued escalating. Walking had became quite the chore for her, leading her to spend most of her time sitting down, the majority dedicated to her all time favourite hobby. While she would still walk if she was tasked with something, it would take significantly longer for Lilly to do it, due to frequent breaks to catch her breath. She also insisted on dressing herself, not wanting to cause the maids any problems with her weight. She had even delved into the art of sewing in order to keep up her wardrobe due to her ever expanding size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the same time, Lilly had learnt that Akira was intending to move to Japan, to focus on the division her father had stationed in the north of Japan. Not wanting to let her dear sister go, Lilly insisted she move to Japan despite her size. Luckily for her, Akira mentioned how there was a Disabled school in the same area she was planning to move to, saying she could do there if she really did want to move with her. Lilly couldn't be happier, leading to her packing her bags and leaving Scotland behind for the home country of her mother. Willing herself through the constanttravel to their destination, Lilly helped out Akira move into her apartment, followed by Akira returning the favour by helping Lilly move into her new school, Yamaku High School for the Disabled.</span></div></div>",

Though, when she was by her lonesome, that part of her tended to slip just a bit. Shizune had just assigned her a rather important job for the upcoming school festival and it seemed as if Shizune had potentially overestimated her own abilities by just a little bit. Her deaf best friend had given her a list of all of the school organizations that would be running their own stands and had wanted her to get a signature from the head of these clubs. The problem was that the list was pretty long and she only had so much time to do it. As she hurried down a corner, a sharp pain hit both her forehead and rear. Getting her senses back, she had just run into someone and landed right on her plush butt. Opening her eyes, she saw someone she recognized in a similar state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hisao, sorry for bumping into you like that.\" she said, still feeling the dull pain in her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry it's my fault.\" said Hisao as he stood up and offered a hand to the bubbly girl. Taking it, an idea hatched in that pretty little head of hers. As she was lifted, she took the papers in her hand and glanced at them. There was only a few signatures compared to the dozens that she needed to collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Hisao, are you busy right now?\" she asked, trying to make her voice as sweet as possible. Hisao considered himself to be somewhat good at reading people, and his mind was telling him that Misha was asking for a favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly, is there anything I can help you out with?' he asked. Luckily for Misha, Hisao was also the type of guy to help out his friends whenever he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup in fact you'd be doing me a super huge favor if you did.\" said Misha as she began to explain the situation. Understanding, she gave Hisao half of her stack and sent him off in the other direction. As she restarted her duty, she wore a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha, that Hisao sure is a lifesaver. I should repay him with a nice lunch!\" she said as she picked up the pace. After all, she wanted to finish before it got too late.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes widened as she saw Hisao returning past her with the full stack in his hands, notably much more alert and active than Misha after doing the paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there you are Misha, every signature filled out. Was pretty annoying to track everyone down, but I got there.\" He took a long look at Misha's tired expression. \"Good thing I was here to help you, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Misha replied breathlessly, getting up from the bench and stretching herself out. \"It'd say it's time I upheld my side of this deal! You've done something for me, so it's only fitting I do something for you in return~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's no need, I was only he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his decline, Hisao found himself grabbed by the arm and dragged quite harshly by the arm by Misha, the bubblegum haired girl having amazing strength for someone who was still breathing raggedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I insist you come so I can reward you~!\" She said, a surprising sharpness in her voice. Trying his best to keep up with her pace, Hisao was soon dragged out of the school all the way to the usual watering hole for many of the students of the school, including Misha, the Shanghai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting a reward if it's the last thing I do! Now order up, it's all on me!\" Misha announced as she sat down at one of the free tables, Hisao doing so himself as a waitress (Somewhat to his dismay not Yuuko) took Misha's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're getting something yourself? What about this being my reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes at him, though in a jestful manner. \"Hey, I did a bunch of work too! You expect me to finish off a workload on an empty stomach~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at her reasoning and shaking his head a little, Hisao ordered his own share, to which Misha handed over some money to the waitress. However, some words were exchanged between the two of them, these words causing her smile to turn into an upset frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\" Hisao asked the now saddened girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm a little short and it means I can't have extra cream on my Parfait!\" Misha replied, a slight whining tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I could just take something out of my order Misha. It'll be much eas-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No!\" She interrupted him with her shriek. \"That would defeat the purpose of bringing you here! I want to treat you for helping me, but a Parfait isn't the same without cream....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao looked the wobbling dejected eyes on Misha's face, her lip quivering slightly as the waitress stood there with money in hand and a slightly annoyed look on her face.</span></div></div>",

Was he getting too excited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot Hisao! Now you've made Misha's nice list!\" exclaimed the pink haired girl as she eagerly awaited her sweet meal. Deciding to play along a bit, Hisao asked her about this so called 'nice list' was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Nice list?\" he asked with a tone that showed interest. Misha gave her trademarked laugh as she humored the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha, that means that you get to treat me to stuff like ice cream, cakes and all of that sweet stuff whenever I want. Doesn't that sound like a good deal?\" she asked with a smile still plastered on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it does sound tempting.\" said Hisao with a smirk on his face as well. The two went back and forth like this for a bit of time, their conversation eventually dialing down to simple conversation like favorite movies, types of music you listen to, opinions on the school and such. If someone were to just come across the pair, they would have easily mistaken them as a new couple out on a date. Eventually the waitress returned with the food, Hisao getting a hearty roast beef sandwich with a few strips of bacon and a soda with Misha getting a sweet strawberry cheesecake and her precious parfait with a nice amount of whipped cream on top. Eagerly digging through her cheesecake, Hisao also began to eat his meal, finding his sandwich very tasty. Soon, she was done with her cheesecake and went right for her parfait. It was also strawberry oriented, with strawberry creme, sliced strawberries and even a strawberry flavored sugar straw. As she ate, Hisao noticed she got a bit of whipped cream on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Misha, you got a bit right here.\" said Hisao as he pointed towards his cheek. Giving off a slight red blush, she quickly wiped the area with a napkin and gave him a sincere smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, thanks Hisao.\" was all that she said as she continued her assault on the treat. Seeing her smile like that, he felt another pang in his chest. However, it wasn't painful, in fact, it made him feel a bit warm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it wouldn't hurt to treat her every now and then.'</span></div></div>",

From far away he spotted the trademark pink hair of a certain bubbly girl ploughing her way through the masses of people, pushing by as best as she could so to find Hisao. When she eventually did, she near stormed over to him with little regard for others, seemingly determined to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving a hand over, Hisao took note of how her other hand was currently holding onto various supplies of wood, elongated and worn with a hammer between her fingers. Whilst mentally he questioned how safe it was for her to carry so much like that in a crowed area, seemingly no one was hurt so it all checked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hisao! Man, am I glad to see you!\" Misha was very breathless as she usually was when working hard, switching the piles of wood from one hand into the other, using the newly free hand to shake it as a way of releasing pain. \"I need another favour if you don't mind me asking! I've got to repair all the old stands around but there's so many around it's hard to single the older ones out!\" She clasped her hands together and fluttered her eyelashes. \"Care to help out a poor wittle girl in need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao was defenceless. No way he could simply resist Misha when she was like this. After all, she was the \"Wittle\" girl. \"Alright Misha, I'll give you a hand again. I trust you have a reward set up when we've finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course! After all, yesterday was such a good time, wasn't it?\" She gave her brightest and toothiest grin as she pass a stack of planks over to Hisao and a spare hammer before rushing off into the opposite direction to him. Hisao chuckled as she when running, finding himself starting to like spending time with the student council lackey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had been a long and hard one to work through, but the duo were able to repair the older stands with ease once they got a stride going.

Still there was something about her that continued to draw him to her during these past few day, something he couldn't really place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess they're pretty busy today.\" said Hisao, looking around to see that the cafe was packed with various customers and waitresses walking all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha~ Maybe we should have tried somewhere else.\" laughed Misha using her trademarked laugh, her 'drills' bouncing along with the action. So as Hisao was naturally curious, he thought asking about the upcoming festival would be a good way to pass the time until their food came. All he knew is that there were a number of clubs and even some outside school businesses were involved. He also knew that there were a lot of stalls and events planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Misha, can you tell me more about this school festival? What with me being new to the school and all.\" said Hisao, taking a sip from the complementary glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's right, you're a newbie aren't ya?\" said Misha, her laugh breaking any sign of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for being so green.\" smirked Hisao. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the festival is one of the school's most highly anticipated events. Everyone has tons of fun, there are really good prizes and it's all a load of fun.\" she said, remembering all of the fun times she had the last year. The more that Misha went on and on about it, the more that Hisao was becoming more interested in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that all sounds great.\" At his words, Misha's expression fell slightly, causing him a bit of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit shit shit, what did I say?!' panicked Hisao on the inside as her expression failed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, gonna be fun alright. Too bad I can't really spend that much time having fun.\" said Misha, sulking down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Hisao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got a lot tighter schedule this year so I gotta be running around most of the time. It's all because of how we have fewer members of student council.\" Now Hisao always considered himself to be a rather rational man. So this meant that he knew when to stick to his own business depending on the situation. However, there was no way he could ignore Misha, who was looking incredibly defeated right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't I help you out? Take on half of your workload so we can finish sooner and so you can have fun?\" said Hisao, feeling that his proposition wouldn't be that intrusive to her own business. As soon as she finished, the brightness in her eyes returned and grew a big smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes that'd be great!\" she shouted, giving off a sharp laugh.  </span></div></div>",

Hisao's own meal, a bowl of meat casserole with a selection of diced vegetables, was placed down, paling in comparison to Misha's oversized order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it's a good thing you're paying for me and not the other way around.\" Hisao joked as Misha dug into the top of her Parfait with her spoon, smiling as she gulped down several helpings of the cream topping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can I say? The Shanghai knows how to make good food!\" Misha enjoyed a forkful of cheesecake in the middle of her speech. \"I could guarantee you that the profits would drop drastically if I stopped eating here!\" She gave on her trademark \"Wahaha~\"s before eating once more, to which the two of them began to eat their meals. Hisao glanced up occasionally, noticing the speed of Misha's eating was much faster than his in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the meal, he heard a shrill cry from next to him, causing a few heads to turn in the direction of Misha. She was gripping a menu with both hands. \"What's up Misha?\" Hisao asked with a questioning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's awful Hisao! There's a new Parfait in the store and I didn't see it! I spent all my lunch yen on this!\" She looked like she was genuinely going to cry. \"It has orange chocolate shavings, three kinds of flavoured shots in the ice cream, is served in a custom made glass bigger than every other parfait and it comes with a complimentary bowl of Konpeitou! Oh it's awful awful aw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha's blubbering face was faced with the image of Hisao handing her several yen bills, more than enough to order her new parfait. Slowly, her mouth crept from an unset grimace to the brightest smile he'd ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done nice things for me, I can only return the favour Misha.\" He added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, Hisao found himself being caught in a devastatingly tight hug, Misha wrapping her arms around him with great force as she gleefully squealed at his act of kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you thank you thank you! I can't be more happy Hicchan!\" She buried her cheek into Hisao's face, his entire view blocked by Misha's adorably chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hicchan?\" He questioned. Hisao was aware his heart was a little strained from the sudden hug, but he didn't mind as it was nothing he couldn't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha blushed a little as she let go, money in hand. \"Well, eh heh...it's something I made up just now. A little nickname for you is all!\" With a smile that radiated sunshine, the pink haired girl bounded over to the counter so to order her parfait, Hisao chuckling as she made her way down.</span></div></div>",

Misha was different, she was unlike any other girl he had ever met before and she constantly surprised him with her tricks, her personality and her kindness. Not only was her smile adorable but so was the way she laughed, the way she cried, everything about her was something that he could barely handle. Of course, he had to hold back. Misha was the type of girl to get attention from the whole world, what could he possibly offer to her. Aside from his condition, there was nothing remarkable about him, he was average in every way. As he watched her sashay back to the table, he stopped thinking about such things and smiled when she sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're in a good mood.\" With that, she let out her trademarked laugh as she beamed him a nice smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All thanks to you Hicchan.\" she said, once again using her nickname for him. With that, he felt his face lit up a bit, something that he hid from the girl. Luckily, she was too busy munching on her cake to notice.  With that, both of them continued to eat their meals, discussing various things about school and such. Eventually, the school festival was brought up again once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everything is running well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, things are going smoothly and stuff. Shicchan even praised me for all of my hard work.\" bragged the girl as she recalled all of the hard work that she had been doing as of late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, with that you deserve even more of a reward.\" said the young man as he gave a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" she asked, a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I take you out for ice cream tomorrow after school?\" he offered. A smirk grew on her face as well, licking her lips at the idea of even more sweet treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I'm not sure. I am a busy girl and all.\" joked Misha as she took a few more bites from her cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's too bad. Guess I can always invite Shizune.\" muttered Hisao as he tried his best to look disinterested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Shicchan? She's not interested in sweets like I am...\" whimpered the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then think you can make time with your busy schedule?\" With that, the girl's face went slightly red, having been outplayed by her own little joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can do that!\" she said with a bright and toothy smile. Before he could reply, her super special parfait came, complete with all of the toppings, whipped cream and sweets. As it was placed down in front of her, she let out a happy squeal as she dug in, Bite after bite, it was incredibly sweet, each taste bringing her closer and closer to a sugar rush. He watched on, finding the who scene to be incredibly cute. After she was done with a quarter of it, she looked to Hisao, plenty of cream and sugar on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks once again Hisao.\" she said, a soft smile on her face. Hisao noticed her face and brought a napkin closer to her face, gently wiping her clean of any residue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time Misha. Now come on and finish that before it gets too soggy.\" With nod, she threw herself back into the parfait, doing her best to hide her red face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With less than 24 hours before the festival officially began, needless to say it was going to be a hectic day for everyone if they wanted to try to get everything completed in time. Everyone hurried their fastest not only to get things finished on time, but to also escape the wrath of the ever dominant Student Council leader, even her very scowl enough to strike fear into anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, everything was shaping up nicely. The stands were almost fully set up, cooking stations tested and running, the athletic grounds were in great condition for the sports activities, even the school's mural was finished on time despite the inherent laziness of it's artist. Given how he has leant his services to the festival, Hisao was busy getting supplies sorted out, getting all manner of necessary provisions to those who needed it. He knew Misha would be around here somewhere, and he knew she would no doubt need a pick me up. She wasn't the kind of girl who could keep working for prolonged times without getting some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't too hard to spot, Misha's bubblegum hair a beacon amidst brown boxes as she was resting atop a stack, arms folded as her head rest on them, panting heavily. She looked very flushed and rather tired, had she been up early and working non-stop? Regardless, Hisao walked over to greet her, to which he saw her face go from exhaustion to pure joy as she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicchan!\" She called out, walking forward and giving him a very large hug, very pleased to see him. \"Oh I missed you, I assumed you were working off the school grounds buying the supplies!\" Holding onto his hands, Misha could barely contain her excitement, her face grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm here now!\" Hisao replied, laughing slightly. \"Looks like you could use something to perk yourself up, if you wouldn't mind me treating a young lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Misha giggle, getting herself lost in a fit of laughing. Hisao simply assumed this was a yes, getting from one of the boxes a still cold tub of ice cream, only recently taken from storage. Pinching a spoon from a nearby kitchen stand, he gave it to Misha as she dug into the food, very pleased she had something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm~ Thank you Hicchan, you're a true gentleman you are!\" Misha beamed as she continued to eat. \"Only thing to make this better would be some more exotic food! Man, is vanilla all they have here?\" She noted between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao gave this some thought, then snapped this fingers. \"You know, maybe we could help the cause. It's a little too late to buy new things, the supplies are already here. But, we could easily get the cookery club to whip up some new stuff to balance out the more humdrum food, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha nodded vigorously, her cheeks bulging with ice cream. \"Yeah! Shicchan's been on their case for a while about not contributing enough, maybe this would be enough to put them in her good books! Oh we gotta think about what they can make...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a few ideas on what they can do, maybe they can take the western approach, have stuff like in those food festivals they have.\" Hisao added. \"They like to fry unconventional foods, like cola and oreos. Maybe coat things in chocolate sauces, have those alternate takes on foods, like funnel cake or pecan pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha was less listening and more salivating at the foods, but she soon went back to her senses. \"Uh, yeah! That would be delicious...and good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, we best write these down and get them to the cookery club. Hope they don't mind the extra work.\" Hisao added, before the two of them went back to sitting together, Misha hungrily eating away. Looking over at her, Hisao noticed her blouse looked a little tight on her, a clear outline of her stomach on her shirt. Granted, Misha had been eating ice cream and parfaits consistently for plenty of days now, so it would be natural for her to gain a little, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Change is usually portrayed in a negative light. For many people, change is most unwanted. Think about it, what kind of person would want to have their life, which they have grown fond and accustomed to, be suddenly altered in a strange unfamiliar new way which forces them to adapt and understand so quickly? Yes, you can say that change can be for the better, but even if it does turn out to be for the better, one would still need to familiarise themselves all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, change is not simply straightforward. You can take one look at the changes of one's life and make a basic yes or no judgement on whether it was for the better or not, but to truly understand and decide if that change was for better or worse is a grand task. Changes can affect entire lives, not just one off events. Even then, it mightn't be either a better or worse change. There could be a mix of both kinds of change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes to changes in life, perhaps the most interesting change one can face is the kind which is being presented right now. In this story, is Hisao Nakai. An 18 year old boy native of Japan, he has lived his life in an orderly simply fashion for all of his years. That was until, he was faced with the unpredictable mistress of change. During a confession of love courtesy of his classmate Iwanako, a once dormant case of heart arrhythmia struck Hisao and almost dealt the schoolboy his final curtain call. Thankfully, the experience did not end his life there, but only went to drastically change it. Not one change, but several. The first being several long months of rehabilitation in hospital, which led right into his next major change in life, the change he is experiencing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao stands outside of the gates of Yamaku High School. While a change of school seems odd for a case such as his, take note that this is a school for the physically disabled. Hisao Nakai now forcibly wears the title of \"Disabled Person\", which has led him to abandon his old school and leave behind old friends, so he can join a new school that will suit the changes his life has been dealt. Having to spend the next years of his life here until he can pass his school years, the boy decides that first he must familiarise himself with his dorm room, where he and his possessions will reside for the years of this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not take him long to sort his room out. With his belongings unpacked and sorted, along with his newly acquired dosages of medication which he must take for the rest of his life, the Hisao lad plans to spend his time familiarising himself with the grounds of the school. With many facilities and areas all with their own purposes, it would pay for him to get to know where they were. Locking the dorm room behind him, he strolled into the school to take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom word of mouth, he was told of the library that Yamaku held. Being an avid reader for a long time and having his thirst for the written word enhanced by his time in hospital, he wanted to go there first to check out the state of affairs in the library. It wasn't too hard for him to find, being rather close to the main entrance of the school. Having located it, he swung open the doors and had a look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao could only marvel at the grand looking library. Rich brown wood was the basis of the room, shelves filled to the brim with books galore. The sections were completely stacked with literature, a visual feast for his eyes. He would expect this sort of library to be at a city hall or a court of law, not a school for the disabled. Moving foot after foot on the soft well kept carpet, Hisao walked onwards into the massive collection, getting a closer examination of the books before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying what he has seen so far, he then decided to turn some of the corners to see what lay deeper into the labyrinth of reading material. Bookcase after bookcase formed together to make passages, further spurring his curiosity to look onwards. However, as Hisao turned the very next corner, his eyes soon came across the sight. This sight was the figure of...</span></div></div>",

Book in hand, she let out a surprised squeak as she noticed the handicapped teen staring right at her. Feeling the pressure of the situation, she immediately hid her face back in her book, trying her best to ignore just what happened. Hisao couldn't help staring for a few moments more. It wasn't only that she was incredibly cute at the moment, but for the fact that the young woman in front of him was incredibly large.Wearing the standard uniform consisting of a white button down blouse, a cute ribbon tied on her chest, a green plaid skirt and pitch dark leggings, each of the articles of clothing were greatly stretched out due to the shear amount of flab that they covered.  The dark haired girl possessed an apple figure, with most of her weight settling down in her giant flabby dome of a belly and heavy thighs. Her arms were quite doughy, each upper arm feeling incredibly soft to the touch. The shy girl's breasts settled nicely on top of her protruding gut and caused the chic black ribbon on her chest to become quite tight around and restrictive against such a fleshy surface. The black leggings she sported perfectly accentuated the curves and dimples of her immense legs and thighs, making such flab all the more enticing to curl up with. While her rear was out of sight as she was currently using it to sit on the comfy beanbag, Hisao assured himself that it was quite formidable as well. One last thing of note was her face, it was slightly pale in complexion and her chubby full cheeks made her look that much cuter.  Shaking himself out of his stupor, he mentally reprimanded himself for doing such an uncouth act. On of the first things he had learned about the school was to respect others so you would be respected in turn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sorry for that, I'm still getting used to this school and all.\" he said warily, hoping that he didn't offend her in any way.  Gingerly looking up from her book, the only thing that Hisao could see were her iris colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, i-its fine...\" she said in barely what could account for a whisper. Feeling that he should at least try to get to know people at school, the heart-impaired student tried to drum up some more conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hisao. What's yours?\"</span></div></div>",

At first, his question drew up nothing but a long awkward silence, the person before him merely hiding behind her long bang of hair and the book she held, a single purple eye peeking out from behind them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Hisao made eye contact with her. He looked deep into her free eye, his vision lost in a sea of deep violet. Right away, he felt himself being deeply enchanted by the girl. Something about her was rather remarkable, but he had no idea what it was. He felt strange about the girl, but not in a negative manner. It was all rather strange in itself to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis soon ended as fast as it began. Eventually the new arrival realised that he wasn't just making eye contact, he was outright staring at the girl. He could imagine this wasn't going to get her to answer any faster, perhaps slower. Quickly, Hisao moved his eye contact away from her eyes and over to one of her two defences, the book she held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life of Pi, huh?\" Hisao noted. He was a rather avid book reader in himself, having seen the book before given it's notable reputation in the literary world. \"Enjoy it so far?\" He attempted to give his face a warm smile in attempts to help the conversation along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his relief, it worked. The dark haired girl lowered her book down slightly, allowing him to see both eyes, though the rest of her face was still obscured. From behind the book, Hisao heard the small voice rise up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I-I'm enjoying it a lot. I'm almost...f-finished with it.\" She replied, the book lowering a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's definitely worth a read. I enjoyed it myself.\" He added. \"I can see it's so highly regarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the girl finally dropped her book down, placing it onto her lap with her hands. Her face was fully visible, rounded and bright without any blemishes. Whilst Hisao mentally chastised himself for thinking such thoughts, he noted that whatever reason for her being at the school must be something internal rather than external.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name...is Ikezawa. It's Hanako Ikezawa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice name Ikezawa.\" Hisao simply replied. He was glad the conversation was going well, since this Ikezawa was the very first person she had met at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao thought about how to continue onwards with her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he could gather his thoughts, a rather bellow sound was heard, startling the disabled teen slightly. Keeping his composure in front of the rather large shrinking violet, he caught on to what the particular noise was. It was her stomach. While he wasn't one for stereotypes, he assumed that the overfed beauty in front of him ate frequently. A heavy red tint stained her pale face as she began to whimper with embarrassment.  Hiding her round face as best as she could with her dear book, Hisao found himself in an awkward situation. From what he could tell, she was very sensitive about her weight which added to her apparent shyness. He had to handle this situation with skill if he wanted to make his first friend at the specialized school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm feeling a bit hungry. I just moved in today so do you mind showing me where the cafeteria is?\" he asked with a genuine tone. Hisao really didn't know much about the school itself so it would be a good opportunity to learn. Peaking up from her book once more, she gave a soft nod and started the rigorous process to lift her heavy figure from the comfy seat. Her knees going a bit wobbly from the weight of her upper half, the girl lifted herself, letting out a sigh of relief as she placed the book back on the bookshelf. To Hisao it was quite the spectacle, seeing such a flabby young woman move in such a lethargic manner, he found it interesting but kept a neutral expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, let's go.\" she said, moving towards the door. As she was fully standing in front of him, the man with the ill heart managed to get a good look at her enormous rear. Clad in the dark green skirt, he could see the outlines of both of her fat-filled cheeks and was almost hypnotized by how they both jiggled wildly with each step. Getting a hold of his running thoughts, he composed himself before he got caught staring. He tried to keep up some conversation with the girl, even talking about books and the like, but all he received were muffled 'yes' and 'no' answers. Eventually the pair made it to the cafeteria and Hisao could clearly tell that Hanako was indeed hungry. After all, her stomach had growled three times during the trip over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hanako, mind joining me for a little lunch? I'm still a bit self conscious about eating here by myself and I'd like the company.\" Another nod from the blubbery girl and the two entered the cafeteria. The room itself was wide with a number of fold up tables laid about in a standard fashion. Since classes had yet to start, there were a few students here and there eating a variety of foods. As many of the students needed specialized diets, the school offered pretty much anything anyone could ever want. Heading in line, they waited a bit before Hisao was able to order. As he considered himself to be a simple young man who enjoyed the simple things in life, he got two slices of pizza with a bottle of orange soda. Paying for his order, he looked back to Hanako who once again had a troubled look on her face. </span></div></div>",

Glancing over from the girl over to her tray, he noticed the vast spread she'd selected for her meal. With two large plates fitted onto the tray, they were both stacked to the brim with a wide selection of foods. The two were clearly designated for both the main meal and for dessert, as seen with the contents on them. The left plate featured a steaming hot platter of roasted potatoes, fried and scrambled eggs, three kinds of rice, spicy curry and a copious helping of bacon. The right plate featured a magnanimous portion of both chocolate cake and brownies, lathered in rich cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember seeing any of this in line...\" Hisao thought to himself, before remember of Hanako. \"What's wrong? You look worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe much larger girl fidgeted slightly. \"I...I don't h-have enough...I can't p-pay...\" The nearby lunchlady gave a nod to confirm this. Taking a look over her mighty spread, Hanako couldn't bear to choose something on her plate to give up. She'd only been a few yen short, mainly due to the addition of the bacon. Secretly she had quite the affinity for the specific meat, such a favourite only rivalled by the sweet tasting substance that was chocolate , enjoying it's taste in any meal it was a part of. Having gone slightly overboard with her helping of the stuff, it had led to her overspending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrhythmia-riddled student took a moment to think, remembering back to when he first added money to his card on arrival. That's when it struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Hanako, it's all on me. I paid in enough to last me the week, so I can afford it.\" He assured her, holding up his own card so to begin paying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...Thanks\" A tiny smile rose on her cherubic face, her frown having disintegrated from the act of kindness. With her meal fully paid along with Hisao's previously, the two grabbed their trays and moved over to a nearby empty table. Hisao had allowed Hanako to pick out a spot for him, due to the cafeteria being an unfamiliar place to him despite having inspected it earlier. Finding it still troubling to move his eyes away from her round rear, the hefty girl led Hisao over to a secluded spot in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako took her fork in her hand, spearing a few strips of bacon before eating them with gusto. Her purple eyes shifted over to the corner to spy a look at Hisao, that same tiny smile re-emerging when she looked on. </span></div></div>",

Across from him was the plush Hanako who was the type of girl to eat carefully and slowly as to not get any crumbs or grease on her cute chubby cheeks. Trying to come up with a bit more small talk like last time, a rather simple idea came to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hanako, what's your favorite kind of food.\" he asked what he thought was a seemingly innocent question. Swallowing another hearty piece of bacon, she placed a finger on her flabby chin, trying to think of an answer for the kind boy she had just met. Hiaso continued to watch her, finding it cute how her expression changed to a slightly confused one. About a minute later, she had come to her conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I like a lot of different foods, I've n-never been that picky. Though out of all things, I like chocolate and bacon the most.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, chocolate and bacon? Certainly is a weird combo but sounds delicious. Have you ever tried chocolate covered bacon? They usually sell them at fairs alongside fried oreos and funnel cake.\" said Hisao, seeing that the expression on Hanako's face had changed dramatically. It was replaced by a face that was filled with wonder and pure innocence, similar to if you had told a child that you had bought them a pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You c-can do that?\" she asked, her face growing a bit red from all the excitement. Letting out a chuckle, Hisao could see that Hanako would be quite the interesting friend.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, its pretty tasty from what I heard.\" He continued on like this, finding topics to have some level ground for conversations. Most of the topics just happened to be about food which he chalked up as coincidence.  Around ten minutes in, Hisao heard a loud and rather infectious laugh coming a few feet away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha!\" laughed a chubby girl with long pink haired styled to look like dizzying drills as she walked over to Hisao and Hanako's table. Getting a good look at her, Hisao could only use the word eccentric to describe her. He noticed that her middle had a softness to it and her visible thighs looked to be quite plump and nearly touch the other. By seeing her hazel eyes, he also noticed that her face was had a small amount of fat to it, making her cheeks quite round and giving her a bubbly appearance, accented by the color of her bubble gum hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, can I help you?\" he asked, noticing that Hanako had gone dead quiet, barely noticing that her skin had gone a bit pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the new student right? My name is Shiina Mikado, but everyone calls me Misha. Nice to meet you!\"</span></div></div>",

It's another nickname I made for the student council president Shizune!\" Misha gave out another ear piercing laugh, pushing her hefty breasts upwards as she folded her arms. \"She's also shown some interest in meeting you! I would've asked you to come with me now, but it seems you're busy with someone!~\" Her gemstone eyes rolled over to meet Hanako's mysterious purple eyes, the significantly bigger girl trembling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hanako, same old same old with you?~\" Misha noted as she took a glance over to her platefuls of food piled up, the first plate still having large amounts despite Hanako haven eaten some of it. \"Keep eating like this and there'll be a repeat of what happened before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Hanako looking paler than ever and Hisao looking as confused as ever, Misha gave a giggle and put her hands on her hips. \"Ah, let me explain for you Hisao!\" In the corner of his vision, he could see Hanako shaking her head side to side, her eyes clenched shut. This did nothing to sway Misha from explaining though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako and me are in the same class, the very same you're in! You see, when she first joined the school, in less than an hour the chair at her desk gave way and she fell! Ever since then, we've needed to use special chairs reinforced with steel so Hanako doesn't fall again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao absent-mindedly nibbled on his meal as Misha continued to keep talking as time passed by. During such, Hanako look completely defeated, head drooped down with her eyes shut, the occasional shudder or tremble moving her huge frame a little.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the black haired girl, her face was still pale and she was trembling slightly.  Having been embarrassed to her very core, Hisao tried to figure out how to cheer her up. As he had yet to really get to know her, his mind was drawing up a blank. Though he had to say that the image of Hanako breaking down a chair sounded really enticing, not in a comical manner but in a more sensual one. Shaking off such weird thoughts, something came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, back when I was a kid, I ended up climbing a really big tree at school one day. The view was great but then one of the teachers ran up to me and yelled at me to climb down. I got really scared then and I managed to get down a few feet until I fell. Managed to bang myself up pretty bad and until middle school, no one would let me live it down. I was known as the handicapped monkey for a bit.\" explained Hisao. Hanako listened on intensely, chuckling a bit at the nickname. Seeing that she seemed to be a bit better, he also noticed just how cute her laugh was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we're straight then?\" he asked. Hanako looked at him with a confused expression, feeling the need to take a few bites from her meal due to her current hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was told something embarrassing about you. It's only fair if I tell you something embarrassing about myself.\" he explained. A slightly shocked expression on her face, soon she began to chuckle and then went even further into laughter. Hisao joined her, the pair laughing over something so trivial. Eventually Hanako would calm down, taking a few moments to catch her breath as she barely had any stamina due to her sheer bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Hisao, that meant a lot to me.\" said Hanako with a bright smile betraying her earlier actions. Hisao gave his own grin, happy to see his new friend in a good mood. The two continued their meal without any interruptions, simply enjoying conversation with each other. Unknown to him, a certain feeling was budding within Hisao, one that was exclusive towards Hanako and Hanako alone. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been several days since Hisao Nakai had made his arrival at Yamaku, having come to befriend one Hanako Ikezawa. As the two of them shared the same classroom for most of their lessons, this allowed their relationship to blossom and continue to grow, allowing Hisao to learn many things about her. From word of mouth he'd discovered Hanako's disability, that she had an underactive thyroid problem. While there were multiple side effects, the most clear and prominent was how it would cause weight gain. He'd also heard a few whispers that she'd developed it during her childhood, with some students talking about thin pictures of Hanako as if they were a sacred treasure. Just looking at her rounded frame Hisao had a hard time picturing Hanako as thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao also learnt how Hanako was given certain privileges over the other students, relating to both her condition and her social problems. If Hanako ever needed some breathing space from the classroom, she was freely allowed to go out at any time. In turn, she was also allowed to eat and drink in class, as long as she didn't make a mess which seemed nigh impossible for her to actually do, her eating habits always dainty and clean. At the same time, she was given free reign of the cafeteria at all times, meaning as long as she had the money to pay up she could buy food from there whenever she wanted. Often when she'd leave the classroom for breathing space she'd return with an armful of foods, all neatly carried in a bento or a cheap container of sorts, all ready for in-class snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time for a break in Yamaku, with Hisao sitting next to his seat, with Hanako's seat right behind him. He actually sat next to Misha and the aforementioned Shizune, who looked far more intimidating than he imagined. Escaping her razor sharp glares and Misha's occasional waving, Hisao would often turn his head to see Hanako, usually taking large bites of whatever snack she had just to give a short hello. She wouldn't respond, but she'd always give a short acknowledgement, whether a wave or a nod depending on if she was eating at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next bell rang signalling break, Hisao did what had since became routine and joined Hanako as they walked out together (Or more, Hisao waited for everyone to leave so Hanako could walk through the door without blocking anyone off.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hisao...a friend wants to see you...\" Hanako announced timidly, walking side by side with Hisao as her body jiggled with every heavy step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend? You mean of yours, right?\" He replied, finding it tough to focus on something other than her wobbling breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...I've told them about you....they're interested...\" She adjusted her hair in mid sentence, the bang on violet hair partially showing her previously hidden eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case care to lead the way Hanako?\" Hisao asked in a questioning tone, soon finding himself following behind Hanako as she brought him to her friend. He peaked a few glimpses at Hanako's massive rear, still looking as soft and perked as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon found themselves at a sole solitary room, not big enough to be a classroom but enough to standalone. \"This is her tearoom...s-she stays here lots...\" Hanako informed. Using a chubby hand, she pushed the door opening, allowing Hisao to see Hanako's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was quite the stunner. With blonde flowing hair and shimmering blue eyes, she was easily not born in Japan. As he looked at the rest of her features, it was clear her status as friend to Hanako had taken a toll to her weight. She wore a snug school uniform, hanging tight around the curves of her body. Her body showed she was far from being fat like Hanako, more closer to very plump, the girl being much larger than an average girl. Her stomach boasted a soft doughy look and likely feel, as seen from the tight fitting blouse. Her thighs were thick as they struggled against fabrics, a few tears in them. Her breasts were good enough to head into double D territory, hefty mounds which still paled compared to Hanako's. While she lacked a double chin, this girl showed a certain chubby nature to her face, rounded in it's look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is that you Hanako?\" The blonde figure looked towards the door, smiling warmly as she seemed to be eating a slice of cake from a table, the rest of the cake slices on a separate plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I b-brought my new friend you wanted to s-see!\" The overfed girl stepped by so to let Hisao passed. This prompted the chubby girl to get up, taking what looked to be a cane as she stood, extending so it tacked onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she must have seeing problems...\" Hisao rather obviously thought to himself as this new girl walked up to him, putting both of her hands onto his face, catching him off guard. Her thick fingers explored before promptly removing, causing her to smile. \"He's rather handsome, isn't he?\" This caused Hanako to blush heavily, stepping a little closer to Hisao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what is your name Miss?\" Hisao asked, still thinking about her touching his face like that.\"I'm Hisao Nakai by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was met with another warm, almost motherly smile. \"Lilly Satou. It's a pleasure to meet you Hisao, I'm so glad you befriended Hanako!\" She sat herself back down at the table, finding her fork so to eat her cake once more. \"Care for some cake and tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako's ears pricked up, quickly sitting down at the table as Hisao did in tow, joining Lilly at the table.</span></div></div>",

From this, the young man wasn't all that surprised by the fact that Lilly was rather chubby as well. He had actually heard of this happening, a fat girl causing her friends to gain weight simply by eating in front of them. As they ate, the other girls would lower their guard, causing more calories to be consumed than needed. Sitting across from Lilly, Hisao sat down next to Hanako, the space between them very scarce, causing her thicker thighs and love handles to press lightly against the heart conditioned man. Of course he didn't mind, finding it to be a quirky trait of her. Placing the cake in front of Hanako, the black haired girl began to eat up, a wide smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you take your tea?\" asked the blonde with a smile as she took a few more bites from her own cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, I take it with two teaspoons of sugar.\" mentioned Hisao as he was focused on just how elegant each and everyone of Lilly's movements were. The way she daintily used her fork to bring pieces of cake to her mouth, how she gently poured the tea and added the sugar, the young man was quite mesmerized.  Hanako noticed this, feeling a bit insecure in front of the 'perfect' Lilly. Even with her added weight, the blind girl always had an air of elegance to her, causing many to adore the kind girl. With Hanako, she was clumsy, a glutton, things that weren't 'cute.' However, something lit up inside the girl at this time, something that screamed her to not 'give up.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" said the other girl in her calm voice. Hisao took it and took a small sip, feeling the flavors of the brew mix in his mouth. Of course he wasn't surprised at how good it all tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite impressive. The blend is rich and doesn't overtake the senses.\" commented Hisao, taking another sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? It's rare to see someone come around with a knowledge of tea. Your friend is quite impressive.\" said Lilly, giving a warm smile to the both of them. With this, Hanako moved over slightly and grabbed onto Hisao's arm, lightly giving him a squeeze and pressing her flabby figure into him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Hisao is really s-special.\" she muttered, her face growing a nice red tone. As Hisao was busy giving the girl a soft smile, Lilly looked at both of them with narrowed eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That boy, what is his game...' thought the blonde haired girl, letting out a small scowl as she watched the two interact in front of her. He was not to be trusted, all he would do is hurt Hanako and she needed to prevent that no matter what.   </span></div></div>",

You must be careful around that boy, I don't know what his deal is but it's bad news. Don't worry about him though, I'm here to help you if he tries anything funny.\" Lilly gave a reassuring smile to Hanako. \"You'll get through this, and when it's over we can go back to not having to worry about nasty pranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" Hanako mumbled, quickly muttering a goodbye before rushing out the door at a hurried waddle. There was no chance Hisao could be like that! Lilly was just being overprotective, right? Wanting to bottle up her negative feelings and disregard Lilly's thoughts, Hanako made her way to class, not before taking a U-Turn at the cafeteria. She needed a good pick me up snack...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day continued on as normal, with the overweight girl attending class as usual, eating her snacks and doing her best to keep Lily's words out of her mind. Hisao wasn't like that, out of all the people she's met, not one was as kind and understanding as he was. He didn't see her weight, he saw a person who had some troubled times and needed a friend from time to time. But still, if this was some sort of sick joke, some ploy he was trying to pull, she didn't think she could take such an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako?\" Broken out of such dreary thoughts, the emotional girl looked up to find Hisao calling out to her. It seemed that class had finished, all of the other students and even the teacher had left, leaving only the pair inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, Hisao, what is it?\" she asked, her voice slightly shaky from the earlier exchange with Lily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you wanted to go Shangai's for a treat. It's on me.\" he said with a grin and giving her a thumbs up. At the word treat, her ears perked up and she broke into a smile. As soon as she tried to get up however, Lily's voice echoed in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Well why not? I wanna treat you, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, well I'm a bit busy, I can't make it...\" She wanted to accept, she wanted to spend more time with him but she was confused. Hisao could be aiming to hurt her after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well that's too bad. Anyways anytime you're up for it let me know.\" With that Hisao began to leave the room, Hanako saw it clearly, she saw him turn his back on her and walk away. With that, something finally clicked in her mind. He was leaving and she was going to be alone again, she would be back to spending all her time in the library, no one to talk about her favorite books or share her thoughts. This wasn't fair, she didn't have to be by herself anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Hisao!\" Nearly jumping in shocked, he quickly turned around to find the girl, her face deep red and tears stinging at the corners of her eyes. He quickly ran up to her, trying to see if anything was the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I want to go, I changed my mind...\" <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter a bit of time spent trying to calm her down and helping her get unstuck from her desk, the pair headed towards the popular cafe. Hanako had apologized for the outburst but Hisao didn't pay it any mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to order as much as you need, I'll cover it all.\" he grinned as he placed a hand on her shoulder. Hanako felt it once more, a certain warmth from the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks...\" Entering inside, the pair were seated by the weekday waitress, Hanako sliding into the booth, her immense body feeling a bit constrained in the small space. Sitting opposite from her, they began their usual small talk, over school, over books and the like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lily seems really nice. I'm glad you were able to find a good friend like her.\" said the young man as he browsed the menu, settling on a hearty sandwich to serve as a nice substitute for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, yes, she is rather kind...\" Doing her best to push such depressing thoughts out of her mind, her eyes locked on a few rather favorable choices on the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can order sweets as well right?\" she asked with a bashful expression, giving him a sincere smile. Seeing such cuteness, he clutched his heart just in case, turning his head to make sure Hanako didn't see his flushed expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, whatever you want.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once upon a time, there was a brave young knight who lived in the land of Yamakuon. He was a rather strong and he spent his days taking random jobs towards protecting the various peoples of the lands from 'monsters.' He was careful in both thought and action and never resorted to violence unless he needed to. As of now, he was settled in a small hamlet south of the capital. The knight preferred life away from the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoyed the peaceful country side. The hamlet also greatly enjoyed his presence as he took care of any stray bandits that would want to raze and pillage the town. From his small hut of a home, he would take on jobs, both local and far away. Awakening from his sleep, he rose from his cot and went to his nearby mirror to inspect himself. Looking back a him was a young man of average height, with medium length brown hair and brown eyes. His appearance seemed pretty standard for a person of his age which betrayed both his experience and skill levels. Taking a brush, he gently tended to his hair, making sure it wasn't too messy after a night of peaceful sleep. Getting dressed, he wore a simple cotton long sleeved shirt and some brown pants that stopped at the ankles. After he finished his morning routine, he headed downstairs in order to make himself a hearty breakfast. Before he could even begin however, there was a knock at his door.  Letting out a sigh, he opened the door, revealing an old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elder? What brings you here this early?\" asked the knight, referring to the village elder of the hamlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sir Knight. I've come because we've had an incident.\" Hisao expected this, having been helping these people ever since he moved in. Though he never minded as happy faces are what he loved to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind going into detail?\" The elder nodded and began to explain the situation. Apparently, there had been reports of food storages being broken into and there was a trail leading towards an abandoned house near the edge of the village. However, whenever someone went to go catch the food thief, there would be reports of seeing loved ones from afar and anyone would simply leave in a panic.  The knight took this in, finding it right up his alley as a knight of the kindgom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can handle this for us, we'd be mighty grateful.\" said the elder, bowing his head in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle it. I'll head over after doing a few errands.\" said the knight. The elder nodded and shook his hand, happy that their latest issue could be solved so easily. With that he left, leaving the knight to make himself breakfast. After all, when it came to monsters, he needed all the energy he could take. </span></div></div>",

Walking along, he entered the main area of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the knight followed the paths, weaving through housing areas and merchant stores, he found himself showered with praise and affection. Cheers and hollers filled his ears as the local townspeople showed their respect for him, having done so much for them in the past. Plus, when they saw the knight coming through town decked out in his full armour, they knew he was going out to perform another great deed for their sake. Men, women and children alike cheered him, the humble hero merely smiling and waving in return. He didn't want to come off as cocky or brash, but at the same time he wanted to at least acknowledge the praise he was showered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his final waves as he left the village, the knight made his way into the thick woodland to search for the house. He remembered how some people risked their well-being by living outside the village, making them at risk of attack from whatever monsters may roam the area. Thankfully, the area had been relatively clear of hostile monsters as of late, the occasional \"Civilized\" monster coming by for a visit. It certainly made the trek through the forest easier, not having to fight anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on a tall hill, the knight spied the very house he was informed of, the trail of food mentioned being present on the floor, an assortment of crumbs and the occasional dropped loaf of bread or hunk of meat. Noticing that the path up hill was incredibly muddy and likely slippery, the knight took it upon himself to clamber up the side of the hill, using the roots of massive trees and slabs of rock to aid his climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he climbed further up, he felt an immense pain in his chest well up. Grimacing with grit teeth, the knight used a free hand to place it on his armour's breastplate as the pain continued. Staying motionless for a good few minutes, the sharp feeling dissipated, allowing him to complete the climb to the top where the house stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed deeply. \"Seek out the 13 signs of the zodiac....\" he mumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging the door open and going inside, the knight looked at the trail of food inside the home so to find out where the one responsible was hiding. The floorboards creaked as he took each step, the house long abandoned and dilapidated with a major amount of wear on the home. Going up the stairs, he looked through all the rooms to see if the person behind the thievery was giving him the slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, then he heard a sign they were close by. A faint chewing noise could be heard through the door of the last room on the upper floor, rustling of a bag could be heard too, no doubt used to carry the stolen goods. Silently stepping over, the knight swung the door open to meet the person inside.</span></div></div>",

Staring inside, the room itself was quite downtrodden, with broken windows and rotten floorboards. Glancing the room, the chewing noise ceased as he stepped in, his hand clutched onto his sword. In the corner of the room, he saw a rather interesting sight. It looked to be some sort of inky darkness, that rippled calmly with each passing second. Approaching this blob, he found another bag nearby and the scraps off food as well. As he went close enough, he noticed that this 'shadow' had a humanoid appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" asked the Knight in confusion as the mass turned around to reveal a half covered face. Getting a better look, the shadow appeared to be a female, and rather thin at that, with a torn cloth as her only source of clothing, The girl warily looked at Hisao, the part of her face visible going into a bit of a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" asked the girl, slowly standing up to reveal her body. She did have legs and arms, but they were quite shadowy and the Knight didn't really know what to make of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Knight who protects this settlement. There have been reports of theft of food and I came here to investigate.\" said the knight, his voice filled with confidence. She grew a rather panicked expression on her face. It was a knight! Knights were always ruthless to criminals! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, a thing over there!\" she shouted as she pointed towards the other end of the room. The Knight looked towards where she pointed and the shadow girl took this as an opportunity to run out the room.  It took the Knight a second to process what just happened and he took off after her. Finding himself in a hallway, he briefly saw the girl run into a room in the far side of the corridor. Running after her, he busted into the room, finding the girl huddled in a corner whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please, just leave me alone. I never hurt anyone, I don't want to die...\" said the girl as she curled up into a ball on the ground. Realizing that he had not acted with delicacy, he realized what needed to be done. Dropping his sword on the ground, he slowly walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'm not here to hurt you.\" he said, She ignored him, still in her panicked state. Gently reaching out, he grabbed her hand gently, finding it to be solid. Looking at him, he could tell that the girl was completely innocent, aside from stealing all that food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll explain everything to the townsfolk. I'll pay for the damages too. I promise, you'll be safe.\" he whispered gently. Taking in her words, she gently sat up and stared right at him, feeling rather calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you have my word as a knight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still feeling rather conflicted, the shadowy girl took a hold of the Knight's hand as he held hers, smiling slightly. \"You won't...l-leave me, will you?...\" She asked meekly, clutching onto his arm as he picked his sword back up to holster it into it's sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to reply, the knight stopped. Was he going to leave her? He could easily sort out the incident and make sure she wouldn't get in trouble, but he had no idea if she would be okay. Looking at her, it was clear why she stole the food, the poor girl was painfully thin, with boney cheeks and stick like arms, the rags covering her body hanging from her tiny frame limply. He couldn't just leave her....but if he wanted the best for her, she'd need to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I will never leave your side. You can live with me from now on.\" The knight replied, smiling back at her. Suddenly, he found himself taken by surprise with a tight hug, surprising energy for such a thin girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst they hugged, he felt the shadowy parts of the girl brush against his skin, feeling cold and soft. It was rather clear the girl wasn't normal by any means, but those eyewitness accounts he recalled from before about the girl gave him an idea on what she was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If it's not too much trouble, can I disguise myself when we enter!\" The shadow girl asked, the dark shadows of her left side slowly enveloping the rest of her body, squashing and contorting her frame into new shapes, until it formed into something new. The shadows disappeared, and now the girl looked completely different. She was now slightly smaller, with a healthy looking body and medium length black hair, darker than before. Wearing simple but warm clothes which fully fitted her, the girl smiled warmly. \"Is this any good?\" She asked in a new voice, a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight was stunned, even though he knew this girl had the ability to alter their appearance. More specifically, to change into the image of the loved ones of those around them. This person was by all means a loved one to him, the image of a young girl he knew long ago, back when he still lived in his home village and hadn't yet embarked on his quest. Seeing her face again, even if it was only an imitation, was something refreshing yet scary at the same time. However, he was brought back to reality by a certain detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems the shadow girl hadn't completely gotten the imitation right, as she had happened to give the knight's loved one a rather hefty chest, her breasts straining the fabrics of the top she wore. The real her he remembered was nothing like that, having a small modest cup size which was smart yet cute. The very idea of her having large breasts, let alone the incredible melons the imitation had, was a pretty laughable concept, but the knight stopped staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be all right, don't worry. Just be your true self, after all you're not a threat in the slightest.\" He replied. It was obvious why she asked the disguise, given the negative opinion on unnatural beings in human territory. Watching the girl morph back into her true form, he took hold of her hand again so to reassure her that everything would be okay.</span></div></div>",
