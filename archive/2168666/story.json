I mean, who would expect me to find a new love right as my mom's lung cancer was about to take a turn for the worse? And who knew that a loud brewery would be the place I'd find it (and in front of <i>my boss</i> to boot)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rainy Tuesday night found me sitting at a table with my team from work. I ended up sitting between a couple guys I don't chat with often, one of them being Marty. Marty and I talked far more than I expected, although the surprise got started early when he refused to scoot over a seat to sit next to one of his work buddies. That meant I got two hours next to Marty, making him laugh with my macabre jokes about what you could possibly run over in his old (trendy) neighborhood. I'd have blamed the IPA for all this, but given we all got to the brewery right after work, I doubt Marty had been pregaming before deciding that sitting next to me was the best way for him to spend the next two hours. I also couldn't blame my outfit, as I'd managed to throw a sweater over my white blouse before running out into the rain to get from the office to my car. I'm not sure what made us keep coming back to chatting with each other. All I know id it took a lot of self control to stay when he decided to leave for the evening. Once he left, I had to put in a lot of effort to not betray how deflated I felt by his absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, I got the call from my dad that my mom was in hospice and that she was too weak to go home. Before I knew it, my team had pitched in on a card offering condolences for my mom's death. From there, every day was an emotional minefield. Marty somehow had figured out how to disarm some of the IEDs littering my brain along the way. Whether it was by the head scratching capitalization of my name in the team sympathy card; trying to find me good non-chocolate candy; or trying to impress me with his trick to get fresher coffee, Marty always had something up his sleeve to boost my mood, if only for a bit. On the other hand, sometimes his actions left me more baffled. I know my social skills haven't evolved past fifth or sixth grade, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings came to a head three months after the happy hour. This time it was a team dinner at an Indian restaurant. Hey, we gotta accommodate our vegan coworkers somehow. Anyway, Marty's boss coordinated everything down to the seating chart. Marty and I sat next to each other again, an arrangement I had a lot of trouble believing was a coincidence. Sipping on my strawberry lassi and nibbling on vegetable samosas, I first tried to focus on the rest of the group (including some people who flew in from the East Coast), but Marty's unusual quietness kept tugging at me. I shifted my attention to him and discovered that not only had he gotten turned down for a promotion but that his wife had no interest in their marriage anymore. He then admitted that he was kind of relieved about the second part because he'd had doubts about that part of his life the day I joined the team. I almost choked on my lassi when he told me this. We ended up ignoring the rest of the group for much of the night as we ruminated over our feelings and the last three months being upheaval after upheaval. Before we left, we exchanged phone numbers but decided to hold off on pursuing anything with each other while we tried to adjust to our respective traumas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe exchanged phone numbers three years ago. Now we share a condo with my husband and cats, alternating between watching the Winter Olympics and going to your cabin for (ahem) photo shoots. Fate really is unbelievable sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Starting at my twenty-first birthday after my husband and I had been trying, unsuccessfully, to get me pregnant.  I went to the doctor for a medical checkup; She told me I had a condition called endometriosis and I would have to have a hysterectomy.  I guess you can say I was one of the lucky ones because it was not cancerous.  But here it is and I'm fifty- four and still have no children.   Yet my husband and I have always taken in all of the strays in the neighborhood and fed them and gave them shelter from the weather.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmy husband was injured in 2000, at the water company, where he worked.  He was hurt using a jackhammer, and it was a terrible back injury.  He was unable to return to do  manual labor, so he took some exams and passed them, from the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA}.   He was promised a good job as a water plant operator, but then the boss's nephew needed a job and they gave it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same year I got a job at our local newspaper as a staff writer.  I was constantly harassed and belittled by another writer, until finally I told her off and told them what they could do with that job.  I worked for a radio station as a reporter and on-air news person and most of the people I know began treating me differently.  People who never liked me or even knew me before, where suddenly smothering me with attention.  but when I got sick and had to leave the job they were nowhere around to befriend me or help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a terrible car accident and almost killed when I passed out while driving on a one-lane road on my way home. I could see my house from where I wrecked.  <br>\r\nMy husband heard me scream and ran to my car, getting me out he then rushed me to the hospital in a neighbor's van.  I had the biggest quack for a doctor that exists.  He did not diagnose my broken ribs, which all of my ribs were broken one side, both my arms were broken, one on the shoulder and one on the wrist. it was a nightmare.<br>\r\nI then proceeded to get pneumonia as I usually did, but this time, with broken ribs, I couldn't cough anything up. I came in an ace of dying, I was in ICU for so long I can't remember how long it was though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was then diagnosed with a rare lung disease and put on a ventilator for a while, then when finally I got to go home, they sent me home on oxygen for the rest of my life.<br>\r\nI have spent months in the hospital for illnesses to my lungs and broken bones due to the fact I developed Osteoporosis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy husband went away somewhere for about a year and I had to move in with my mother during this time, I was unable to stay by myself.  While staying with her a friend,  or at least I thought he was! He said he would stay at my house, watch my cats and take care of things around the house.  It turns out, The old thing robbed me!  He took everything I owned, then he vandalized the property, stealing all the wiring, shower, hot-  water heater, and he left the place a wreck.  Go figure people, I can't...<br>\r\nI reported him to the police, they even caught him with a charge card he got out of my mailbox, but they did nothing to him but take the card from him.  It turns out he is an<br>\r\ninformant for them and makes drug buys while wearing a wire.  I know that he himself uses strong drugs, like meth.  But He got by with stealing my identity and using all these charges in my name and my husbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is just a few of the traumas we have been through, to me life is trauma.<br>\r\nBut I wouldn't change mine, I love the people God put in my life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, peruse my be the wrong word here. After all, I'm the kind of woman who considers a 38 minute article on the potential pilot suicide at the root of the Malaysian Airlines crash to be light reading. I'm not afraid of sinking my teeth into a detailed plan for boosting 5G security. Simply put, I'm the kind of reader that is nerdy enough to get a \"Kick Me\" sign nailed to my back. The only reason that hasn't happened is likely attached to my chest and required plenty of core exercising to prevent backaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how did I end up walking this incredibly strange Boring America tightrope? I grew up watching Cheers with my parents and got a Spice Girls CD for Christmas once upon a time, for the love of everything. I should have walked down the pop culture path. My teenage ambition of screenwriting should have pushed me down that hill to the point of major facial lacerations and bruising. Somehow, I kept from stumbling down that detail-laden rabbit hole, almost ended up in politics, and now spend my time working on a gospel of media analysis and telling Americans to check themselves. I ask them if they are actually angry or if they are picking up on (manufactured) anger around them. What is at the root of their anger? Is it a headline saying, \"<b>She moved home to save money \u2014 and her mom never wants her to leave</b>\"? Or is it that people are too busy yelling thesaurus-formed insults at each other and not actually listening for valuable points in opposite opinions? I have decided that my activism is calling people out on <i>how</i> they're consuming media, because we're all pretty bad at. Let's be real here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize that I'm not ready to push these links to my friends. Hell, the ones I do share don't really get much response. At the same time, I recognize that I'll never <i>really</i> be ready. I have to keep putting the information out there. I have to continue leading the metaphorical horses to water. I need to continue giving them something to drink. They may prefer the bubbly sugar water offered by pop culture and persuasive activists. A cool, clean drink of checking impulsive, emotional responses is much healthier, though. All the same, I know I can't force their mouths to the sugar-free water without looking like I'm drowning them. Still, I'm going to share my collection of Media Analysis links so I can continue to at least do my due diligence.</span></div></div>",

She would do her grocery shopping before she'd step in her lonely apartment, this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she didn't have someone waiting for her or someone she'd like to cook for didn't exist anymore didn't matter. This weekend would be different. She would treat herself as if she mattered with or without a partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught  the beautiful beach photo on the wall of a man and a woman watching a Caribbean sunset with their heads touching. She shrugged as she slipped her hand into the side pocket of her jacket to check if her wallet is still here. Good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator was crowded. She slid to the side and leaned at its wall, closing her eyes. <br>\r\nsoon she'd be out on the street, smelling the spring rain and getting soaked.Why didn't she wear her raincoat in the morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tired!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him. Golden skin, honey-colored eyes, golden curls. Tall, too! Yes, of course, the new communications officer. She remembered him being introduced during the week to her floor by Kate, the CEO. What was his name? Joshua something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The end of the week,\" she tried to smile so to act friendly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Joshua Sterling, and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted on her feet. \"Emma Walker, I work on the fourth floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember,\" he said. \"I saw you during the introduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched her hand to her forehead. \"I remember your being introduced, too. Welcome to the company. I guess you'll be, you are, working on the sixth floor or am I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's what Kate said.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma wasn't sure why he was talking to her. She also wasn't sure she liked Joshua's smug, well-adjusted look. If Emma were to be a new worker in a company this size, she'd want to sink into the floor to not be seen. In fact, that's what she had done three years ago, even though Jen, her childhood friend, was working here, also. But it was then, and Jen had moved on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you'll have a great weekend after a long week,\" Joshua said. \"Any interesting plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know...\" she said undecidedly, looking at the other people in the elevator, listening in their conversation. The nerve of them! Suddenly she decided to tell the truth. \"My weekends are as boring as my working days.\" She chuckled at her own brazenness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"I can't believe that, but taking your word for it, how about....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But time passed quickly and it is six thirty PM and Joshua has  not come yet. She becomes nervous and worried in the same time.

Good afternoon Emma! How are you? Emma smiles to her neighbor even though she is completely nervous and angry. Hello! Sally how are you! Pleased to meet you! Emma I have found this next to my door. It is for you but someone has put it there accidentally. Thank you so much Sally! It is really kind of you.<br>\r\nEmma closes the door and opens the great perfumed box addressed to her.
