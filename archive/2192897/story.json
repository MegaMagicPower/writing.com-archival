The night will be filled with nothing but rain and wind. A wasted evening so far. At least tomorrow is the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You slump into your green gaming chair. The monitor's bright screen was tiring your eyes. A can of Pepsi and a small bag of cheerios kept you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Paying for Photoshop is not your goal. A trial should do the trick. You only needed it to edit photos for your homework. Arriving at a website of a distro, you hit download without thinking. Sleep was getting harder to fight off. You went to bed, as the download progressed. But it wasn't Photoshop... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You woke up, feeling somewhat refreshed. You hear the engine of your mother's car. You gasped. Like a surprised cat, you leaped out of bed. You went to your window, sliding it open. You frowned, seeing her backing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lewis!\" You flinched from the voice. \"Mom said you're babysitting us! No leaving the house!\" Jessica's voice sounded like nails scraping on a chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You groaned. You're left with your sisters again. You hoped at least one day they will tag along with her for a, \"bring your daughter to work\" day. Luck wasn't feeling up to it. You scratched head, with irritable feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took that thought out of your mind. Photoshop was more important. You made your way to your computer, noticing an odd quirk. On the screen, it said: Thank you for downloading, Photomerge. Enjoy your fusion fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The fuck?\" You sat down in your chair. \"Photomerge...\" You launch the program. You stared at the splash screen before it instructed you to put in two photos of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Curious, you decided to do what it told you. Looking at photos of fusions would amuse you. Although, the thought of merging with Hannah stirred your arousal. What about Kim and Mike? Looking at your photos on your computer, you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hannah and Kim merged together. Mike and your sisters? Or, a hot cheerleader fusion as a best friend? Your imagination was guiding you. But, you have no idea of its true purpose... </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You have downloaded a strange version of Photoshop, and you can merge people into all sorts of hybrids... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is based on the original Photomerge. It was an interactive by lilmalawi that used to be hosted on this site. I've decided to reboot this story after it got deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the original, expect sexual scenarios to happen. However, there should never be any NSFL content in the story (no guro, no scat, no water sports, etc). The story is moderated, but don't fret. I <i>will</i> edit for spelling errors, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you like the concept of merging, and some other kinks please join my discord server. You can even discuss about the story there, along with another one called, Merge Necklace: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://discord.gg/DQKxG35.\" target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/DQKxG35.</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****The Original Cast of Characters UPDATED*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis: [This is you!] A 16 year old boy, and sophomore.
