William was headed northward to Camelot, the beautiful court of King Arthur and the legendary Knights of the Round Table. For the past five years, William had dreamed of becoming one of Arthur's knights. He had heard of their exploits--the wondrous tales of Lancelot and Galahad and Gawain--and now, the King had returned from a long and arduous quest. William's time had finally come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a bridge which passed over a dark lake. In the distance, William could hear the eerie voice of a fairy or other mythical creature singing a lament. He paid the voice no attention and continued onwards to Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at a village and in the distance, he could see a great stone castle--Camelot, at last! He moved onwards through the village, but was stopped by an old hag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Evening, deary! Fancy a drink? My brother runs a pub in town, and I think he'd be more than willing to treat a young man so fine as yourself to a pint or two of ale.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><b>Well...</b></span></span></div></div>",

Onward he rode towards Camelot, and finally he arrived at the gates. Above him loomed the massive castle that housed King Arthur's court. Before him stood a gallant knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><b>Good day,</b></span> he said, <span class=\"corange\"><b>What is your purpose here?</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clred\">I wish to join King Arthur's knights at the Round Table, sir.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\">He's, uh, he's very busy at the moment.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clred\">No he's not.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\">Yes he is.

You think that just because I'm keeping watch at the gate, I'm not qualified to sit at the Round Table. Is that it? I bet you think me pretty dim-witted, do you not?

He never even went to college.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clred\">And you did?</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"corange\">For Christ's sake, yes!

After passing through a few chambers, he stood in the great hall of Camelot.

I thought I told that fool not to admit anyone!</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam bowed before the King as he said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clred\">My lord, I am William.

I know well what dangers await.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Sir Lancelot burst into the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">Sir, the people are starting to gripe again.</span></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\">Damn it, Lancelot.

Then oddly, he saw a sign on the same road he came in on, that he could swear hadn't been their before.  And next to it was the Knight that had guarded the gate, with an evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam said, \"King Arthur has sent me on a noble quest to slay the dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Knight tried to restrain a chuckle and said, \"Ah I expected he would.... just follow the signs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sign led William off of the main road and along a trail, and soon there was another sign, \"To the Dragon... you're almost there!\"  He shortly came to a cave with a large dragon sized opening where there was a huge sign with an arrow, stating \"This is it.... the dragon is in here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeething about all of the signs seemed odd to William, they wording was overly large, and crude and seemed like they might have been made by some half-inteligent animal instead of a human.  But he dismissed that notion, and called into the mouth of the cave, \"Vile dragon, come out in the open for I intend to slay thee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large reptilian head poked from the cave, that terrified William's horse, which bucked and threw him to the ground.  William quickly recovered, drew his sword and swung with all his might just as a large taloned paw descended on him.  The blade clattered uselessly on the dragon's hard scales, and with a quick shake, the dragon had knocked it out of William's hand.  Then the beast leaned back against the hill next to the cave's mouth, and while he hummed a tune, began pealing off William's armor and then his clothing. Then it opened its terible jaws widely and was about to pop William inside when the exasperated knight screamed, \" Wait, this isn't supposed to happen! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paused, and said , to the trembling William, \"Well of course it it my boy, its part of the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What deal?\", William said, relieved that the dragon could talk, seemed quite civil, and had not swallowed him already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the deal with King Arthur, Arthur PENDRAGON, to be precise.  You see, to carry the title  Pendragon, you make a deal with a dragon to be the kingdom's protector, and to show other kings and enemies  he has a dragon protector, he displays the image of the dragon on his flags and pennants, hence the name PENDRAGON.... now what part about this don't you understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam stammered nervously, \"Well,  The part about King Arthur sending me out to slay you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slay me?\" the dragon chortled in derision.  Humans don't really slay dragons, just look at the success you had, though I suppose there are some chidren's fairytales that say otherwise, and good thing for them because they keep fools like you coming. You see, part of the deal with me being protector dragon of the kingdom is that I get three, free  square meals a day, and I am afraid he sent you instead instead of a fat calf for tonight's supper.  I can scarely blame him, as a calf runs upwards to eight schillings and six pence these days, while I should expect you didn't cost him anything, I suspect  Now while its tur that a fat calf would be a bit more filling, there is my second business you know, which makes you nearly as good as the calf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's that?\", Wiliam mumbled in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nodded his toothy muzzle towards the pile of William's armor on the ground, and said,   \"Why, didn't you know?  I happen to be the greatest purveyor of used armor in all of Camelot!\"  And on that note he swallowed William in a sinle gulp.   </span></div></div>",
