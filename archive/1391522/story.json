He sneaks up on her and \"RASENGAN\" HE USES THE RASENGAN TO KILL HER AND MAKES IT SO STRONG THAT IT RIPS A HOLE THROUGH HER STOMACH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, that was just Naruto daydreaming. Naruto had gotten hungry and started daydreaming because of the lust for Ichiraku Ramen. \"Dangit! I lost her. Oh, man lets see. I'll start looking over there.\" Naruto walked around town and asked if anyone had seen the girl. Apparently people had been looking for Naruto because they would reply \"No, sorry, but someone was asking for you earlier.\" or \"Oh, yeah. I saw her go that way. She was asking for the hokages place.\" Naruto ended up going to the street up ahead and found Kakashi asking people a question. Kakashi looked at Naruto and said 'there you are'. Kakashi lead Naruto to the hokages place and found that the girl was talking with Tsunade. Just before he walked into the room though he overheard the words 'Gem of different dimensions? Are you sure?' They stopped talking when Naruto and Kakashi walked into the room. 'What are you talking about' asked Naruto. 'Nothing' Tsunade replied. 'Oh, come on I heard you say something.' Naruto replied. 'No you were just hearing things.' Tsundade said troubled 'I doubt it.' Naruto said inquiringly ' Are you hungry again Naruto?' Tsunade said assuringly now. \"Well Yeah, but...\" Naruto decided to shut up. He knew that this kinda thing had happenend before where he got hungry and started to see things or hear things. \"So Naruto have you believe in different dimensions?\" Tsunade asked.</span></div></div>",
