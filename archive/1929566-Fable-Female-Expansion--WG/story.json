It is time to wake up\", came the voice of her loyal butler, Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Ugh, go away, Jasper\", groaned the Princess. Mornings were not her thing. <br>\r\n\"Now that is hardly the response of a Princess. And after the cooks spent all that time preparing your birthday cake...\"<br>\r\n\"Cake?\"<br>\r\nThe Princess jumped out of bed. She loved the cake the cooks made. It was so nice. The way it fell apart in your mouth. The soft sponge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess was brought back by her dog licking her hand. <br>\r\n\"Hey boy. Did you sleep well?\", She asked her companion. <br>\r\nHe barked in response. <br>\r\n\"Good. I slept well as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt this conversation, but your clothes are ready. The finest cloth, with immaculate stitching. The white would bring out the colour of your eyes\". Jasper came over carrying a short brown skirt, a pair of tights and a white top that was quite tight around her breasts. <br>\r\nAfter a quick change, the Princess left the room. Soldiers saluted her as she passed and people greeted her. Nothing different happened. And why would it? She was only a human, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning into the kitchen, the Princess is surprised to see a huge cake, at least three layers of sponge and frosting. So nice...<br>\r\n\"Princess, are you okay\", asked one of the cooks. She had been gradually getting closer to the cake. <br>\r\nShe backed up a small amount and cleared her throat. \"Yes, I'm fine. Just looking forward to the party, that's all.\"<br>\r\nShe quickly left the kitchen before she devoured the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party, a number of people had turned up. Her butler, Jasper, her combat mentor, Sir Walter Beck. Heck, even her brother had turned up. The Princess didn't really care about them though. She was waiting for the cake. <br>\r\nAfter a quick Happy Birthday Song and a few introductions, the Princess finally had her chance at the cake, along with other baked goodies. Quickly grabbing a plate, she swiped a couple of slices of cake, an Apple pie and a Mince pie. After grabbing her food, she ran off to her den in the library, where she quickly ate all the food. She was disappointed at how fast she ate it, so she returned to the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more cake than she could manage, the Princess finally went to bed. As she slept, the fat from the cake was transferred onto her slim body, causing her pyjamas to tighten and me of her buttons to pop out. <br>\r\nWhen morning arrived, the Princess found it harder to get up. Upon looking in the mirror, she was met with the sight of a...</span></div></div>",

She had just fought her way through a group of Hollow Men that had invaded the local tavern in her name-sake town, Brightwall. <br>\r\n\"Thank you so very much, Princess!\", weeped the owner of the tavern. He kind of lost when he asked the Princess for help clearing it out. <br>\r\n\"Happy to help\", replied the Princess. She was happy to help, as everyone she helped supported her in her rebellion against her brother, King Logan. Walking out of the tavern with a slight limp, the Princess sighed. <br>\r\n\"A Hero. The most powerful person in Albion and I'm easily hurt by a walking bone pile\", she complained. It wasn't her fault that she had dropped her sword when countering a Hollow Man's slash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the Potions stand, the Princess was disappointed to see that it was closed. <br>\r\n\"Curse my luck. I'll have to have a pie if I want to travel tonight.\"<br>\r\nLimping over to the Pie stand, she was immediately spoken to by the owner. <br>\r\n\"Hello, Princess!\", he shouted happily. He was a slightly porky man. He looked as though he had been sampling his own pies. <br>\r\n\"Hello. I'd like a pie. Any kind will do\", she told him. <br>\r\n\"Perfect. You can sample my new pie! I call it the Meaty Pie. It combines chicken, beef and pork, along with a nice meat tasting gravy.\", he shouted. <br>\r\nThe Princess flinched every time he shouted. He was pretty loud. <br>\r\n\"I'll take one.\"<br>\r\nThe owner walked off and returned with a large pie. It was about double the size of a normal pie and looked twice as delicious. <br>\r\nThe owner was happy for her to just take it, as long as she came back. After multiple promises that she would, the Princess limped off to her house just outside Brightwall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival, her faithful companion, Shadow, was enthusiastic in his greeting. After a thorough licking, the Princess sat down at her table. Pulling the pie out of her rucksack, she gave it a quick look over before cutting a small slice. Popping it in her mouth, her mouth exploded with flavour. <br>\r\nThe three kinds of meat mixed together to give a perfect taste, which was intensified by the gravy. <br>\r\nWhile eating, she failed to notice that each piece she ate made her body gain a little fat. To begin with, it wasn't much. Just a couple of pounds in her belly. But as she ate more and more, her gain sped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer small belly pushed out to form a small potbelly. Her B-Cup breasts bloated up to C-Cups. Each of her ass cheeks gained 5 pounds. After finishing a quarter of the Pie, the Princess was back up to full health. Standing up, she didn't notice her gain but felt a bit more tired. Deciding to put her plans on hold, she walked up her stairs and collapsed on her bed, fully clothed. Falling asleep, she was plagued by dreams involving the Pie she had just ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, it wasn't a dream. She had sleep-walked back down to the Pie and was now slowly eating it. The Princess' once perfect body was bloating again. Her ass swelled with fat and her belly burst free from her top. Her breasts jumped up another cup size and popped a button of her top. <br>\r\nDoes the Princess wake up and realise what she is doing? Or does she remain sleeping and gaining?</span></div></div>",

Forgetting to use any cutlery this time around, she scooped up pieces of pie with her hands and shoved them into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each bite she took was making her body swell and swell by the second, dropping bits and pieces of crumbs and chunks of meat onto herself; as her clothes struggled to keep her growing frame contained. The more she devoured, the less remained of what the Princess' body was like before; in terms of shape and size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts grew to another cup size and burst her top wide open, buttons scattered away in different directions, free for all to see, as they now looked like a pair of small sized basketballs, which sagged side to side on her growing belly. Her arms were full of pudginess and flab that was clearly hanging from them. Her hands were no better, being quite pudgy themselves; as her fingers were looking very plump like sausages. Her belly was getting softer and bigger than before, drooping over her waist like an apron. The belly would gurgle and churn, unknown to the Princess, symbolizing it was holding in some massive amounts of gas. Her huge butt looked like two big watermelons. It was perhaps as big, if not bigger, than her belly. Her ass cheeks drooped down her legs and would sway and jiggle with each movement she took. And lastly the Princess' thighs looked like logs and would share in the jiggling madness whenever she moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing the rest of the pie in her sleep, the Princess, wearing only her tight skirt and shoes, rubbed her stained greasy hands on her belly while moaning with delight and planted herself onto the floor; and proceeded to drift away into a deep slumber while occasionally snoring loudly.</div></span></div></div>",

I was gonna eat that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver brought her back to reality. She wasn't wearing a top. Not seeing the remnants of her old shirt, she opened a wardrobe which had a number of shirts that she had insisted be brought here from the Sanctuary. <br>\r\nGrabbing one, she struggled to button up the front. <br>\r\n\"Come... ON!\" She grunted, pulling the top across. She managed to get a couple of buttons in, but the rest wouldn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching her bigger ass, still not noticing her body, the Princess headed towards town. She wanted more of the pies, and was hoping that the seller was still there. <br>\r\nWhen she reached the town, she ignored the looks she was getting from the townspeople and headed towards the marketplace.

They were good\", replied the Princess. \"You don't happen to have anymore, do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Right this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baker led the Princess behind his stall, where a massive oven housed a huge amount of the pies. <br>\r\n\"Now, how many do you want?\", he asked. <br>\r\n\"Emmm... How much is one?\"<br>\r\n\"50 Gold for the Hero of Brightwall\", he said. <br>\r\n\"All of them\", she quickly said. <br>\r\nAfter handing over a number of bags filled with gold, the Princess headed home. As the baker watched her almost knock a child over, an evil smile appeared on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, the Princess locked her door and dumped all of the pies on the table. The top disappeared under all of them, and some were stacked on top of each other. Drool appeared at the corners of her mouth. She was resisting the urge to dive in and devour every single pie on the table. <br>\r\n\"Come on... Remain dignified\", she told herself. <br>\r\nAfter storing most of the pies in her cupboards and drawers, the Princess set two pies on the table. She did set a knife next to one of them, but her resistance finally broke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a handful, she stuffed it in her mouth. Gravy, crumbs and bits of meat rained down into her cleavage. She grabbed another handful. And another. And another. <br>\r\nWhile she was chomping through her feast, fat was slowly being added to her body. Her belly began to split into two rolls. It lay between her thighs, which were slowly widening beyond the width of tree trunks. Her breasts broke the buttons of her top. They resembled basketballs in size, and sagged down onto her belly. Her ass ripped her skirt apart, leaving her in her panties/thong. Each cheek was a globe of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her slowly growing body, the Princess finished off the first pie. She leant back on her chair and let out a massive burp. She then wiped her greasy hands on her belly, leaving a faint stain. <br>\r\nYawning, the Princess contemplated sleeping. Although the 'thief' who had stolen her previous pies could return and take these ones. <br>\r\nIn the end, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Instead, he placed an expedition to some island above her. <br>\r\nShe swiped all the chess pieces of her board, leaving the game between Jasper and her undecided. Speaking of Jasper, he knew to avoid the Princess when she was angry, having raised her since she was a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess had run out of things to break or knock over in her room, so she stormed out. When the guards outside her room went to salute, she cut them off with a glare so fierce, even Balverines would run. Pushing past them, she stomped down the stairs into the garden. When a Noble would go to greet her, they would receive either a glare or a curse. <br>\r\nAfter a number of nobles had been rejected, the Princess met someone who wasn't so easily scared. <br>\r\n\"Greetings, Princess\", said a wizened old man, with a wispy white beard. <br>\r\nThe Princess glared at him. <br>\r\n\"It's a fine day, isn't it?\", he said, not noticing her stare. <br>\r\nAnd so it went. The old man would comment on something, while the Princess would glare at him. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! SHUT UP!\", shouted the Princess at the top of her voice, drawing the attention of everyone in the garden. <br>\r\nThe old man didn't reply. His expression changed from a pleasant happy one to a surprised one to a very, very angry one. <br>\r\n\"Why, I'm shocked. That is not how a Princess should act, especially to her subjects. Perhaps some humility would teach you?\"<br>\r\nThe Princess stomped her foot. <br>\r\n\"GET OUT OF MY GARDEN!\", she shouted. <br>\r\nThe old man stared at her. <br>\r\n\"Yes, humility. Perhaps... Yes, that would do.\"<br>\r\nThe old man waved his arms while chanting some weird language that the Princess didn't recognise. To be honest, she didn't care. She had stormed off towards her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next morning, the Princess got out of bed. Pulling her pyjama top down, she didn't notice her belly, which had gained a couple of pounds. <br>\r\nAfter throwing on some clothes, she went outside. Her anger had dissipated, but some other feeling had replaced it. <br>\r\nWhat was that feeling?</span></div></div>",

She had been fighting them for a couple of minutes now, and was beginning to struggle. Drinking a health potion, she shot it with her pistol. Roaring, the Balverine charged at her. <br>\r\n\"Damn...\", She muttered, rolling to the side. <br>\r\nConcentrating, she felt heat flow to her hand, which manifested as a fireball. She chucked it at the Balverine. It hit it in the chest, causing it to fall to the group. Running over, the Princess quickly stabbed it through the chest. She had many close calls with things that she thought were dead, but weren't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see what you were guarding...\"<br>\r\nRunning behind them, she found a dark hole, which she assumed led into a cave. <br>\r\n\"Brilliant, another cave\", she said sarcastically. \"Love them\".<br>\r\nShe cautiously made her way down, one hand on her pistol and the other following the wall. She wasn't expecting to run into any trouble, but caves were usually occupied by bats and hobbes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, during which she almost fell down a pit, the Princess reached a massive cavern. There wasn't very much to look at, although there was a path cut into the rock below her. <br>\r\n\"No harm in following the path\", she said, jumping down. <br>\r\nAlong the path, she spotted a couple of animals. A deer watched her pass by before running off. In the distance, a flock of bats circled a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path finally led to what looked like a shrine. The Princess couldn't tell what it was a shrine to, nor did she particularly care. What bothered her was that she had extorted information from a bandit, fought through loads of Balverines and almost fallen down a hole and all she got was a shrine. <br>\r\n\"What a bunch of garbage!\" She shouted, kicking the shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she limped down the steps, trying not to step on her now sore foot when a noise behind her caused her to stop.

Her breasts were three times the size of the Princess's, while her ass stuck about two feet from her body. Her hips were almost as wide as the Princess was tall. And she didn't look too happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you kick my shrine, mortal?\" She asked, her voice echoing around the cavern. <br>\r\nThe Princess, still kind of shocked that this woman had just appeared, made a squeak. <br>\r\n\"Mortal, answer me!\"<br>\r\nFinally snapping out of her confusion, the Princess replied, \"I'm not a mortal. I'm a Hero! And who are you to question me?\"<br>\r\nThe woman glared at the Princess. Her face didn't change. <br>\r\n\"It is beneath a Goddess to answer mortals. Although, a Hero is interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess, stubborn as ever, answered rudely. <br>\r\n\"The fact that I'm a Hero is irrelevant. I see that I've wasted my time here. See you later\", she said, turning to leave. She was stopped when the woman suddenly appeared in front of her. <br>\r\n\"You're going nowhere. You see, I haven't blessed a mortal with my gifts in a long time. And I haven't taken a host body in an even longer time. I find it fitting that a Hero becomes my host\", she said, smiling. <br>\r\nThe Princess just laughed. <br>\r\n\"Please! You expect me to believe that? I'm out of here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the woman, she was half-way to the exit when a cold feeling halted her. She couldn't move, and her body was starting to feel heavier. <br>\r\n\"What's... happening?\", she stuttered. <br>\r\n\"Why, your body is changing to suit my needs\", answered a voice inside her head. <br>\r\nScreaming in surprise, the Princess accidentally shot a wall with her pistol. <br>\r\n\"What? Why?\", she screamed. <br>\r\n\"Because I can\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the heavy feeling intensify, the Princess looked down, just in time to see her breasts jump up a cup size. They were now D-Cups, and had broken the top button of her shirt off, revealing her new cleavage. Feeling her hips crack, she grabbed her ass and found it growing. Her panties were beginning to disappear into her ass crack. Her hips widened by a couple of inches, causing a rip to appear in her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very lengthy argument with her new voice in her head, the Princess looked back at her body. Her breasts were contained, barely, in her top. They were bigger than her head, and weighed more than one of her hammers. Her ass was now two cream orbs stuffed in a very tight skirt. Each one was firm and round. Her hips had widened by a couple of feet to accommodate her new ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I much prefer this form\", the voice said. <br>\r\n\"I don't! Give me my old body back!\", shouted the Princess, stamping her foot in protest. <br>\r\n\"No, I think not\", replied the voice. \"I think it's time for me to assume full control of this form\".<br>\r\n\"Like hell you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a pain began to form in her head, the Princess began to fight the influence of the Goddess. But who gets control of the body?</span></div></div>",

She had just helped Samuel out, as he had accidentally summoned a whole bunch of hollow men and didn't have the means to stop them. She had taken care of it in no time, but she had taken a couple of attacks. Her natural healing ability had healed her in seconds, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking in with Jasper and finding very little in terms of quests, she decided to have some time to herself. She thought that it was time for a little shopping. Looking at the map, she had a couple of options. There was Bowerstone, although it was always packed. Driftwood, while small, was quite cheap. And finally, Brightwall. Cheap and a large selection. There was no competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding outside Brightwall Village, the Princess checked her purse. She had a good amount of coins on her, plus she earnt some coins every hour from rent. Walking into the town square, she could see a number of stalls. There was the blacksmith, although she wasn't in dire need of a new weapon. The pawnbroker was offering 12% more for rare stones. Walking past the potions booth, she stopped and bought a couple of health potions. Further on round, her eye was drawn to a shabby stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in charge looked quite desolate. It was clear that she wasn't selling too much. The Princess aimed to change that. <br>\r\nWalking up to the stall, the woman gasped. \"Your highness...\", she started. <br>\r\n\"Quiet! I don't want people to start calling me 'Your Highness' again. It gets quite repetitive after a while\", said the Princess. <br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. Anyway, can I help you?\", asked the woman. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. You don't seem to be selling too much. Is there a reason?\"<br>\r\nThe woman sighed. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm reasonably new to the market, so not many people stop by. In fact, you're the first today.\"<br>\r\nThe Princess couldn't help but feel sorry for her. <br>\r\n\"What are you selling?\", she asked. <br>\r\n\"Blueberry Pies, freshly made with the best blueberries in all Albion!\", she woman said, clearly proud. <br>\r\n\"I'll take a couple\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Princess had given the woman the coins and received her pies, she waved goodbye. After an unremarkable look around the rest of the market, she decided to call it a day and head home. Leaving Brightwall Village, she headed for her home in Mistpeak Valley. She prefered the solitude, rather than the noise of a city. <br>\r\nInside, she set the pies on the table and went upstairs to get changed. Throwing her travelling clothes into the corner of the room, she threw on a white top, some tights and a brown skirt. Heading back downstairs, she saw the pies on the table. <br>\r\n\"That woman was really nice. And those pies do look good. Might as well\", said the Princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing one of the pies, the Princess cut herself a generous slice. Lifting it to her mouth...</span></div></div>",

Swallowing the first bite, the Princess took another, then another, then another, until nothing was left. Licking her lips, she leant back on her chair and gave a quiet burp. <br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me!\", said the Princess. \"Man, that was good. And there's still some left. It would be a shame if no one would eat it...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting another slice, she ate it in a manner much like the first. Only, this time after finishing it, she felt... full. <br>\r\n\"Strange, I haven't eaten in a while. How have two slices of pie filled me up?\", wondered the Princess. <br>\r\nAfter a while, the bloated feeling disappeared. Deciding that it was nothing, the Princess had a third slice. Once again, the bloated feeling reappeared. This time, it was more intense. Looking at her stomach, she saw nothing out of the ordinary. However, changes were overcoming her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue dot appeared on her nose. It slowly grew in size, turning her entire face a deep blue. It even affected her hair, as its normally brown colour had become blue. Next, the blue colour started moving down her body. Her breasts had gone blue, then her belly and then her legs. Her arms also started changing colour. The Princess didn't notice anything, as her clothes covered her entire body. Once her hands had turnt blue, only then did she realise something was up. <br>\r\n\"What the...?\", she began, when the full feeling began to grow in intensity. Moving her hands to her stomach, she recoiled when it pushed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god!\", she yelled in surprise. Looking down, she saw her belly, once flat, was now pushing against her top. Unbuttoning it, she gasped when a blue sphere appeared. Grabbing it, she whimpered. <br>\r\n\"What is happening?\", she asked, scared. <br>\r\nHer breasts began filling out, causing another whimper. Grabbing them, she gave a quiet moan due to their sensitivity. Feeling her backside beginning to expand, she sighed. <br>\r\n\"What is going on!\", she shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the growing stop. The Princess sighed in relief, before looking at her body. <br>\r\nHer breasts had gone up to E-Cups. Each one was a deep blue and very sensitive. Her belly made her look eight months pregnant with twins. Her backside was now two orbs of blue flesh. <br>\r\nLooking around, the Princess...</span></div></div>",

Normally, a wooden floor would bruise her backside, but now? She was more likely to bruise the floor. <br>\r\n\"What happened to me? One minute, I'm me. The next, I'm this... blue... thing?\"<br>\r\nLooking at her blue body, the Princess couldn't help but be a little turned on. <br>\r\n\"It's not that bad...\", she giggled, before catching herself on. \"What am I on about? I need to find a cure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on the floor, the Princess attempted to get to her feet. She struggled, and rocked backwards and forwards. Eventually, she was on her feet, and regretting it. <br>\r\n\"I feel so heavy\", she complained. \"Whatever has happened to me, it's made me heavier!\"<br>\r\nA rumble caused her to flinch. <br>\r\n\"I cannot be hungry! I just ate some pie!\"<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled in response. Apparently, it wasn't satisfied with what she had had. <br>\r\n\"Fine!\", she exclaimed. \"A couple more slices, then we are going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her girth over to the table, she attempted to fit her backside into a chair. After the arms had broken off and the chair had finished creaking, the Princess grabbed the remnants of the first pie and stuffed it  into her mouth. She instantly regretted it, as it reminded her of how good the pie was. Reaching across the table, she grabbed the second pie and cut it in half. Leaving one half, she quickly finished the other half. <br>\r\n\"Oh yes... Tastes so good!\", she said, licking her blue lips. <br>\r\nStruggling out the chair, and cringing at the creaking it emitted as she moved, she started moving towards the front door when a familiar feeling returned. <br>\r\n\"Oh dear god... No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of running out the front door, the Princess moved as fast as she could towards the back door. As she ran out into her garden, she felt her body begin to expand again. Only this time, it was a little bit more pleasurable. <br>\r\nAs her spherical belly grew bigger, she watched her breasts expand. Poking one, she moaned at how sensitive it was. Grabbing both, she moaned loudly, partly due to the growth under her hands, and partly because of the sensitivity. <br>\r\n\"Oh, yes... Bigger!\", she gasped, massaging her growing breasts. <br>\r\nWhile she was focusing on her breasts, her belly, still a sphere, had gone past the realm of twin pregnancy and was making her look pregnant with around six kids. Her backside had reached the size of her old belly and had basically rendered her skirt useless. Her panties, stained blue, were slowly disappearing into her ass crack. Her body, while still mobile, was beginning to become a sphere. Her thighs had joined in the growth, giving her a pear shape. Her cheeks had filled up as well, making it slightly harder to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stopped. The Princess was disappointed, but when she saw her body, she wasn't too happy.  <br>\r\nShe was mobile, but barely. Her breasts were about J-Cups. Her top hung around her shoulders, as she had unbuttoned it to have a better grasp on her breasts. Her bra contained them, but was showing signs of strain. Her belly was massive. It was still a sphere, but was the same size as an exercise ball. Each ass cheek looked like it was housing a couple of globes. Her thighs completed her lower body, giving her massive hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself, the Princess knew there was only one course of action. </span></div></div>",

She had one problem though. <br>\r\n\"How on earth do I get back into my house?\", asked the Princess out loud. She had grown bigger than the door, and her first attempt to get through the door resulted in her giant hips getting stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter freeing herself from the door, she sighed. <br>\r\n\"I need that pie, but I'm stuck out here. Come on, think!\", she told herself. She waddled her bulk around her back garden a couple of times before trying a couple of ideas she had had. <br>\r\nFirst, she approached her door and, rather hopelessly, tried to suck in as much breath as she could. It worked briefly, before she felt the need to breathe halfway through the door. Throwing herself to the side as best she could, she got out before she was truly stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then... Idea number 2!\", she exclaimed. <br>\r\nWaddling to the door, the Princess placed her hands on her hips and pushed. The feeling that followed was uncomfortable, to say the least. Once again, her plan failed as she couldn't stick the feeling. <br>\r\n\"Fine! Last idea before I walk back into that town and buy more pies!\", she exclaimed. <br>\r\nWaddling once again to her door, the Princess turned sideways. Slowly moving through the door, she was surprised that her final idea was working. <br>\r\n\"Never expected this to work. Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best!\", she said, happy that she could eat her last pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the table, she was going to forget the knife, but decided against it. Cutting it in half, and then half again, she lifted one bit and quickly stuffed it into her mouth. Bits of blueberries fell onto her skin, but she couldn't distinguish between the fruit and her skin, so she forgot about them. Polishing off her first slice, the Princess lifted a second, and much like the first, it disappeared down her throat. <br>\r\nLeaning back as best as she could, she gave a couple of burps. Lifting the pie tin, she quickly finished it off. <br>\r\n\"And then there was none! Ohhh, I don't feel so good...\", She moaned. <br>\r\nWaddling as fast as she could, she reached her back garden before letting out a massive burp, which made her feel better. It was instantly replaced with a familiar bloated feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Bigger, please!\", squealed the Princess. She was looking forward to this expansion, and had basically stripped to her underwear in preparation. Looking at her belly, she watched in anticipation as it began to grow even bigger. Moving her arms towards her breasts, she was disappointed and slightly shocked to see that she couldn't reach them, no matter how hard she tried. <br>\r\n\"Come... On!\", she grunted. \"Reach... my... Breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually gave up, as she could see what was happening to her body. The previous expansions had involved her body becoming bigger and bluer, but this one was different. Instead of each individual body part growing, her body was beginning to become a sphere. Her arms were being pulled into her bigger upper body, and her legs were slowly being absorbed by her lower body.

Ever since the Darkness had been defeated in what people were now calling the Battle of Bowerstone, most enemies had disappeared from Albion. Heck, even the Sand Furies had mostly disappeared from the deserts surrounding Aurora. This left the Queen/Hero with nothing to do. <br>\r\n\"Man, I thought the life of a royal would be more exciting. It's even worse than when I was a Princess!\", she complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, a problem was arising. People were going missing in the deserts surrounding Aurora. They were all woman. The reason the Queen was there was to investigate the disappearances. When it was mentioned to her in Bowerstone Castle, she jumped at the chance. Now that she was here, she had no idea where to start. <br>\r\n\"The only leads were the woman. And they are gone\", mused the Queen. \"It's best if I take a look around the desert, see if anything comes up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the desert, the Queen sighed. It was just as hot as she remembered. <br>\r\n\"At least I'm not being taunted by the Darkness this time\", she said, shuddering at the thought. <br>\r\nIt eventually got the point where it was too hot for her to continue in her current clothes. She retrieved the Guild Seal from its case and was teleported to the Sanctuary. Jasper greeted her in his usual fashion. <br>\r\n\"If I may ask, why are you covered in perspiration?\", he asked. <br>\r\n\"The desert is a hot place, Jasper\", panted the Queen. She was really feeling the effects of the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into a very dusty set of clothes that were reserved for the desert, she left the Sanctuary. Back in the desert, she still felt hot but it wasn't as bad. <br>\r\n\"Let's continue, shall we?\", asked the Queen to no one in particular. <br>\r\nWhen a voice replied to her question, she almost had a heart attack. <br>\r\n\"Yes, let us continue... Goddess!\"<br>\r\nShe spun around to find nothing. Turning was a mistake, as she felt a blow to the back of her head. She fell to the ground, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen woke up. She was nice and cool, which was surprising. The last she knew, she was in the middle of the hottest desert on the planet. <br>\r\n\"My head...\", she groaned. \"Who attacks Royalty? Honestly...\"<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, she felt a breeze around her lower body. Looking down, she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no longer wearing her dusty desert clothes. She was wearing the robes of Auroran Royalty. She had gold bangles, gold necklaces, gold everything. Looking around the room, she saw a mirror. Peering at it, she recoiled when she saw her new hairstyle. Instead of her short ponytail, she had an elegant updo that wouldn't look out of place in the back garden of her castle. <br>\r\n\"What...?\", she began. She was cut off when the doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man flanked by two Sand Furies walked in. <br>\r\n\"Well, it appears our Goddess had descended upon us. Do not worry, for we shall give unto you your true form\", he said, walking around her. <br>\r\n\"Listen here, I order you to release me. If you fail to do so, the armies of Albion shall descend upon you and...\"<br>\r\n\"Do absolutely nothing, as we have the Goddess on our side\", said the man. \"Now, follow me. I shall reveal your true form\".<br>\r\nThe Queen had intentions of refusing, but as she looked into the man's eyes, she found herself agreeing with the idea. <br>\r\n\"Let us go, then\", the Queen told the man, gesturing for him to lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Queen, the unknown man and the two Sand Furies walked down a corridor, the Queen was attempting to regain control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she successful?</span></div></div>",

She was helpless until they group walked into what appeared to be a large cavern that had been partially converted into a throne room. The throne was similar to the one in Bowerstone Castle, although this one was made out of pure gold. It had a deep blue seat, and was flanked by two more Sand Furies. The man gestured for the Queen to take a seat, which she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we have brought you here because we believe that you are a reincarnation of the great Auroran Goddess. It is said that she is reborn every time Aurora is threatened, so that she may free her people.

I shall therefore become your goddess, and allow Aurora to flourish under my rule\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man appeared to be satisfied with her answer and gestured to an unseen person.

She was surprised to find that the potion tasted a lot like blueberries. Putting the bottle back, she gestured for the girl to leave. <br>\r\n\"It is done\", she told the man. \"Now, tell your new goddess your name\".<br>\r\nHe knelt before her. <br>\r\n\"My Goddess, I am your Chief Priest, responsible for locating the Goddess.

Why won't it leave?\", asked the Queen, scratching it as best as she could. <br>\r\n\"It is the beginning of the changes. Do not fear, no harm shall befall you\", reassured Chief. <br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, the Queen was slightly irritated to find that her mirror had been removed. <br>\r\n\"No one, not even the Goddess, may look upon you while you are in your quarters\", Chief told her from outside her door. She accepted this, although she was still irritated. Lounging on her sofa, she found that the itch had mostly dissipated, only to be replaced by an even stranger feeling. If she had been paying attention to her body, she would've found that she was now a deep blue colour. <br>\r\n\"A goddess... I always knew I was destined for greatness\", she told herself, smiling. She was ignoring the bloated feeling that she was feeling. She stopped ignoring it when she felt heavier. <br>\r\n\"What on Aurora...\", she asked, annoyed at being broken out of her trance. Looking down at her body, she finally broke her mind control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once white, slender body was now violet in colour. And she was no longer slender. She was becoming the opposite. As she watched, her belly began to bloat outwards. Her breasts began to push against her bra, one of the two articles of clothing from Albion that she was allowed to keep. Below her body, she felt her ass begin to expand as well. <br>\r\nGetting to her feet, she rushed out of her room as fast as her bloating body would allow. She found Chief, who smiled when he saw her enter. <br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\", she demanded angrily. <br>\r\nChief held his hand up. <br>\r\n\"Have no fear, Goddess.

They entered each part of her body, mouth, ass and vagina, in equal amounts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive body began its third expansion. Her breasts, already the size of massive watermelons, grew even bigger. They finally broke free of her shirt. Buttons flew off in all directions. Her bra strained against the massive mammaries, but held. <br>\r\nHer backside grew even bigger. Her skirt ripped along the sides, releasing her ass. Each cheek grew bigger and bigger. Her panties held on, but just barely. <br>\r\nHer belly surpassed the rest of her body. It extended about six feet from her body. It was a massive globe. The skin covering it was pulled tight and was covered in stretch marks. <br>\r\nHer face puffed up even more, giving the Princess a third chin. Her arms plumped up even more. Her hands looked like catchers mitts, and her fingers resembled overstuffed sausages. Her thick thighs widened, stopping when they were a couple of feet wide. Her hips had widened to accommodate her gargantuan belly. Her feet had burst through her shoes, any her tights were now straining to hold her massive lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, the Princess woke up. She had a splitting headache, and her back was killing her. But at least she was alive. She didn't respond to her body's growth. She didn't care anymore. <br>\r\nAfter she had struggled to her feet, she paused. What was she going to do now? She was a massively pregnant Hero. But she was still a Hero. Looking across the cavern, she saw another cave. She could either explore that cave, or she could go home and wait until she had given birth. <br>\r\nIn the end, the Princess decided to...</span></div></div>",

Her centre of gravity had shifted due to her new body, and she was having trouble moving her heavier legs. <br>\r\n\"Alright, I can do this!\"<br>\r\nSwinging her hips down and then forwards, she found that it was much easier to walk. It was still hard, but easier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the entrance to the next cave, she stopped. Her face had gone red, and she was breathing heavily. <br>\r\n\"I... I never thought it would be this... this hard to walk\", she said, trying her best to breathe properly. <br>\r\nAfter regaining her breath, she continued onwards. She was shivering slightly, as most of her clothes had been ripped apart. She briefly considered the Sactuary, but decided against it. <br>\r\n\"Who knows how Jasper would react\", she told herself, rubbing her arms in an attempt to heat them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess eventually reached a new cavern, after many, many rest stops.

Because there was two of them, the pleasure she received was greater. She had to resist the urge to moan again.<br>\r\nDown at her belly, it had pushed out again, straining the buttons lower down on her top. Her breasts had also started to grow.

She lifted her slightly bigger body out of the chair in which she sat, and walked over to where she kept her food supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing her mirror, Elise payed no mind to her body.

She needed to make sure that the cooks had left the kitchen, and as a further precaution, the castle, and she needed to wait until there was a break in the guards patrol routes. <br>\r\nShe had mapped it all before. <br>\r\nAt 8:00 PM, the cooks left the kitchen to collect their pay and, 15 minutes later, they left the castle to go see their families, after a quick check that no one had raided the kitchen. Elise couldn't go during this time as some cooks still remained in the kitchen and guards stood in front of the outside door and the inside corridor was filled with servants, nobles and guards. <br>\r\nAt 9:00 PM, guards were still in front of the outside door but the inside corridor was a little bit emptier. At 9:15 PM, the outside guards change, leaving a two minute window for Elise to slip in. She would spend at least half an hour gathering supplies. The next guard change would be at 10:30 PM, leaving another two minutes for Elise, along with her smuggled supplies, to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the hard part. She would then have to get back to her room, which was easy. With a combination of hidden passages and her knowledge of the castle, Elise would never be caught. The perfect heist, in her opinion. <br>\r\nAt 9:00 PM, Elise left her room and walked outside. Nobles were allowed outside until 10 PM, so she had free reign until then. Keeping close to the kitchen door, Elise just walked around until the guards changed. Taking this opportunity, Elise quickly slipped into the kitchen, locking the door behind her. After locking the inside door, Elise started raiding the cupboards and fridges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed as much as she could of her favourites, but leaving some so it wouldn't be noticed. After a good half hour of looting, Elise was finally ready to leave. Checking both doors, guards were still there. <br>\r\nAfter ten minutes had passed, Elise was bored. The apple she had been rolling about had been recently eaten, leaving her nothing to do. Her stomach rumbling gave her something to do. <br>\r\nElise looked around. No one was there, so why was she checking? Reaching into one of her bags, Elise pulled out some mutton. Quickly eating it, she pulled out some more. Then some more and then more. Soon enough, her first bag of mutton was empty. Due to its very high fat content and the amount she had eaten, the mutton had taken its toll on Elise' figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were barely contained within her dress despite the extra material provided by her belly, which had forced its way through and under the dress and now hung down like a small apron. Her ass had forced the back of the dress up but it was still covered by her incredibly stretched panties and a very small amount of her dress. Giving a couple of quiet burps, Elise giggled, which was very unlike her. <br>\r\nUnknown to her, the cooks had prepared a special mutton for the Kings birthday. They had mixed some alcohol in with the sauce and Elise had eaten quite a bit, leaving her a little drunk. It was having a profound effect on her decisions, as Elise had forgotten about the bags she had packed. <br>\r\nShe had heaved her hefty body to her feet and was now raiding the rest of the kitchen, making a lot of noise. <br>\r\nDoes anyone hear her?</span></div></div>",

The alcoholic mutton was a bit potent, especially for her, who had never had an alcoholic beverage before. <br>\r\nThe maid stared at Elise before shouting, \"GUARDS! THERE'S AN INTRUDER IN THE KITCHENS!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Damn.

Reaching the dining room, four guards jumped her. Spinning round, two of the guards were smacked in the face by her bigger breasts, knocking them out. The other two grabbed her arms and attempted to push her to the ground. That didn't work, as Elise used her bigger body mass to crush one of the guards before rolling onto the other one. <br>\r\nGiggling madly, Elise found this fun. Knocking out guards in, what to her was, a high-speed chase. Swaying off, Elise eventually escaped the castle. The guards were still chasing her as she ran into the local Bowerstone tavern. Hiding among the revellers and drunks, Elise would be hard to spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Elise sat at a table by herself, a beer in front of her. She was deep in a day-dream, until someone tapped her on the shoulder. Clumsily turning around, Elise sees that it is...</span></div></div>",

The bags that she had originally packed were lying near the door, unwatched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise wasn't focused on finding food in general. Instead, she wanted more of the King's Mutton. She loved how the meat fell apart in her mouth, how the sauce made her forget about her problems...<br>\r\n\"Yes!\", squealed Elise. She had finally found it. <br>\r\nA number of mutton chops, all drenched in the alcoholic sauce and waiting for someone to eat them. Elise threw herself at them. She tore huge chunks off, occasionally stopping to down a tankard of water. The amount of food she was eating, along with the alcoholic sauce, was having a profound effect on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had gone quite red, and her cheeks had puffed up. Elise was hiccuping every few seconds, and stopped to giggle every so often. Her breasts were stretching her dress to its limit. Bits of mutton and sauce fell into her cleavage, where she would pick them out and then eat them. They were about F-Cups, and were still growing. Her belly was on full view. Her dress had given up on covering the massive sphere of fat. It protruded about a foot in front of her, and jiggled everytime she moved. Her ass, still contained within her panties but just barely, was two massive globes of pure fat. Her ass cheeks would jiggle occasionally, due to her movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Elise stopped. She had run out of mutton to eat. Turning around, she lost her balance and fell over with a loud crash. Giggling madly, she got up to her feet. Grabbing her bags of food, she tries to return to her room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a nearby chocolate river, which looked nice, but Little Sparrow didn't like chocolate, so Rose didn't bother looking there. The Experimenting Room was an interesting area, as Little Sparrow was always experimenting. There was the time she had almost blown up their shack by mixing some silvery metal and water. Deciding that the Experimenting Room was the best choice, Rose headed off in its general direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing upon the door to Experimenting Room, Rose was disappointed to see that it was closed. Her sister never closed doors behind her, unless...<br>\r\nUnless she was in danger! Rose yanked open the door, calling for Little Sparrow. She got no answer. Turning to leave, Rose was surprised to see that the door had disappeared. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not leaving\", Rose said to herself. <br>\r\nHaving a look around, Rose saw a number of weird things. There was a tank filled with small balls. There were some sheep with pink wool. On one occasion, Rose thought she saw a little man with green hair but when checking out the area, she found nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most interesting machine was a giant machine with a button on it. Pushing the button, the machine made a couple of whirring noises, extended outwards a little and produced...<br>\r\nA stick of blue... stuff. (Gum didn't exist at this point.)<br>\r\nPulling it out, Rose eyed it over. She didn't really want to do anything with it, but it looked edible and Rose was very hungry. Licking it, she was surprised to find out that it tasted like a blueberry that the gypsies Little Sparrow and she visited over the Winter. <br>\r\nShe popped the entire thing in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bite was heaven! Some sort of tomatoey taste ran down her throat, before changing to potatoes and a beef tasting liquid. Rose was still chewing at this point, as it changed for a final time. It now tasted like blueberry pie and some cold taste she couldn't identify. As she continued chewing, Rose couldn't see her nose turning a deep violet colour. She didn't notice as the violet hue took over her entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill chewing, Rose started feeling a little bloated. Passing it off, Rose had another look around the Experimenting Room. As she walked, she found it harder and harder to walk, eventually waddling. Looking down, Rose screamed. <br>\r\nHer belly had pushed out from underneath her clothes and was a deep violet colour. Looking over her hands, they were also deep violet. Waddling as fast she could, Rose started shouting for help. All the while, she was attempting to push her belly back, but it fought back. And it was winning. Her breasts joined in the fun, and started to strain the top half of her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the growth stopped. But Rose wasn't happy. She was deep violet and she looked pregnant! Her belly looked like she was 9 months pregnant with twins and her breasts looked like a ball she had once found. The ball was pretty big, which didn't bode well for her. <br>\r\nRose was having trouble moving, as her thighs had no room between them and rubbed get her when she walked. <br>\r\nHappily, she spied the door and waddled towards it as fast as she could. But before she got to the door...</span></div></div>",

Her belly was a ball with two other balls lying on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Rose was unable to move as her legs were slowly being sucked into her spherical body. Her arms were suffering from the same problem. She flapped her arms frantically, trying to roll her huge body. <br>\r\nShe did manage to roll, but not in the right direction. She rolled backwards, away from the door. Rose opened her mouth to scream, but was stunned when it hit off the floor.
