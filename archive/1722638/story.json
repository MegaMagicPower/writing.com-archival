She happened to find the means to do so during a raid on a Terran Rebellion outpost. The Terrans had been developing a shrink ray as a means to shrink spies into and out of classified areas. After raiding the place and testing the shrink ray on one of the captured Terran scientists, she began to formulate her plan within her twisted mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night shift for Terok Nor, the mirror Kira forged documents authorizing a secret mission to the alternate universe in order to cover her true mission, to capture and shrink Captain Benjamin Sisko. <i>Then he can really be my slave</i> she thought as her lips curled into an evil smile. Presenting the documents to the officer guarding the transporter, she grabbed one of the devices used to change universes and stepped onto the transporter pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Habitat ring, Deep Space Nine!\" She barked assertively, and slowly began to dissolve as her plan began to activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Intendant materialized on Deep Space Nine, she couldn't help but stifle a giggle as she thought about a tiny Sisko serving her, rubbing her feet, pleasuring her. Calming herself, she sought out the captain's quarters from her memory. Once she arrived at the door to his quarters, she began to play with the door controls, using an old Cardassian bypass to force them open quietly. Slipping through the now open doors, she made her way over to the master bedroom. These doors opened with a slight his, but it was enough to awaken the ever vigilant captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.. Kira? Is that you?\" asked the captain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of.\" Laughed the Intendant as she fired her shrink ray at Captain Sisko. Instantly, the captain began to shrink in size. How small did he shrink?</span></div></div>",

Sisko feared it was a phaser, and attempted to shield his chest. Though the beam struck him, he didn't feel pain, but nauseousness. More surprising, he noticed that his sleepwear was rapidly growing on him, or rather, that he was shrinking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done?\" He attempted to scream. Instead it came out as a squeak, a voice crack that would have only been appropriate had he been a teenager. The Intendant's face, already luminous with her smile, broke into a laugh after hearing the once imposing captain's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha! Oh this is going to be fun Sisko.\" Kira said as she watched him shrink. Down the man shrunk, until he disappeared into his sleepwear. The Intendant walked over in her black catsuit, and rifled through Sisko's clothes. After a few seconds, she found the small man and scooped him up with her hand. She brought him up to her face, resting in her palm. She smiled down at the man, her signature lustful smile appeared as large as the wormhole to the small man. As he was being picked up by the admittedly beautiful giantess, Sisko noticed the black catsuit, and realized that this woman was not his Kira. Mustering up all the dignity he could standing naked, an inch tall, on a woman's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intendant! I demand that you undo this immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sisko, don't you think you're in little *giggle* position to give orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you done this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After everything you've done to me? You made me a fool in front of my superiors, you attacked my station? And worst of all, you betrayed me! We could have been something together Sisko.\" The psychotic woman began to let her anger take hold of her. The soft hand of the alternate universe Bajoran began to clench into a fist. Sisko lost his breath as the fist tightened. If not the beam, this would be what kills him. But just as soon as the fist formed, it disappeared as mirror Kira regained her calm and condescending face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all of that is going to change now Sisko. Now you're going to be my slave, and not just an average Terran slave, you're going to be my personal special slave.\" Her voice paused on each of the last few words, letting the small captain absorb the terror she was projecting in those words. \"Now,\" she said in a playful tone, \"Should we go ahead and head back over to my place? Or shall we stay at your's for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSisko understood that she didn't intend to listen to her in the slightest, and could only thank the Prophets that Jake had gone out to cover a Starfleet mobile hospital on the war front. Somehow, Sisko felt it would be less dangerous out there, than if they still had shared the same quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Pondered the Intendant, Sisko still in hand.</span></div></div>",

I need...\" He called out before the Intendant could stop him. Her hand balled up into a fist again, crushing Sisko against her soft warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Sisko, I was going to take it nice and easy on you, but now you deserve to travel with me the hard way\". Sisko could feel gravity hit him from within her fist as she sat down on Sisko's bed, and after a few seconds, she uncurled her fist once more, but this time she kept her fingers pinching Sisko's chest, so he wouldn't be able to get his voice back. Beneath him sat the open mouth of mirror Kira's right boot, but he couldn't look down he was held so tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, can you smell that Sisko? That's the scent of my feet, marinating in my boots all day. Oh it must be so sweaty down there, even I can smell it.\" The scent wafted up to Sisko, and he tried to gag, but the lack of air in his lungs left him trying to take in any air that he could, even if it was infused with the smelly odor of the Intendant's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you could have ridden up in my beautiful breasts for the ride home, but since you were such a naughty boy, you're going to have to have a timeout in my boot. I'll see you later my little slave!\" With that she double checked that Sisko was over her boot and then dropped him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSisko fell what seemed to be hundreds of feet from the grasp of the mirror Kira into her boot. The smell intensified as the darkness of her bott swallowed him, but he had been gasping for air ever since she had released him, taking in more of her noxious fumes. He prepared for the end, if not the crushing of her fist, if not the beam itself, a fall from 100 feet would surely do him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the insole of her boot with a wet thud. <i>How am I alive?</i> he thought. <i>Perhaps the beam that shrank me boosted my strength.</i> He locked this information away in his head, hoping that he might be able to use it sometime to escape this madwoman. <i>This madwoman whose sweat I'm now drenched in</i>. He realized that the wetness of his crash had come from the insole, which had apparently soaked up some of the sweat from her foot. His world was about to get a whole lot worse though, as the Intendant's foot began to move back into its home. Whatever light Sisko had was blacked out as the foot entered the boot. Still fearing that he could be crushed, Benjamin ran as far as he could from the foot, but it was in vain. He tripped over the damp fabric of the insole, and landed on his back. Looking upwards in defeat, Sisko couldn't do a thing as mirror Kira's foot came to rest on top of him, crushing him beneath the ball of her foot. Still he wasn't dead, but there was definitely a large amount of pain as he could feel the Intendant stand up, placing her full weight on top of him. All of Sisko's world was now encompassed by Kira's foot. The soft underside of her foot overwhelmed the captain, as did the smell, and the sweat that was now on both sides of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira however was in pure ecstasy. The Benjamin Sisko of this universe, once an object of her fury, was now nothing more than an insole for her feet. She wanted nothing more than to lay down on the bed and touch herself to alleviate this extreme arousal, but she knew she had to get out of here as soon as possible, lest one of Sisko's friends have heard his call for help over the computer. She gave her nether regions a light tap from outside the catsuit, as if to calm her darkest desires, until later. She checked for and felt the squiriming of the tiny captain beneath her feet, confirming her belief that the shrink ray made its target impossible to crush, and walked out of the quarters, and make her way to ops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSisko felt the world lighten as he was lifted into the air. Then within a second the feeling was gone, and the crushing pain returned, even worse. He was pushed further into her skin, leaving an indent against the smooth flesh of the underside of her foot. The cycle continued as Sisko realized that his captor was on the move. Unable to do anything except occasionally squirm, Sisko prayed to the Prophets that Jadzia Dax had heard his brief yelp and was on the way to rescue him before this crazy yet gorgeous woman carried him off to her own universe.</span></div></div>",

I hope you don't mind a little adventure.  I promise your surprise will be worth the wait.  All you have to do is push the button on the transporter - it's already programmed to beam you right to me, oh and don't forget to put on the blindfold.

Then he disappeared in a silvery shimmer of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Neelix didn't realize is that Kes had the transporter programmed to reassemble him much smaller than normal.   When he re-materializes, Neelix will only be about 30 inches tall!
