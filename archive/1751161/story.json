Currently he was undergoing a rebooting fase after their father had repaired the damages had he'd suffered, which meant he wasn't going to wake up anytime soon, or, as Roll sees it: 'the perfect opportunity'. Truth be told, deep down within her metallic heart, Roll knew she had feelings for him that went beyond just 'brother and sister' ever since got she booted up for the very first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last room in the laboratory completely cleaned, Roll went straight the room where her brother was sleeping peacefully. She simply couldn't contain her excitement any longer, she just needed to see him no matter what. She was lucky that only the two of them were in laboratory, as her father was gathering the broken robot masters for salvation that were defeated by her brother, which meant that no one could stop her from what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the room she could immediately see her brother still in his Mega man form resting unconsciously on a large table in the middle of the room. Her smile then reached both edges of her face at the sight of her beautiful brother's face.

Curious you slowed up and headed towards the crowd to see what all the commotion was about. Though you didn\u2019t have a good view, you heard the scientist saying something about mass and molecular conversion while gesturing towards a large machine behind him. You weren\u2019t entirely sure what any of that meant but it seemed like he was preparing a demonstration anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you couldn\u2019t see too well over the crowd the scientist was having some trouble getting his machine working. His intention was to shrink a nearby statue with his device to demonstrate its capabilities. Instead the show was turning into an embarrassing PR nightmare. He had to get it working and fast. Suddenly the machine flickered. Though no one noticed, a small burstfired out towards the crowd. Heading straight towards the newest person to join in. Before you knew what was happening, you were now surrounded by a dense Forrest of towering legs staring around in a combination of panic and disbelief. Was this what that mass conversion thing meant. Someone surely noticed what happened. They\u2019ll fix you up soon surly. But no one saw. No faces were looking down at you. The process was instant and unnoticed by the entire crowd as the scientist finally got it working and resumed his demonstration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were even more terrified now. You needed to get help, but right now you were in extreme danger in the crowd. You had to back away for now or risk getting stepped on. Moving back towards a bridge back to the park you dodged passers by and hugged spaces that people were less likely to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you noticed a shadow looming over you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was six months after the events of Command Mission, and Marino had since returned to her career as a master thief and treasure hunter. However, her time working with the Maverick Hunters had had an impact on her, as she had since been making an effort to rob only those who deserved to be robbed, such as corrupt executives, mob bosses, and other, less scrupulous thieves. She'd sometimes even receive assignments from the government at central tower to spy on suspected criminals or search for treasure in newly discovered ruins. However, while Marino couldn't complain too much about her current lot in life, there were times when she would miss the old days, when she would steal what she wanted from who she wanted and answer to no one but her own whims. It's not like a government paycheck didn't pay the bills, but stealing just wasn't quite as fun when she wasn't breaking the rules. In fact, just the previous week, a famous diamond had been on display at the Giga City museum, and it took every ounce of willpower she had to resist the opportunity to steal it. Of course, if she had stolen it Central command wouldn't have had much trouble putting the pieces together. The bottom line was, working for the government was beginning to seriously cramp Marino's style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Marino was exploring the ruins of an old laboratory on the edge of the island, hoping to find some lost technology she might sell for a tidy profit. Thus far, she hadn't found much more than your standard assortment of junk store rubbish. \"Geez!\" exclaimed the thief, \"I swear, it must have taken me half the day to reach this old lab, and now here I am wasting the other half of it rooting through piles of garbage. And hear I thought I was going to find my next big score!\" Little did Marino know just how \"big\" of a score she was in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about ready to call the day a loss, she noticed a spot on the wall that seemed to be slightly uneven. Upon taking a closer look, she found a hidden switch. Making sure to stay alert of any traps this switch might trigger, Marino carefully pressed the switch. Another part of the wall slid open, revealing a hidden passageway. \"Well now, it looks like I may have found something worth stealing after all!\" Quickly making her way down the newly opened hallway, Marino came upon a single door. Upon opening it, she was greeted with a large room with walls lined with blank computer monitors. At the end of the room sat an enormous monitor and a large computer terminal. \"Well, if there's anything of value around here, it's probably recorded on that computer\" she thought, as she made her way to the terminal. Using some of her hacking tools (vital to any thief in the year 22XX), she was able to bypass the computer's security measures and reached its main database. Oddly enough, there seemed to be only one file, labled \"Project: Goddess\". Her curiosity piqued, she opened the file, to be met by the most curious message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo a lady reploid who desires true power,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this, then you have stumbled upon my greatest work. I have designed this program to give unlimited power to any female reploid who downloads it. Unfortunately, upon its completion, I fear I will already be long for this world, as certain parties have deemed my research too dangerous. As such, I have left this computer network to finish what I started, so that some day, women like myself may be able to experience absolute power and show the world what happens to those who try to suppress our evolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Levana White<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the message, Marino noticed that the computer had released a data chip, similar to the ones that had contained the data for X and Zero's advanced Hyper Modes. Analyzing the data it contained, Marino found that it did indeed contain the data for a new Hyper Form: the Goddess Armor. However, there were a few oddities about this form. First of all, unlike most Hyper Modes, which were designed for only one user, this one could be used by any female reploid. Second, it's data apparently could be replicated, presumably to take advantage of the first point. Finally, and Marino had to read over the data a couple of times before she could register what it said: All of the Goddess Armor's specs (Power, Shields, Speed, Duration, ect.) were listed as \"unlimited\". \"Boy\", she thought to herself, \"either the lady who made this was really full of herself, or this is some sort of miracle program. Either way, I can't wait to try it out! I'm not sure about this 'evolution' stuff, but I could do with some 'true power!'\" Suddenly, all the monitors in the room started flashing red! \"Intruder alert! Intruder alert!\" the droning security voice repeated. Suddenly, a large, red, dragon-like mechaniloid broke through the floor of the room. \"Well, looks like I'll get to try out this new Hyper Mode sooner than I thought! Let's just hope it works as well as that lady said it does!\" As the large mechaniloid lunged at the thief, she shouted \"Goddess Armor, activate!\" Immediately, Marino was consumed in a large flash of light, as she felt what seemed like an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Marino began to stir. \"Man, what a time for an earthquake!\" she exclaimed, looking at the ruins around her. \"It really did a number on the place, too! Just look how tiny the pieces of rubble are!\" Marino then looked at herself, checking for any damage. Oddly enough, there wasn't a scratch on her. Even more odd, however, was her new attire. It resembled a black bikini with a turquoise line pattern. Her hair style had also changed, as it had let itself down and had seemed to grow out. Lastly, she now wore an impressive black and gold necklace with a blue gem hanging from the center. \"Well, I was expecting something a little more... armor-like. Still, I suppose the fact that I suffered no damage from that earthquake means it works.\" Suddenly, she recalled the giant mechaniloid that had attacked her earlier. Just as she began to wonder what happened to it, she felt something begin to wiggle under her butt. Lifting her tush slightly, she felt underneath herself and, much to her shock, found a tiny mechaniloid. \"So, did you shrink, or...\" and then it hit her. This \"Goddess Armor\" must have made her grow! \"Wow... guess that lady wasn't just blowing smoke. Judging by those trees only coming up to my ankles, I must be around 500 feet tall!\" Looking down at the little dragon, she wondered what to do with the little guy. Suddenly, she got a rather mean idea. She brought the tiny robot up to her face, which bore a smirk of anticipation, and said \"Hope you can swim, little guy.\" Then, after giving the tiny dragon a farewell kiss, she pulled her arm back and threw it across the ocean. \"Man, even relative to my old size, I don't think I could throw that far! I guess this armor really does make me infinitely powerful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there now remained the question of what to do with all this power...</span></div></div>",

With how bored I've been lately, becoming a goddess and having a bit of fun with this city is starting to seem like a pretty good idea. After all, anyone can steal things like technology and treasure. It takes a true master thief to steal control of an entire city!\" With that, Marino had decided: she would briefly turn back to normal, return to her apartment and rest for the night, then give Giga City a show it wouldn't soon forget. \"Rest well, little island,\" the thief laughed to herself as she drifted to sleep, \"for tomorrow, you'll know the power of goddess Marino!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day seemed like any other to the citizens of Giga City. After Colonel Redips' attack on Central Tower, the city was fairly quickly rebuilt, this time as a normal, ground based island rather than a floating one. At this time, Marino was standing in front of the newly rebuilt tower, still at her normal height. After scanning the \"Goddess Armor\" data further, she had discovered that she could freely adjust how large she was while in goddess form. As such she figured that she would start by growing large enough to get the entire city's attention, then shrink down to a size at which she could more easily toy with the tiny town. With her course of action decided, Marino grinned and shouted \"Goddess Armor, activate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Giga City fell silent as they stared up at the sexy, green haired giantess. She was as tall as Central Tower, or roughly half a mile in height. Pleased to see she had a captive audience, Marino began to speak. \"Well, hello there,\" she said, in the most lustful voice she could manage, \"I'd just like to tell you, I'll be your goddess from now on. I don't have many rules, other than do whatever I tell you. If you do, you can be sure I'll be more than happy to reward you with some time with these,\" she spoke, leaning forward while squeezing her ample breasts, \"or this,\" turning around and thrusting out her panty clad ass,\"or maybe even with a trip to my... secret area...\"after which she began rubbing between her legs while moaning slightly. \"However,\" the giantess continued, her sexy voice taking on a darker tone, \"cross me, and I can guarantee you an... unpleasant end under my foot,\" stomping the ground for emphasis, \"or in my belly\" she said as she rubbed her tummy while licking her lips. \"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get along just fine. Just... try not to get on my bad side, or you'll see just how naughty your goddess can be! Any questions?\" With this last statement, the city went into an uproar. \"Music to my ears\", thought Marino, as she shrank down to a size of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets of Giga City were in a panic, as most of its citizens rushed to evacuate. Unfortunately, so many people leaving a city at once tends to congest the roads, and as a result there was no shortage of vehicles crowding the streets, filled with people for Marino to play with. After briefly analyzing the roads, she determined her course of action. Spying a nearby highway exit, the goddess walked over, sat down with her rear facing the exit, and waited, giggling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\"All I wanted to do today was go to work, go home, watch some TV, and go to bed... and then THIS happens!\" muttered the young office, now speeding down the highway hoping to get to the nearest airport before he could get caught in the giant reploid's path of destruction. This man was one of the city's human inhabitants (the city had become more integrated some time ago) and although he wouldn't consider himself to be prejudiced against reploids, all of the recent maverick uprisings had left him somewhat wary about his reploid neighbors and coworkers. However, he never saw this coming. As he sped down the road, he noticed that the giantess was making a path toward the very part of the highway he was driving on! \"Damn it! I gotta get off at the nearest exit, or who knows what this lady might do to me!\" But as he adjusted his path, he noticed too late that the goddess had once again shifted her path, and had sat down a short distance from his vehicle. As he was going too fast to turn or brake, all the young man could do was brace for impact and hope that this lady reploid was feeling merciful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nMarino sighed in ecstasy as she felt what must have been a five to ten car pileup on her gigantic derriere. Turning around, she could see a group of people escaping their wrecked vehicles. Chuckling at their efforts, she reached down into the crowd and grabbed a group of five humans and reploids, the young office worker included, allowing the rest to escape. At her present height, each person appeared to be about 2 inches tall to Marino. She then laid back on the nearby stretch of road and placed her tiny captives upon her soft belly. The giant thief briefly observed the expressions of shock and terror upon the faces of her little toys. Pleased with their reactions, she decided to break the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already heard my announcement, so I don\u2019t think extensive introductions are necessary. To keep things short, I\u2019m feeling kinda sore right now, so I\u2019d like it if you guys could give me a massage. Do that, and afterwards I\u2019ll let you go on with your lives. Does that sound like a good deal to you?\u201d Marino finished with a warm smile. For a moment, no one spoke, and the goddess was about to continue with her orders, when one of the reploids, who appeared to be a hunter model, spoke up. \u201cI-I\u2019ll never give in to your orders, Maverick!\u201d he stammered trying to put on a brave face and readying his arm cannon. \u201cWell,\u201d said Marino, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to hear that. But I do suppose I wouldn\u2019t be much of a goddess if I didn\u2019t follow up on my threats.\u201d Having said that, the self established goddess reached for the rebellious hunter. He fired a few shots from his buster, but they failed to do even the slightest damage to her hand. Grabbing the tiny reploid between her fingers, she brought him up to her face. \u201cAnd by the way,\u201d said Marino, her voice taking on a cold tone, \u201cI don\u2019t take well to people who call me Maverick.\u201d With that, the thief tossed him between hen lovely lips and began chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny more questions?\u201d Marino asked, her voice slightly muffled due to here talking between bites. She then swallowed the insubordinate hunter and let out a soft (to her), contented burp. Not hearing any further objections, she looked over her remaining captives and decided where to assign them. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, addressing two heavily built reploids, \u201cyou two look like you were built for construction and other manual labor, so I think I\u2019ll have you massage my feet, and you\u2019ll do my thighs.\u201d Nodding silently, the large men began to work their assigned positions. \u201cAs for you,\u201d Marino continued, turning to a young human woman, looking to be about twenty years old, \u201cyou don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve done much in terms of working harder muscle, so I guess it\u2019s okay if you give me a good belly rub.\u201d \u201cTh-thank you my goddess!\u201d the woman stated hurriedly, and quickly began rubbing the \u201cground\u201d beneath her feet. \u201cAnd you\u2026\u201d she began to say to the office worker, before pausing briefly to look him over. \u201c\u2026don\u2019t I know you from somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp to this point, the young man had been too terrified to really see anything about this goddess, other than that she was very large and very, very sexy. Having been prompted to do so, however, he looked more closely at her face. \u201cI recognize you now!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re Marino, that thief that stopped the rebellion and that sometimes does work for central command! I\u2019ve seen you passing through the hallways near the office!\u201d \u201cAh, right, and you are?\u201d Marino questioned, sounding somewhat curious. \u201cOh, um, I\u2019m Stan, just a government office clerk, nothing special\u2026\u201d he muttered, \u201c\u2026though, if it\u2019s alright for me to say this, I\u2019ve always thought you were very beautiful.\u201d Stan admitted, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right, I think I remember filing a few mission reports with you. Well,\u201d Marino purred in a seductive tone, \u201cif you really think I\u2019m beautiful, then I think you\u2019ll enjoy the assignment I\u2019ve got in store for you\u2026\u201d And with that, the turquoise haired goddess leaned up slightly and began to undo her top. Lifting the cups of her bikini bra, she let her two enormous, lovely breasts out for all to see. Stan\u2019s face was now completely red at this sight. \u201cM-my goddess, surely you don\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d But he was cut off as Marino placed a finger over his mouth. \u201cI sure do, hon. I want you to massage each and every inch of both of these big, beautiful boobies,\u201d she breathed, now stroking one of her nipples while squeezing the whole of her other breast. \u201cUnless you have a problem with that?\u201d N-not at all! I\u2019m just very, very honored that you would ask such a thing of your lowly subject!\u201d Stan exclaimed, sweating with anticipation. \u201cThank you so much, my goddess! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, my cute little slave. And please, I think I can allow you to call me by my name,\u201d Marino said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, thank you very much, Miss Marino!\u201d Stan shouted with enthusiasm, running toward the lovely hills of his goddess. \u2018Miss Marino, huh?\u2019 the gargantuan thief thought. \u2018Yeah, I think I like the sound of that.\u2019 And with that, Marino reveled in the sensation of having the entire front side of her body rubbed by here little servants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunters X, Zero and Axl report to the command room to prep for teleportation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaverick Hunter Zero awoke from his slumber. Climbing out of his stasis tube, he ran to the command room. As he ran, he thought back to the dream he was just having, to the dream he had every time he slept. Actually, it could be said it was two dreams, which he would flip back and forth between. The first, of course, was the one that had been there for as long as he could remember: A strange old man rambling about some cryptic purpose. The second dream, however, wasn't cryptic at all, rather it was all too clear: Iris. Since that fateful day when she died in his arms, Zero had been haunted by that painful memory. He never let anyone see the pain he felt, always keeping a cool demeanor, but he rarely felt truly happy. Zero quickly shook off these lingering thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m a Maverick Hunter. It\u2019s my job to give others peace of mind, even at the expense of my own,\u201d he said to himself as he entered the command room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero arrived at around the same time as his fellow hunters, X and Axl. \u201cMan, I can\u2019t wait for this mission! It\u2019s been forever since the last big Maverick attack!\u201d exclaimed Axl. \u201cA lack of Maverick activity is a good thing, Axl,\u201d X reprimanded. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be peacekeepers, not war seekers.\u201d \u201cI know, I know\u2026\u201d said the younger reploid, waving off his senior officer, \u201cCan we just get our mission briefing so we can leave?\u201d \u201cThat depends, can you stop talking long enough for Signas to give us our orders?\u201d commented Zero, speaking for the first time since entering the room. Axl opened his mouth to provide a retort, but no words came to him, leaving him to settle with giving Zero a look of disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hunters turned to the front of the room, Signas, their acting commander, began to speak. \u201cThe rogue mechaniloids have spread further from the center of the city than we had expected. As such, I\u2019ll send each of you to a separate part of the city to stop these mavericks before the destruction can spread any further. In turn, each of you will be assigned a navigator. Alia, you\u2019ll be working with X.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger\u201d, Alia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPallette, you\u2019re with Axl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, sir,\u201d Pallette responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Layer, you\u2019ll be Zero\u2019s navigator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, the purple-haired reploid began to blush slightly.  Though she tried to hide it, Layer was somewhat infatuated with the red hunter (a fact which Pallette, her coworker and close friend, teased her to no end over). She never did work up the nerve to talk to Zero outside of work, usually giving herself the excuse that it would be inappropriate for them to share anything beyond a professional relationship. Still, part of her still hoped that she might have some chance of getting to know him, platonically if not romantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes sir,\u201d said Layer, trying to regain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all have your orders. This city hasn\u2019t seen much maverick activity in the past few months. Let\u2019s finish this mission quickly so we can keep it that way!\u201d With that being said, Signas sent the coordinates for each navigator to input for the transport of their respective hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zero stepped into the transporter, he heard Layer begin to speak: \u201cUm, Zero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?,\u201d said the red hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2026 Good luck out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuck is meaningless on the field of battle. All that matters is skill, strength, and proper direction. The third is what I\u2019m counting on you for.\u201d Zero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sorry\u201d said Layer, feeling slightly foolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026 thank you,\u201d spoke Zero, the slightest hint of warmth in his voice. With these last words, the transporter activated sending him on his way and sparing Layer the embarrassment of him seeing her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author\u2019s note: Really long first chapter, I know. I\u2019ll get to the shrinking in a chapter or two, so be patient please.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anyway, there don\u2019t appear to be any more signs of maverick activity, so until further notice, you\u2019ll be on stand by. Be sure to file a report on the attack within the next few days. And Axl, this time I expect more details than \u2018that awesome headshot you pulled off.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir\u2026\u201d the young reploid groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Axl walked away grumbling, Zero turned to speak to Layer. \u201cHey, just thought I should thank you for today. I\u2019ll admit, without your analysis, I might not have found that giant tank\u2019s weak spot, or at least not until after it had mowed down a few more city blocks.\u201d<br>\r\nTrying once again to conceal her blush, Layer meekly replied, \u201cOh, um\u2026 not at all, Zero. I\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right. Still, it\u2019s always good to have someone like you to watch my back. Anyway, since I\u2019m on stand by for now, I figure I\u2019ll go hit the training chambers for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zero turned to leave, Layer thought to herself: \u201cI wonder, does Zero ever give himself a day off? I mean, I understand he has his duties as a hunter, but, especially with maverick activity at an all time low, you\u2019d think he might take a day off every now and then. Maybe if I invited him to go somewhere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Zero!\u201d Layer blurted out, surprising both Zero and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d questioned the red hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 n-nevermind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay then, see you around.\u201d And with that, Zero walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d Layer reprimanded herself. \u201cI can\u2019t just go asking him out out of nowhere like that! I probably just blew away whatever respect he might have had for me\u2026\u201d She was so busy beating herself up over her perceived blunder that she couldn\u2019t hear Pallette walk up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you ever going to ask him out?\u201d the blond navigator piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Pallette! Don\u2019t startle me like that! And I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Layer sputtered defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you don\u2019t. Come on, Layer, I\u2019m your best friend. I can read you like an open book. Though right now, I\u2019d say your story could probably use a few revisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Layer enquired warily. She and Pallette had trained together as navigators at the same academy, and she recognized the look in her friend\u2019s eyes all too well. It was a look that said \u201cI\u2019m going to drag you into a plan that\u2019s totally going to take you out of your comfort zone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust that I\u2019ve got a plan that\u2019s guarenteed to bring you and Zero MUCH closer together!\u201d Pallette exclaimed. By this point, one could all but feel her excitement coming off of her in waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPallette, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Layer began to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me! If I start working now, I can probably have it built in a couple of hours!\u201d And with that, the young blonde skipped off to her laboratory, ignoring her friend\u2019s pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I gotten myself into?\u201d Layer groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to set over the city, Zero was leaving the training facility, a bit earlier than he usually would. For some odd reason, he just couldn\u2019t concentrate as well as he usually does during combat, as his mind would randomly drift back to his conversation with Layer. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m slightly curious as to what she wanted to say to me. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t all that important, but still\u2026\u201d His train of thought was cut short as he heard some footsteps running toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZero, Zero!\u201d Pallette exclaimed, \u201cI was just looking for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just finished work on a new chip! It\u2019s built to increase the accuracy of a reploid\u2019s melee attacks. You\u2019ve just got to let me install it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to right now? I was just about to\u2026\u201d But before Zero could finish speaking, Pallette was already dragging him off to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, as Zero was preparing to enter his stasis tube, he thought back to what Pallette told him as she was installing the chip:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, for this chip to integrate itself into your systems, you\u2019ll need a full night of rest. As such, the chip will make sure to keep you in sleep mode for the duration of the programming period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose the sooner I get this chip installed, the better. And who knows, this upgrade might be what I need to get back into combat mentality.\u201d With this last thought, Zero entered the tube, and entered sleep mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes later, the chip began to kick into effect. Zero began to rapidly shrink in size, until he was roughly 2-3 inches tall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Entering a combination of numbers into a nearby keypad, she deactivated the room's alarm system and opened the stasis tube. Carefully picking up the tiny hunter, she then made her way toward the navigator's sleeping quarters. Looking at the shrunken Zero, she thought \"Huh. You know, at this size, he is actually pretty cute. Still, I did this for Layer. I can't wait to see how she reacts to this! And the best part is, the chip had a slight memory altering effect. When Zero wakes up, he won't remember me installing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving returned from a shopping trip, Layer entered the living quarters provided to her by Hunter HQ. Unlike the stasis chambers used by the hunters for the sake of quick response, the navigators' rooms were more similar to reasonably sized apartments, including individual bedrooms and washrooms and shared kitchen and living areas, to suit the reploids' human-like desire for luxuries. Layer herself also looked different from her usual navigator form, sporting a more casual dress (T-shirt and jeans) rather than her usual metallic armor. In recent years, some reploids had grown discontent with walking around in bulky armor during everyday activity. After some heavy research, a team of engineers at Hunter HQ (including Pallette) had managed to reverse engineer the technology used in Dr. Light's armor capsules to build a device that could change and remove armor. Such developments have provided a great deal of comfort for reploids, as well as helped to smooth their integration with human society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back on topic, Layer prepared a light supper for herself, briefly hopped into the shower, changed into a light belly shirt and a pair of purple pajama pants, and laid down in her bed.  As she pulled up her covers, she thought back to her conversation with Zero, and Pallette's teasing about it, she wondered \"Maybe Pallette is right. Why shouldn't I try talking to Zero. We ARE friends... sort of. All right, then! It's settled. Tomorrow, I'll talk to Zero, and ask if he wants to spend some time together!\" Filled with an amount of resolve she didn't know she had, Layer entered sleep mode, already mulling over her plans for the next day. Little did she know, someone else had already decided how her meeting with Zero would take place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPallette quietly entered her friend's bedroom, Zero in tow. She slowly crept up to the sleeping Layer and, in a move that would probably cause Layer to die of embarrassment were she still awake, slipped Zero onto her sleeping friend's chest, nestling him between her breasts. \"Pleasant dreams, you two,\" she whispered, then slowly made her way out. But as she reached the doorway, she turned around to take one last look at her friend. \"Now that is just ADORABLE!\" she thought, as she saw Layer softly place her hand over her sleeping crush, a soft smile lighting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThat night, Zero had been having the same dream as always. In his dream, he had just found Iris in her last minutes of life. But, just as he was pleading with Iris not to die, his dream decided to go a little off script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Zero.\" said the supposed-to-be-dying navigator. Much to Zero's shock, Iris, who just moments ago was mortally wounded, began to stand up, then offered her hand to the red hunter. Rather dumbfounded by this development, Zero said nothing and let Iris help him up. Looking at her, he noticed two oddities: First, Iris showed no signs of the injuries she had received during their battle. Second, she appeared taller than usual. Normally, Zero was about a head taller than Iris. But now, his head only came up to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, how did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't talk right now,\" said Iris. She then brought Zero into a warm embrace, pressing his face into her breasts. Looking up at her as she smiled gently, a strong feeling of warmth overcame the usually cool and isolated hunter. The two stayed like this for hours until Zero awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n\"Of course... It was just a dream...\" Zero thought, responding to his disappointment upon waking up alone. He wasn't really surprised by this, but there was a part of him that always wished that Iris' death really was just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with his inner reflection, Zero turned himself to a more pressing issue: Where the hell was he? He could already tell that he wasn't in his stasis tube. It was too dark to see his surroundings, but by feeling around him he surmised that he was caught between two walls, perhaps some manner of prison. But when he tried to move, it seemed that said walls did little to impede him. He stood up and felt the wall next to him. Oddly, touching this wall seemed to bring back the sensation of warmth from his dream and, for a moment, he was overcome by a somewhat childish impulse that pushed him to hug the large, soft object. He immediately withdrew himself from the hug, though not before he felt the environment around him shudder slightly. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d Zero chastised. \u201cI can\u2019t just randomly act on impulses like that!\u201d Trying to clear his mind of distractions, he made his was through the path between the two \u201cwalls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting what appeared to be a large tent flap, Zero made his way outside. Looking around at his surroundings, he began to try to deduce his current location. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of dark here, but I can still see fairly well. Judging by furniture such as a desk, a bookshelf, and a mini-fridge, I can assume this is someone\u2019s personal quarters, most likely a woman\u2019s, guessing from the light purple walls. Of course, given my assumption is true, this forces me to address an important issue: Why is everything in this room so much larger that it should be? And for that matter, where in this room am I?\u201d Examining the soft ground he stood on, he discovered it to be a type of synthetic skin, the sort used for humanoid reploids like him. Piecing the logic together, unlikely as it seemed, there was one conclusion he could reach: He was standing on the belly of a gigantic humanoid reploid! Factoring in his previous deduction about the room belonging to a woman, Zero turned around to confirm a theory about his prior location: He had just been between a giant pair of breasts, and had briefly hugged one of them. \u201cWell,\u201d murmured Zero, slightly embarrassed, \u201cI guess now I know why I felt that warm sensation\u2026\u201d Trying once again to clear his head, Zero tried to plan his next course of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zero's train of thought was suddenly broken by what sounded like the roar of a great beast, though he quickly realized that it was merely his unknowing hostess yawning as she awoke. The ground beneath his feet began to shift as the giantess slowly sat up, causing the red hunter to lose his footing and slide onto the gigantic lap below him. Looking up, he immediately recognized the face of the drowsy woman above him: \"LAYER?!\" Zero was now even more confused than he was moments before. He had assumed that his reduced stature was the result of some manner of virus that had infected him during yesterday's battle; The Maverick Virus had always affected him differently than normal reploids, after all. However, if the Mavericks had deliberately infected him, then why would they deliver him to one of his allies, rather than capture or outright crush him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasoning out his current circumstances would have to wait, however, as his immediate objective was to contact the towering navigator. \"LAYER!\", the tiny hunter shouted, \"LOOK DOWN!\". Unfortunately, the volume of Zero's voice had decreased along with his size, and Layer didn't so much as turn her head at his call. \"Well, I guess if I can't make myself heard from down here, I'll just have to climb up to her ear.\" This seemed as though it ought to be an easy task; After all, Zero had had to climb several walls and large mavericks during past missions. It hardly seemed like it should be a challenge to scale the torso of a giant woman. However, as the tiny robot prepared to start climbing, there was one thing he forgot to take into account: Layer had just woken up, and she was about to start moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAfter blinking the last bits of sleep out of her eyes, Layer got out of bed and walked toward her dresser to pick out her clothes for the day. She had the day off today, so she was able to wear casual clothes for a change. She picked out a light green T-shirt and a tight pair of jeans, along with a pair of ankle socks and a matching set of a pink bra and panties. She began to walk back toward her bed, when she noticed a slight weight causing her pajama pants to sag slightly. Without so much as a downward glance to see what might have caused this, the navigator gave the pants a slight tug to readjust them, then continued on as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nThe moment Layer stood up, all Hell broke loose for Zero. He barely had time to grab on to the waist of her pants before she began walking about her room. Her casual stride toward her dresser caused the tiny hunter to swing back and forth helplessly in front of her waist, struggling to hold on. It only became more difficult for Zero to keep his grip as Layer bent up and down, navigating her dresser for clothing. Even during this struggle, Zero couldn't help but notice that Layer's pants were starting to sag from his weight, displaying the front of her black panties and causing him to blush once more. Unfortunately, Zero wasn't the only one to notice this, as Layer gave her pants a sharp tug. Zero...</span></div></div>",

Arriving quickly, he noticed that no one else was there, but the light on his usual teleporter was green, indicating that its coordinates had been set. \"I guess they realized that I'm good enough to take on missions by myself!\" he says to himself, hopping inside.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been at least a month ever since the incident with the Dark Elf and the Resistance\u2019s former new leader Epzilo. The base was still recovering and adjusting to having Ciel be their leader again. She recently had developed a power source that could produce infinite amounts of energy to solve the current energy crisis. Through her study of the creatures known as Cyber Elves, Ciel created the \u201cConvergent Ignition by Energy Linkage\u201d system or the C.I.E.L. system for short to solve the crisis. She in hopes wanted to end this war with Neo Arcadia by using this system as a peace treaty. However, it was still missing some key components to be out of its\u2019 Alpha stage and into final production. She needed to find a molecular compound regulator or M.C.R. to work with other special parts to make it complete. As of now the whole Resistance Base was running on her successful alpha prototype. She had been working ever since this morning to keep perfecting it, and needless to say she was tired and looked awful. Alouette had tried to get her to take a break, but Ciel kept denying she needed rest and still worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, she was found unconscious in the analysis lab from a lack of sleep and some hunger. Arlene found her this way and rushed her to the infirmary with Cerveau to give her some medical attention. Cerveau was a little upset with Ciel for not being careful with her health. He just gripped his forehead as started to apply an oxygen tube and I.V. to her. Alouette heard the commotion and came to check on her \"sister\" and saw her in the medical bed conscious, but asleep from her recent overworking. Ciel woke up 3 hours later to see she was in the infirmary and saw Cerveau and Alouette there with her. After wincing from the ceiling lights a bit she looked down at her arm to see an I.V. needle and an oxygen tube going into her nose. She looked to see Cerveau giving her concerned yet stern look, while Alouette was very worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerveau, Alouette...? Ooh... How long was I out...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been out for 5 hours, Ciel. Ugh! The entire base, Myself, and even Zero at times have told you to not do this to yourself!\" Cerveau said sternly after slamming his clipboard on a nearby podium and scared Alouette somewhat. \"Sorry, Alouette. I didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She replied meekly then spoke in raised her voice in an assertive tone with Ciel. \"Sis, Mister Cerveau is right. You can't be hurting yourself like this! You've made every in the entire base be worried.\" She finished with some tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alou, please calm down! I really didn't mean to make everyone so worried sick, Truly!\" Ciel said a little excitedly to try and calm down Alouette, and looked at Cerveau. \"*sigh* Go on and scold me again.\" Ciel looked down and expected Cerveau's scoldings again. She sometimes felt he was like a stepfather to her and Alouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel... I would but... Now isn't the time for it.\" Ciel looked up at him in little surprise. However, it soon turned to a collective frown as Cerveau took another stern look. \"What you need to do is rest, and take some time off of working on your project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerveau...! I-If I don't keep working on-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No means no, Ciel! I understand what you're working on can stop this senseless war, and solve the Energy Crisis. However, you need to remember Enlightened Ones also have their limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerveau...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... Just take at least one day off, Ciel.\" He pleaded her one last time. Ciel looked down and clutched the flat sheet and blanket with her fists. She bit her lips and gave a long deep thought. A tense five minutes passed, until Ciel finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright, I'll take the rest of the day off. B-but when I rest up I'll need to get back to work. The C.I.E.L. system is missing some crucial components, especially and M.R.C.\" Ciel stated lastly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.C.R.? What is that, Sis?\" Alouette asked in curiosity. Ciel was about to answer, but motioned to save it for later. She nodded and looked down at Alouette with a caring smile. \"Maybe later, Alou. Someone else will have to know what it is, too.\" She pat Alouette on the head and just laid back down, until all of them heard a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...? Cerveau is Ciel awake?\" A masculine voice could be heard from the other side of the door. Cerveau went to open and saw it was Zero who was on the other side. Ciel and Alouette looked to see him step in and started to talk with Cerveau in front of the health monitors off to the side, possibly about the last mission reports. Alouette got up on Ciel's bed and snuggled up with her \"sister\". Ciel just cuddled her with a hug and stayed like this for at least fifteen minutes until Cerveau and Zero came over to the bed. Zero had his arms crossed and was giving her a very stern look, while Cerveau motioned him to lighten up some. Ciel sighed and gave a \"good grief\" face with an anime sweatdrop, she knew she was in for a scolding from Zero. She the half-asleep Alouette to wake up, and get off the bed. She did just that and Ciel gave Alouette her plushy Cyber Elf cat. Ciel looked back up at the male reploids until Cerveau broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was discussing the last reports with Zero, and the Mission was successful. The area was cleared and the Maverick was terminated. However, I also informed him about your recent work overload as well.\" Ciel sweatdropped again as Cerveau said that last part. \"Zero will take you back to your room, and he will stay in there for the night to make sure you don't try to go against what you promised, Ciel.\" He put emphasis on the last part. \"Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand... Dad.\" Ciel said the last part sarcastically which made Alouette giggle, Zero give a slight amused gesture, and made Cerveau have an animeish irritated face with a sweatdrop. Zero helped Ciel get up out of bed after her I.V. was removed and escorted her into a wheelchair. She was wheeled out of the Infirmary and down a long corridor that lead to Her's and Alouette's room with said little reploid following close behind them. There was some silence with occasional member asking was Ciel alright with either her or Zero answering yes. They were about halfway to their room when Zero thought back to Ciel's sarcastic remark. He knew she had this side to her slightly, but couldn't help to snicker a little which Ciel and Alouette both heard. He stopped and gave slight sly smile and looked down at Ciel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, 'Dad'?\" He said a little teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that, heh. I just down that sometimes to annoy him for fun.\" Ciel replied a little sheepishly. \"However, until we found you Zero. Cerveau was like a second father to me and Alouette.\" She finished with a hint of sadness in her voice. Upon hearing the last bit Zero grew a little curious about what she said. \"What exactly happened to your real parents?\" Ciel grew a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... All I know is they died when I just born that's it.\" Zero looked back and bit his \"lip\" thinking probably hit a sensitive area. While, he isn't as ignorant to how others around feel when he first woke up. He can still be a little insensitive with other's emotions when not thinking about it. He looked back at Ciel to try and apologize, but she motioned him it was okay. She didn't mind telling something about her past or history, since he was still slightly ignorant to other things in the world. They finally came to a stop when they reached their destination. Ciel inputted a special code, and opened the door to hers\u2019 and Alouette's room. When Zero wheeled her into the room she tried to get up, but almost fell over before Zero grabbed her. As he held her Ciel couldn't help, but to blush. It wasn't much a secret, but she was infatuated with the crimson hero. However, like always he's oblivious to her feelings for him and added to the fact Ciel puts her work and others' happiness before her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Ciel said looking away in embarrassment. In truth, she also felt a little uncomfortable with people seeing her without her ankle boots on. She was about 5 ft. 1 in. without them on. About 3 inches shorter than Zero. He just nodded not paying attention to her discomfort, and helped her to her bed. Ciel realized she left her lightsource on a high up shelf. She used some nearby furniture for some support and attempted to reach the flashlight. However, she couldn't even reach it when standing on her toes. Zero sighed and walked over to her then proceeded to lift her by the midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just asked for some help.\" Zero stated a little too bluntly. Ciel once again failed to hide her discomfort, and this time Zero caught on to it. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can put me down now. I have it.\" Zero still gave her a suspicious look until she fessed up. \"Okay, Okay! I have some issues with my height. Especially when I don't have my heels on! Now can please put me down?\" Zero nodded and put her down, then Ciel made her back to her bed to get some rest. She gave momentary thought and looked at Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind going another mission tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't. I always do that to help out the Resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you already know. I've been working on a very important and special project to end this war and the Energy Crisis, that being the C.I.E.L. System...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmhmm...\" Zero said with some slight disinterest since he thought she going to try to convince to let her work on it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you mind going to the site of an abandoned lab, the Scouting Unit found, to retrieve the parts and the M.C.R?\" Zero made slight surprised face letting Ciel know he thought she wanted to work again. He leaned on a nearby wall and thought for a moment. \"If you don't want to, I can send the Scouting Unit to go retrieve it.\" Zero closed his eyes and still thinking. Alouette pretended to be asleep and listened to what going on. Ciel just looked at Zero and waited until he looked at her with simple expression and walked towards her.</span></div></div>",

How many times do you plan to get in my way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man and Tron were in a heated battle, outside of some old ruins. Mind you, neither of them had planned this confrontation. Mega Man and Roll had traveled to this island following a new lead on the location of the \"Mother Lode\". He had been directed to these ruins by the people of a nearby town, who had heard stories of an ancient treasure beneath the ruins but had never been able to go deep enough to confirm them. After excavating the ruins, he hadn't found any signs of the legendary Mother Lode, but the blue treasure hunter did manage to find a rather large quantum refractor. Unfortunately, the Bonne Family had also followed a lead to the island and, after hearing about a \"blue boy\" heading to the ruins, Tron quickly prepared herself to confront Mega Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hand over the refractor and I'll let you go! Or am I going to have to make you cooperate?\" boasted the pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, like all the other times you've 'made me cooperate'?\" Mega Man retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut up! That was then and this is now! Anyway, even if you've beaten my past inventions, you don't stand a chance against my Gustaff Mk. III!\" And with that, their fight continued. The Gustaff fired off round after round of bombs, missiles, and laser blasts, but Mega Man dodged each shot with expert precision, all while getting in several shots of his own. Within a few minutes, the giant mech was letting out billows of smoke, looking like it was ready to fall apart. But just as Mega Man prepared to deliver a finishing shot, Tron popped out of the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, I give up!\" she cried, waving her arms frantically. \"I'll leave the island, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man felt somewhat unsure at this point. On the one hand, he knew it wasn't the smartest idea to trust the word of a pirate, especially after the number of times he had come into conflict with this group. On the other hand, he didn't really dislike Tron at all. They were usually enemies, yes, but there had been times they had worked together, and he sensed that she really wasn't that bad a person deep down. \"Well... alright, but come out with your hands up. I don't want you pulling any tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tricks? Me? Oh, never! I can't believe you'd even suggest such a thing!\" said Tron, her voice dripping with false sincerity. Even so, she did oblige the blue boy, climbing out of the robot. \"You won and I lost. I can accept that. In fact, I really do feel bad about giving you so much trouble. Maybe I could... invite you over for dinner?\" Tron suggested coyly, displaying the slightest hint of a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. What's to stop you from taking me prisoner after climbing aboard your airship?\" Mega Man said warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Your loss. My Servbots cook some of the best pot roast you'll ever find. Still, I really don't want to leave on bad terms. Handshake?\" she offered, for once giving what seemed to be a truly genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I guess it couldn't hurt...\" muttered Mega Man, thinking Tron actually looked somewhat... pleasant, when she wasn't angry. He accepted the lady pirate's extended hand, and immediately regretted doing so. He felt a harsh surge of electricity run through his body, and blanked out momentarily. As he began to regain his senses, he began to realize that something was off. Everything around him looked slightly... larger. Mega Man hoped that this was merely his eyesight being distorted by the electricity, but the more he tried to pull himself together, the larger everything continued to seem. Of course, his \"biggest\" concern was the titanic Tron, now looming over him grinning triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho ho ho! I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that trick! By the way, in case you were wondering, your new perspective is courtesy of my latest brilliant invention: the Bonne Shockshrinker! I originally designed it to shrink things like cargo and treasure to make them easier to transport, but now I think I've found a new favorite use for it!\" the pirate gloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you going to do with me?\" stammered Mega Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though I already told you: you're coming home with me, like it or not! And don't worry: Bon and Teisel are out on another mission right now, so we'll have the ship all to ourselves!\" And with that, Tron reached up and plucked the little robot off the ground. Mega Man tried to fight back, but was still very drained from the shock he had recieved. \"Don't worry, little boy. We're gonna have a lot of fun together.\" said Tron, with a mischievous grin plastered to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Tron plan to transport her captive?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mega Man's eyes become wide at this statement. \"Wait, Wha-?!\" Is all he is able to say before he begins to fall through the air. A few seconds later, he lands on something soft-ish with a thud and a small bounce. Mega Man attempts to get up to his feet, but the shrinking process that he just went through has left him nearly immobile; only able to twitch slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic Tron lets out what would sound like an innocent giggle to anyone normal sized; but to Mega Man it was one of the most terrifying things he has heard in a long time. \"Oh, just look at you. You must be really fighting to get away if you're able to move THAT much.\" The colossal captor taunts in a sarcastic tone before she bursts out into a small laughing fir. \"I'm just kidding, the Bonne Shockshrinker has a weird effect on robots, it causes complete paralysis for a few hours. Weird, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man's expression grew grim at that remark. Not only was he shrunken to the size of a mere toy, at the mercy of Tron Bonne, but he was also completely motionless for the next few hours. Things just got from bad to worse. Though Mega Man didn't have much time to reflect on this, as his whole world suddenly grew dark. He manages to turn his head to see Tron's titanic rear end headed directly at him. So this is what she meant by \"sharing a seat\". Mega Man begins to let out a scream, but it is quickly turned into a barley audible muffled sound as Tron sits down in the Gustaff, and by extension on top of Mega Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTron takes a moment to grind her rear into the seat, and her captive, in order to make the trip as comfortable as possible (for her). \"I hope you're comfy, it's gonna be a LONG ride back to the Airship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only respond Tron gets is the same barley audible muffled scream from underneath her bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a 'yes Miss Tron, I am very comfy! I want to stay this way forever'!\" Tron says with a poor imitation of Mega Man's voice, laughing as she closes the cockpit and the machine begins to move.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, smashed between the larger then life posterior and the Gustaff's pilot seat; Mega Man is losing his mind. Where as he was capable of moving in very small increments before, he is now completely immobile. The seat easily conformed under Tron's weight, essentially creating a perfect Mega Man shaped indent that has him completely trapped. On top of that, the pressure is unimaginable. Tron herself isn't a very weighty girl; in fact she is the exact opposite. But to someone of Mega Man's current size, she may as well be a mountain in terms of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tron pilots the Gustaff back to her Airship, she can't help but look down to her rear end every now and then. Every time she does, her smile grows wider and wider. She finally won. Not only had she bested the only one to ever beat her machines, but HE was her trophy. \"No, not a trophy...\" Tron thinks out loud in an almost whisper. \"More like...a pet, or a toy.\" She laughs to herself, adjusting her rear end once more in order to feel her captive rubbed against her bottom. At first she was just planning on shrinking him, playing with him for a bit, then returning him back to normal. But now she wasn't so sure. It's one thing to plan out something, but once it's in motion it can be very easy to stray from the original plan. As she felt Mega Man's miniature form trapped beneath her, she knew she would never let him go. He was hers, and hers alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man lets out another scream as Tron begins to grind him against the seat again. Much to his pleasure, he finally hit his limit and passed out. He embraced the temporary release from his torment with open arms; as it might be his last moments of peace he'll ever get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass by, and the Miniature Mega Man slowly begins to wake up. He finds himself... </span></div></div>",

So...\" Tron's voice trailed off, as she brought Mega Man close to her mouth, tilting her head back and opening her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the normally composed robot boy was scared out of his mind. \"Wait,Tron! You aren't really going to eat me, are you? I know we haven't been on the best of terms, but this is going too far! Please, I'll do whatever you say, just don't...\" But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as the giant pirate released him from between her fingers and dropped him onto her enormous tongue. As Tron closed her lips, Mega Man thought to himself, 'So, this is it. After all my battles with reaverbots, airships, and ancient superweapons, this is my final fate: to be a snack for a teenage girl. Through all my battles with Tron, I can't say I ever really thought she would actually kill me. Actually, if we weren't always fighting, maybe we could have been friends...' Suddenly, the ground beneath Mega Man\u2019s feet began to shift, as Tron had started to move her tongue about her mouth. The boy quickly became quite disoriented as the enormous muscle began to push him around his damp, humid prison. He was pressed against the roof of the mouth, then rubbed against the inside of the girl\u2019s cheeks. The tongue then began to feel itself around Volnutt\u2019s body, apparently trying to taste him. Tron then took things a step further by sucking on him like a piece of hard candy. All the while, Mega Man could hear Tron moaning softly, though at his current size and position, said moaning sounded more like an echoing roar. He had to admit, terrifying as this whole experience was, there was something rather erotic about the situation he was in. Then, to his horror, he was quickly deposited atop Tron\u2019s bottom row of teeth. As the menacing molars closed down upon the hero, he felt that all hope was lost. But, instead of the life-ending crush that he had been expecting, the teeth exerted a much softer force. It was less like a bite and more like\u2026 playful nibbling. He could hear Tron giggle as her tongue brushed teasingly against him. Finally, his prison tightened up briefly, before ejecting him into the palm of Tron\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to let his eyes readjust to the light of day, the still somewhat bewildered hero turned his attention to the still comparatively gigantic pirate girl. \u201cWell,\u201d said Tron, sporting an enormous grin, \u201chow did you enjoy our little \u2018mouth play\u2019 session?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-mouth play? I thought I was going to die! You can\u2019t just throw people into your mouth like that! Really, you shouldn\u2019t go around shrinking people to begin with!\u201d The tiny digger rambled on about what was wrong with what Tron did, still rather flustered by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, did the little pirate girl scare the big strong hero?\u201d she taunted. \u201cStill, I guess I got a bit carried away there. Next time I thrust you into a situation like that, I\u2019ll try to warn you. You WERE tasty though. You\u2019ll probably be even more so after I get you out of that armor\u2026\u2019 At this statement, Mega Man ceased his ranting and began to blush slightly. \u201cAnyway, speaking of thrusting you into situations, I suppose I should show you your new travel arrangements\u2026\u201d said Tron, regaining her teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you ta-\u201c Volnutt started, before looking down and noticing a change in the girl\u2019s appearance. While he was inside her mouth, Tron had removed her shirt, leaving her top covered only by her small jacket and a pink bra, which contained her still-developing but still respectable c-cup breasts. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean- I mean you wouldn\u2019t- I\u2019m not that kind of-\u201c sputtered the now VERY embarrassed boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh\u2026\u201d cooed Tron, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to say anything. I KNOW you\u2019ll love this.\u201d And without any further fanfare, the girl pirate grabbed Mega Man between her fingers and plopped him into her soft cleavage. She then squeezed her breasts together, though not so hard as to cause any harm to her captive. \u201cComfy enough for ya?\u201d she asked, a light blush now gracing her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolnutt tried to respond, but by this point was embarrassed beyond the point of words. All he could do was blush and nod his head. \u201cI thought as much!\u201d Tron chirped. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019ll be about an hour before we get back to the Gesellschaft, so feel free to take a nap until we get there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a nap proved to be no problem, as the warm, soft \u201cpillows\u201d Mega Man had been provided with allowed him to quickly drift into sleep. As be began to nod off, he thought to himself: \u2018Why is she being so nice all of the sudden?\u2019<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roughly two hours later, Mega Man finally began to stir. Waking up, he could already tell he wasn\u2019t in Tron\u2019s cleavage anymore, though he was still lying on a soft surface. Specifically, he appeared to be at the end of a rather large bed, most likely Tron\u2019s judging by the bed\u2019s pink sheets and the girlish decorum of the surrounding room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolnutt then realized that he could feel the softness of said bed just a bit too well. Usually, while his armor did possess some amount of sensory interface, his sense of touch was somewhat dulled. Checking himself over, he confirmed what he had feared: his armor had been removed and replaced with regular clothing, albeit clothes tailored for someone the size of a small doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who finally decided to wake up,\" boomed a voice behind him. Turning around, Mega Man found a now fully clothed Tron, laying on her side with her head half resting on her palm, who had apparently been on the bed with him the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTron! What did you do with my armor?!\u201d Mega Man exclaimed, still trying to sound less intimidated than he actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tron, a smug grin crossing her face, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have you giving me trouble once your weapon systems were back online, so I had to remove it. Thanks for being such a sound sleeper, by the way. It certainly made the process a lot easier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do with it?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, relax. I kept the parts in a small box on my desk over there. Don\u2019t go getting any ideas about trying to put it back on, either: I made sure to disassemble it to the point where only I can put it back together when I decide to let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when will you do that?\u201d Mega Man enquired nervously, already fearing Tron\u2019s answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I dunno,\u201d Tron replied nonchalantly. \u201cA week, a month, a year\u2026 I suppose it\u2019s more of an \u2018if\u2019 than a \u2018when\u2019, really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d the boy stammered, bewildered by his captor\u2019s complete disregard for his rights as a person. Tron giggled at how easy Volnutt was to tease at this new size. It was certainly a welcome change of pace from her being the one who couldn\u2019t talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, I\u2019ll probably let you go\u2026 eventually,\u201d said the pirate, mumbling the last part of this statement to herself. \u201cBut hey, let\u2019s talk about something else now! Like what we should do together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 what do you mean by that?\u201d Mega Man enquired, having regained some of his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tron, as she reached out and picked up her tiny captive, \u201cas I said earlier, I\u2019d like to have dinner with you, so the Servbots are cooking for us right now. But while they\u2019re doing that, I was thinking we could, y\u2019now\u2026 do something fun together, maybe get to know each other in the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d asked Mega Man, as he began to imagine what sort of \u201cfun Tron might have in mind. Some possibilities were rather frightening, but others seemed rather\u2026 enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a lot of ideas as to what we could do for now, but I suppose they all fall into one of two categories. And since I\u2019m feeling <i>incredibly</i> generous today, I\u2019ll even let you select which category. After that, I can list off various things we can do, and you just stop me when you hear something you like. Don\u2019t test my patience though: we are going to do something together, and if I think you\u2019re just stalling for time, I might just be forced to choose for you. And I assure you,\u201d she stated, her voice taking a somewhat harsh tone, \u201cyou <i>don\u2019t</i> want me to choose for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-and what are my choices?\u201d replied Mega Man, trying to hide both his fear and his anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first option is\u2026 doing a bit of work for me. Something along the lines of painting my nails, giving me a full-body massage, cleaning my ears, basic servant work\u201d the giant girl stated in a condescending manner, moving the boy around her body in accordance with each task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not your servant!\u201d shouted Mega Man, briefly forgetting his current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, did I touch a nerve?\u201d Tron giggled in mock sympathy as she turned over and sat Mega Man on her belly. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to think of it as servant work, we could just call it doing a friend a favor. We <i>are</i> friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she finished, giving a pouting expression for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d the pirate continued, visibly pleased with her crush\u2019s continued befuddlement, \u201cYour other option is playing a game, one suited for our size difference. We could play cat and mouse, mountain climber, or something else along those lines.\u201d Tron had to admit to herself, all these games did seem rather childish, but growing up as a pirate meant she never really had much of a childhood or much interaction with people her own age, so part of her saw this as an opportunity to make up for lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, all your suggestions sound like they\u2019re more fun for you than they are for me\u2026\u201d muttered Mega Man, perhaps hoping for something different\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point\u2026 Tell you what!\u201d Tron piped up, \u201cHow about for every task you complete or every game you win, I\u2019ll do something nice for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Nice\u2019 like let me go?\u201d the small digger pleaded, already knowing what her response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, short stuff.\u201d Tron replied, giving the boy a light poke for emphasis. \u201cRather, you remember your earlier \u2018transport?\u2019\u201d Mega Man\u2019s luminescent blush was all the response she needed. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just say that there\u2019s more where that came from\u201d she finished, flashing a somewhat suggestive grin at the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man though to himself \u2018Well, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that she puts her satisfaction ahead of mine. Even so, she\u2019s still being nicer than I might have though before. Either way, as long as I\u2019m stuck here, I might as well make the best of it.\u2019 \u201cAlright Tron, I accept your terms\u201d said Mega Man, some amount of his usual confidence finally returning to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright then!\u201d Tron replied, pleased with, if somewhat surprised by, the boy\u2019s newfound compliance. \u201cSo, are you ready  to do some work, or would you like to play a game?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll give you a full body massage.\" As Mega Man said this, he felt Tron pick him up as she slowly got up and placed him off to her right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! But first, let me get changed so you can get to work.\" As Tron said this, she lifted up her right foot and crossed it over her left leg. Then she slowly took off her shoe and placed it on the floor next to her bed. Then she proceeded to take off the black sock and placed it inside her shoe. Now with her right foot uncovered, she put her right foot down on the floor as she lifted her left foot over her right leg. As she did this, her left foot was placed right over Mega Man. Covering him, and preventing Tron from seeing him under her foot. He could only watch as she took off her shoe as she placed it on the floor. Now reviling her black sock right above Mega Man's face, he watched as she slowly placed a finger inside her sock as she even more slowly pulled this sock off. As if she were toying with him. Mega Man watched as her heel came into view, as well as her sole, and finally her toes. Tron held the sock in her hands for a moment before she leaned over to place it in her other shoe. But as she did this, her foot shifted. Causing it to bump into Mega Man and press him into the bed. This knocked the air out of his lungs and forced him to smell her foot. It smelled of some sweat, but not a whole lot. And that was about it. Her feet were pretty clean other than that. In fact, smelling Tron's foot reminded Mega Man of when he would give Roll a massage. Often times when he got to her feet, they were very ticklish, and she would often kick him in the face. Forcing him to smell her feet until she could regain her composure. At first when she did this he thought it was disgusting. But over time, he came to enjoy doing things with her feet. Whether it was massaging them, smelling them when she was asleep, or hiding under her desk just to watch her toes wiggle around. As he thought away, he almost forgot what was going on outside of la-la land. He looked up just in time to see her foot lifting up...</span></div></div>",

Roll looked up to see a gigantic Mayl looking down at her with a pleased expresion on her face.

So this might be the last time we get to see each other for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really happy you've taken singing back up, but I wish there was a way we could hang out and have you still follow your dream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first tour Sonia would play in months, and she had Geo to thank for re-inspiring her to continue following what she always wanted to do after her temporary retirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence, neither person being sure what to say- there wasn't anything positive to add. They wouldn't see each other for weeks and there was nothing either person could do about it. Neither person wanted to break the silence with a comment that sounded as nasty as they felt about the situation, fearing to make the other person guilty in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" The silence was finally broken by Harp, surprising both Sonia and Geo. \"There might be a way.\" Materializing outside of Sonia's hunter, Harp had a short, hushed conversation with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia turned back to Geo, a new look of excitement and mischief on her face. \"I think I have an idea.\" With no explanation, she wave changed into Harp Note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" Geo was absolutely clueless. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarp Note teasingly put a finger to Geo's lips. \"Just trust me.\" Backing away a few feet, a look of concentration crossed her face. Playing a short melody on her guitar, Geo fell to his knees, an intense feeling of nausea followed by the sensation of falling from a high place completely overpowering him, and forcing his eyes closed in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the feeling passed as fast as it came. Reopening his eyes, the original dull and familiar landscape of Echo Ridge was replaced with a seemingly completely foreign terrain. The sound of Sonia's girlish giggling from far above him helped him piece together what happened- Harp Note's song caused him to shrink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down, Sonia (having returned to being human) plucked the tiny Geo off the ground with two fingers, bringing him up to her beaming face. \"Looks like I won't have a problem bringing you along with me anymore.\" She giggled and paused for a second, before adding with a flirty tone, \"you're super cute like this, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious...\" Geo couldn't help instinctively struggling in her grip a bit, though due to his minuscule scale, this more amused Sonia than weakened her hold on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I think this is gonna be the funnest tour I've ever done. Not only do I get to play a whole bunch of shows, but I've got a cute little boy toy to keep me company at the hotels, on the tour bus... It always did get a bit lonely.\" She smiled broadly, gently playing with her miniature crush's body with the hand opposite the one holding him, lightly squeezing his dangling legs and poking his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of pure excitement and indulgence to the situation covering her face weakened Geo's defenses; he loved seeing her happy. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd come around!\" Giving him a small peck on the top of his head, Sonia slid the tiny boy under her shirt and hoodie, settling him between her modest breasts. \"The tour bus is coming around to pick me up and take me to Netopia later tonight, and the first show is there tomorrow. We'll call your mom and school from the road. Wouldn't want anyone trying to come pick you up...\" Sonia stuck her tongue out playfully before settling her top back down and heading out towards the pick up location, not waiting for Geo's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt already being fairly late, the tiny boy eventually managed to get comfy against her soft skin and underneath the warmth of her clothing, falling into a peaceful sleep. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Having noticed a dearth of Mega Man giantess fiction, I've created this interactive to call upon those like myself to contribute to what I hope will become one of this site's better video game giantess interactives. I will write some chapters for this work, but I truly hope it will attract the attention of authors more skilled than myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow obviously, I have my own preferences as to how the interactions between giantesses and small people go, but I acknowledge that other people have their own interests, so I will allow some fetishes outside my own to appear within this interactive, provided they meet with my established rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Mega Man series to be in this interactive:</u><br>\r\nClassic<br>\r\nX<br>\r\nZero<br>\r\nLegends<br>\r\nBattle Network<br>\r\nZX<br>\r\nStar Force<br>\r\nMultiverse<br>\r\nAnd any other game that might be released in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I prefer:</u><br>\r\nFemale/male<br>\r\nGentle/Playful<br>\r\nViolent (From evil characters)<br>\r\nButt<br>\r\nBreast<br>\r\nMouthplay<br>\r\nVore<br>\r\nCrush<br>\r\nInsertion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I will allow:</u><br>\r\nFemale/female<br>\r\nViolent (From good characters, try to justify)<br>\r\nFoot<br>\r\nScat<br>\r\nToilet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>I will <b>not</b> allow</u><br>\r\nGiant Male<br>\r\nMale/male<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings to bear in mind when adding to this interactive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Use proper spelling and grammar: I won't complain too much about the occasional typo, but I will not hesitate to delete chapters that don't meet a certain quality standard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to avoid too many overly short chapters. Other than the early option chapters, try to have at least two paragraphs of story in a chapter, if not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to leave options open. Like I said, I'm cool with people straying somewhat from my own preferences, but I don't want to see every chapter become about foot torture or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Inversely, don't try to derail someone else's storyline to your own tastes. As long as someone writes within the provided guidelines and doesn't block off all possible points of continuation, I will stay my hand and try to ensure that this story remains a pleasant experience for all involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn conclusion, I openly encourage all who love giantess stories and Mega Man to add to this story, and hope this interactive will be a success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Edited July 6, 2011*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will now be awarding gift points for what I deem to be quality additions. I don't have that many, so awards will typically be between 100 and 300 GPs, based on how I rate your chapter.</td>",
