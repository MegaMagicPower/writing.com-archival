The nightmarish pounding of Godzilla-like footsteps timed almost rhythmically was accompanied by seismic shaking that caused the chandeliers of her posh digs to sway gently.  As Trish gazed below, the ugly blood curdling screams of helpless people filled the air like a thunder cloud intruding on a sunny day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha\u2019s big blue eyes bulged in disbelief as she watched this creature chase a luxury SUV down Star Blvd and whimsically lift it from the ground as its wheels spun uselessly a seeming ten stories up in its grip.  The poor people in the SUV were the lucky ones; left in the path of this sci-fi movie-come-to-life were five or six cars and trucks crushed into the roadway, flattened and in some cases pressed into the indented pavement.  People on foot were not spared as the monster dropped the SUV onto a fleeing mob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCity folk at street-level were enveloped in a sensory vacuum.  The thunderous approach of the monster caused people\u2019s ears to pressurize; others too close to the creature\u2019s feet went temporarily deaf.  Giant sweaty feet left gigantic moisturized footprints in the street, a toe print mockingly pressed onto a half crushed car and as people gathered to help the injured passengers of the toyed-with SUV, several Good Samaritans were in awe at the tennis racket sized fingerprints emblazoned upon it like a bad paint job.  Beads of sweat the size of golf balls were paved onto the city streets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo enormous strands of the monster\u2019s hair strewn recklessly in the nearby intersection met two cars with disastrous results as the strands ensnared the vehicle\u2019s axles, sending the cars spinning violently into opposing traffic as the monster watched.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOD, BEING A GIANT IS SO DAMN AWESOME, Eileen remarked as she rolled her big brown eyes in ecstasy, wrecked cars at her painted toes. BY THE WAY, JUST HOW SEXY DOES THIS CALVIN KLEIN EUPORIA PERFUME SMELL ON ME?, Eileen asked mockingly down to several injured people lying in the street.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA YEAR EARLIER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRing! Ring!  \u201cHello?\u201d, Eileen answered like a perky school girl.  \u201cHey, \u2018Leen\u201d, Trish greeted the actress with girlish glee.  \u201cHey, glad to hear from you. Uh, havin\u2019 the best time here at the spa; Just gotta mud bath, pedicure and now I\u2019m at the pool wearing this cute bikini I got at Fredericks of Hollywood\u2026at $2,000 it better be cute.  What\u2019s up?,\u201d Eileen inquired excitedly.  \u201cJust got a call from the studio and they have a part for you.  I know you just wrapped on a film with some A-Listers and I\u2019m working on getting you a supporting role with some of the same people, but\u2026.\u201d  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Eileen asked as she prepared herself for disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not exactly the romantic comedy you just shot, but it sounds very high profile.  Well, it\u2019s the lead role in the newest remake of the movie, get this, Attack of the 50\u2019 Woman,\u201d Trish finished with a cringe on her face. An awkward pause ensued.  \u201cHello?\u201d Trish asked over a quiet cell phone.  Then laughter.  \u201cOK, let\u2019s get this straight, you got me, Ms. girly girl, Ms. Got-to-the-spa weekly\u2026and I might add Emmy-Award winning actress playing a giant woman? Are you crazy?\u201d  Trish smiled.  \u201cI felt the same way, but hear me out.  The screenplay and storyline have been completely revamped and overhauled and it will be nothing like the first two. It\u2019s actually an interesting story and your character gets to do some amazing things as the 50\u2019 Woman. Most importantly, you and only you are the star.  This is A-List material\u201d Trish said with re-assurance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen let her guard down.  \u201cAlright, so who\u2019s directing?\u201d she asked.  Trish was awash in excitement and anticipation. \u201cGet this, the directing and special effects will be overseen by the directors of the Matrix movies.  Isn\u2019t that awesome!\u201d Trish exclaimed. Eileen\u2019s skepticism seemed to melt in the sun.  \u201cThat does sound pretty awesome.  When can you send me the script?\u201d Eileen replied as she took a sip of her fruity cocktail and adjusted her designer sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The daughter of Bollywood actress Prisha Pellashanda, Ms. Peoples is finding fame and recognition here in America independent of her mother\u2019s weighty success back in India.  She has an Emmy to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople Magazine sat down with the 22-year old starlet a few hours before this year\u2019s SAG Awards to get know this ravaging beauty that people closest to her refer to her as Eily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING IN AMERICA?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother took me to Hollywood when I was 15 to try me out for a small part in a soap opera.  She was in the middle of promoting a new film at the time, so the timing was, ya know, pretty good.  She lived in America for a few years before I was born, so she had some connections.  I didn\u2019t get the part, but Elite Models got me some work in some catalogs and things.  A one-week trip to the states and we were hooked. I\u2019ve barely been back to India in the seven years we\u2019ve been here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW YOUR FATHER?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been a couple of years.  Not since he retired from baseball. It\u2019s kinda sad, but I\u2019ve moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWITH STARS LIKE HALLE BERRY, DO YOU THINK FILMMAKERS ARE MORE OPEN TO WOMEN OF VARYING NATIONAL ORIGINS AND RACE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah [Laughs].  Just look at me.  I\u2019m the poster child; I mean I\u2019m half Indian, half African American.  I\u2019ve been very fortunate that Hollywood has been very open to my taking on roles that many white actresses would die for.  My calendar is booked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, THIS BRINGS UP THE NEXT QUESTION. YOU\u2019RE WORKING ON THE REMAKE OF ATTACK OF THE 50\u2019 WOMAN.  WHAT\u2019S THAT LIKE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s gonna be awesome.  I watched the two originals [cringes] and they were pretty bad.   I can honestly say this is up there with Godzilla or King Kong.  Script is great and so are the special effects.  Me and the crew are having a blast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT DOES THE SCRIPT CALL FOR YOUR CHARACTER TO DO?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmmm, can\u2019t quite tell.  Let\u2019s just say that if I were living in Metro City, be afraid, very afraid.  There are some rather romantic scenes, um, and, no, no real people were actually eaten during the making of the movie, though [laughs].<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANY TRUTH TO THE RUMORS YOU\u2019RE DATING\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot going there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Giant toes have trapped people in their grip and five-foot long fingernails have scraped lamp posts from their roots. There\u2019s no escape from this colossal woman straddling the Metro City Overpass &amp; Bridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually this scary-real photo of Patricia Piper (Eileen Peoples) in the new movie Attack of the 50\u2019 Woman will be plastered on billboards and posters everywhere starting next week as the vast ad campaign for the Peoples-featured film kicks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe spared no expense in making this photo and the movie as real as possible.  You\u2019d think an actual giant woman has just been spotted on the highway,\u201d said Heather Hughes of Magic Arts Film Studios.  \u201cWe actually closed down the Metro City Bridge, brought in some 50 cars and trucks and hired 100 extras to act like Eileen\u2019s character, Patricia Piper were really toying with them high above, having grown to 50\u2019,\u2026.or more (laughing).  Then, back at the photo studio, we super-imposed a very sexy Peoples onto the scene, resulting in a freaky cool giant woman. It was inportant to convey the chaos and fear she inspires in this role\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen noted lightheartedly that \u201c..the art director had me try on all kinds of duds, but we settled on this cargo miniskirt and tight off-the-shoulder top for the bridge shoot.  Even my hair manages to destroy a few cars, since as you can [see] from the poster, I'm primping and dragging my extra-long hair on the bridge. My stylist was the tops since Patricia had to look her best as she scared the crap out of people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlfriend Magazine spent the day with Eileen Peoples as she wrapped filming in her biggest role ever.  The highlight of the day was the promotional poster shoot.  When asked what she enjoyed most about this role, Ms. Peoples said \u201cThe director and crew are so skilled they had me convinced I was really a giant woman, ya know it really helped me bring Patricia Piper to life.\u201d And as far as that wardrobe? \u201cYeah, designer Marcy Felstrom really hooked me up. I mean, my character\u2019s wearing some hot mini skirts and sexy tops.  Even designed them extra, extra, extra large!\u201d Eileen giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttack of the 50\u2019 Woman opens in June. The film reportedly cost $200 million to produce.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ecstasy was brazenly dished out on silver platters. The movie industries hottest young stars, including Stacy Stellis, Paige Anwar and recent Vogue cover girl Renee Yrilkosminov could be seen dining, skinny dipping and fucking on the palatial grounds of the estate.  An orgy this was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA well earned rest was long overdue for the white-hot Eileen Peoples, gracing the current issue of People.  \u201cAttack of the 50\u2019 Woman was due to open June 22, with largely excellent reviews and a blowout party was just the thing Eileen was hankering for .\u201cHey, pass some of that cocktail,\u201d a naked Eileen requested from the glimmering pool.  \u201cSure thing, Eily\u201d Hillary Duff said as she knelt down to hand off the glass to Eileen as she lounged on a pool raft.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe how kickass this party is,\u201d Eileen slurred, popping some X in her mouth.  Just a few feet away, Paige Anwar was doing it doggie style with her producer boyfriend on a lounge chair.  Actor Bruce Dawdson and actress Bridgette Bethany were lip-locking in between lines of coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEily, what\u2019s the premiere supposed to be like for this move?\u201d a naked Stacy asked as she rested her chin on Eily\u2019s raft; joint in hand, water up to her nipples.  \u201cIt should be pretty cool.  They\u2019ve brought in a 50-foot replica of me and they\u2019ll be putting it in the middle of Cinema Avenue, directly in front of the huge Loews.   Limos\u2019ll drive right under me.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Eily\u2019s publicist strutted out poolside with a wide smile.  \u201cHey, Trish, what\u2019s up?  It\u2019s time to stop doing work and come party with us,\u201d Eily offered.  \u201cI\u2019ve got something better. Much better,\u201d Trish rang out spastically as she held a crisp white piece of paper in her hand.  Trish scanned the document, reading its contents aloud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Ms. Peoples,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations on the completion of your new movie, Attack of the 50\u2019 Woman.  I am sure that this film will be one of many great successes that will grace your career over the years to come and I and my colleagues at HomTech, Inc. will be rooting for you all the way. It is my understanding that the premiere of your film will be taking place on June 22, 2007 and that you and your representatives are hard at work to make it a very special occasion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to assist you in making your premiere worthy of your talent and hard work.  <br>\r\nWhile not yet public information, HomTech is diligently putting the final elements together on a drug that will aid people inflicted with growth-related disorders; simply put, one or two controlled doses will allow people to grow to normal height within a few days who ordinarily might have been stunted due to disease.  The drug is an incredible development for millions.  Moreover, the FDA has put approval on the fast-track.  For your premiere, our team can create a safe dosage capable of producing growth to the height of at least 50\u2019 as well as an antidote that you can take to counter the effects after the event.  I and my team assure you any drugs you take are safe and very effective. We can be on-site to supervise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have sent a copy of this letter to your agent as well as your production company.  Mr. Jones of P Productions, Inc. has already given his approval via fax.  HomTech is eagerly awaiting your reply.  I am hoping we can work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you have any questions, feel free to call me at the number at the bottom of this letter.  Again, congratulations and best wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Jennifer Uytson<br>\r\nHomTech, Inc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d Trish cried out with glee. \u201cCome on, do it. It\u2019ll be fuckin\u2019 awesome. How goddamn cool would that be,\u201d Stacy, Hillary, Bruce and a cast of others cheered on.  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can get one of the top designers to fit you,\u201d Trish assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm. Wow! Let me see,\u201d Eily pondered as she took a sip of her cocktail.  Male model Dwayne Detton massaged her shoulders as he waded in the pool behind her.  \u201cGive me two minutes to think it over,\u201d Eily purred as she turned her head to kiss the hunk behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know she slept with about ten people to get on the cover of that magazine.  Now, so what\u2019s so urgent that you had to call me as I\u2019m heading to one the craziest parties of the year?\u201d supermodel Kira Moss asked smugly into her diamond-studded cell phone.  Kira listened intently as she pulled her custom Maserati into Eily\u2019s palace in the hills, parking it among the multitude of equally impressive vehicles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Kira quipped as her long legs snaked out of the doorway, high heels clicking to the pavement. \u201cOmigod, I have to let her know.  That\u2019s, like, some serious shit.  Well, I guess if it did wonders for Paris\u2019 career, then\u2026\u201d  Stopping to adjust her mini skirt, \u201cOn second thought, Eily\u2019s got a lot more to lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira, currently one of Britain\u2019s most popular runway models and younger cousin of well-known Kate Moss, has known Eily for a number of years when they crossed path\u2019s at one of Cinemaville\u2019s hottest clubs.  Back then, they often traded boyfriends like girls traded dolls; in fact they still do.  \u201cHey, how are you?  It\u2019s been forever,\u201d Kira cheered as she hugged Stacy Stellis and Bruce Dawdson as she made her way to the back of the house, where some 30 people had gathered.  The amount of drugs and alcohol was countered only by the lack of clothes on the guest\u2019s bodies.  Moody Indy music played softly over the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira stood poolside, searching through the landscape of cocaine snorting and fornicating celebrities, to find Eily floating in the pool, taking a hit on a joint, steam rising from the water\u2019s surface as the thermostat regulated the temperature for maximum comfort.  \u201cHey, Kira, over here.  Get in.  Have a joint, Take off your clothes!\u201d Eily rang out.  Kira began slipping off the designer duds that hugged her 5\u201910\u201d frame and slowly stepped into the pool, eyes widened in disgust as she spotted a naked Renee Yrilkosminov in a pool lounge chair just ten feet from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you invited that bloody low life to this party,\u201d Kira whispered to Eily in her thick English accent as she rested her arms on Eily\u2019s raft, pointing discreetly to the 5\u201911\u201d Renee.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your beef with her?  Did she do something to upset you? Just try to get along for the evening.\u201d  Eily tried to assure.  \u201cIt\u2019s just that she\u2019s such a fake; She makes Vogue after coming in second on that cheesy \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Model\u201d.  Eily rolled her eye.  \u201cA little jealous I see.  Here take some of these.\u201d  Kira picked the tiny blue ecstasy pill from Eily\u2019s palm.  \u201cI took one an hour ago, and I\u2019m totally chill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne momentarily interrupted Eily\u2019s rub down, grabbing another raft for Kira.  \u201cThank you,\u201d Kira smiled as she hoisted her wet expanse onto the float.  Several minutes passed as marijuana smoked filled the air as Nelly Furtado reverberated gently from the pool\u2019s underwater stereo system.  Kira and Eily floated next to each other as they watched the likes of rapper D-Tane and actress Molly Tres tongue wrestle as sexy cocktail waitresses kept the waterfall of champagne and vodka flowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, wow this is the best X I\u2019ve ever experienced.  I haven\u2019t felt this good and pampered since I don\u2019t know when,\u201d Kira purred. \u201cKnow what you mean.  My schedule and wrapping up this 50\u2019 Woman movie has completely drained me.  It\u2019s nice to kick back with good friends and even better drugs.\u201d  Eily glistened as she faced Kira.  Both women giggled in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eily, ya know on my way over here, my agent told me that some asshole posted a video of you on Youtube.  I think it's the one\u2026\u201d  \u201cYeah, the one of me fucking what\u2019s-his- name from a year ago. Trish told me the news right before you came in.\u201d  Eily interrupted. \u201cAren\u2019t you pissed?\u201d Kira commanded.  \u201cI was, but for one, the X is totally trippin\u2019 and two,\u2026Dwayne show Kira the letter that I got.\u201d  Dwayne waded over to the side of the pool and gestured for Trish, now in a bikini to hand him the letter from HomTech.  \u201cHere, Eily\u2019s got a plan for that shit,\u201d Dwayne laughed confidently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira read the letter as she positioned herself more comfortably on the rubber and plastic float.  \u201cThey can actually do that?!@?  Make you that fucking tall?\u201d Kira exclaimed.  \u201cYes!  And that\u2019s my plan.  I mean after reading that letter and, I know who the assholes are who put that damn video up.  It was a whole bunch of people who did it.  I\u2019ve spent several years carefully managing my image and I don\u2019t need that shit in people\u2019s minds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the letter again in disbelief, Kira asked, \u201cCan I call these people for you?\u201d  \u201cI was gonna have Trish call them on Monday, but I can have you take care of this for me if you\u2019d like. Trish\u2019s got enough on her plate. Whispering softly to Kira, \u201cI want to make the most of this, so I had this \u2018holy shit!\u2019 idea that will blow people\u2019s minds and teach people never to fuck with me again.  Do you remember that movie \u2018Queen of the Damned\u2019?  I think it came out like five years ago [Kira nodded affirmatively].  Well, anyway, it starred one of my favorite actresses, Aaliyah, God rest her soul.  She died in some accident or some other freak shit\u2026whatever.  I want to pay tribute to her, so I was thinking of wearing the same outfit she wore in that movie.\u201d  \u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201d \u201cLower your voice,\u201d Eily snapped to an incredulous Kira.  \u201cYou mean you want to go as a vampire\u2026a giant vampire? [Eily smiled from ear to ear].  \u201cHoly shit!\u201d Kira marveled.  \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by a \u2018holy shit!\u2019 idea.  A giant vampiress or 50\u2019 vampire in the middle of Cinemaville\u201d Eily proudly trumpeted.  \u201cHow about showing up in Metro City too,\u201d Kira suggested.  \u201cGood idea, girlfriend.  All those people and a giant vampire girl.\u201d Eily oozed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, kindof an Egyptian-ish vampire.\u201d Eily smartly added.  Now, if you check out online, and you can plan it how ever you want, but Aaaliyah in that movie\u2026she\u2019s totally wearing these funky contacts that make her eyes mysterious, fanged teeth, of course, this beautiful ornate breast plate that runs around her boobs and up to her neck, and some vampire-like bracelets.  [Laughing]  Don\u2019t forget to pick me the tight leather mini-skirt.  And the best part,  Aaliyah wore this fucking over-the-top tiara or something.  Get me that, too!\u201d Eily giggled as she placed her hand on Kira\u2019s raft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was overjoyed and honored to be chosen for such a monumental task, smiling with a satisfaction she could hardly contain..  \u201cMMmmm, I think she had these incredibly long lashes and killer fingernails in that movie,\u201d Kira revealed as she puffed on a joint, leaning back to take in the night time sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMake me a sexy 50\u2019 foot vampire and I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
