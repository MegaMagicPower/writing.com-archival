Fat lot of good it would do, she'd already found out that he owed an anormous amount of taxes and she was being evicted from her beautiful home, having to sell her dog grooming business and all of her lovely french furniture. If she could just get her hands on his neck! May he rot in Hades!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Baxter came in and sat straight in his chair, folding his large hands around a bundle of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we have already read the main will, but there is a special clause in it that I was instructed to read to you after you had a little time to grieve for Mr. Phillips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fuming and cursing Ryan under her breath and told the lawyer to just get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Phillips, your late husband has left you something that was very near and dear to his heart and the only thing the state cannot take away from you\", he squirmed in his seat, \"Who'd want it anyway\", he said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I couldn't hear you.\" She leaned forward so she might hear him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn't hear you.\" She leaned closer so she might hear him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and began, \"This wonderful old hotel on a beautiful hawaiian island. Mr. Phillips told me many wonderful stories of his grandparents running it and he said he stayed there every summer until he went off to college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a picture of the most run down dump she'd ever laid her eyes on! It was a three story building with the shutters hanging at odd angles, paint peeling off in large ribbons and thousands of palm fronds scattered everywhere. Surely there had been a hurricane or some natural disaster for it to look like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was not even habitable and yet it was to be her only home. She stomped her feet and began to cry. A good tantrum always made her feel better. She composed herself, thanked the lawyer and went back to her last night in a hotel room, they would toss her in the streets tommorow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smeared cold cream on her face and was grateful the old hotel had also come with the plane fare to get there. She looked at her green face in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you've gotten the best of me Ryan Phillips? I'll make that place the best hotel in Hauo, Huoo.....oh whatever it is!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fifi stuck her polished nail through the mesh screen of the pet carrier. Skye reassured her that everything was ok and the poodle laid down and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye laid her head on the back of the scratchy airline seat and closed her eyes. She wished she was already there so she could access the situation and reassure herself she wouldn't be living on the beach clad in rags and searching for crabs so she wouldn't starve to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skye.\", someone whispered in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flew open and she turned to see who was there. No one was there. She sat there stiff. It had sounded so much like Ryan, when he was in one of his playful moods. He had chased her through the house sometimes, spitting chocolate milk on her or trying to catch her for a kiss. She smiled at a good memory and then remembered he had also cheated on her. Her eyes got misty and she leaned back and closed them again and told herself not to start conjuring up ghosts. The condemmed property that Ryan had left her would keep her busy for a long time to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked up Fifi's carrier and set out to look for him.He was holding a cardboard sign with her name on it. He retrieved her luggage and she followed him, not to a waiting vehicle but out onto the flight field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koko, where are we going?\", she asked loudly and holding onto her hat. Planes and jets buzzed past them as she ran to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to take another plane to get to the hotel.\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", she yelled, \"I don't understand. I was told the hotel was on this island.\" She grabbed at her skirt as it tried to fly over her head, then her hat again, nearly dropping poor Fifi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we have to take this plane to the island. Very secluded, you will like it very much.\" He started throwing luggage into the back compartment of the small plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary Mother of God, please be with me!\", she said and made the sign of the cross. Even if she wasn't of that faith, it couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed in, throwing her hat on the luggage pile and the dog carrier on her lap. Koko got the engines revved up as it spat out huge clouds of black smoke. As they started down the runway, she clutched the bar on the door until her knuckles were white. They heard a thump, thump noise and Koko jumped out and put some tire sealant in a tire and hopped back in. What would happen if the tire were flat again when they landed, she grimaced?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She did find out that he was married to a girl named Kimmy and had two children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane suddenly lurched forward and started to nosedive. She grabbed the dashboard, the dog carrier still in her lap. She looked at Koko with terrified eyes and he told her it happened all the time, as he twisted this knob and turned that handle. She was not reassured and looked at the ocean below, putting her hands over her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, it felt like some force yanked her hands away from her eyes and she saw the water looming closer and closer. She screamed and Fifi started yelping as Koko righted the plane right before impact. She however, had fainted dead away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt someone shaking her and Koko was telling her they had landed. Thank God! She must have passed out and was spared the landing, leaving it a mystery of whether they landed on one wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoko took her hand to help her out of the plane and she hooked her heel on the door and pitched forward on top of him. She told him she was sorry and rolled off him and collected the dog carrier. She straightened her clothes and waited while he gathered the luggage. She felt as if she'd been dragged behind one of the chariots in The Gladiator.</span></div></div>",

Koko find me a cab, will you?\" She dug in her purse for some change and selected a cherry cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cab Mrs. Phillips. I have my car.\" He sat her luggage down and went to get his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nibbled on the delicious, cold treat and let Fifi have a few nibbles too. The man in the snowcone shack chuckled to himself and hid behind a newspaper. She would probably laugh at the site of herself too. She heard an awful noise to see Koko driving a beat up army jeep, spitting and sputtering, threatening to die any minute. He helped her in the seat and hurried and jumped in himself before it died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered why everything here was so old and wornout? Was this place so isolated that they were far behind in modern things? She was used to modern facilities, what if they had only outside bathrooms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally had to put the dog carrier in the back seat so she could hang onto her hat and dress at the same time. Miracles upon miracles, there was a seatbelt around her waist, keeping her body from flying away. They were zooming around mountain roads without any guardrails, she just knew any minute they would fly off a cliff and into the sea.</span></div></div>",

He had worked there as a teenager and could show her where things were. She told him thanks and watched him drive away through the rusted screendoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at all the sheets draped over the furniture and decided she had to find a place to sleep before she dropped in her tracks. She let Fifi out of the carrier and outside for a few minutes. Back inside as she headed up the stairs, the knob came off in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mental note, fix the stairway knob.\", she said wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the knob over her shoulder with a thud and headed up the stairs. The stairs creaked and she thought something was behind her, but when she turned to look, the knob was back in place. She was more tired and stressed than she had thought. She scooted up the stairs to find a place to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sat up fuzzy about where she was and then remembered the awful day before. She saw the bedframe leaning against a wall, along with an old mirror, and gasped at the sight of herself in it. Her one hundred dollar hairdo was ruined. She looked like a fighting rooster that had lost the fight! She grabbed clean clothes and her jumbo makeup bag and set out to find the nearest bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the bathroom just across the hall. There was no shower and the pipes in the bathtub clanged and groaned and finally spat out some water. She took a lukewarm bath, not lingering any longer than necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dabbed her makeup on just right and curiously opened the medicine cabinet for a peek. She was surprised to see not the inside of the cabinet but the outside through the wall. There was a dove resting in a tree outside that didn't seem alarmed by her nosiness. She stared at the bird for a minute and saw Koko and his family below clearing the palm fronds. She excused herself from the bird and went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called Fifi to go outside and talk to Koko and his family. When she got to the screendoor, no one was out front. She went to the back and saw Koko at the edge of the back yard putting the fronds in a pile to burn. She picked Fifi up and they walked towards him between some patio tables and chairs, and was about to say something when she fell into a huge hole in the ground. Fifi went flying into the air when they landed in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Mrs.Phillips?\", Koko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spat dirt out of her mouth and sat up. So much for clean clothes and makeup around here, she thought. Koko jumped in and helped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koko, why is that huge hole there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that is for the pig roasts they used to have here, big luau. They put hot rocks in there and wrap the pig in banana leaves and slow cook all day.

There were several steps leading down to the beach and she decided to go check it out. Fifi bounced down the steps behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom, she kicked off her shoes and let the sand warm the bottom of her feet. She walked up to the waves lapping the shore and waded in. She saw a large wave coming in and tryed to back up to the shoreline away from it. She wasn't fast enough and the wave knocked her down into the foamy surf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome slimy black thing grabbed her around the waist and she screamed and flailed her arms. She wriggled loose and ran and picked up one of her heels for a weapon. She stood her ground as the thing stood up, water dripping from it. It was a man in a diver's suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I frightened you mate, I didn't want you to drown.\" He held his diver's mask and slicked the water from his hair, smiling at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you scare me like that! Just because I'm female, you think you have to rescue me? I may be new around here, but I will not be the butt of your stupid jokes!\" She put her shoes on and called Fifi to follow her back up the stairs. If he thought she was impressed by his good looks, she'd fallen for that before and look where it had gotten her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, however like his australian accent, she admitted to herself, as she stomped off up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood with a puzzled look on his face.

The crazy dog was dancing around on her hind feet like she used to do for Ryan, when he teased her with boiled chicken, her favorite. Fifi stopped dancing and sat looking at something and wagging her stumpy tail. It had been too much for the dog as well as her, she'd have to see if there was a good therapist around for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called to the dog and set off towards a bungalow to the left of the hotel, just off the driveway. She walked over and stuck her head inside. Kimmy was humming loudly to herself as she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Ms. Phillips, so glad to met you. I'm Kimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck out her hand and Skye shook it and was nearly knocked down by two dark haired whirlwinds that stopped long enough to kneal down and pet Fifi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, these two belong to me. Is it okay if they play with the dog?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's fine. Fifi, go play with the children.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe gave the dog a hand signal to go outside and the children followed.

I hope you like it\", the dark haired beauty looked at her for approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Kimmy, does it have a shower with hot water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does, right through there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I love it.

Of course I will supervise all operations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Phillips.

She called to Fifi and they got into the jeep as Koko hugged the kids and promised to bring them a treat from town. He hopped in and cranked the puffing dragon to life. She'd learned to wear pants for this trip and no hat. The heck with her hair, it was totally hopeless.</span></div></div>",

Small children began to gather, eating snowcones, the colored syrup dripping down their chins and clothing.

She quickly dried off and put on her satin blouse, capri pants and heeled sandals. She put on her makeup quickly, some was better than none.

He took her outside and showed her some rotten boards that had to come down so he could replace them. Surely she could work a hammer and pull out a few rusty nails. He gave her a few instructions and left her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed loudly a few times and began concentrating on the task that Quinn had trusted her to do. Once again Ryan showed up and wanted to help and they fought over the hammer , swinging it wildly. She regained control but not before ther were several holes in the building and a broken window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of breaking glass, Quinn and Koko came running.

Are you on any kind of medication?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny\", she said, \"I think it's time for lunch.\" She stomped away, picking at the globs of paint in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook his head and told Koko lunch was a good idea because he needed a cold beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had no family left except Fifi, and she was a traitor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye realized that the whole time they had been eating that Ryan had not come around.

She tuned into an animal show about orphan chimps and felt herself tearing up. She pulled Fifi closer and hugged her.
