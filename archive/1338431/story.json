Below is a link to descriptions of the girls for those who do not know much about them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Mahora_Girls%27_Jr._High_Class_2/3-A\" target=\"_blank\">http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/Mahora_Girl...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, let's start the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi Springfield was up late one night in his school dorm room, a room he shared with two of his students: the hot-tempered but well-meaning Asuna, and her happy, cheerful friend Konoka. Still practicing hard to one day become a master of magic much like his father, the Thousand Master (who makes magic pacts with 1,000 girls, hence his title), Negi had a long way to go to achieve his father's success. Unlike his father, Negi has made only a few pacts to date, all of which involved his students, including the two he lived with. As he continued reading up on magic spells on the bedroom floor, with nary any light but a small lamp to see, he woke up Asuna, who slept on a bunk bed with Konoka, with her bed on top. The light, however was still enough to light up a fairly large amount of the room, one which annoyed Asuna fairly much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi\", Asuna sighed in a groggily tone. \"It's almost 2:00 a.m. You've been reading those magic books all week. Why don't you go to sleep, already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Asuna-san, I think I might have finally found an unique spell, one that may never been done by my own father\", Negi smiled as he continued reading the book. \"I bet it could be useful for the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really\", smirked Asuna. \"And what could POSSIBLY be so important that you have to stay up so late in the night with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a rare and hard to use spell - a growth spell by the name of \"Incresco Tantus\". It's said to make any object, alive or inanimate, grow several times its own size. Doesn't that sound cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..whatever\", Asuna said half-asleep, already proceeding to go back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo cool.. Negi thought to himself. He usually got excited upon reading magic books, but never quite this much. As he finally turned off the light and proceeded to his own bed (one on the ground level much like Konoka's, though with a little stair case leading from it), Negi thought to himself of trying out the spell on something like a rock or a pebble the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, around 9 or 10 a.m., Negi had already dressed himself in his usual teacher attire, despite being a Sunday and not teaching any classes. As he thought to himself the night before, he had placed a small pebble in a magic circle he had made by moving his stick on the ground to create said circle. Right before he says the magic words to expand the rock in size, one of his students shows up. But who was it...?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unsurprisingly, it was Asuna, the first student in Negi's class to find out about his being a magic user, as well as his closest ally. He also lived with her in the dorms as well. Though instead of greeting him with a friendly \"Hello\", Asuna looked at the magic circle in the distance and walked right up to Negi, staring him at the face. Her expression on said face was that of an annoyed one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were serious about it, weren't you?\" questioned Asuna, who then stepped back and sighed. \"You always like to go head first into things, typical of a runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Asuna-san, this magic could come in very handy in the future\", Negi defended himself. \"What if I were able to make your, as well as everyone else's, Pactios stronger by augmenting your size in the process? Surely that would be of help in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the thought of a 'magic growth spell' sounds like something out of a science fiction story, not a magic book\", replied back Asuna, still fairly disappointed that her own teacher would try such a thing. \"I can't believe you would try such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least let me try it on this pebble\", asked Negi, staring at Asuna somewhat with a puppy-dog eyed expression. Asuna tried to resist it as best she could, but found out she couldn't last for long. She eventually caved in to the younger boy's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...all right. But I want to stay here in case anything happens, Negi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Asuna-san. Stand behind me and watch me make this rock grow to a the size of a boulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if it DOES work, it would be fairly neat\", said Asuna, now stepping back about 10 feet from the circle, but still within talking distance to Negi. \"All right then, Negi, let 'er go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi then lifted his staff vertically in his hands, the staff facing directly in front of the circle. He then began the chant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, a light flashed from his staff, successfully causing the pebble to grow. Unfortunately, Negi's aim with the spell was off, and in addition to the pebble's growth, he made a much wider radius of objects grow around him grow, including a buried can of soda in the dirt, several other assorted rocks, and even Asuna herself! As soon as the circle engulfed the teenage girl in the lightly colored light, it disappeared completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san!!!\" Negi exclaimed, running to his student. \"Are you feeling all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna looked at her body, wondering if anything happened to her. She was relieved to find out nothing was different than it was a minute ago, \"I feel fine, Negi. But I wonder if the circle did make all those things grow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna then proceeded to pause, and gulped, continuing with \"I wonder how big I'M going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you were to grow, you would've done so by now, would you know?\" wondered Negi, looking at Asuna for any differences in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right\", smiled Asuna. \"I don't feel any different at al...hmm? What did I just fell right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san, your...chest. It got bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, you're only 10 years old\", grumbled Asuna, annoyed at Negi's gawking at her breasts. \"You're too young to talk about bre..oh hey, you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thing that grew. So did Asuna's hair, arms, legs, and backside. Even the bells in her were starting t grow. And all the while Asuna looked worried, as if she heard a bear rustling in the middle of the woods. Thankfully her clothes grew with her, unlike some of Negi's other spells in the past, but this was still a big shock to the girl. Only a couple minutes later did she finally growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it did work. See?\" grinned Negi. Asuna would normally at this point yell back at him, but she felt so confused and scared by her height that she could barley talk. Negi noticed this too, walking up closer to Asuna to try to talk to her. Asuna herself proceeded to sit down on the ground, kneeling, noticing the much greater size of scope between her and her teacher. It was almost like comparing an adult to a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi\", a worried Asuna said outloud, unsure of whether to cry or yell at Negi. \"This is...really weird. We have to fix this NOW before you get caught!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Asuna-san\", Negi said in an attempt to comfort Asuna. \"I can fix it. I've done it before.\" His energetic spirit helped made the 20 foot-tall Asuna feel a little better, and with it she then proceeded to stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" asked Asuna non-rhetorically, attempting to smilee. \"This could be like the age pills and wear off in a while. Maybe I should do something to celebrate this temporary mini-giantess spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what, Asuna-san?\" Negi asked his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....um....I have no idea\", Asuna laughed in a somewhat nervous tone.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps he can guide us to a source.\" \"You're right\", he said, nodding in agreement. \"Takamichi might not be able to use magic the way I can, but he can still help us.\" However, Negi and Asuna couldn't go wandering around Mahora Academy looking for him: the sight of a 20-foot tall girl would scare the school. So the two retreated to the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Asuna's new height made it 4 times faster than usual to get away from the school, with Negi not too far behind, flying on his stick. Negi then decided to telepathically contact Takamichi via a card placed upon his forehand, in much the same manner he's communicated to his own students in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takamichi, can you hear me?\" asked Negi, hoping for a response. \"It's me, Negi. We have a bit of a situation he..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you, Negi-kun\", Takamichi replied. \"What seems to be the manner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....have you ever heard of a spell that makes objects, as well as people, grow big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I vaguely remember it, but I don't remember it being widely used. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was trying it the other day, and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it backfired and hit one of your students?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", Negi sighed, Asuna sighing simultaneously with him. \"It hit Asuna-san, and now she's 20 feet tall! I don't know how to reverse it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help us, Takahata-sensei!\", Asuna said right in front of Negi's face, hoping he would hear her. \"If word caught out about this, Negi would be turned into an ermine for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thankfully for you two I know of a way to resolve this, but it's fairly dangerous\", explained Takamichi, a worried tone in his voice. \"The only known copy of a spell that reverse spells of that magnitude is guarded by a monster in the library underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like the one Negi and I went to when we were studying for the exams a few months ago?\" asked Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", replied Takamichi. \"The very same. You'll have to retrace your steps down there and find him. Once you get past him, you can find a whole array of books with various spells. But for your sake, only use the shrinking spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" asked Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other spells are so powerful, and I don't mean anything harsh by this, but someone of your experience level may not be able to handle the spells without disasterous results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand\", said Negi and Asuna in unison. And with that, Negi caught off his connection with Takamichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Negi, I guess we're going on another strange adventure\", Asuna told her teacher, rubbing his head playfully with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems so\", he said in reply. \"But do you think we should go alone?\"</span></div></div>",

Asuna decided to plop her butt on the ground to prevent banging her head into something, watching as she slowly grew to 60 feet tall.

The tiny teacher watched as the already tall girl's head and face grew further and further away from him, her long, beautiful hair covering up his body as Asuna shot up into the air. By this time Asuna was used to growing and just let it go with the flow, while Negi latched onto his student's shoulder to stay on the increasingly taller student of his. Within a minute or so Asuna was now 100 feet tall! Her ear alone was almost half his size, much less the rest of her body. Her head alone towered over her teacher, not to mention the rest of her body, with arms longer than most of the buildings at Mahora Academy, and legs as tall as some skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't be too hard to best that monster now.

Never thought one day I'd be 100 or so feet tall, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I\", Negi nodded in agreement. \"But how are we going to get to the library at your height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can make the hallways bigger\", suggested Asuna, giggling a little afterwards. \"It worked on me, so it may work on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try, Asuna-san, but we should wait until night, when it's less busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.

A ruler was far too small to do such a thing, so Negi pulled out from his pocket a mini-roster, which gave basic information on all the girls in his class, including measurements (which he didn't share with anyone but his own students, though some were more annoyed by this than others), and decided he had to base his observations on it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the child teacher examined Asuna's body, Asuna herself looked confused as she watched her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be looking at me pretty long and hard, Negi\", Asuna smirked as she watched her teacher walk up to her very long legs. \"What exactly are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm trying to see if your measurements are all evenly p-p-placed\", the nervous teacher replied, looking quite red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're so cute\", smiled Asuna as she proceeded to stand up straight on her feet. The difference between the two's height now was quite staggering. Within a manner of minutes, Asuna went from being less than a foot taller than Negi to being big enough to hold him in one hand. Negi nervously continued his observing, but when he got too close to his student's knees, Asuna started to look a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be looking where I think you are\", Asuna grumbled. \"I may be nicer at my newfound height, but I won't be afraid to smack you for glancing at my panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san, I'm not interested in that kind of thing at all\", an annoyed Negi said in his defense, blushing quite a bit. Asuna giggled at her teacher's red face, who was unaware that his student was merely teasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please sit down on your knees now?\" Negi requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", Asuna complied happily, sitting down on her knees in Negi's direction. The boy tried to climb up his student's knees to take a better look, but found himself falling off her skirt quite easily when he tried to climb up on her legs to do so. Asuna simply smiled and scooped up Negi in her right hand, placing him on her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this help, Negi?\" Asuna asked cheerfully after putting him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It does\", Negi replied, bowing to Asuna in gratitude. So far he hadn't notice any difference in size in comparison to the rest of her body. It seemed as if Asuna's body grew evenly, right down to the bells in her hair. The only areas Negi hadn't examined were Asuna's butt and chest, which he decided not to look at for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything different about my body, Negi?\" an inquisitive Asuna asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It seems as if everything grew the same amount, from your toes to your hair\", Negi told his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to be blushing a lot during the whole thing, Negi\", teased Asuna, giggling a little as she placed Negi right up to her lips. He thought he was going to get kissed by her gigantic lips, which were almost, if not bigger than, his head. It was all for fun, though, as Asuna quickly put Negi back down on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\" Asuna giggled as she placed her teacher on her chest, which to Negi looked big enough to sleep on, like two really big pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels kind of nice\", a shy Negi admitted, feeling a little sleepy on top of his student. Asuna quickly moved him to right beneath above her chest, his feet facing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been looking pretty tired lately, Negi. Why don't you rest a little before we head off, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oka...\" Negi responded, already proceeding to fall asleep on Asuna's chest. Asuna herself proceeded to slowly place herself down on the ground as well, who was tired herself from extra work on her paper route recently as well. Within minutes the two were sleeping like babies. But is their sleep a peaceful one, or are they disturbed..?</span></div></div>",

He remembered being on Asuna's left breast before he slept, but now he was sitting in the middle of it! A look down the area below revelaed a fairly high jump for him just to get down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Asuna-san's growth didn't stop!\" said a panicked Negi as he twirled his arms around in typical worrywart fashion like he did in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard the giant yawn of his student, which sounded incredibly loud to him. When she raised her right hand to rub her eyes, Negi could actually feel each movement on his student's body as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done yawning, Asuna slowly picked up her teacher inbetween her thumb and pinky, lifting the boy up closer to her face and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Negi\", the giantess whispered to her teacher, then proceeding to stand up on her two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san! You're...you're...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared\", Asuna said in a very soothing voice to the boy teacher. \"As long as I'm around, no one will hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi was confused by Asuna's gentle, sweet voice; it reminded him of his older cousin Nekane. Asuna even had the same, soothing smile on her face that she typically did, placing the teacher slowly in her left skirt pocket. Before that, though, she gently kissed the boy on the face with her giantess lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer expection, though, he noticed Asuna had changed in more ways than one. Her hair now went straight down her back, for one. But most noticeable was her attire; instead of her casual attire from earlier, Asuna was now in a beautiful, light blue dress that went down to her toes. Her lips were aligned with pink lipstick, and her chest seemed to be a little bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san...how tall are you now?\" the worried Negi asked his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 300 feet tall, I suppose\", she politely answered, the boy now in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"300!? Oh my, this is bad..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't threat, Negi. We will have this fixed soon\", Asuna comforted her teacher as she walked closer to her destination point. But...what WAS that destination point?</span></div></div>",

In fact, it was about an hour before Asuna took him out again, showing Negi a beautiful waterfall in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, look! Doesn't that look nice?\" his cheerful student asked of him, placing him gently down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes it does!\" he agreed, sitting on the nice, cool summer grass beneath him. Asuna joined him on the ground, sitting with her legs in an Indian position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to get grass stains on your clothes!\" Asuna giggled as she watched Negi get up and noticed his brown butt, trying to get the grass off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Negi~\", Asuna sighed as she looked at the waterfall some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of getting grass stains off his clothes, the worried boy walked ever closer to his student as he tugged on her dress, hoping to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Negi?

Odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look a mother, or an older sibling, or..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..a goddess?\" Asuna finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that I've never seen you like this before..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's like you noticed before, right? The taller I get, the happier I am. And right now I'm very happy just being with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..I know I can be mean, even bossy at times to you. But I don't do it because I hate you; I do it because I care for you. You and Konoka are two of the most important people in my life, and I would do anything for you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna picked up her teacher and embraced him with a soft, gentle, giantess hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, I care for you. I'll always be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe touching moment was then interrupted by Asuna splashing some water on her teacher and placing him back on the ground, soaked almost from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for, Asuna-san!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To lighten things up\", Asuna said with a smile. \"Why don't you go swimming? It's a nice day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have my swim trunks..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do now!\" Asuna said to her teacher, pulling her his swim trunks from her other pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You KNEW you would take me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did! Today you're going to relax and have fun, Negi!

Now that he was further away from her, he could how mature she looked in her long, light blue dress and her bell-free hair. She looked more like an adult woman than a teenager, and her voice was as soothing as that of any mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, it's getting dark! You better come out!\" Asuna said to her teacher as she picked him up from the water with her cupped hands. She then placed the boy back on the grass and dried him off by blowing on the boy with her big mouth, which was surprisingly effective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna then handed the boy some casual clothes he could change himself with.

Afterwards, the magic circle disappeared, as did the light from Negi's staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kuuunnn\", chirped Konoka, bending her head down to Negi's eye level. \"You're soooo cute!\" With that, Konoka grabbed Negi in her hands like a toy on the ground of a little child's room. \"This is so cool\", she continued. \"M-maybe to you, but I'm scared of heights\", panicked Negi. \"Hey, I know\", Konoka then said, winking one of her eyes. \"Let's show Asuna or Setchan this.

She stood tall, hovering over Negi with her hair sticking straight into the air. \"You idiot!

When Negi thought he had a perfect plan, his thought was interrupted when he heard Asuna yell, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah! Asuna-san, I almost had a perfect plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? If you thought of it once, you can think of it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonoka overheard Asuna's outburst for food. She got out of her bunk, and looked in one of the cupboards, only to see them barren of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all out of snacks\", Konoka sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeh?! Didn't we get some the other night?\" Asuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I don't think so. Well, I'll just go get some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Konoka take them along?</span></div></div>",

The size of the pocket was perfect enough that they could stand and rest their arms and head at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonoka giggled while looking at their heads poking out of the pocket. \"Just be sure that you hide when someone is nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konoka, please be careful with us.

It always does around you, Negi-kun\", smiled Konoka. \"So let's go walk over and say 'Hi' to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but please slow down for me\", Negi asked Konoka, his head facing hers as if he was looking at a sign on a building three stories above him. \"Your legs are much longer than mine now, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd carry you, Negi-kun, but I'm still not tall enough to do so.\" Thank goodness, thought Negi to himself. The dizzying height from Konoka's lift gave him a head rush most roller coasters could only hope of giving fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long a walk until they found Setsuna, who up until a few minutes ago was busy teaching Asuna sparring techniques, a common thing they've done together since they rescued Konoka a few weeks ago. But Asuna had left a while ago, and Setsuna was simply polishing her sword under a tree. But suddenly the shade seemed darker than before, and Setsuna wondered what caused it. She looked straight up and around her, until she noticed a strange sight....a 20-foot tall Konoka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-O-Ojo-sama!?!\" exclaimed Setsuna in shock and awe. \"What on Earth happened to you!?! Did someone put a curse on you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Setchan\", smiled Konoka, who then sat on the ground, her feet in an Indian-style position. \"Negi-kun simply case a spell to make me taller.\" Still in shock, Setsuna looked straight at Negi with a very blank expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU did this, Negi-sensei?? Can you return her to normal??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the truth is...I don't know a shrinking spell. I guess that's why my magic school told us it was one of the 'forbidden' spells to cause. Apparently it's very hard to refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, Setchan\", Konoka smiled to her friend, placing her on my lap, all the while with Setsuna blushing as red as a tomato. \"In fact, I think you should grow, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!?!?\" gasped Setsuna. \"Ojo-sama, I couldn't do that. We would be easily spotted due to our size! In fact, I'm already worried about you being this tall and too big a target!\" Konoka simply continued to stare at Konoka with a smile in her face. Setsuna slowly felt less worried about her taller friend, and finally popped Negi the question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, will you please make me taller, so that I may more easily protect Ojo-sama?\" she asked of her teacher, clapping her hands together and bowing her head to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Setsuna-san?\" asked Negi. \"It may be a while before you return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure\", Setsuna told her teacher. And with that, Negi did the same magic incantation he did on Konoka, and only a few minutes passed by before Setsuna was around 19 and a half feet tall, a little shorter than Konoka's current height. She was far from excited, though, and was so worried about her height she could barely speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Setchan\", comforted Konoka. \"Sit down right next to me.\" Setsuna listened to her and proceeded to sit down.

The light engulfed her and faded away in a few minutes. She didn't know if the magic worked until she felt something tingling around her body. First, her hair grew, then her legs grew larger. The rest of her body then started to grow until she was 20 feet taller.

Negi looked around, and it was Takane!. Her mouth was hung open as she was surprised at Mei's new height.

Mei started to worry a little more now than usual, as she was well aware of whose voice that was. It was of Takane Goodman, her superior. The girl jumped out off of a nearby tree, landing pinpoint perfect on the grond. Her clothes were different than usual: while Takane usually wore one specific uniform, today she was dressing more casually, wearing a light blue t-shirt and jeans. However, she still wore boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Negi-sensei, but we cannot allow such an event to unfold in front of Mahora. You will be prosecuted for your actions and turned into an ermine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no one's even seen us\", Setsuna tried to reply, only to be given a loud \"Hush\" from Takane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, you have one of two choices: come quietly, or I'll be forced to fight you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Takane-san, my students' size...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd forget about that?\" smiled Takane, holding a small, label-less bottle in her right hand. \"I will make myself grow and fight your students if need be. So, what will it be, sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi was too worried about being turned into an ermine. What was supposed to be a painless experiment ended up being a gigantic disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, let me fight\", Setsuna told her teacher, kneeling down on the ground and facing him. \"I'll make sure you and Ojo-sama are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set-chan, be careful\", added Konoka, watching her friend pull out her sword and walking towards Takane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takane-san, I'll fight you!\" a serious Konoka told the girl \"And if I win, Negi-sensei won't get turned into an ermine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but I want both you and your friend to fight\", replied Takane. \"Oh Mei~..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Y-Yes, onee-sama?\" a worried Mei asked her superior, running over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink this\", commanded Takane, forcing the liquid down Mei's throat. She soon gagged afterwards, the taste of the liquid not leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Soon after Takane also drank the liquid, and both girls felt a powerful surge inside of them. Mei was first, first noticing her tiny feet expanding in height, followed quickly by her hands, forcing her to put down her broomstick lest she snap it in half. The scared girl's head then grew, followed up by her arms, hair, and finally her stomach and chest. Takane's growth started with her hair, then her head, and then worked its way down all the way to her feet. A minute and a half passed between the girls, and they were both roughly 4 times the size they used to be, similar to Konoka and Setsuna.</span></div></div>",

But if we don't, we might never be able to be normal again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quiet the predicament\", Setsuna sighed. Just then Negi stood up, and as he did something floated out of his pocket and to the ground. It was Yue's pactio card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Negi shouted. \"Yue-san's artifact! It's an encyclopedia that might have something on reversing the effects of a shrinking potion. But I wonder where she might be? I think I remember her saying something about going on another library expedition but that might have been yesterday.\" A figure moved through the woods behind Negi and he turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who's there?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Negi!\" came the familiar call of Asuna as she charged him head on. \"You just seem to cause trouble for everyone don'tcha?!\" she said as she screeched to a halt.

You should hurry and get these four fixed before something happens.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you Asuna-san\", Negi bowed slightly to Asuna, making sure Setsuna and Konoka didn't slip.

Instead, Negi told her the truth: pure and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a spell that allows both inanimate and living things to expand in size\", Negi eventually told Nodoka. \"I was going to test it on this pebble in the middle of the dirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...first I grew, and then I shrunk, and then..\" Nodoka explained to her friends, who afterwards looked at Negi in a combination of shock and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun! You didn't tell me you had the power to make things bigger!\" Haruna said to her teacher, teasingly batting his nose. \"What else have you tried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Actually, Nodoka-san was the first person I tried it on...\", admitted Negi, facing away from his students. \"And I have to fix this right away..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww.

Look how cute Nodoka is!!\" Haruna asked her teacher, hugging her tiny friend in her arms. \"She's sooooo cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even I have to admit that a smaller Nodoka's kind of cute\", Yue added. \"Even if it is a little weird that I'm taller than her..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun!

I'll promise to take good care of her\", teased Haruna as she hugged her friend once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nodoka's not a pet, Haruna\", snapped Yue, releasing her friend from her bifocal friend's gasp. \"Negi-sensei, do you think you could try the spell again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's really up for Nodoka to deci...\" began Negi as Nodoka rushed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, please.

She beamed at Nodoka throughout the entire process, waiting impatiently to snatch her little friend up the first chance she got. Unfortunately for her, Yue got to Nodoka first and cradled her (though not for the same reasons as Haruna) to keep her small friend away from Haruna's crushing embrace. She had a very hard time resisting the urge to follow her larger friend in embracing Nodoka as soon as she picked her up, however. Her urge turned to reality when Nodoka reached up and wrapped her arms around Yue's neck. She hugged the figure draped around her and formed a spring board with her hands as Nodoka jumped from her to Haruna, who hugged the little Nodoka and spun in place as she caught her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, thank you SOOOOOOO much!\" Haruna shouted, causing Nodoka to clap her hands over her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei!\" an extremly frightened Nodoka squealed. \"Please try to stop making me shrink!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I will, Nodoka-san\", Negi said frantically, patting his student on the head IN order to quell her torrent of soon-to-come tears.

When she finally did calm down, though, she started to whimper as she hugged Negi's right leg. She then cried into it, hiding her face in his pant leg as he, Yue, and Haruna heard her cry (albeit muffled). When Negi sat on the ground to get a better look at her, her face was blood red, and tears still ran down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends tried to cheer up, but it was to no avail. No matter how many times she was told how neat it was to shrink or the jokes about she'll always have room to sit somewhere she heard from Haruna, the feeling didn't change for the upset, crying little girl. Even Negi's patting her head again didn't seem to help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei...!\" was all Nodoka could respond with when she finally stopped crying. \"I'm scared! I want to go back to my dorm room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\", he replied, picking up the girl in his hands, holding her close to his chest. \"Let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka felt at first scared being pressed against her teacher's chest, but soon she changed her mood. His big, gentle hands felt almost comforting to her, so much that she didn't even care that she was over 3 feet off the ground (which, at her height, would be the equivalent of a story or two from a building). Nodoka then clenched her fingers into his shirt over the next few minutes as he walked into her dorm room and then sat on her bed, Haruna and Yue beside the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Nodoka-san!\" Negi told his student, who felt a little sleepy from the walk. He was just happy that she wasn't crying any more. As he placed her on her pillow, though, he felt another tug from the tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me, sensei!\" Nodoka demanded, looking scared. \"Please stay with me for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nodoka...\", Yue sighed in response to her worried friend. She then faced Negi with a serious look on her face. \"Negi-sensei, please stay here with Nodoka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but what ab-b-bout f-fixing...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that later! She's really upset!\" she barked at her teacher, Haruna nodding in agreement. \"Please, sensei! <i>You</i> did this to her! It's your responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Yue-san\", Negi nodded. He then took off his shoes and sat down on the bed next to Nodoka. \"Nodoka-san, I'll stay here for your sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sensei...\", the timid girl replied, blushing a little at her teacher's \"giant\" face. She then proceeded over to his stomach and got on top of it. \"Thank you very much..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. She's like a puppy\", Haruna giggled as she opened the door. \"We'll leave you two alone, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, be careful\", warned Yue as she left the dorm alongside Haruna, closing the door. Negi had a unnerving feeling about her warning, but he hadn't much time to think about it. He had to take care of Nodoka..</span></div></div>",

It was the longest conversation she ever had with the boy, and she was delighted by every minute of it. She even found herself getting used to her smaller stature when Negi picked off food for her to eat and even shrunk little straws for her to drink cans of soda with. They even spend some time outdoors, with Nodoka watching a whole movie safely snugged in her teacher's front shirt pocket. It was one of the best days of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two headed back to the dorm later that night, though, something happened to the shrunken girl: she was getting bigger! Nodoka found herself quickly outgrowing Negi's pocket, now up to the 1 foot mark (and growing) as she stood beside her teacher and continue to shoot up in the air. Higher and higher she went until she eventually found herself at her original height once more. Once this happened she hugged her teacher harder than she ever had before, followed by kissing him on the lips in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this wonderful day, Negi-sensei!\" a euphoric Nodoka told her teacher. \"If you ever feel like shrinking me ever again, please tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....okay\", a baffled Negi replied as she left Nodoka's dorm and headed back to his own. Haruna and Yue, meanwhile, looked at the two from about 25 feet down the hall, spying on them the entire time ever since they \"left\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want Negi-sensei to shrink me too\", Yue commented. \"Riding in his shirt pocket looks kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to me\", Haruna explained to her friend. \"I like to think BIG!\"</span></div></div>",

Nodoka already felt awkward concerning her height around Negi, and this didn't help manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, however, Nodoka finally stopped growing. Her final height was almost 15 feet tall, a little less than triple her normal height. Too embarassed to move, much less talk, Nodoka simply stood frozen stiff like a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-n-n--negi s-s-s-s-s-sensei...\" Nodoka slowly and shyly blurted out. \"I'm s-s-so sorry for leaving y-y-you in a position like this.\" All the poor girl could do right now was feel frustrated at the mess she caused Negi. With that, Nodoka kneeled her long legs onto the ground, and then lowered her head, which was even bigger than Negi's stomach. \"Please forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, Nodoka-san\", Negi assured Nodoka. \"I should've been more careful with my spell. If anything, I should be the one apologizing to you.\" With that, Negi himself bowed his head towards Nodoka, nearly looking at the mini-giantess face-to-face as he told her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei looks so cute\", thought Nodoka to herself. \"Almost like a doll. I want to hold him in my arms and embrace him in a hug, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Nodoka and Negi heard a voice in the distance. \"Hey, you two lovebirds!\" chimed an out-of-distance Haruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruna?!\" exclaimed Negi and Nodoka. \"We can't let her find out!\"</span></div></div>",

Nodoka was still thankful for them, though, and thanked Haruna for being more understanding now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nodoka, You know what you should know do before you shrink back to normal size?\" asked Haruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" replied Nodoka, still red in the face and a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Negi should have a date!\" Haruna grinned. \"How many people get the opportunity to date a 15 foot-tall girl like yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-d-d-d-date?!\" said Negi in shock. \"But Haruna-san..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.

Haruna-san somehow overheard you and Asuna-san talking about the growth spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!?!\" Negi exclaimed. \"She knew from the beginning!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I did too, sensei\", Nodoka shyly replied. \"The thing is, Yue, Haruna, and me played rock-paper-scissors to see what you were up to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose you were the winner?\" asked Negi. Nodoka shook her head up and down in reply. \"Oh, I see\", he added. \"I guess Haruna-san wanted to see the results, then? But what about Yue-san? She loves magic abilities.

Even at 120 feet tall Negi still at least came up to his student's individual fingers in height, but now even they were starting to creep up high above him as the already tall Nodoka felt herself growing ever larger. Nodoka watched as she grew so big she could see halfway up through some of the buildings of Mahora Academy...and she was still sitting down! Negi began to worry some more as he tried to clear the way from Nodoka, but the growing giantess picked up the teacher with two of her left hand and placed the boy on her chest to protect him from harm. Negi found himself looking face to face with his student as she grew, now finally stopping at a height of 300 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, do you think I'm cute as a giantess?\" the 300 foot-tall giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes\", Negi replied bashfully in a combination of both fear and blushing at his student's cuteness. Nodoka smiled in reply, but seemed a little sad at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As happy as I am of being a giantess, though, I wish my friends could see me and join me. Say! Why don't we do that, sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi seemed reluctant. The last thing he wanted was several skyscraper-sized students running amock and revealing his magic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we shou...\" Negi began before Nodoka stuffed the boy in her right skirt pocket. Nodoka then began to stand up (using a tree as balance) from the ground and proceeded to head to her dorm room, careful to not step on anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder who should grow with me... Nodoka wondered to herself. She didn't mean anything bad by it: Nodoka was just lonely at her new height.</span></div></div>",

Haruna held some books in her arms while Yue walked beside her sipping a juice box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where in the world is Nodoka?\" Haruna asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Don't you remember?

Haruna and Yue looked up past some trees to see the upper body of the 300 foot tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"Yue looked at Haruna, \"You don't think Negi-kun's behind this, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, I, uh...\" Haruna didn't expect Nodoka to be looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka took Negi out of her pocket and placed him gently on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your magic, Negi-sensei?\" Yue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes...\"Negi uttered silently and slowly. Meanwhile, Yue was observing her giantess friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect you to master a growing spell...\" she said as she noticed Nodoka walked closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually I didn't master it\", Negi told Haruna, \"So I need to find a cure for the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cure?\"Nodoka heard, \"Why? I like being so tall... In fact, I want for Haruna-san and Yue-san to be too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Sorry, but I'm not going to be hit by a spell Negi-sensei hasn't mastered yet\", Yue told her friend point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\" Haruna said. \"Let's get ready, Negi-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Nodoka cheered at her friend's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can't!\" Negi hesitated to say. \"I can't have everyone running around and-\". \"Relax, Sensei,\" Haruna said to her teacher as she patted his head, \"We'll be sure not get anyone's attention.\" Negi didn't think he was going to change his students' minds so he gave in. \"I suppose...\", he then sighed. \"Oh thank you, Negi-Sensei!\" Haruna smiled at the boy as she hugged him tightly. \"Haruna-san, that's enough...\"the poor child teacher nearly choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi then drew a circle around Haruna in the dirt, watching the girl continuously smile all throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want everyone to stand back\", Negi warned Nodoka, Yue, and Haruna as he began to lift his staff in the air. \"And Haruna-san..please stand still okay?\" Haruna then winked at Negi, confirming his request. Yue and Nodoka stood away from Negi and Haruna as he began to recite the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi cast the spell like normal, but instead of hitting Haruna, the spell had hit Yue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Negi gasped as the usually short girl's transformation to a giantess began before his eyes. Yue's legs began growing, following her head, arms, and torso. Yue had became 15 feet tall and continued to grow. Haruna could only stutter as she watched Yue grow 25 feet in size, and then one last spurt up to 40 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei! Please reverse this right now!\" the giantess Yue yelled at her teacher. Nodoka panicked and starting \"shh\"-ing the girl, telling her while in a panic, \"Don't shout! Someone might hear you!\" \"But I don't want to be huge like you, Nodoka! Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I can't! I don't know how!\" Negi told his student. Meanwhile, Haruna looked in awe at Yue and Nodoka as they towered over her and her teacher. \"Yue\", Haruna then began, \"Maybe you should enjoy being very tall. You're so cute!\" Haruna's response caused Yue to cock an eyebrow at her, wondering how her tremendous size could be considered cute.</span></div></div>",

Nodoka-san reacted in much the same manner when she first grew...before she grew again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!? You mean Yue is going to get bigger!?\" an inquisitive Haruna asked Negi. What very little relief Yue had was now all but gone upon Negi telling her that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much bigger is Yue going to get, Negi-kun!?\" Haruna added to her previous quesiton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", Negi quietly blurted out to his excited student, \"Nodoka-san started out around 15 feet tall before she grew to 300 feet or so..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", Haruna smiled at Yue. \"You're going to become a giantess goddess, Yue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be that big\", Yue stammered, blushing in embarrassment at her giant height. As Yue continued to freak out, she felt a powerful surge going through her body again. The 45 foot tall giantess noticed her hair growing to more than twice the length it already was, soon followed by her feet, legs, arms, hands, torso, and lastly her head. When all was said and done, Yue was now 100 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei!\" Yue cried as she hugged Negi with her giant hands in a moment of cowardice. \"I don't want to be any bigger! Please fix this now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Yue-san, I don't know how!\", Negi whimpered to his giantess student.

Nodoka then wrapped her arms around the girl as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww\", Haruna smiled in delight of her best friends hugging. \"Isn't friendship beautiful, Negi-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\", Negi answered with a blank stare on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that that's done, how's about we finally make me bigger?\" Haruna asked of her teacher, placing her head next to his own and smirking.</span></div></div>",

Are you practicing some kind of spell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", Negi responded. \"It's a growth spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-growth spell??\" asked a confused Setsuna. \"I didn't know they had that kind of spell in your magic books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently it's not used very often for some reason\", Negi explained to Setsuna. \"But I'm going to make this rock grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it all right if I watch too, Negi-sensei?\" asked a slightly flustered (and intrigued) Setsuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", smiled Negi. \"Just be sure not to get too close to the circle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Setsuna proceeded to step back right behind Negi. The thought of the growth spell ran for her mind as she watched Negi prepare his spell. It made Setsuna wonder about her own height, considering herself fairly short for a 13 year-old girl. Konoka was a couple of inches than her, and Asuna looked like an adult in terms of height stature in comparison. Although Setsuna didn't look particularly young for her age, she did think of herself as fairly short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei...do you think I'm short for my age?\" Setsuna asked her teacher in a sad tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, Setsuna-san. You're fine just the way you are\", Negi smiled in reply. \"If anything, <i>I'm</i> short for my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried one day my height might get in the way of protecting Ojo-sama..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Setsuna-san. Konoka-san's got you, Asuna-san, me, and many others in this school to protect her. Why are you asking this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...I want you to help me protect Ojo-sama\", Setsuna said in a decreasingly lower volume of voice, proceeding closer to her teacher until she was right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi pushed his head upward as he looked at the now depressed student of his. Usually Setsuna had either a determined or content look on her face as of late, but today she almost seem scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuna-san..do you want me to make you bigger?\" Negi asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I do, sensei\", Setsuna said in a much more assuring, louder voice. \"I'll put my life on the line for Ojo-sama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Setsuna put down her sword on the ground and proceeded to the circle, removing the rock from it. But before fully entering, she told her teacher while blushing beet red: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, please don't make me TOO tall. I don't want to hurt anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you, Setsuna-san\", Negi told her, in a comforting tone. \"And if something goes wrong, I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi then proceeded to take his staff and lift it with his arms, the staff facing vertically and away from the boy. The magic circle began to glow, and so did the tip of Negi's staff as he said the incantation: \"Incresco Tantus!\" And as soon as Negi said it, both the magic circle and the light from his staff disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuna-san, are you all right?\" questioned Negi, hoping he didn't hurt the girl in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, sensei\", smiled Setsuna. \"Though I guess it didn't work.\" Setsuna then proceeded to go pick up her sword and walk away from her teacher, waving him a friendly good-bye as she headed off to eat. She didn't look too phased by the spell's failure, but Negi was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Setsuna-san\", Negi frowned. \"I guess I couldn't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna then walked up to her teacher, smiling with her eye closed and embraced him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right\", smiled Setsuna. \"You're still a great magic user, Negi-sensei. I just need to train some mo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna froze in mid-sentence, feeling something like a muscle cramp in her stomach. She fell to the ground on her knees as she panted heavily, screaming shortly afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!! It hurts!!\" exclaimed Setsuna as she pulled at the ground below her with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuna-san!!\" exclaimed Negi. \"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Negi said this, he noticed Setsuna's hair was getting longer, her petite arms were getting much longer, and her head was growing to a much bigger size. It seemed as if she was growing unevenly, with her head, hair, and arms at least 4 or 5 times their normal height, but the rest of her body the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really awkward\", Setsuna nearly cried, struggling to keep balance as she stood up with her long arms, only to fall to the ground. Fortunately, the rest of her body was starting to grow. First up were her hands, then her legs, feet, and finally her stomach and backside. All in all it took about 4 minutes for Setsuna to finish growing to a height of about 24 feet (a little less than 5 times her current height). She could finally stand up now that her whole body was one size, but she found herself scooting on her butt on the ground until she managed to sit up, like she was in a chair that was hard to get out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei\", Setsuna frowned, worried about her new found size. \"I'm...not intimidating, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you ARE a little intimidating at that size\", Negi said nervously, causing Setsuna to droop her head down in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but you're still the same Setuna-san you've always been: strong, brave, and beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna felt a little better after Negi's recovery comment, sitting down beside her teacher. She was still a little nervous looking at her surroundings, though, and she now realized how it felt for the title heroine from Alice in Wonderland after she ate the \"Eat Me\" cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now, Setsuna-san?\" asked Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" thought Setsuna...</span></div></div>",

She quickly lept behind a very big tree and hoped that no one would spot them. Unfortunately this wouldn't last long, as Setsuna shot up yet again in growth. The spurts were small but consistent, with Setsuna growing about 2 feet each second during it. The growth did not cease for almost 2 minutes, with Setsuna now an icredible 400 feet tall! Her skirt pocket at this height would be enough for Negi to live in, much less hide in, and the extremely tall giantess slowly proceeded to creep ever further away from any people's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two reached a clearing, only to see a batch of huts in the middle of the forest even taller than Setsuna! They must have been over 1,000 feet tall! As Setsuna quickly hid behind one, she saw a girl who didn't look any more than 8 or 9 years old emerge from one of the huts. The girl was dressed in a plain pink t-shirt and white skirt, and quickly noticed the 400 foot-tall samurai hiding behind her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Another giantess! But you're tiny\", the 800 foot-tall girl told Setsuna, astonished by her incredible height. \"But I'll fix that!\" And with that, the girl ran back into her house and got out some hot soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink this\", the girl smiled to Setsuna. Setsuna wasn't hungry, but she didn't want to be rude, so she drank it. It tasted very good. But Setsuna wondered what the girl meant by \"fixing\" her height problem....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to figure out the meaning in it, though. Setsuna found herself balooning further in height, and this time she grew in spurts of 15 feet a second for almost a minute! In just 60 seconds Setsuna was not only taller than the huts she once was overshadowed by, but nearly everything else in town!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!! You're really tall, onee-chan\", the girl smiled in awe. \"Not even my mommy grew to 1300 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1300 FEET!?\" a flustered Setsuna replied. \"I'm almost a quarter of a mile high!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", the girl smiled. \"And you're about to grow again. That was a super-strong soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you give me the soup?\" the worried Setsuna wondered to the smiling girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see....the growth that happened to you earlier was my doing. I've heard about your heroic escapades around Mahora Academy in the past and wanted you to come help our town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really nice of you, little one, but I'm afraid I have my own friends to protect\", Setsuna bowed in apology, where she once again shot in growth, this time to 1700 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortuantely for you, the only way to grow back to normal is to defeat the people who attacked our town\", the girl told the very, very tall Setsuna, who once again shot up in height, this time to 1900 feet. \"That's partially the reason we ourselves live here. We're too big to live in regular society.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", Setsuna pondered. \"Okay then, I'll help you. But ONLY if you promise to return me to my normal height\" which she added as she shot up to 2100 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, onee-sama! By the way, my name's Ara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Setsuna. Nice to meet you, Ara-san\", Setsuna said, bowing to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too\", she replied, also bowing her head. \"And thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore setting off, though, Setsuna reached into her pocket and pullled out Negi, who was dazed inside his student's skirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to ask of you this, but can you watch my teacher, Negi-sensei?\" Setsuna asked the girl, holding said teacher in the palm of her right hand. \"I don't want him to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it\", Ara responded, carerfully taking the teacher and placing him in her hands. \"Good luck, Setsuna-sama!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Setsuna headed pass the village to find out who was reponsible for disturbing the peace of the little town. As she walked she once again shot in growth, now up to 2500 feet tall! How long does it take her to get there?</span></div></div>",

Never before had the young 14 year-old heroine thought she would not only grow to be 5 feet and a half tall, but big enough to make most mountains look like toys! Setsuna's growth did not stop when she left the village, and the already tall giantess was now 5,000 feet tall. She could only pray that she did not hurt anyone during her walk, and she was very, very fortunate no one had seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna finally arrived at the headquarters of the people who made the people in the not-so-nearby village monster-sized. Despite them knowing a spell that makes things much bigger, the town itself was small. Setsuna had to squint her eyes and bow down below her to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! Over here!\" came a tiny voice from the tallest point of the village, about 10 feet from Setsuna's vision. There she saw a girl, about 5 foot, 10 inches tall. She had long, blonde hair, green eyes, and was wearing a pink-purple kimono, wearing wooden sandles with it. She was speaking for a very big microphone, causing the residents to cover their ears in the process. \"Did you come here for an anti-growth spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes, yes I did\", the gargantuan Setsuna told the girl, who didn't look the least bit scared of the tall girl. \"Can I please have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll let you have it\", the girl snickered, running up to Setsuna and pouring some rainbow-colored liquid on her right shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's she doing, thought Setsuna to herself. Just then, she felt the town growing in size. It seemed to be a shrinking spell after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you shrinking me?\" Setsuna asked the girl, confused and a little worried as she shrank down from 5000 feet to 4600.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we known you're with THEM, those backwards people from the hut village a hundred miles or so from here\", the girl explained. \"And we're going to cut you down to size, and the rest of your town, once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't understand\", Setsuna asked, confused and a little worried as she now shrank down to 4300 feet tall. \"Weren't you the ones who made those villagers grow in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is THAT what they told you? Then they told you lies\", the girl sighed. \"That tribe has a habit of taking normal-sized people and making them grow big for their own amusement, claiming them to be 'heroes' they need help from. They're typically cute, young females lured out for the older, perverted men to gawk at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how DID they grow in the first place?\" wondered a now 3900-foot tall Setsuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long ago, there was a man and his wife in a valley not too far from here. They were a simple couple, living in luxury together in the wilderness. But the animals they encountered were very big...I'm talking 50-foot rats here! Eventually the man found the source of the growth and tried it on his wife. He was amazed at the results, as well as tantalized. He himself grew shortly after. But they got lonely by themselves, so they started getting other people to join them and they made a village. The couple themselves later had a baby, who started off human sized but grew to be over 700 feet tall the day she turned fifteen! Although the source of the growing liquid is long gone, relatives of that couple still have the power to make others grow..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the girl who made me grow was...\" questioned Setsuna, now down to 2900 fetet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, giant girl! She was a descendant of those people. Every now and again they tried, by force of their huge size, to take our shrinking fountain away from us. And every time they've failed, because we blast them with a liquid that causes them to shrink to the size of bugs. Eventually they started recruiting others to grow and use them as bait, one day attempting to get the shrink formula, but to no avail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why won't you give it to them?\" asked Setsuna, now down to 2700 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they never politely asked\", the girl huffed. Setsuna just gasped in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but I WAS going to politely ask\", the flustered girl told her, now down to 2500 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, the shrinking I hit you with stops at a certain point. It can only shrink someone to 1/200 the height they were hit with. Which means if I was 5,000 feet before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be about 25 feet when this is done. But to show you my regards, I'll give you the shrinking potion for the entire village IF you can beat me in a match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm so much taller than you. It wouldn't be fair\", pointed out Setsuna, now 2200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that detail\", the girl snickered. \"Our village is used to dealing with giants. We've slain people over 100 feet tall and came out on top. The village around here is protected by giant mountains, so any attackers MUST come in here if they want to fight us. And then we shrink them down to normal humans, then again to bugs, then dispose of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cruel!\" an angered Setsuna cried, now 1900 feet tall. \"Have you no respect for people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respect? They're greedy cowards who used size to intimidate us. I care not for 'respect' or 'fairness'. Our village has been destroyed at least 7 or 8 times by giant attacks since I was born 15 years ago. My own grandfather was squashed to death by a giant woman's breasts. Shrinking them is the least we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel that way, then I will stop your shrinking ways!\" an angered Setsuna cried out to the whole town, now 1500 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, big girl on campus. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Setsuna\", she replied straight-forward, now 1300 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Amin\", the blonde-haired girl. \"And we shall fight as soon as you finish shrinking to 25 feet. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", Setsuna sadly replied, now 1000 feet tall and worried about what will happen if she fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(no chapter choice, proceed to the next part)</span></div></div>",

Within seconds Setsuna shrank in height in spurts of 20 feet every few seconds, until she was down to 10 feet. Setsuna quickly put her teacher safely onthe ground around the 90 feet shrinking point, feeling relieved she was getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the spell was not over when Setsuna shrank down to a mini-giantess size of 10 feet. The girl continued to shrink ever still, down even below her regular height. Negi watched as his student, who minutes ago was a 150-foot tall giantess, was now barely 10 inches tall. Negi picked up the tiny Setsuna and ran back to his dorm in Mahora Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes Negi, short of breath, ran like a shot into the dorm room and closed it. Although Asuna was not there (she was busy with her paper route), Konoka was, and she noticed Negi from her bed, only now starting to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Negi-kun\", she smiled to her teacher as she yawned and sat up on her bed, stretching her arm. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Setsuna-san...she shrank\", a worried Negi told Konoka, who was baffled by her teacher's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, I know you can't make people shrink\", she giggled. \"Are you sure you're not confusing her for the little Setsun she creates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does THIS look like a doll to you?\" he asked his student, holdin up a very tiny Setsuna in his arms, who was petrified at the height of Konoka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-o-o-o-o-ojou-s-s-sama...\" Setsuna tried to tell her friend, only to be taken by force from Negi into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so adorable, Set-chan\", Konoka smiled and grinned. \"Really, really, really cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ojo-sama, you're making me dizzy\", a nauseous Setsuna told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\", a saddened Konoka told her 10-inch friend as she placed Setsuna on her bed. \"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Negi-sensei made me grow, then I grew REALLY big, then I shrank down to this size. I don't know what's going on, but there's something afoot. I think someone on this campus is shrinking people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, Set-chan\", Konoka assured her friend. \"This will probably ware really soo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Konoka, too, felt warm, causing Negi and Setsuna to shout \"Uh-oh!!\" in unison. Within seconds Konoka was a little more than 10 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right\", Konoka smiled to her friend. \"But what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to inform the school!\" Negi said outloud. \"Before every girl in Mahora Academy shrinks!\" Negi decided to first tell about this...</span></div></div>",

As they were going to search for them, both Setsuna and Negi heard someone shouting their teacher's name. It was none other then Asuna and Konoka themselves, and from it looked like Asuna was mad and Konoka had a look of worry and excitement at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neeeegggiii!\" Asuna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to the point where Negi were floating. Konoka looked around to see if Setsuna was around. Asuna was yelling at him about how he stole something from their room, then she heard Konoka saying \"Wow!\" Asuna then looked at her roommate, and when she saw her looking up, she looked up as well to find the giantess Setsuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Setsuna-san! What happened?\" Asuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I asked sensei to use a growth spell on me\", Setsuna said with a red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi! You better have a good explanation for this!\" Asuna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came down to explain to her but she put knuckles around his head and started to twirl it. It gave him a good deal of pain until Setsuna stopped her from doing by telling her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!!\" Setsuna shouted. \"I asked for it, so don't blame him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna stopped as she started to calm down. She wanted to know why Setsuna, a good middle schooler and a great swordsmen, wanted to become a giantess. She pointed and asked her this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Tell me why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked Negi-sensei because I was..a little shorter then Ojo-sama, and I wanted to become bigger to protect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonoka was surprised to hear that. Even though she knew that she wanted to protect her, she had asked Negi to grow to boost her protection towards herself. Konoka came next to Setsuna's knee and patted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Secchan...I thank you for such grateful thoughts\", Konoka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ojo-sama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I liked the height you were before you became big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna's heart felt a slight pain, and little tears came out. Negi and Asuna dodged the tears as she wiped the tears off with her handkerchief. But before she could even say something, she felt pain from her stomach and now became 70 foot tall. Asuna's mouth opened with disbelief and looked at negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi! don't you know how to revert this spell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I don't really know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna grabbed Negi's collar and started to shake him, but Konoka broke the two up. Asuna was pissed because not only was Setsuna getting bigger, but Negi didn't know a revert spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, we can find a way to get Setsuna-san back to her original height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually..\" Konoka mumbled.

The blonde-haired teacher of all things magical of Negi's, Evangeline McDowell stumbled on Negi's growth spell seconds before he was ready to cast it. The boy crept back a little when he finally noticed her coming up from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stupid thing are you doing now?\" she asked him, an annoyed grimace on her face. \"I hope you're not forgetting your training with me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I didn't, Master!\", Negi quickly replied, hiding the circle in the dirt with his feet. Evangeline, however, just walked around him, wondering why he was playing in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the circle, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up to something. Spill it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Negi explained to his master everything he had learned recently about the growth spell he found out. The explanation proved pointless, though, as Evangeline herself had tried the spell decades ago, only to find it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work\", she told him point blank. \"If <i>I</i> couldn't use it successfully, what makes you think you can? Even your father couldn't use it correctly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I won't know until I try now, will I?\" Negi asked her with a smile on his face. He then began the spell like he had planned to do so earlier, holding up his staff as he preformed the incantation of \"Incresco Tantus!\" All through it all Evangeline simply looked bored, yawning at the sight before her. She would've left right then and there if she didn't see a giant rock appear out of nowhere in front of Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...!?\" the girl gasped at the sight of the 10 foot tall rock. \"So it <i>does</i> work!\" She then pointed at Negi, explaining to him, \"You're going to try that spell on me next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Master! I don't know of a reversal spell....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reversal spell!? Why would I not want to be bigger?!\" she laughed at the child teacher, poking him on the head with her fingers. \"Now just repeat what you did earlier, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-okay, Master...Just stand in the spot the rock was at earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline complied and waited for the boy to perform the spell once again. It worked perfectly, and the once short vampire could feel her body growing, laughing manically as her body pulsated bit by bit with growth. It didn't last very long, though, as the growth seemed to stop at 20 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sucks\", Evangeline sighed, hoping to grow bigger from the spell. \"Still, this is definitely an improvement!\" She then picked up the frightened Negi below her and stared at him with lowered eyebrows, smiling a disturbing smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you thought my training was tough before...\" she teased the boy, slowly putting on the ground as she turned around in a full circle to show off her new size to Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you can't possibly me to battle you at my current size! I have a hard time training with at your normal size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\", the mini-giantess Evangeline admitted. \"So.....\"</span></div></div>",

Evangeline was throwing back no punches, and was once hard when he was taller than her was significantly more difficult when she was 4 times his size. He had to admit, though, that he was feeling more pumped up from his training than he ever had before. Even Evangeline had to admit that his progress was faster than it used to be, and after a few hours of training she decided to settle down in her beach resort in her pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBozu, get me something to drink!\u201d the giantess vampire demanded from her pupil, who ran like a shot to do so. He quickly returned with some lemonade, but the glass was much too small for her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it bigger!\u201d she told Negi, who whimpered at the command he was given. A shot of Evangeline\u2019s face snapped him out of it, though, and quickly he cast another growth spell to make the glass several times its original size. Evangeline then picked it up and drank from it, placing it on the ground next to her pupil afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-M-Master, I\u2019m very tired. Can I take a rest now?\u201d Negi requested of his magic teacher, sweat running down his face, and bruises over many parts of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but get treated by Chachamaru first. I don\u2019t want to hear you whining a few hours from now how you\u2019re still sore\u201d, she replied, turning away from the boy as she proceeded to take a snooze herself. Negi bowed his head in reply and ran off to get healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi and Chachamaru talked for a fairly long time as he explained about what happened that day that turned the once-short Evangeline into a towering giantess, which even the robot girl herself had a hard time believing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d she politely asked her teacher as she wrapped up his foot in bandages. \u201cYour training will only get much tougher from here, and what if she grows any bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid of that quite a bit. Master is quite strong as is..and today\u2019s training was the hardest I\u2019ve had with her in months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the results are definitely showing, Negi-sensei. I haven\u2019t see you put up a fight like that in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Chachamaru-san. But I wonder if it\u2019s worth it if I need this much help after each fight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegi-kun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi and Chachamaru were confused by what they just heard. Was someone watching them? A closer look revealed that it was Konoka, running ahead of her best friend Asuna. The two seemed to be holding some sort of food in their hands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKonoka-san? Asuna-san? What are you two doing here?\u201d wondered Negi as Konoka ran him to the boy and handed him a sandwich in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe figured you\u2019d be here training with Eva-chan when we didn\u2019t find you when we woke up\u201d, explained Asuna. \u201cAnything new?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi turned ghost white when Asuna asked him this. Chachamaru began to respond, but Negi whispered to her to keep it a secret through her left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegiiiiiii\u201d, an annoyed Asuna groaned. \u201cSomething happened and you won\u2019t tell us, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.I might\u2019ve made Master\u2026.b-b-bigger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d screamed both Asuna and Konoka as they ran off to find Evangeline. They did eventually find her asleep on a chair, coming back with shocked looks on both of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegi-bozu, explain yourself! Now!!\u201d Asuna demanded, grabbing Negi by his shirt collar. He did as he was told, explaining to both her and Konoka about the growth spell he casted earlier, forced by Evangeline to try it on her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it actually DID work?\u201d Asuna asked, looking confused. \u201cI thought you were reading a children\u2019s book or something last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it did work, and it was <i>real</i>!\u201d defended Negi. \u201cAnnnnnnd I have no clue how to reverse it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that could be a problem\u201d, added Asuna, looking stressed. \u201cKnowing Eva-chan, she could attack the campus Godzilla style if she got any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three students and their teacher talked about Evangeline\u2019s recent growth, the giantess herself woke up and looked down at her fellow, um, \u201cacquaintances\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t this ironic?!\u201d Evangeline cackled to herself as she picked up both Asuna and Konoka, one in each hand. \u201cAfter all these months of mocking my height, and here I am much taller than you girls will ever amount to be.\u201d She then squeezed Asuna even harder in her hand, watching her moan a little as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, let Asuna-san and Konoka-san down now!\u201d Negi requested of the giantess vampire. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not hurting me, Negi-kun\u201d, Konoka told her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she <i>is</i> hurting me\u201d, Asuna snapped, biting the vampire\u2019s arm with her teeth. Evangeline let go of her grasp on her, watching her fall back to the ground unharmed. She then made a raspberry at the vampire, watching her get enraged as she threw Konoka back at her (with Negi slowly stopping her fall with his magic).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019m going to make you pay for hurting Konoka!\u201d yelled Asuna, unleashing her sword via her Pactio  card. \u201cLet\u2019s dance, brat! 5 feet tall or 20, it doesn\u2019t matter to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsuna-san, calm down!\u201d Negi pleaded with his student. But he doubted it would work right now to ask her to stop\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He nodded in reply, and soon enough she stepped back a few steps as her teacher prepared the spell. He lifted his staff in front of him, and a bright light was beginning to shine from his staff as he shouted the incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncresco Tantus!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that came a bright blue light. However, it wasn\u2019t aiming for the pebble directly underneath Negi\u2019s feet: somehow the projectile went backwards and hit Chachamaru instead! Slowly she felt her body tingling and growing before her, feeling her very body stretching quickly in various directions. First her legs grew, then her arms, hands, feet, stomach, and finally her hair and head. At the end the android student of his had grown to become a towering 90 feet tall giantess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensei, what just happened!?\u201d a worried, embarrassed Chachamaru asked her teacher, standing on her knees and covering her face in her hands in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow you got hit by the spell\u201d, Negi told her, looking equally as worried. \u201cLet\u2019s go see if Evangeline-san can fix this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want her to find out! I don\u2019t want to worry her!\u201d Chachamaru responded hastily. \u201cAnd remember, sensei. If I recall, if anyone finds out about your magic abilities, you will be stripped of your powers and be turned into an ermine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but sometimes you have no choice but to ask for help\u201d, Negi tried to comfort Chachamaru, padding her right foot, only to be lifted up by the robot giantess and kissed by her on his left face cheek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, sensei.

This time, she was now 150 feet tall, and she was a little embarrassed but continued to fly. She reached the destination and landed on the ground, letting Negi down.

Eva listened to him, and despite being amazed by this, Negi told her that he needed her help, and she thought for few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is one reverting spell I know...but I have to dig deep to remember that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master!\" both Negi and Chachamaru reply..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished their sentence, Chachamaru now shot up to 300 feet tall. Evangeline was starting to feel a little worried about her robot disciple, so she turned around as she started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to remember it, so until further notice,  do whatever you want. There''s no training today.\", Evangeline told Negi and Chachamaru. She went back in to figure out the way to cast the revert spell. Negi was now thinking of what should he and Chachamaru could do while Eva was collecting the information.</span></div></div>",

She had all her gear, provisions, and and strange tasting juice boxes packed into an extremely small back pack. As she walked outside she saw her teacher, Negi, standing with his staff in his hands. \"Incresco Tantus!\" she heard him yell. A flash of blue light launched off his staff and struck her full force in the face. The impact caused her to fall to the ground immediately. She saw (or rather, felt) Negi running towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yue-san! Are you alright?!\" he squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Y-yes, Negi-sensei, I-I'm fine\", she said as she stood up, clutching her face. She felt herself sway as if she was a reed in a river. She fell back down flat on her butt and rubbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird. I feel off-balance for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Yue-san, could you open your eyes please?\" Negi whispered. As she removed her hand she saw something that made her rub her eyes in shock; her teacher was floating on his staff above her gigantic right knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The growth spell seems to have worked, though this isn't exactly how I planned. It was supposed to hit a rock and-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi was soon silenced by a finger roughly the size of his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a good idea for us to talk about that kind of stuff here. Even if it is really early in the morning, we should find a more secluded spot to talk about what happened\", Yue whispered as softly as she could to Negi. He simply nodded and hopped onto her ready palm. She stayed low and under the trees as much as her much bigger body would allow. As soon as they found a place to talk she sat with her back against a tree and looked straight at her teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sensei. What happened?\" asked the 60 meter tall giantess Yue. \"Why am I so big??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said, it was a growth spell. I don't know why it missed the rock and hit you, but it did for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A growth spell, huh? Wait a second..you do know how to fix this, right?\" Yue asked, looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. The truth is...n-no. I'm sorry, but I only know how to make things grow, not shrink them. It may take a while before I can probably fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I'm going to miss the library expedition today! This is the WORST!\" she pouted. It was the first time Negi had seen her be so emotional about something without crying. This sight was not to last, however; shortly after a torrent of tears flowed over the boy's body, drenching him from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't cry, Yue-san. It's my fault! And as your teacher, I'm making it my responsibility to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi looked quite confident in himself as he proceeded to take out his staff once again and make a noticeably bigger circle in the dirty around his giantess student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try my best at this and try to see if this spell will reverse itself. Here goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei..\" Yue said between sniffles. \"B-Be careful..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Yue get smaller, or were her problems just about to get even bigger?</span></div></div>",

The bi-speckled student was holding a sketchbook in her left hand and a pen in her left pocket. She was on her way to sit outside Mahora Academy to draw when she noticed Negi and his staff, a sight which quickly caught her eye. As she walked ever closer to her teacher, she became increasingly inquisitive of what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Performing a magical spell, eh, Negi-kun?\" smiled a curious Haruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah\", he shyly replied, holding his staff behind his back. Haruna then looked right below her teacher and saw a dirt circle with a pebble almost in the dead center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. A growth spell?\" Haruna asked her teacher, again smiling. Negi nodded his head up and down in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why waste that on this rock?\" Haruna asked, kicking the rock with her foot. \"Why don't you try it on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I c-c-couldn't do that!\" a nervous Negi told Haruna. \"I don't even know a way to reverse it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Negi-kun. I'm not worried\", Haruna smiled, putting down her sketchbook on the ground and proceeding to step in the circle in the dirt. \"I always wanted to be big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  the inquisitive Negi asked his student. \"I never heard that from Nodoka-san or Yue-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's kind of a guilty pleasure secret of mine. When I was little, I LOVED Ultraman. My father and I used to watch it all the time right until I enrolled in this school a year or so back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched it that long? Negi thought to himself, looking a little confused. While he had never watched Ultraman back in England, he had heard of it and read articles on it since he started teaching in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you always wanted to be a super heroine of sorts, Haruna-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I just wanted to be big, Negi-kun. Well, what are you waiting for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi proceeded to turn his head in all directions before he answered that question, making sure no one was around to see him or Haruna. The coast seemed to be clear, so the nervous teacher started to begin the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi proceeded to lift his staff with both of his hands, holding it in front of him while also pointing at Haruna. The circle in the dirt then began to glow, and Haruna felt the glow  while standing on top of it. Then Negi began to chant the incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a manner of seconds the spell began to take effect, and Haruna looked really excited during it all. Everything on the girl's body, from the tips of her hair to ever her glasses, began to grow in bits until Haruna grew to a height of 25 feet. After her growth finished the light, as well as the circle in the dirt, both disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", Haruna exclaimed, looking around her much smaller surroundings. Viewpoints she normally would only be able to see from the third or fourth floor of the school building were visible to her in front of her very eyes, and she couldn't but think of how cool it all was. Then Haruna proceeded to look down at her teacher, who barely looked 10 or so inches tall at her newfound height. Haruna giggled at the sight of the smaller Negi, proceeding to sit down on her knees to see him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really worked\", Haruna told her teacher, her eyes gleaming. \"And it's even cooler than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe to you, but this is making me nervous\", Negi panicked, his face deep red from Haruna zooming her face up to the boy. She purposely then stuck her face closer to him until the teacher was right next to her lips, but all she did then was smile with her teeth showing when that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we let Nodoka and Yue join in the fun?\" Haruna asked her \"small\" teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", Negi replied. \"Maybe it would be better if only you and me knew about this? You know, a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..Negi-kun, you may be right\", pondered Haruna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you won't get Nodoka-san and Yue-san involved?\" asked a desperate Negi to his giantess student.</span></div></div>",

The \"kid\" in reference is actually her teacher, Negi Springfield, a 10-year old boy from England who's only entagled the teenage girl's life since he made his teaching debut. All Chisame wanted was a normal junior high school life, but with the likes of vampires, robots, time-travelers, ninjas, martial artists, and a whole assortment of magic users amongst her presence, her junior high life was anything but normal. And now that she found her teacher can use magic, it's only complicated things further for the bispeckled youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well today's different\", she smiled smugly to herself. \"Today's Sunday, and I'm going to spend in inside, away from Harry Potter and his magical misfit harem.\" But just as she went into the fridge to make herself some breakfast, Chisame realized she forgot to buy food recently! Too hungry to wait until lunch, she decided to make a quick trip back and forth to a local grocery store, hoping not to be seen. To make sure of this she decided to wear a hat to cover up her hair, as well as wear dark glasses over her regular ones to cover her eyes. She REALLY didn't want to be seen on her only day off of the week...especially by her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to last, though. Despite her best intentions, Chisame was quickly spotted by Negi, who as standing not too far fro mthe school gates. \"Good morning, Chiu-san!\", he smiled to his student, referring to her by her online alias, in which she was one of the most adored idols on the Internet. Chisame still tried to ignore him, but found herslf unable to ignore him. He had made a circle in the dirt right next to him, which kind of intriqued Chisame. Reluctantly she walked up to her teacher, took off her disguise, and stared at the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the dirt circle?\" Chisame bluntly asked Negi, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm trying to cast a rare spell\", Negi replied happily. \"A growth spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\", Chisame said surprised. \"No way can a twerp like you know a spell like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was about to test it on this pebble here\", the saddened teacher tried to tell his student. \"You don't have to stay if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right: Chisame DIDN'T want to stay. She simply wanted food in her belly. Still, what harm could it do to watch him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I have free time right now, sensei. Fire away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\", Negi said, smiling once again. He grabbed the staff, lifted it in the air, and began to chant the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, a light blue flash of light came from the sraff. However, instead of hitting the intended pebble in the center of the dirt circle, the light changed its course. It aimed straight at Chisame! It wasn't too long until she felt a pulsing sensation all across her body. Chisame quickly saw herself towering over her child teacher even more than before. In just a few moments Chisame had grown to 25 feet tall! Instead of scared of her new surroundings, though, she was angry. She grabbed Negi with her left hand, lifting him high above the ground to her own eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth have you done to me!?\" asked a very annoyed Chisame. \"You better fix this right now!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but.....I don't know a shrink spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's okay! I found this spell in the underground library of the school! Surely there's a book there that can reverse it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There better be\", said a still annoyed Chisame, finally putting her teacher back on the ground. \"And I'm coming with you to find it!\" Maybe my increased height might be of aid to this shrimp, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do Negi and Chisame leave right away, or not?</span></div></div>",

Especially since now she was 5 times her original height, her appetite, to follow suit, was also several times bigger. The girl quickly took Negi and ran from the school grounds. After a couple of minutes of running, the two reached a clearing away from the academy and into a forest area. There the tired Chisame sat on the ground, leaning her body against a giant tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, I hate to ask of you this, but do you happen to have food on you?\", Chisame asked her teacher. \"I didn't eat breaskfast this morning, and I'm worried that I won't be able to travel without some nourishment.\" To her surprise Negi had, indeed, food on him. Konoka made him a nice lunch for later the previous night, and the child teacher more than happily gave it to her student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", Chisame told her teacher as she quickly ate the food in only two bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel better now, Chisame-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\", she replied, now standing up. \"It wasn't as much as I hoped, but at least I have energy again. Let's go!\" Chisame then took Negi and plced him on her left shoulder, and the two decided to sneak back into Mahora Academy and to the library. But a 25-foot tall girl would cause much pandemonium in the school...Chisame would need a disguise. What should it be?</span></div></div>",

I hope you have a plan, sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\", Negi smiled, and he ran back to the school as Chisame continued to stand under a tree, albeit in a lower position this time to not bump her head. All the while Chisame decided to take a nap, as she was tired from staying up all night on the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi soon enough arrived back to Chisame, showing off many a giant sheet, ones even big enough to cover Chisame, who in her sleep grew again, this time to 40 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we put these on just right, we could say you're a statue or something\", Negi explained to his student, who quickly put on the blankets over her body, thankful that she hadn't grown enough yet to the point where she couldn't put them on her without feeling small or tight. A few moments later Chisame had finished putting on the sheets, which were all the same color: blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What AM I supposed to be?\" Chisame asked her teacher, feeling silly in the blue blankets on her. She wished she had a mirror to see how ridiculous she was, walking around in blue sheets like a child wrapped around his blanket in a cold winter day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you're SUPPOSED to be....well, I'm not quite sure\", Negi nerviously told his student, who then slapped her forehead in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, grab my clothing utensils, make them grow, and come back here with them ASAP!

Whiler Chisame was definitely right in one way (she DID shrink), what she didn't know was how small she actually shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chisame finally got out, she wondered why the grass looked so tall next to her for a few seconds before coming to the conclusion that she shrank. The tree she previously banged her head on before looked postively gigantic now, taller than any building or tree she had previously seen in her life. Although glad her clothes shrank with her (even her glasses), Chisame was, unsurprisingly, unhappy. However, instead of cowering at her now bigger environment, Chisame was simply annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Negi had finally come back with the supplies when he saw the blue sheets from earlier. The child teacher was confused as to why they were on the ground, and as Negi dug through them, he heard a thunderous \"BOO!\" from behind him, which caused to scream and fall on his butt. Seems that Chisame had hid herself in the curtains and scared Negi from behind him. Chisame snickered a little at Negi's fall, the first time she smiled all day since he gave her food earlier that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chisame-san! You're...you're...\" a gasping Negi blurted out. \"You're so small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be nice for you to not have to look upwards to talk to one of your students for once\", sarcastically remarked Chisame. Negi was simply fascinated by his younger student's size, and he put his left hand next to Chisame's body, noticing that the girl was barely twice the size of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DO have my supplies, right?\" asked Chisame to her teacher, stil lin a little bit of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah\", he replied, placing all of Chisame's sweing utensils and pieces of fabric on the ground. \"So what are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it might be difficult, but I'm going to try to make something that makes me look like a doll so we can get in without suspicion\", Chisame explained to her teacher as she pounted her finger to her school uniform, already beginning to take out her supplies and make something. \"Maybe a long-sized dress or some kind of casual clothing or something. I haven't decided yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't need help, Chisame-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....maybe a little\", she shlyl blurted out. \"I'm too small to cut anything properly, so you must be help me out and listen to EXACTLY what I say.

As Negi waited for a reply from a question he had asked her, he noticed that she was no longer in his line of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chisame-san...\" Negi said looking at his shoulder. He saw, or rather barely saw an even tinier Chisame standing on his shoulder. \"Chisame you're-you're even smaller than before.\" He could see her jaw move in reply but heard no sound. \"I can't hear you. Please talk louder.\" He saw her motioning something. She pointed to her head over and over. \"You want me to poke your head?\" Negi asked confused. After a quick smack to the face with her little hands Negi looked at her again. He realized she was pointing not at her head but at her ear. Negi offered his palm and she stepped on before he raised it to his own ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, sensei. For a teacher you're pretty stupid\", came Chisame's voice ringing in his ear channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chisame-san this might be even worse than we thought\", Negi said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And how can anything be WORSE THAN THIS!!?\" Chisame screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this continues you'll shrink down to a subatomic level and continue shrinking until you're absorbed by an atom\", Negi said putting his fore fingers together over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?! NEGI START RUNNING!!! We need to get to the library NOW!\" Chisame shouted as Negi winced in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", he said as he began to sprint. They soon reached Library Island. Luckily, Chisame had remained the same size the entire time, but Negi was getting worried. They found Nodoka and Yue about to begin their decent into the massive building. Negi shouted to the two, \"Yue-san! Nodoka-san! Wait up!\" They turned around to see him running toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei?\" they both said as he crashed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph! Sorry about that. It's just that, well we have a problem here\", Negi said as he stood up, Chisame jumping onto his shoulder .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we do!\" a barely audible voice yelled up at him. It was Yue, now about five centimeters tall, with a slightly luckier Nodoka, who was standing at about twelve centimeters, crouching next to her. The smallest of all three, Chisame, hopped down Negi's shoulder and down next to the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\", Negi said with a groan. \"It appears that I have the Midas touch. Only instead of gold, you all shrank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing we can about that but to maybe get you some mittens\", Yue said, speaking for Chisame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the spell is already invoked, so I can still pick you guys up\", he said as then all stepped onto his palm. \"Now we have to go in and find a way to get you all back to normal.\" Negi walked into the opening with his friends on his shoulders. He comes to a forked pathway about twenty meters in. \"Which way?\" Negi asked his students, unsure themselves of whichway to go. Seeing two signs on the wall, Negi waked up to them and read them aloud. \"The Hall of Magi and the Hall of Spells and Charms. Which way?\"</span></div></div>",

Pages upon pages of the spell book were checked fully by his adrenaline widened eyes. He was pacing back and forth frantically as he read, making sure to get through every page of the writing so as to not mess his students' size up even more. When he found the page, he nodded to himself before setting his students down in front of him. Quickly he picked up a sharp rock and scratched a crude magic circle on the tile around them. After careful examination of the spell, he raised his staff and recited, \"Refero Ad Normalis!\"(Latin for 'Return to normal.')<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi then watched as his students grew. Sweat drops of nervousness ran down his nervous face. To his delight, though, all three of his students returned to their exact sizes. He wiped what seemed like a gallon of sweat off his brow and, at the same time, touched Nodoka's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\", he meekly said as the shrinking process began again. He quickly recited the same spell and Nodoka returned to her normal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad. Anyone I touch gets shrunk\", he grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sensei. There has to be a book here somewhere that can tell us how to remove a curse\", Yue comforted Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be right, Yue-san. There are a lo~~t of books here.\" As Nodoka and Yue started to check out some books, one girl was heading towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck finding the right one, sensei,\" Chisame unemotionally told her teacher as she walked out. Negi made no attempt to stop her, thinking he didn't deserve for anyone in the room to help him. Before leaving completely, though, Chisame stopped at the end of the door and turned around, asking her teacher \"Well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" a teary eyed Negi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I mean this is usually the time when someone says 'Don't go!' to the person that is leaving.\" Aggravated as ever, Chisame marched up to Negi and looked him straight in the eyes. \"Grr... Fine I'll stay\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Chisame-san. You should go back to the dorms...in fact, all of you should. I can fix this by myself\", Negi explained to his student. It fell on deaf ears, though, as all three girls ignored him at that point as they searched through different tomes, volumes of spells, and different colored charms for a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei! Negi-sensei! I found something\", Nodoka said, reading excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the other three blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that the place that we should have gone to fix all of us was not here. But the Hall of Magi!\" Nodoka told the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Negi asked. \"Why there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that there's a strange aura emitted there. And it goes on to say that anyone with a pure heart and great desire for good shall enter said aura unscathed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Unscathed'. What does it mean by that, I wonder? Whatever. It's getting quite late and we have school tomorrow. If it's the quickest way to end this, THEN LET'S GO!\" Negi shouted to his students, running out of the area they were previously in. All four left the Hall and ran back to the fork. Unfortunately, the fork that was there before was not the same. This time the corridor was facing completely different directions, and new signs were now inscribed on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter there and you shall die,<br>\r\nEnter here and you shall fly. <br>\r\nFlying up in skies above, <br>\r\nfloating upon clouds of love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter here and all shall flourish, <br>\r\nEnter and there and none shall nourish, <br>\r\nThe power of ones will of mind, <br>\r\nThe power here is pure you'll find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gre~~at\", Chisame said sarcastically. \"They both say we'll die if we go in the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which one, Negi-sensei?\" Yue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...power of mind or love of the heart\", Negi pondered to himself. Just then, Nodoka stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...sensei. I think I know the answer\", she said to her teacher as she walked a bit in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Nodoka-san. Which way?\" Negi asked his pupil, who continued forward to the wall and pushed the brick in between the two signs. Almost immediately a door-sized section of the wall parted, leaving the other three in the group looking slack jawed at Nodoka. She blushed as Negi asked, \"How-how did you know to do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both heart and mind are needed to be a pure person, not one or the other\", she answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Nodoka!\" Yue cheered as she hugged her friend. Again the girl blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we waiting for? Let's hurry this up! I haven't had much food today!\" yelled Chisame. The four all began to sprint down the hallway and into the darkness. As they did a sudden light spread across all of them. However, Negi began to feel a tingling feeling similar to that of growing. He was then raised into the air as more and more rays of light focused on him. His body began to glow, and as soon as it began it stopped. He reached forward and touched Chisame's arm. Nothing happened. He poked her a couple of times more. Again, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Negi cheered as Yue and Nodoka hugged their teacher, happy that he was normal again. \"The curse has been LIFTED!!\" The four then all retraced their steps and found that the fork in the hallway was normal once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all outside of Library Island, Negi and his students all parted their individual ways. Some were leaving to go to sleep, some going to read, and some going on the Internet until four a.m. the next night. As for Negi himself, he returned to his dorm, said hello to Asuna and Konoka, and laid down on his bed like a tree falling down after being cut by a lumberjack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rough day, Negi?\" Asuna asked the exhausted boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have NO idea\", Negi chuckled to himself.</span></div></div>",

Ever since child teacher Negi came to her school, Ayaka has been adoring and admiring the 10 year-old teacher, much to the chagrin of Asuna, her longtime rival and on-and-off friend. Her being the student representative, though, means she gets to see Negi quite a bit. Though sometimes Ayaka wondered to herself: did she actually like Negi, or does he merely remind her of the little brother she never had (he died before birth)? Ayaka tries to not think of that often, but one thing she knew for sure: she wanted to make Negi (and in the process, herself) happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Sunday morning Ayaka was walking around the school, admiring the beautiful gardens and feeling the cool summer wind blowing in her long, blonde hair. She gave a happy sigh as she stood there and felt the breeze, thankful for the one day a week where she didn't have to worry about homework or getting things prepared for class. Shortly into her walk, though, she saw a familiar person not too far from the school garden: it was Negi! He seemed to be making a circle in the dirt with a staff, placing a little pebble in the center. Ayaka had to know what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ayaka walked...er, ran, up to Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Negi-sensei!\", she smiled as she came up to the boy, hugging him from his backside. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm f-f-fine, Ayaka-san\", Negi replied, feeling a little dizzy from the sudden impact and for Ayaka's chest pressing on his back. \"Nice to see you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to, sensei?\" Ayaka asked, letting the child teacher go from her grasp. \"It looks like one of those 'magic circles' that conjures up demons from one of those horror movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing like that\", Negi assured his student. \"But...I don't know if I can clearly tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei!\", Ayaka pouted, placing her head next to his. \"I'm the Class Rep\", she continued, this time looking much happier, rubbing Negi's head with her right hand. \"You can tell me anything. I promise I won't tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay...\", Negi said reluctantly, whispering to Ayaka in her left ear that he was creating a magic circle to make an object in the dirt grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Ayaka exclaimed, once again rubbing Negi's head. \"You have a cute, childish side in addition to being mature and sophisticated. You're so great, Negi-sensei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's the truth!\", Negi whimpered. \"I'll even show you. Just stand back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyaka did what Negi was told. Regardless of whether or not he was telling the truth, she was happy to see the confident look he got on his face whenever he worked hard at something. Negi then proceeded to lift up his staff in front of him, and recant the magic works:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, a blinding, light blue light came from his staff. However, the light bounced off a nearby tree, not only missing the pebble in the dirt, but it collided with a different target: Ayaka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO!!\" she and Negi screamed at the same time, worried by whatever circumstances had just happened. By the time the flash of light was gone, Negi saw a very big sight: a 30-foot tall Ayaka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why is everything so tiny?\" was Ayaka's first words after the growth finished. The newly born giantess then looked below her field of vision and saw a tiny boy where her teacher once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, you're so cuuuuute doll-sized!\" Ayaka squealed in delight as she picked up her teacher and embrace him in her arms, his head resting on her new sized chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh... thought Negi to himself, hoping no one saw him. Especially Asuna.</span></div></div>",

Asuna froze in place as soon as she saw the giantess Ayaka hugging Negi in her arms. Her face then turned red, but not red from embarrassment: red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you up to, Negi?!\" she yelled at her teahcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not up to anything Asuna-san!\" Negi called down from the very tall Ayaka's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is Class Rep so huge, huh?!\" Asuna's face fumed with anger. \"Why exactly are you two up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was p-practicing a growth spell and I accidentally made Ayaka-san tall!\" Negi shouted, attempting to defend himself. \"It was an accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?

You're gonna traumatize him, you pedophile!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pedophile?!\" Ayaka yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh!! Please don't fight!\" Negi pleaded. \"If someone hears you they might get suspicious! And if they know I'm a mage in training, I'll get turned into an ermine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi's right\", Asuna sighed, \"We shouldn't yell...otherwise 'Sensei' might get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Asuna-san, that was actually very mature of you\", a shocked Ayaka said to Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks\", replied Asuna with a sarcastic tone. As she looked up to give Ayaka a glare, she noticed she was glowing again, similar to when Ayaka grew the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...uh, Negi-sensei, is a tingly feeling a supposed side effect of your spell?\" the worried Class Rep asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure\", Negi answered, \"Why do you ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel something at my feet\", said Ayaka as her feet started to expand along with her legs. Her legs then started to grow, making the 30 foot tall Ayaka 30 feet taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-bozu! Stop that!\" Asuna yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not doing this!\" Negi cried, \"I swear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyaka's torso and arms then expanded to fit her legs, making Ayaka become 80 feet tall. Her head, however, did not grow and looked disproportionate on her huge body. <br>\r\n\"Ha! Ha! Ha!\" Asuna laughed at the surreal sight of Ayaka's head on her giant body. <br>\r\nFinally, Ayaka's head grew to make her a perfect 90 foot tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna squish you for laughing at me!\" threatened the 90 foot tall Ayaka as she proceeded to stomp her feet on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try!\" Asuna remarked, positioning herself in a battle ready position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please!

But then she saw her teacher's worried face and soon unclenched them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three decided to get out of Mahora Academy at soon as possible. Under Negi's request, Ayaka grabbed hold of him and Asuna and put the two in her skirt pocket as the three made a dash away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly ARE we going, Negi-sensei?\" Ayaka asked, confused as to where she was going. She was simply running in a straight line away from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure\", a reluctant Negi told her. \"I've never used an enlarging spell before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll never be using it again, either\", an annoyed Asuna told her teacher, rubbing her left hand fairly violently onto his hair. \"This is why I can never leave you alone with magic, even for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just jealous because you wanted to be big, too\", taunted Ayaka, giggling to herself. Asuna turned her head away from Negi, pretending not to care, and also blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san, did you WANT to be big?\" Negi asked his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! What kind of a question is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you turned red in the face just now and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Negi! Sheesh, you don't have to analyze every single thing, you know. I'm already a decent height for a girl my age. There's no need for me to become some huge freak like Class Rep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it, Asuna-san! I can soon thrown you off of me as I can save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I'm so scared\", taunted Asuna, making a raspberry at Ayaka. She couldn't see it, mind you, but she knew she was given one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, you two!\" the worried Negi cried, swinging his arms left and right. \"Ayaka-san, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyaka then proceeded to stop and look around her environment. It seemed as if they ran into a temple none too far away from the school. It was old and torn-down, and it didn't look any bigger than a single floor, maybe two. The wood was old and discolored, and the flowers and shrubbery around it weren't doing too well, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, perhaps you can make this temple grow and we can hide here?\" Ayaka suggested to Negi, taking him and Asuna out of her pocket and placing them back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I can try\", Negi told his giantess student, trying his hardest not to look at her intimidating size in comparison to him. The boy then proceeded to take his staff and circle the whole shrine area, similar to how he made Ayaka grow. He then lifted the staff in his hands and began the incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi, Asuna, and Ayaka watched as the shrine glowed a light blue color, not unlike the color Ayaka glowed when she started to grow.

Evangeline-san might know something, but she would probably rather kill herself than tell us\", Negi replied. Asuna and Ayaka both sighed at the same time only to find Negi's eyes alight with triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Negi-sensei?\" Ayaka asked. \"Is it good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Very good news! Do either of you know where we are?!\" They both shook their heads. \"This is the Hall of Catacombs!\" Still ignorant as to what the good news is, Negi went on explaining. \"This is the home to the one and only Grimoire of Ages. A book of spell so ancient and powerful it is said that casting one healing spell would heal every wound on every person in a 100 kilometer radius!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is some impressive magic power\", Asuna gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", Negi nodded. \"And if we can get to that book..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it may have a spell to shrink me!\" finished Ayaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where is it? This place wasn't exactly all that big before you grew it\", Asuna stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san, it's called the Hall of Catacombs, and there are almost endless tunnels stretching under here. We just need to find a way to get to the caverns below us\", Negi explained to his student. Just as he finished explaining, a large crashing noise almost cut him off. The two normal-sized people turned to see their giant friend up to her neck in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She fell right through!\" Negi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class Rep, are you ok?\" Asuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine\", she said, struggling a little to get free. Just then a large crack opened in the floor right under Negi and Asuna and they both fell right through it. Luckily Ayaka's hand moved swiftly enough to help her friends escape a narrow death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what now?\" Ayaka asked her teacher.</span></div></div>",

I couldn't imagine crawling on my knees like a toddler the entire time\", Ayaka thanked her teacher, smiling at the thought of him being in her pant pocket. \"You really how the answer to every situation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be so modest, Ayaka-san! You're my student. Of course I would help you out\", Negi replied, gushing a little himself. Asuna just continued to stare into space as she tried to ignore Negi and Ayaka's chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk seemed to take longer than she thought, though. Ayaka found herself traveling down a straight corridor for at least 10 minutes without so much as a single turn or sight to be seen. She found this to be quite strange. But that wasn't all; the ceiling seemed to be getting higher and higher! Ayaka found herself glowing once again, but feeling a different effect than from when she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei!! Something's happening to me!\" the worried blonde began to whimper, watching as the more cramped friends of hers quickly got out of her pockets as fast as they could. It wasn't long before Ayaka found herself shrunk down to a mere 6 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class Rep!\" exclaimed Asuna, picking up the tiny Ayaka in a single hand. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, but now I'm too small to be of any use...\", Ayaka drooped in Negi's direction, feeling saddened by her recent development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Negi smiled back. \"You've done so much for us already, Ayaka-san! And I would be honored if you were to let <i>me</i> give you a ride in my pocket for your services.\" Asuna nodded in agreement as Negi reached out his hand to his little student, who climbed aboard it quickly. The giant Negi standing in front of her made her heart skip a beat. She was too happy for words to express the sight of what she was now seeing, and she continued to smile once Negi carefully put her in his left pant pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable in there, Ayaka-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!! You're ready to go, Negi-sensei!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Let's go, Asuna-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! We better hurry before something else happens to Class Rep's inconsistent height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something all three could agree on. The once giant shrine seemed to shrink by to its normal size as they kept running down the hall, though the trio's heights were unaffected during the whole process. Soon enough they came to their first set of tunnels in the Hall of Catacombs, wondering which way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go right\", Negi and Asuna said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let's go left!\" a conflicted Ayaka suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe the center sounds better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arguing continued until Asuna grabbed hold of Negi and scooped him in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! No more arguing! We'll determine this through rock-paper-scissors! Come on, Negi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Asuna-san. If we don't choose a path we'll never fix up Ayaka-san's height. If I win, we go left like she wants to. If you win, we'll go right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Negi. Okay, then....GO!\"</span></div></div>",

Makie, going on a morning walk to build up her leg muscles, saw Negi during her walk and screeched to a hault, proceeding right towards the boy until she was right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Negi-kuuuun\", smiled Makie. \"How are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well, Makie-san\", Negi smiled back. \"Were you on a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", Makie smiled back. \"But what's with the circle you made in the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi froze still when Makie asked him this. Unlike some of his other students, Makie didn't know that Negi used magic, and he certainly couldn't tell her, less he be turned into an ermine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...this? I'm just playing in the dirt\", Negi rushed, knowing full well that there was no way Makie would something that kind of crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you DO do kids stuff from time to time\", she simply smiled at her teacher. \"So what are you playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was \"pretending\" to make this pebble in this magic circle big...\" Negi said before being interrupted, with Makie putting herself in the center of the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neg-kun!\" Makie smiled. \"Could you make me \"bigger\"? *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm......\", Negi hesitated to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Negi-kun!\" Makie frowned, proceeding to get puppy-dog eyes. \"Pllllleeeaasssseeee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi thought once again of the consequences, but had a hard time resisting his student's puppy-dog eye look. He eventually caved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Makie-san\", Negi sighed. \"But promise me you won't tell anyone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it\", Makie nodded in reply. Negi then proceeded to lift up his staff vertically in his hands, facing in front of him, and proceeded to chant the incantation. As he chanted it the magic circle around Makie began to glow light blue, including Makie, and a light came from his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the light disappeared, as did the magic circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were some nice lights, Negi-kun\", Makie said in awe. \"Where did they come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...flashlights. That's it. Flashlights\", Negi responded nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Negi-kun, you're so cu...\" Makie felt a burning sensation in her stomach all of a sudden, falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel dizzy...\" Makie said in a daze, not noticing her increasingly larger body. First her legs grew, followed by her head, arms, hands, and finally her torso. At the end she stood up at a fairly tall height of 15 feet, about three times her normal size, a process that took about 3 minutes. Soon afterwards Makie proceeded to get up and saw Negi below, who barely came up to her skirt. Makie eyes opened wide, and Negi proceeded to cover his head for the fountain of tears that would no doubt come out. Instead, though, he was greeted with a<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE SOOOO CUTEE!!\" shouted Makie, hugging the much smaller Negi. \"This has got to be a dream now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A dream, Makie-san\", replied Negi, who fake laughed in reply. But what do I do with Makie-san now?</span></div></div>",

Negi then thought that if Makie should find out about his being a magician, he might be able to make a Pactio with her, if nothing else. After a few seconds of thought, Negi decided to tell Makie the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makie-san, this isn't a dream!\", Negi yelled lightly at the girl. \"I'm really a magician and you grew as the result of a magic spell I recently learned!\" Negi then thought that if there's a time his pink-haired student was going to cry, now would be the time she'd do it. However, much to his surprise STILL, Makie didn't see the slightest bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Negi-kun, you're such a fibber\", laughed Makie, proceeding once again to hug her teacher. \"This is all just a dream, isn't it?\" Negi sighed in relief at Makie's reaction: perhaps now he wouldn't get in trouble for this incident in the first place. But what do you when you triple the size of a teenage girl? She couldn't stay this tall forever, after all. What about school, and what would her friends think? And even if her friends DID think it was alright, they too might want to grow, and then OTHER girls would want to grow as well. And before you know it, Negi would be needing to use an elevator just to say \"Hello\" to his students, much less teach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Negi-kuuuun\", smiled Makie. \"Let's show Akira-chan this!\" Negi once again proceeded to his worried state from before, but knowing full well Makie was going to do this whether or not he complied, simply went for the ride. But just before doing so, Makie felt a weird surge from her body. She noticed something odd about her hands as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, did my hands just get bigger?\" asked Makie, showing Negi her hands, which had just grown several more inches in height in the last minute. Soon enough the rest of her body had continued to grow, beginning with her head, legs, arms, hands, and finally her stomach, chest, and bottom. Makie now stood at a height of about 30 feet tall. \"COOL!\" Makie screamed in delight. \"Now I can definitely hold you on my shoulder, Negi-kun!\" And as true to her word, Makie picked up her teacher with her hands and placed him on her right shoulder. \"Ready to go meet her?\" Negi shyly his head up and down in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what should happen?</span></div></div>",

Tell me again if you want to make me shrink or something.\" With that, Makie ran off, and since no one noticed her growth, Negi didn't have to worry about the consequences of his magic using. Still, though, someone DID see him. Before Negi could even see it, he was bonked on a head by a taller person. That taller person was Asuna, who was watching the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't use our classmates as guinea pigs for magic\", she sighed, placing her left hand on Negi's bruised head, rubbing it. \"Though I guess you found out it worked after all, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", Negi said in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?

She slowly shrank back to the size she once was, and once she reached her normal height she hugged Negi in gratitude for returning to her normal stature. But Makie felt something weird...it felt as if her teacher was moving further apart from her. Eventually Makie realized that Negi wasn't moving...she herself was shrinking! First she was up to Negi's head, then his neck, and eventually she shrank to the point where she wasn't even up to his knees! Frightened by her new, small height, Makie did what any girl shrunk to the size of a big plush doll would do: panic. Actually, both Makie AND her teacher started to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Negi, Asuna was actually watching him the entire time behind a tree, just in case someone was bound to happen. She popped out and surprised both Negi and Makie, the latter clinging to Negi's knee at height of the girl, who was tall as a building to Makie at her height. Instead of yelling at him, though, all Asuna could do was sigh. She then offered to help Negi restore Makie's current height, but something was off..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My staff!\" Negi exclaimed, noticing his bent wand, probably from the result of one of Makie's very big hugs. \"I can't reactive the spell without it!\" As Negi said this, his wand literally snapped in two. Upon its cracking, he bowed his head in apology to Makie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't just leave her here\", Asuna told Negi. \"I guess we have to check Makie-chan to our dorm for the time being.\" Makie nodded in agreement at what Asuna said. She tugged on Negi's pant leg, hoping to get a ride on him. Surprisingly he agreed, and gently lifted Makie up and placed him on his shoulder. The three then went straight back to the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA FEW HOURS LATER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi had finally prepared his staff. Makie, who was on the bed asleep on Negi's bed, was then nudged by Negi to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makie-san, it's time to return you to normal size\", Negi told his student, still half-asleep.

The two shrunken girls sat on the ground, dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Negi-kun!\" cried Makie. \"Now Asuna-chan and Konoka-chan have shrunk as well!\" Negi was sweating profusely right now, thinking that, if nothing else, he would have made the girls simply taller. But now they less than a third his own height. Asuna and Konoka have now snapped out of the dizziness of the spell, and have noticed their much bigger surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Asuna was kind of scared. Her room looked like a warehouse at her new height, and the ladder that led to Negi's bed looked like a wooden skyscraper at her height. Her can of soda, to which she was drinking happily a minute ago, wasn't even big enough to carry with both her arms anymore. Although glad her clothes shrank with her, Asuna was fairly speechless. Konoka, on the other hand, thought it was cool and ran up to Negi's ladder and climbed up all the way up to his bed, admiring the fluffy, giant bed he had at her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Negi was about to try yet again to change them back, he got a phone call on his cell phone. It was Kotaro, and it seemed fairly urgent! Negi had no choice now but to leave the girls at their current height as he left to meet up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, everyone\", he told the girls, speaking in a much quiter voice than usual. \"I promise to change you all back once I return.\" With that Negi ran out of the dorm and closed the door behind him. Little cries of \"No!!\" came as a result, but they were so faitn to Negi he couldn't hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Asuna was starting to feel a little more calm about her surroundings on Negi's bed, but still seemed sad. Konoka decided to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Asuna? Don't you think being as big as a plush toy is cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But think of all the neat things you can do when small. Sodas seem like fountains, all-you-can-eat snacks, and beds as bouncy as trampolines. You should enjoy this moment, Asuna. Being with Negi-kun and his magic abilities is a special thin most don't get to share.\" And with that, Konoka jokingly shoved Asuna off her pillow, causing the girl to bounce repeatedly on her butt on Negi's bed. She was worried at first, but soon got on her legs and started jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Konoka. This IS fun.\" Asuna giggled and laughed as she jumped from one side of the bed to the next, hoping never to have to stop. \"No chores, no homework, no newspaper route! THIS is what Sunday is all about.\" As the two happy campers continued to bounce, Makie looked outside the window from the top bunk. Wondering if she would ever return to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what should happen when Negi arrives back?</span></div></div>",

Well, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be fun to mess around with Set-chan! Let's do it!\" Konoka chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I mean, what if someone sees us or catches us?\" Asuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to do it if you don't want to, Asuna-san\", Makie told her friend with a smile. \"It was just an idea.\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as her vision cleared she saw Makie towering over her. Her eyes lit up and she embraced the taller girl from the waist down. Makie patted Konoka's head and crouched down to hug her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling any better, Makie-san?\" Negi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, much better.

Even with her massive strength and size difference Konoka would not budge. Konoka, having had her fill of hugging Asuna, then turned to Negi. She jumped on his hand so fast he didn't have any time to react. Being a gentlemen, Negi hugged her back as best he could until she let go and plopped back onto Asuna's lap with the 3-inch Makie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! This is fun right, Makie-chan? I want to be this small forever!\" Konoka chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konoka! Why would you say that?!\" Asuna asked. \"I mean what would Setsuna-san say if she found out about this? She would be really worried about you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right\", Konoka frowned in disappointed, only to lighten up again  second later. \"But I still think it's fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is just no reaching you, is there?\" Asuna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't you forget it!\" Konoka joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's nothing to do now but go to sleep\", Negi said, cutting Asuna off right before she could reply to Konoka. \"Right\", his three students said in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go and get Makie-san checked into our room. Asuna-san, please watch them\", Negi asked of her as he walked out the door to their room. \"I'll be back in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Negi. See ya\", Asuna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BYE NEGI-KUN!!\" Konoka and Makie yelled in order for him to hear them. The door shut behind him and the two tiny girls looked up at their larger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makie-chan, do you need a bath? Konoka and I have already taken one\", Asuna asked her 3 inch tall friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been sweating all day. I'm all sticky\", Makie said with a disgusted look. \"But how am I going to take one? The other girls should be at the baths and I can't be seen like this!\" The answer came when Asuna stood to with the two in her right hand and opened the door to the bath room with her left. She turned on the sink enough to accommodate Makie's size. A while later Makie was swimming in the sink completely alone with the door closed. The nob jiggled and Negi walked in. Seeing his student in the sink, he blushed ferociously and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot Negi!\" Makie heard Asuna yell at their teacher behind the closed door. \"I told you Makie-chan was in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that she was taking a bath!\" he yelled back at her, blushing red. Asuna then lighlty hit Negi on the head, replying with \"Well, what did you think she was doing?!\" \"I don't know. Ouch! Asuna-san, why'd you hit me?!\" Their conversation continued in this manner for the next few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is how they always are\", Makie said to herself. She then got out using a tissue as a towel and put the clothes that Asuna had taken off one of her dolls. They fit snugly and she descended the sink carefully. When she finally hit the ground Asuna opened the door slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makie-chan, are you done?\" she asked the miniature gymnist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm finished. Thank you\", Makie smiled in reply as Asuna picked her up. For obvious reasons they all agreed that the smaller people would sleep in Asuna's bed. After exchanging \"good nights\", the group went to sleep. The next day Negi found both the smaller girls latched onto his hand. He looked around to see if he had wondered into Asuna's bed last night. Surprisingly, he hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Must have climbed up here while they slept,\" he said softly. He carefully detached them from his hand and laid them down. He then got up and dressed and ate. Afterwards he took a quick glance at the calender, which quickly stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" he said in surprise at the day it said on the calendar. \"It's Monday! Asuna-san, wake up! It's Monday! We have to go or we'll be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Negi?\" Asuna said groggily, rubbing her eyes. It was a rare day that the girl didn't have a newspaper route early in the morning, so she got to sleep in. \"It's Monday! Get up, get up!\" he urged his student, who finaly put two and two together and realized what day it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh CRAP!\" Asuna said as she rushed to get dressed and get her things together. \"C'mon, Negi, let's go!\" She turned to see her teacher writing something on a sheet of paper. \"This is no time to write anything, Negi!\" \"I'm leaving a note for Makie-san and Konoka-san\", He explained, folding the paper and putting it next to them on his bed. \"Alright let's go.\" They then left for school at a high speed run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the two other, noticeably smaller girls then woke up to find a note from their teacher next to them. With a little difficulty they unfolded the paper and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konoka-san and Makie-san, Asuna and I have gone to school. <br>\r\nWe will come and get you once it is over. <br>\r\nPlease, for your sake stay here in the room. <br>\r\nSincerely, Negi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Ma~~~an! I want to explore at this size!\" Konoka said in a disappointed tone. \"Come on Makie-chan, let's go exploring!\" But Makie was not as raring as her friend to do so, even if she was twice her size. \"We shouldn't, Konoka-san. Negi-kun is looking out for us and we should listen to whatever he says. Still...it MIGHT be fun to look around. Oh, what to do?\"</span></div></div>",

Still, though, the one and a half inch tall girl wasn't about to spend her day sleeping on Negi's giagntic bed, one that would put even most royal beds to shame at her new height. Makie too didn't want to spend all day cramped indoors herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we do? School lasts for eight hours\", Makie asked her friend, who then lit up in anticipation, as if she had just gotten an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Makie-chan! Let's doodle!\" the cheerful girl chirped as she slowly made her way down Negi's bed. Despite the intimidating size difference, Konoka wasn't the least bit scared as she made her way down Negi's bed, which was the equivalent of jumping off of a 60 foot tall building at her height. She used a wrapped-up blanket to work her way to the ground, using the pillow that Negi accidentally left on the ground from his sleep as a safety net on the ground below. Makie quickly followed her friend down the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the process of getting to the ground was done, Konoka then proceeded to her school bag that she placed on the ground next to Negi's bed. The tiny girl had a hard time moving it around, but with some help from Makie they finally got it on the ground. The tiny Konoka then peeked around in the bag, which was kind of like exploring a cave to her, causing the girl to giggle happily to herself as she fished out her notebook. She then went in a second time to get some pencils. At the end, from start to finish, the process of getting the supplies out ate up the good end of an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Makie asked her friend as she found a hard time lifting the usually tiny pencil in hr arms. \"We're too tiny to write with these pencils!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we have this\", Konoka chirped in reply as she got out a bottle of ink roughly the size of Makie. \"This is from my art class, but we can use it to draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\", Makie nodded in reply, helping open up the notebook to a blank page and spewing some of the ink on the notebook page. The two then dipped their fingers in the ink and started drawing various things in it until they got sleepy once again around 2 p.m. or so. Makie drew herself winning  golden trophy, her and an older Negi smiling together and almost kissing, and several other things. Konoka meanwhile drew herself with Setsuna, Asuna, and Negi, a picture of her as some magical girl, some animals, and a stylized version of her dorm room. A few hours later, Negi and Asuna finally came back, the latter going \"Aw\" at the sight of a tiny Konoka and Makie sleeping on her own notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, do you really think we should wake them? They seem so peaceful\", Asuna asked her teacher, but all he could was look stern in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We must wake them up! I must fix what I began!\" Negi sternly replied to his student's question, sightly nudging the two tiny girls with his right pinky finger.</span></div></div>",

Once they all arrived (including Chachamaru), Asuna took the smaller girls out of her pocket and placed them on one of the bells on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the problem?\" Chachamaru asked inquisitively. \"Master can fix that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" both her tiny classmates asked in anticipation. When Chachamaru nodded, they began to excitedly ring the bells in Asuna's hair, causing the red headed girl to take both of them off and place them on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Asuna~~~...put us back. We wanna play with your bells again\", Konoka and Makie whined simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's really annoying! Now come on, we have to find Eva-chan\", she said as she glaring at them. They soon found Evangeline lounging around th beach area, with one of Chachamaru's sisters massaging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, Master! We have a problem\", Negi yelled from afar. He began to run along with Chachamaru and Asuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now, boy?\" she said, looking up from her book to see him stopping in front of the massage table. She looked at Negi for a while before turning to Asuna. She saw the two shrunken girls on her right shoulder and began to laugh. \"Ahahaha! That is hilarious! Y-you actually made two of your students tiny! It's like you're TRYING to become an ermine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, please. We need to get these two back to normal\", Negi pleaded to Evangeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha..fine. Come into the library. I won't fix this for you since I find it incredibly funny, but you should be able to find a way to fix it yourself in here\", she told Negi, calming down a bit. The child teacher then proceeds inside the library and grabs the nearest book. He flips through the pages as Asuna sits with the girls in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...these are all dark spells\", Negi realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What of it? My specialties ARE dark and ice\", Evangeline said. \"You're just using the spell to grow your students, right? Besides, if you really ARE my pupil, you should be able to embrace the power of darkness like I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi was beginning to have second thoughts about whether or not to listen to his master's advice. After thinking it over he finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

That's all I'll say about it,\" Evangeline said lazily as she strolled out of the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround an hour and a half later, a very tired Negi emerged from the large library doors, being greeted a second later by Asuna and the two smaller girls who had left Negi, upon request, to study alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-ss-so, did you find the spell to fix this?\" Asuna asked Negi with concern. A small nod from her teacher made Asuna and the other two girls sigh in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'm kinda done with worrying about these two for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi nodded in agreement as Asuna placed the girls on the ground in front of him. This time, not even bothering to draw a circle around them, he then began to chant a strange spell. Each word quaked within the smaller girls as they felt a sensation they couldn't explain. Their bodies started to glow an eerie black. And in a burst of released energy they found themselves back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEGI-KUN!!!! You did it!!\" all three girls exclaimed as they looked at their teacher. Or rather the place that he was formally standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi? Where'd you go?\" Asuna asked, puzzled. She felt a slight tap on her heel and looked down to find her one inch tall teacher looking up at her.  She stiffened as what she saw caught up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-Negi!? What happened?!\" she panicked as she picked up her teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It didn't say anything about this in the book\", he replied, trying to keep himself level headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious!?\" Evangeline shouted. \"You chose a spell in which you had to give up something of your own in order to give it to someone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KKKYYAAAHHH!!!\" Konoka screamed as she snatched Negi away from Asuna. \"Negi-kun!!

Not a clue, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared for anything.\" She answered in an inspiring chirp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely right about that.\" He agreed, cursing himself for no following her example and trying the spell prepared for something like this. They reach the mountain area and the giantess takes her teacher out from his snug cradle and lowers him down to the plateau where her tent is nestled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei do you think you can get them and make them big like me? Everything should be in a gray duffle bag.\" With that he ran in only to reemerge with a small piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't there. But I did find this note.\" He said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? What does that note say?!\" She boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says, 'Kaede, if you want your ninja bag back you will have to find us. Love, Fuuka and Fumika.' Well this is bothersome.\" Negi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They picked the WRONG day to mess with me.\" Kaede sent Negi a wink telling him she was teasing them and trying to scare them out. It worked! A terrified pair of twins stepped out in the open holding Kaede's bag. Seeing the large version of their friend scared them even more than hearing her soft but incredibly loud voice. Realizing they had been tricked snapped them out of their horrified trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting THIS back any time soon!\" Fuuka yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was really mean!!\" Fumika screamed as they both ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we just forget about the bag or should I chase them down sensei?\"</span></div></div>",

She was taking a break after her endless self-punishment when her eyes were suddenly diverted. She ran straight up to a nearby tree and, after a quick succession of hits, fell to the ground on her feet. She had been training all morning, and although it was only about 10:30, Ku Fei was nearly exhausted. However, now she could clearly see what had called her attention in the first lace. It was her teacher, Negi, who was standing in the dirt with his staff. She saw him twirl it around in the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is he doing? Fu Fei wondered to herself. So she walked straight up to him and looked him in the face. His eyes were tightly shut and his arms were raised up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-bozu! What are you doing?\" she again asked, this time out loud and directly at her teacher. Negi then opened his eyes. only to see his student wrapped in intense blue light. He yelled at her to escape, but it was to no avail. Ku Fei struggled to escape from the light, but all her attempts were futile. Calmness overtook her body as she shut her eyes. By the time she opened them again she found herself looking straight up at Negi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're up\", Negi sighed in relief. \"It's a good that nothing happened either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean-bozu? What is supposed to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got caught in a growth spell I just cast and I couldn't stop it. But it seems to have failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I do feel kinda funny now that you mention it\", Ku Fei laughed. But it was no joke. A second later she clutched her stomach, her insides feeling like they were growing inside of her. She was in such great pain that she started to rip up the ground beneath her. About a minute later she had stopped writhing and was now crouching with her face to the ground breathing heavily. Beads of sweat rolled down her face as she struggled to remain conscious. When K Fei finally did open her eyes, she no longer saw her teacher's young face staring down at her. This time she saw it looking directly up at her. She lifted her head up, and Negi's small body was caught by the top of her nose and lifted up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. It worked. This is bad....\" the worried teacher said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-bozu. This... is... AWESOME!!!!!\" squealed the now 80 meter tall giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about!? This is terrible!\" he yelled back at his super-sized student. \"We'll be in serious trouble if anyone sees you! I'll be turned into an ermine! This is definitely not good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm so big! It fun being big\", Ku Fei chirped happily in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ku Fei-san, we have to find a way to get you back to normal fast!\" Negi whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Alright-bozu. But how we going to do that? I can't really go walking around like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to ask somebody for advice.\" Who does Negi ask for advice, though?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Negi began to proceed with the growing of the pebble in the dirt, two girls in the distance noticed their teacher. The two girls were fairly short for their age (even shorter than Negi), and they both had pink hair. One had hers in pigtails, and the other had hers in a bun. They also dressed the same: a plain white t-shirt and light blue shorts. They were Fuuka and Fumika, twin ninja girls in Negi's class. Fuuka was the childish one of the duo, while Fumika was the more mature, careful one of the two. The two girls noticed Negi in the distance not too far from their dormitory and wondered what he was doing so early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose our teacher's doing, Fumika?\" Fuuka asked her twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Let's go see\", Fumika replied, and the two dashed off to see their teacher who, at that time, alread began the incantation, which went along the lines of \"Incresco Tantus\", Latin for increasing the size of something. However, as the two were not aware of Negi's growth spell, the two simply thought they saw flashes of light coming at them when Negi's spell misfired and hit both girls at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! So bright!\" the twins screamed simultaneously, wondering what just happened. A few seconds  later the light had finally stopped, and Fumika and Fuuka noticed their teacher looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumika-san, Fuuka-san! We have to get out of here!\" Negi tried to tell his students, but the two just looked at him with a blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, sensei? It's just a flash of light\", Fumika told her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that!\" Negi continued to explain to his students about their very soon growth. \"It's something...bigger than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\" Fumika and Fuuka smiled in unison. \"Like a growth spell?\" The two noticed Negi's silent pause afterwards, and soon the twins put two and two together and jumped to the conlusion that Negi had them with a growth spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder which one of us will grow first?\" wondered Fuuka outloud to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's me\", Fuuka smiled. \"I always wanted to be taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like Negi could blame the two for getting excited. Fumika and Fuuka were so tiny for their age, they were often mistaken for kindergardeners. What really worried Negi was how to turn them back, if they would even let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the first signs of growth began to appear on the girls. First to grow was Fuuka, who saw her shoes spring up in size. Her shoes grew in small spurts of growth until they were 10 times their normal height, in a process that took 15 seconds. Next up were her hands, which grew in similar spurts of growth for 15 seconds, then her arms, legs, butt, chest, and finally her hair and then lastly her head. The formerly tiny ninja girl was now a little more than 40 feet tall, and Fuuka couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fumika looked up above to her sister, she too felt a tingle in her body. Unlike her sister, Fumika's growth began with her butt, which caused the tiny ninja girl to slam pretty fast onto the ground from the weight of it. Like Fuuka, Fumika's body parts were growing to 10 times their normal height, and shortly after her butt's growth began her legs and feet. About 30 seconds later her hands began to grow, then her arms, hands, and lastly her hair and head. At the end of all the growing, Fumika, too, was about 40 or so feet tall. Both sisters then came to Negi's eye level and gave them a kiss on each of his cheeks, Fumika kissing the left cheek and Fuuka the right. This freaked Negi more than a little out, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best thing anyone's ever done for us, sensei\", smiled Fuuka as if she just won a lottery giving away one million dollars to its winner. \"Let's go somewhere to celebrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this is the time for celbra...\" Negi tried to tell Fuuka, but the giantess ninja grabbed him before he coud finish his sentence. She then placed the boy on her left shoulder, smiling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sensei\", Fumika assured her teacher. \"Where we're going, our newfound height will not be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Where are we going?\" wondered Negi, still worried over the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\", Fuuka smiled to her teacher. \"We're just going to..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I guess that isn't that big of an issue anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K., you can show Kaede-san that you're big, but then we have to go back so I can find a way to reverse this\", Negi said resembling a father denning his child a toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to me that you not in a very good position to be telling us what to do\", Fumika pointed out, smirking an evil grin. \"One wrong move and it could be 'GOOD BYEEE sensei'! Anyway, we don't want to want to be small again. Being small is so boring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but it's normal...\" Negi muttered to himself. He looked down to see the forest floor melting away into a green highland meadow. In front of them he saw Kaede's small tent with smoke coming up from around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede!\" the two ninjas called for her. There was no reply. \"Kaede! It's us, Fuuka and Fumika. You can come out!\" Again, no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr!\" growled Fuuka as she tore the tent off of the plateau that it had been sitting on. \"Where could she have gone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Those two...seem to have grown angrier since I casted the spell.&gt; Negi thought to himself. &lt;I should calm them down, but how do you calm two hyper, devious, and now angry giantesses?&gt;</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be one of Negi's students, Chao Lengshen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Negi-kun\", she smiled at him, lifting one hand in the air at her teacher. \"Seems I stumbled upon one of your spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch-Chao-san!? You know that I'm a mage..!?\" Negi began to say as Chao hugged the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Knew this entire time, actually. I even knew that you were performing a growth spell. One that, by the way, I purposely stumbled into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? How did you know this would happen?\" Negi asked of his student, who proceeded to look at him with a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm from the future, silly\", Chao laughed as she patted her teacher's head in just. \"I once read about this spell before in my magic books, but was never able to find it myself. So, using a device that allows me to predict future and past events, I came to this spot at the exact time I knew you would begin this spell. I even know when I'll start growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when is that...?\" Negi reluctantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\", Chao continued to smile as she placed Negi on the ground, her growth beginning before him. The child teacher could only watch as Chao's body began to expand in size all over, from her hair to her feet. After about 50 or so seconds had passed the growth was complete, and Chao smiled in glee of her new 100 foot size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga...eh.....eh.....eh\", the speechless Negi babbled as Chao picked him up and placed him on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Negi-kun, what do you think of the new and improved Chao Lengshen?\" she asked him with a slight sinister tone to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...that we should keep this a secret as much as possible...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no! This is too cool to keep this to myself! I just HAVE to show Satomi this and rub it in her face. She said it was impossible for humans to grow, but I'm gonna prove her wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Chao-san...if you know I'm a mage, then you probably also know that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. 'If someone finds out, you'll be turned into an ermine'. I've heard it from your students before. Don't worry, Negi-kun. I'll try to be as quiet as I can.\" And with that, the reluctant teacher and his giantess student headed off to meet Satomi.</span></div></div>",

But still, studying <i>every</i> day? Even when I was training to be a teacher, I didn't have to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the difference between you and Satomi. Me too, actually. I study every day too, Negi-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChao proceeded to peek through all the windows of the building, hoping to see a glimpse of the girl to show off her new size, but alas nothing. She was getting agitated now, angrily tapping her left foot on the ground. She was now behind the entrance of said building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr...this is frustrating! I knew for sure she'd be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Chao-san, I think I see Satomi-san entering from the front side..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Thanks, Negi-kun\", the excited Chao rushed out as she proceeded to stare a wide grin at the girl, surprised by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHH! You scared me, Chao-san!\" Satomi meekly muttered, dropping her notebooks in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Chao asked her as she picked her up in her hands, placing her on the top of her head right next to Negi. \"Now do you believe me that people can grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but that's impossible! The body structure of people doesn't allow for growing or shrinking..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You're saying I'm a robot, then?\" Chao once again picked up Satomi, this time lifting her shirt up and placing Satomi's face directly in contact with the top of her stomach to feel her heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...hear...a...heartbeat...\" Satomi slowly blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you! I'm a real, 100 foot tall giantess!\" Chao grinned at her friend as she placed up on the ground. \"And it's all thanks to Negi-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei?! He has those powers!? I thought he only knew basic magic..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know about my powers too, Satomi-san?\" Negi sighed in frustration over how easily he's let his \"secret\" of being a mage slip out among his students. \"It seems like everyone knows..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew you had magic quite like this, though!\" a now starry-eyed Satomi shouted to her teacher, who was still on Chao's head high above. \"Sensei!! Can you make me big, too!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Negi-kun! It'll be fun\", suggested Chao. \"We promise we won't do anything to harm others. And if anyone asks, you can say Satomi and I are robots she created.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't know. Let me think about it, Chao-san and Satomi-san..\", Negi paused, knowing that either decision would wind up being fairly problematic.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right before Negi began his spell, he saw one of his students not too far in the distance. It was Kazumi, one of his students aware of his magic abilities (though since she didn't have a pactio with Negi, she had no magic abilities of her own). The child teacher waved his hands out to her to get her attention, to which she did. Kazumi then dashed quickly over to Negi, wondering what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early for a Sunday, Negi-kun\", Kazumi said to her teacher, looking down at the circle in the dirt. \"I guess you're trying out a new spell or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", he smiled in reply. \"I'm trying to make this pebble in the center of that circle grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You know a spell that makes things grow in size?\" the shocked Kazumi asked him, whose shocked expression quickly turned into a smile and a slight snicker. \"Does it work on people?\" She then walked into the circle herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kazumi-san!\" the worried Negi sprang out. \"I haven't tested it out yet! I'm testing it on this rock first to see if anything happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Negi-kun, don't be so wishy-washy\", Kazumi smiled to her teacher. \"You didn't become the great teacher you were today by not taking chances, right?\" This caused Negi to pause in thought, and he remebered long ago when he fought against a monster that attacked his village years ago with nothing but a beginner's wand. He could've died that day, but was saved by his father in the nick of time. Negi didn't want to relive that kind of thing ever again in his life, and especially not jeopardize one of his students' lives in the process. Meanwhile, Kazumi was still looking at Negi, wondering if he would even go through with the spell now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazumi-san, I've made my decision\", Negi told his student. \"I can't do it.\" Kazumi looked disappointed at his teacher's decision, partially because she wanted to be a part of his magic studies. But Negi wasn't quite done yet. \"I can't do it here, that is\", he added. \"Let's go outside the school gates and I'll let you....gr...ow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazumi once again regained her cheerful disposition, and the two headed out to a naerby clearing far from the school gates. There were plenty of trees around the area as well, so even if someone COULD see them, Negi could always try to erase their memories with a spell should someone see them. Negi then proceeded, once again, to a patch of dirt on the ground and made a circle in it, which Kazumi quickly put herself inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to go, Negi-kun\", Kazumi smiled to her teacher, winking her right eye and  giving him a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then\", the still somwhat worried Negi replied, hoping that the spell wouldn't do anything major to his student. He then closed his eyes and began to hod up his staff with his left hand, swinging it around left and right. During this the circle Kazumi was in began to glow, and with it, Kazumi herself beganglowing. Kazumi could feel her whole body feeling warmer, almost as if she was in an electric blanket, and it made her feel a little funny. Then Negi finished off the spell with the following incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds afterwards the spell began to work its way into Kazumi. Kazumi's long, sender legs were the first part of her to grow, growing to several times their original size until they were several times taller than her own teacher. Next up were her arms, which reached out pass several trees (though thankfully her arms weren't caught in any branches). These were soon followed by the growth of her hands, which grew in quick spurts that made her head look as small as a Barbie doll's in comparison. Then Kazumi's feet began to grow, eventually growing up to Negi's own knees. Next up was her chest, stomach, and butt, which grew, much like the rest of her body, in quick spurts, each time getting to be about twice the size they were before. Kazumi's hair soon enough started to grow, quickly covering up her entire face, soon followed up with the growth of her head. In a manner of two minutes Kazumi's growth began and finished. Already one of the taller students in her class, Kazumi was now a 45-foot tall junior high school giantess. Kazumi looked around her new environment with a little bit of a shock, but was fairly happy with the results that it gave. She was also glad Negi's spell actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazumi-san, are you alright?\" Nei asked his student, yelling fairly loudly to get her attention. The  newly found giantess then sat down on the ground on her back, picking up her teacher and placing him on top of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Negi-kun\", she smiled, her eyes closed doing so. \"I'm glad it worked, and I'm glad you chose ME after all to practice this with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not worried?\" Negi asked in shock while Kazumi patted him on the head with her right pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. You probably don't even know how to fix this, I bet\", Kazumi told her teacher. \"But I'm not too worried. If I know one thing about you, Negi-kun, is that you never leave a student in need behind. Ever. That's what makes you a great teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-thanks\", Negi smiled, blushing in reply. \"But now what do we do?\" Soon after asking this, Negi watched as Kazumi picked him up and placed him back on the ground on his feet, the giantess herself standing up once again on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I have no idea\", Kazumi said with a slightly childish tone in her voice, playfully sticking out her tounge a little. Just then she felt a strange warmth in her stomach and noticed the environment around her getting even smaller. Kazumi seemed to have to be 46 feet tall now! She then proceeded to the ground once again, this time sitting on her knees, and picked up Negi with her hands and placed him on her lap, his head resting on her chest once again. \"We could always talk\", Kazumi said to her teacher, looking down to him and smiling. \"We don't get to hang out too much, Negi-kun. Or we could, you know, hang out somewhere.\" The giantess student, who at that point grew to 47 feet in height, then began playing with her teacher's hair once again with her right pinky finger. The first time she did this to Negi he was a little worried by the height difference, but he seemed more relaxed by it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem happier since you've grown\", Negi pointed out to his student, who grew up to 48 feet tall just then. \"And you're already quite cheerful as is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a side effect\", Kazumi smiled, growing an additional foot, this time to 50 feet. \"I guess the taller you get, the happier you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what path do the two walk down now?</span></div></div>",

Negi was used to be shorter than the majority of his students, but compared to the antics of vampires, robots, time-travelers, and rock golems, one of his students becoming a giantess wasn't so weird. He was especially glad that Kazumi was a <i>friendly</i> giantess, unlike a few B-horror movies he had seen as a child of giant-sized people destroying cities and killing people in their rampages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun~\", Kazumi smiled brightly at her teacher. \"Do you like me..~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh!?\" was the boy's reaction to Kazumi's question. He gushed red as he stared at Kazumi's cheerful, smiling face, which zoomed overhead her large chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....do you like me?\" an annoyed Kazumi asked once again, her smile slowly turning into a frown. \"I guess you don't...\" She began to fak cry in front of the boy, giggling inside her head of his stressed-out expressions as he began to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I liked you, Kazumi-san! I like all my students!\" Negi quickly responded, watching Kazumi grow in size once again when she smiled in response. Negi could feel the distance between himself and her face separating all the further, watching as she grew from a tall 50 feet to an even greater 65.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...you're so sweet, Negi-kun. You'll make som lucky girl a nice husband one day\", she teased her teacher as she kissed the boy with her giant-sized lips. \"The kiss is our little secret, Negi-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret?\" a befuddled Negi wondered. \"Why would a kiss be a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your girlfriend, Asuna\", she continued to further tease her teacher. \"You two are so cute together! Or perhaps you like Nodoka, or perhaps Yue? I've seen you hang around with Chisame recently as well, and even Makie and Ku Fei. You sure are popular with the girls, ain't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....they're my students. Of course I want to be....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want them to respect me, and to do so I earn their trust by being friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww! You're sooo cute when you're embarrassed\", Kazumi further teased her teacher, standing up on her butt and proceeding to kiss him again. During the kiss she grew again, this time to a high 90 feet tall. Once again Negi stood in shock of what was going on, watching as his giantess student sat back down on her backside on the ground, placing her teacher on her large left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, are you hungry by any chance?\" Kazumi asked the boy, whose stomach then rumbled as if he were hitting a cue. Her stomach then growled even larger, leaving a bit of a vibration to the teacher resting on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, yeah\", he replied. \"But where do we go to get food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...that's a good question\", pondered Kazumi, placing her left hand under her chin and stroking it.</span></div></div>",

She's actually very sweet and nice, but there's one thing about her that separates her from the rest of her classmates at Mahora Academy: she's a ghost. Long confined to the school grounds since her death, Sayo spent 60 years relatively alone until one day she finally got to talk to another student at the school. Her name was Kazumi, one of the top authorities of gossip and intrigue among the Mahora Academy students, and she was even in the same class as Sayo. Since then the two have been good friends. Of course, this was after she accidentally caused a ruckus on the campus and almost got blasted by Mana into a fate worse than...well, the afterlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sayo couldn't spend all her time with her newfound friend: after all, everyone needs a little privacy once in a while. So one beautiful Sunday morning in summer, Sayo flied around the sky of Mahora Academy, enjoying the summer colors and all the cheerful faces of the students on campus. During her flight she noticed her teacher, Negi Springfield, who seemed to be making a circle in the dirt right outside the school. Intrigued by her teacher's behavior, she decided to swoop down and see what he was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after swopping down to her teacher's eye level, she decided to hover above the dirt circle. At this time she was unaware that her teacher was already casting the growth spell, proceeding to enchant the incantation of \"Increseco Tantus\" while she continued to stare at the ground, even placing her ghostly hand on the dirt to pick up the little rock (despite being a ghost and not being able to pick it up).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Sayo was about 20 feet in the sky, wondering how she got up there. Perhaps it was another barrier that blocked out ghosts and the like, and she was blown away? That's what Sayo thought, until she looked below her and noticed she had legs! Even more so, she noticed how far she now was from the ground....she was now a 25-foot tall ghost girl! Sayo started to get nervous, and proceeded to cry almost immediately following the discovery of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened to me!?\" the scared ghost girl cried, hoping that Kazumi heard her and could possibly get her to ask Negi for help. As for Negi himself, he had left shortly after her growth, sad that the rock did not grow like he expected it to. Sayo was crying tears down her eyes like they were water faucets...but who hears her cries for help?</span></div></div>",

Kazumi well then and there who was it behind her...she could tell Sayo's ghostly trail quite easily. However, when she turned around she was quite surprised by the sight upon her: a giantess Sayo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-S-Sayo!\", the astonished Kazumi asked, falling butt first on the ground in shock. \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei cast some weird spell and I grew really big\", the scared giantess cried, wiping the tears off her eyes as she did so. \"And now I can't even fly since my legs grew when I did. And I also can't leave the school grounds because of the curse I have on me. Oh Kazumi-san, what should I do!?\" The scared girl then proceeded to lay down on her stomach on the ground, looking at Kazumi in freight of her smaller environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-Don't worry, Sayo\", Kazumi replied to her friend, now standing up once again. \"Negi-kun can fix this, I'm sure of it!

P-p-please hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazumi then proceeded to run around Mahora looking for Negi. Although happy that Kazumi decided to help her, Sayo wondered to herself if he could even fix her predicament, or even make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to trouble anyone\", a sad Sayo said to herself, proceeding to cry once again. \"Perhaps I should leave and hide somewhere else..\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, it was at Africa that she heard of a shaman who had the ability to see ghosts and even possibly revive them from the dead! Sayo quickly hurried to the location of this shaman, who was often seen on Mount Kenya, which was located in the country of, well, Kenya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" Sayo smiled to herself. \"I've been traveling the world for months and never thought I'd never hear of such a thing. Perhaps I can be made human again and reverse this curse!\" As the excited ghost girl ran to Mount Kenya from her current destination in Nairobi, Kenya (which wasn't too far from Mount Kenya), though, she stopped and talked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will talking to him really fix this?\" Sayo nervously asked herself, looking at her legs below her. \"It's possible nothing could happen, or worse.\" As Sayo slowly walked to the mountain she thought to herself whether or not to go through with proceeding up Mount Kenya.</span></div></div>",

That's the problem with not having legs for 60 years: it makes it very difficult to climb up places. As Sayo lost her ability to fly when she grew, the giantess ghost girl had a difficult time working her way up the mountain. Although her legs were long enough to climb as high as 10 or even 15 feet in a single step, Sayo's natural clumsiness prevented her from going very far. To her it was like going one step forward and two steps back. After over 2 hours of struggling, Sayo only made it roughly one-tenth up the mountain, and she saw no sign of the shaman anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so useless\", Sayo sighed sadly to herself. As the ghost girl continued to mentally beat herself up, she felt herself inching upwards to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sitting down\", the ghost girl slowly said to herself, unaware that she was growing for the first time in months. All of a sudden the mountain didn't look quite so big as Sayo grew from 25 feet to an extremely generous 200 feet tall! To say that the once mini-giantess was scared would be an understatement: Sayo proceeded to cry once again. But it didn't last long, as the giantess ghost girl decided to use her newfound height to scale the mountain faster. Surely now it would be easier for her to find the shaman, right?</span></div></div>",

The giantess ghost wondered if perhaps he wasn't even on the mountain at all? It was slowly getting dark, and at night it would be quite difficult to find him. At about the 55% mark Sayo proceeded to rest, saddened by her development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thousands of miles away from my friends, my only savior is nowhere in sight, and now I'm a giant freak\", Sayo cried to herself as she saw the sky increasingly turned orange. It also seemed to her as if she was inching upwards again, causing the girl to flail her arms in worry. Sayo watched as she ballooned in height from an already tall 200 feet to a gigantic 500 feet! Her footing on the mountain was coming off, and Sayo saw herself slowly falling down the mountain. As the worried giantess clenched on to a rock, she started to freak out again, and once again found herself getting bigger...now she was growing to an even bigger 600 feet! She found herself unable to even grab the biggest of rocks with her hands: they felt like mere pebbles in her hands. Sayo then fell down the mountain again, this time to the very bottom of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayo proceeded to cry as she fell back first down the mountain, her progress all for nought. As she continued to cry she didn't feel notice herself growing ever bigger, this time to an amazing 1,000 feet! When Sayo did finally open her eyes, she was surprised by the huge difference between her and the mountain! It barely looked higher than a very large building to the thousand foot tall giantess. But Sayo was still frustrated by both her new height and her failure to find who she was looking for.</span></div></div>",

As Sayo tried to hold this idea of growing in, she felt another surge in her body, and this time it made her grow to a staggering 2,000 feet tall! Now nearly one-sixth the size of the mountain, the colossal sized Sayo walked in a circle around the mountain area to see if anywhere was near by. To her surprise she did see someone at the bottom of the mountain area: she found the shaman! His skin was black, as was his hair, and he wore a casual looking white shirt and beige pants. If Sayo didn't know any better, she would have mistaken the man for a tourist. Luckily for her she remembered his picture from an earlier source she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mister, but could you help me?\" Sayo asked the man in the cutesiest, most pathetic voice she could muster up. The shaman, who at the moment was about to start climbing the mountain, turned his head back to see the massive ghost girl before his eyes! But does he see her, or only sense her presence?</span></div></div>",

I'm a shaman, not a teleporting service. But if you can retrieve him and come back, I can perhaps still help you. It shouldn't nearly as long for you to get over here now as you were when you were originally...\" the shaman paused as he fully looked at the 2,000 ghost girl in front of him. He didn't realize just quite how big he was. \"Just how tall WERE you, originally? I doubt you've always been quite this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 4 foot 11\", Sayo replied as she stood on her butt on the ground to see the man better. \"At first I grew to 25 feet tall, then 200, then I ballooned near this mountain until I was 2,000 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing. You're the biggest ghost I've ever seen..anyway, bring back your teacher and we'll fix this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", Sayo smiled for the first time since her growth spurts began, running as fast as she could back to her native Japan. It would take her quite a while to get there: Sayo was lucky the first time because she was able to obtain rides on cruises and trains, taking advantage of her ghostly nature. Now the giantess would have to travel on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 3 weeks of traveling through a combination of walking, crossing oceans, and riding planes and such (the ghost girl did not gain weight when she grew, so she could still attach herself to smaller things easily), Sayo finally arrived at Mahora academy. She could sense great change in the academy: all her school mates were now in their final year of middle school, and one student (Chao) seemed to have left the school completely. It was a bright Sunday morning, not too different from when she first grew. Sayo quickly spotted Negi sitting on a bench near a building, reading his new third-year roster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things never change\", he smiled to himself as he read through his schedule, no different from last year. The only exceptions were Chao and, of course, Sayo. Negi sighed as he looked at Sayo's picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on Earth did she go, anyw...\" Negi began until he saw the enormous ghost girl before his eyes. Sayo was still under the assumption that Negi couldn't see her when he actually could, and Negi proceeded to scream at her intimidating size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei!! Can you see me!?\" Sayo quickly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-yes I can. I've d-developed my m-magic in great detail over the last several m-months, so now I can see y-you as clear as day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy to hear that\", Sayo cheered out loud, so happy that tears were rolling down her eyes. She then explained to Negi the events that happened to her over the last 7 or so months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite something. So you want me to travel to Africa to help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Negi-sensei. If you don't help me, I'll just continue to get bigger and bigger until I'm taller than Earth\", Sayo whimpered, growing to a bigger 2,200 feet before his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All r-right, Sayo-san. I'll help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sensei!! I promise I'll make this up to you somehow!\"</span></div></div>",

He was about 40 or 50 feet away, and he looked like he was about to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,what the heck\", Sakurako smiled to herself. \"I probably have plenty of time before they show up.\" With that, she ran straight up to Negi, who stopped what he was doing to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Negi-kun\", she smiled as she ran up to him, almost right to his face, startling the boy teacher a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, good morning, Sakurako-san\", he smiled in reply. \"Were you waiting for someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Misa and Madoka\", she replied, sighing. \"We were supposed to meet up today and hang out, but they're late. Anyway, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....me?\" Negi began, startled. \"Oh...nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the circle?\" she wondered, staring in the circle of dirt next to them. \"Are you summoning something?\" Then Sakurako paused for a bit, and smacked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I get it!\", she said outloud with confidence. \"This is for a play or movie! What's it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's about a giant rock\", he nervously half-lied to the girl, feeling ashamed of himself for doing such a thing. \"And....it grows and grows and they can't stop it. I was going to try out the, er, 'special effects'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I wanna see\", Sakurako smiled, running right behind Negi. \"Don't let me stop you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\", Negi replied, proceeding to put his staff up in the air. Perhaps if Sakurako wasn't aware he was doing magic, he wouldn't get chastised for it. With that, he proceeded to chant the magic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the pebble in the dirt began to grow bigger and bigger, up to at least 2 feet or so, when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That looks neat\", smiled Sakurako, who stepped closer and closer to the glowing, growing rock. \"I wonder how you did th...AHHH!\" Sakurako was then struck by the blue light, but only for a few seconds. At the end the pebble grew to 3 feet in height, and Sakurako collapsed on her legs on the ground, rubbing her hands on her stomach as if she just a tommyache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel right, Negi-kun\", Sakurako sadly sighed, then proceeded to stare straight in her teacher's face. \"Do I look okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi couldn't reply because of he shocked he was by what was happening to Sakurako. Her hair was growing at a rapid rate, as were her hands and head. Since Sakurako was rubbing her eyes she didn't notice the effects, including the then growth of her arms, stomach, butt, legs, and finally her feet. In a process of about 20 seconds the average-sized cheerleader was now the tallest ever alive at 25 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakurako had finally stopped rubbing her eyes and proceeding to stand up straight on her feet. Then she noticed the noticeably smaller trees and nearby buildings, able to see as high as the 6th floor in some of them. Sakurako was confused, unaware that she had grown into a giantess. Then she looked at the smaller Negi right blow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" she smiled in delight. \"A real-life replica set of Mahora Academy! I didn't know this movie was about a giantess\", she added, winking to her teacher from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah. That's what it is\", nerviously responded Negi. He had no idea how to tell her she had grown five timer her original height. What was a teacher to do? By this point Misa and Madoka had finally shown up at the front gate, only to notice the giantess cheerleader in the distance...how do they respond?</span></div></div>",

Oh I got It! I'll ask Negi-kun for his address so I can write him a letter!\" She then sprinted to her teacher. But just as she reached him, she was enveloped by a shroud of bright blue light that came from the circle beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is this?!\" Ako asked herself in shock. As the light faded, Negi opened his eyes and saw his student kneeling before him, clutching her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ako-san! Oh no! This is really bad!\" a worried Negi said outloud. He bent down to tend to her, only to be struck by her head as it almost tripled in size, as did the rest of her body, knocking the child teacher into the air. Ako then opened her eyes as the pain in her mid-section passed, finding herself holding Negi in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what happened just now!?\" she asked her teacher, who was rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got caught up in a.... in a... a growth spell...\", Negi replied hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-a growth spell?\", a very frightened Ako asked her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm a mage, and you got trapped in my growth spell. I'm really sorry, Ako-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a mage?!\" Ako asked, appalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sorry I have never told you. I haven't told nearly half the class this, actually. It's a very big secret that mustn't get out, less I be turned into an ermine\", Negi explained to his student as he cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ermine? Wow, isn't that a little...harsh?\" Ako inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of the worst punishments a mage can suffer. So please don't tell anyone about this\", Negi pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sensei, I won't\", Ako promised, much more confident about her height, which was roughly 30 meters tall now. \"Well, sensei...now what should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

As the gentle giantess placed her teacher on her left shoulder, Negi felt increasingly calmer about the recent growth his student had succumbed to. The two decided to walk into a nearby grass clearing, and Ako slowly placed Negi down on the ground. Having earlier packed a lunch for her that day, Ako decided to eat it now despite being morning still. Her increased size also brought an increased appetite, and as she proceeded to quickly eat the meal she had made she felt hungry still. But right now she couldn't simply head back to campus...that would be absurd. Instead, Ako used this time to get to know her teacher better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, feel free to ask me about anything you want\", Ako told her teacher as she smiled at him. \"Anything at all. I don't care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..if I remember correctly...you play in a band, right?\" Negi asked his student, who looked a little shocked by that knowledge he had. \"What kind of songs do you play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...some rock, some ballads..\", Ako shyly told her teacher. \"I can get quite nervous on stage easily at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we all?\" Negi giggled. \"Now you know how I feel teaching a class of girls several years my senior. Every DAY it feels like I'm playing a concert...only this one involving literature and knowledge, not music. Do you also sing, Ako-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", Ako nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you good? What do you sound like?\" an increasingly inquisitive Negi asked Ako, who felt like she was being put on the spot. Negi knew this, however, and then proceeded to stop asking her questions. He knew part of the reason that she was trying her hardest as of late was because of his \"older counterpart\" Nagi, and Negi thought it was about time he told her the truth about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ako-san...you know who Nagi is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I do! He's your handsome, kind older cousin. What about him?\" a brightly smiling Ako asked her teacher, her face directly staring at his, almost close enough to kiss the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's something you should know about him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? Is he going to visit campus soon? Are you two gonna hang out soon? What? Please tell me!\" Ako pleaded with her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...to tell you the truth, Nagi and I are...\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, she laughed at the idea that her teacher could be the same boy she had a crush on since the Mahora Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You two look nothing alike!\", Ako continued, looking at Negi with a disbelieving expression. To prove his point, though, Negi got out one of the age-changing candies that he had previously used at the festival earlier and quickly swallowed it down. Within a flash the once 10 year-old teacher was now the tall, skinny, good-looking 15 year-old boy that Ako had earlier come to have a crush on. The expression on her face was nothing short of total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what!?\" Ako asked herself as she banged her head into a nearby tree. \"I can't believe I've fallen in love with a 10 year-old!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ako-san, calm down!!\", Negi attempted to comfort his giantess student. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wish you told me earlier still, Negi-kun...now I feel really silly\", Ako said to herself as she cried a little. \"I must be the stupidest girl in Mahora Academy for falling for a little kid. Though come to think of it..I always thought 'Nagi' looked kind of familiar. Like that of a person watching over me from afar or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it wasn't love you felt, Ako-san?\" Negi asked his troubled student as she inched ever closer to her teacher, placing the boy on her lap and playfully stroking his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it was just me being a young fool in love. I won't deny that I'm a little downtrodden by the news you brought me, but I'm also glad you came out and told me the truth. Thank you, Negi-kun.\" And with that, Ako picked up Negi and proceeded to give the boy a kiss on the lips, shortly growing afterwards to a noticeably bigger 50 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ten year-old Negi-kun is cool, too\", she smiled at the boy as she then proceeded to hug him, growing ever further to 60 meters in height. Although glad that she was happy again, Negi was beginning to worry about his student's increasing size..</span></div></div>",

You weren't in bed when I woke up, so I came to see what was up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I guess you know about the 60 meter tall Ako walking behind me, huh?\" he whispered to the ermine, pointing to the very tall girl in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Are you referring to Iz-zu-zu-zu..........!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamo was at a loss of words. Such a towering figure of cute before him made it hard for him to control his male hormones. But more important than that, think of how much money a Pactio with a girl that big could bring him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you have to make a pact with her! Now!\" Chamo splurted out at a feverish pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Chamo-kun, I need to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....excuse me, Negi-kun, but what's going on? What are you talking to that hamster?\" Ako slowly asked, sitting on her knees to get a closer look at the ermine on the ground below, sitting on a tree stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bro's partner in magic. Together we've activated several Pactios with the power of a girl's kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl's kiss!?\" Ako blushed, unsure of what that meant. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I create a circle, Negi kisses a girl, and voila! The girl gets a card and a special power for doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm still confused, Chabo...Kabu...Kobo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chamo. The name's Chamo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still confused, Chamo-kun. Negi-kun, could you explain it better to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure would, Ako-san. You see....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi then proceeded to tell his student how he already made pacts with several of the girls in his class, and how as a result they've helped him inch ever closer to his goal of finding his father, the Thousand Master, as well as become a Magister Magi (Master Mage).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say that if I kiss you, we can form a pact, and I'll gain magic abilities?\" Ako carefully asked, still trying to follow everything she was being told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", nodded Negi. \"You don't have to if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to!\" forcefully replied Ako. \"Negi-kun, let's form a Pactio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're okay with it. Chamo-kun, you know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds a circle appeared below the feet of both Negi and the 60-meter tall Ako. Slowly but assuringly she pressed her lips closer and closer to her teacher, still thinking of Nagi as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do it, Izumi-san! Kiss me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Ako began to have second thoughts of the whole thing. She debated to herself that  it might help her overcome her growing dilemma. However, at the same time she felt extremely awkward kissing a 10 year-old boy about something she wasn't sure would even work, much less benefit her.</span></div></div>",

At least that's what she worried would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the pactio ended, and Ako found herself with a card with her own name and image on it. She was confused as to what she was supposed to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....now what, Negi-sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say 'Adeat', Ako-san.

Where did you go?\" a confused Ako asked as she turned her head to the ground, looking around for her teacher. She then paused for a moment and worried that she might have sat on him as she grew, unaware while still talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei!! Negi-sensei!?!

He tried not to show the pain, but that just made Ako all the more frustrated. She gently placed Negi on the ground as she wondered what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think back to your training, Ako\", she tried telling herself as she continued to mumble under her breath. \"But wait...come to think of it, is my syringe the only thing that could heal him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAko then proceeded to look at the 47 meter tall nursing tool in front of her, its tip almost, if not taller, than her teacher's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei said that I have magical healing abilities in this form...I hope he's correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly but assuringly, Ako very, very gently turned her teacher on his backside and took out the syringe. She then very slowly placed the tip of the needle onto his back, slowly injecting him with a tiny bit of fluids in his body. Ako then soon put away the syringe and waited for any results to follow up. When two minutes went by, with no sign at all of Negi getting better, Ako started to cry big tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this crying that Negi finally started to move, fully recovered from earlier. He tried to tell Ako this bit of good news, but the crying giantess couldn't hear him through the hands in front of her face. When she did finally let them go, though, she saw a happy Negi jokingly dance for her to show that his legs were healed. She then flashed the brightest smile he had possibly ever seen from any of his students (with the possible exceptions of Ayaka and Makie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, I'm so glad you're back to normal. You were right; I DO have healing abilities!\" the delighted Ako smiled at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And very good ones at that, Ako-san!\" he chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wonder if it's possible to inject myself and see if I can shrink myself back to my original size?

Maybe you should try something else first before you do that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe..but I'm not comfortable being a 70-meter tall girl in a pink nurse uniform.

She was just your typical run-of-the mill, red headed girl. She really despised her freckles but there was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day as she was on a walk through the huge Mahora campus, she unknowingly strode into Negi's magic circle. Since her head was down in worry (she worries a LOT), she could not see her teacher starting the spell. She sure felt it, though. A moment later she was wrapped in an intense blue light that radiated around her and even through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a warm sensation that can only be explained as drinking hot chocolate, coffee, or tea that has been warmed to the exact right heat on a cold day. She felt her body give way and stretch out. It continued to stretch until it stopped abruptly and she opened her eyes and lifted her head. She saw a tree about her height directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked herself. \"There aren't any trees at Mahora that are my height. Unless they just planted a new one or something.\" She felt a slight tap on her knee. She looked down to see her teacher. From where she was he only came up to the top of her shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAHH!! L-l-l-little Negi-sensei!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsumi-san, please be quiet. If someone hears you we will both get in trouble', Negi said in a tone only slightly more level-headed than his freaked out giantess student. \"Please sit down so no one sees you.\" His pupil began to sink to her knees and weep into her hands. Negi walked up to her and patted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsumi-san, please don't cry. This is my fault\", Negi said, trying to comfort the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei's fault? B-b-but how can that be?\" she sniffed in-between tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm.... kind of a mage\", Negi explained hesitantly. \"I casted a growth spell and you stepped into the magic circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a growth spell?\" she said, wiping the tears away from her face. \"So that's what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm very sorr-hmph!\" Negi started to say before he received a large hug from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Negi-sensei!\" she chirped happily. \"Now that I'm big, I'm not scared of things so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? You aren't mad about this? I accidentally made you 20 meters tall!\" Negi said, appalled at his student's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, silly! I might have been scared for a second, but I'm not mad at all! But we SHOULD find a way to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. But do you think I should make you a little bigger? I mean it could be dangerous. We might need it\", Negi asked, worried about what was going to happen next. What should they do?</span></div></div>",

Just don\u2019t make too big to not see you\u201d, teased Natsumi, playfully sticking her tongue out at her young teacher. And with that Negi decided to make another circle in the dirt around the 20 meter tall Natsumi, once again performing the incantation. The already tall giantess noticed her body growing ever further from the ground, with even the tallest trees on campus grounds looking like mere shrubs to her growing stature. Within moments she grew from 20 meters to an even more impressive 100 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, everything\u2019s so small\u201d, a shocked Natsumi said to herself as she lifted her teacher to his face level. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not scaring you, Negi-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Natsumi-san!

She had noticed something was amiss and she turned around to see something that brought tears to her eyes. It was Negi, her child teacher, who up until now was so adult-like and mature beyond his years, was playing in the dirt. She ran up to him and hugged him, smothering the boy in her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun! It's good to see you playing like a normal child should!\" she said resting her chin on the top of his head and smiling. \"I was worried that you might grow up too fast and miss your childhood fun!\" Negi pulled away from his student just before the blue light of his spell enveloped her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Chizuru-san, get out of there!\" Hh screamed to his student. She couldn't hear him. She was over come by what was surely the greatest feeling she had ever experienced. She felt her body loosen up and stretch out. Her body as a whole was overpowered by a warm sensation that loosened her up even more. Her eyes were comfortably closed until the feelings stopped abruptly and she felt the chill of the early Sunday morning air sweep across her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrr...it's really cold, sensei\", Chizuru said her teacher, her eyes still closed. But when she finally opened them her teacher was nowhere to be found. She looked in all directions before feeling something very small crawling onto her left knee. She looked down and was shocked at what she saw. It was Negi! Her teacher was now roughly the size of a watch to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun. Y-y-you shank!\" she said, beginning to panic while picking Negi up and thrusting him to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no I didn't, Chizuru-san. Well you, umm...how can I explain this? You kinda, well, grew\", Negi stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? But h-how is that even possible?\" she said, surprised. Negi went on to tell her his connection with magic. Once he was done Chizuru had grown from about 30 meters to a staggering 100 meters into the open skies above Mahora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a mage, am I correct Negi-kun?\" He nodded. \"Then you can fix this... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would need a little time but I'm sure I can fin-\" he started before he was cut off as Chizuru's chest enveloped, this time instead of just his head, his whole form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just TOO cute! And a mage no less! I knew there was more to you than just being a genius Negi-kun. I just KNEW!\" she chirped as she removed Negi from between her giant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizuru-san. We have to get you back to normal or something very bad will happen to me\", Negi said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of bad thing?\" She asked looking even more worried than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one I'll be turned into an ermine an-\" he was again cut off by another trip into his students enormous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No one will be turning MY sensei into an ermine! I won't allow it!\" she said removing Negi yet again, this time placing him on her lap. \"As long as no one sees you and we get this fixed we don't have to worry about that.\" Negi grimaced. \"We really should be getting to Master (Evangeline) to ask her about this\", he told his student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but...Negi-kun. Could we please show Natsumi, Ayaka, and Kotarou-kun this?\" she asked the boy, bringing him up to her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I d-d-don't think that's such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Negi-kun\", she pleaded with a kicked puppy look that would put any plush doll to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhh...\" Negi thought over to himself.

And why are you calling her Master?\" Chizuru asked with a worried stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's teaching me and requires me to call her 'Master', Negi explained as Chizuru stuck out her tongue in disgust. \"And we should see her because she's Magister Magi (or great mage).

By the time the process was done she was on the ground in a not particularly comfortable position, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch-Chizu-Chizuru-san!\" Negi stuttered.

It took them a while to see he was not floating, but standing. Standing on an enormous hand so delicate it could only belong to one person. Chizuru.

I'm worried that if you get any bigger, you may outgrow Mahora Academy itself. You'd be too small to see Natsumi-san and Kotarou, much less protect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, sensei!

It's hard to say \"no\" to such a sad, distraught face from a pretty girl like the face Chizuru used earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChizuru soon left the campus, which wasn't so hard for her to do at her new height, covering ground up to 60 times faster than when she was at her original height. The 100 meter tall giantess stopped at a lake, gently putting Negi, Natsumi, and Kotarou down on the ground, the latter two finally waking up from earlier, only to see the giant face of Chizuru smile down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizu-nee!! What happened to you!?\" a freaked out Natsumi asked her friend, tears of shock running down her face. Kotarou, meanwhile, was just plain shocked, the hairs on the top of his head standing up in surprised shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, you two! Ready to get big like me?\" the happy giantess asked the two playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Natsumi asked her friend. \"How did you get big in the first place?\"</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, Natsumi and Kotarou were confused as to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, if you may?\" jokingly commanded Chizuru to her teacher, who only nodded in reply as the two watched Natsumi and Kotarou glow in a bright, light blue color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\" Negi then shouted out loud as a bright flash of light went to and enveloped both of Chizuru's roommates. They felt very warm as the growth slowly proceeded to take effect, like they were wrapped up in a blanket. Natsumi's growth was starting much faster and in much bigger spurts than Kotarou's, and within seconds she was at a height of around 25 meters. Her growth was soon followed after by Kotarou's, who stopped at about 20 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, you shrunk!\" an astonished Kotarou exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everything so much smaller?\" a worried Natsumi added quickly after him. \"What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....you grew\", Negi told them point blank. Natsumi looked quite upset about this shocking revelation, though Kotarou not so much. In fact, he seemed to find it to be pretty neat. Chizuru, meanwhile, simply smiled at the height of her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you two make such cute mini-giants\", Chizuru squealed happily as she hugged both Kotarou and Natsumi between her rather large chest. \"It's like hugging human plush dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizu-nee, please stop\", Natsumi suggested to her very tall friend, finding it very hard to breath with her face smothered in her chest. She then asked her friend, \"How did we fix this?\" Chizuru, however, simply replied, \"I don't know\", causing Natsumi to quickly grab her teacher and shake him rapidly, making Negi very dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, please fix this\", a worried Natsumi asked of her teacher. \"I don't want to be the size of a building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I COULD try a reversal spell by replacing the Latin word for 'Increase' with that of 'Decrease', but I don't know if that would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.

I will finish it up for him/her as the momentous 150th chapter of this story! Thanks so much for the addition over the last several months!)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatsuki Yotsuba (though she was usually referred to by her last name) was walking along the pathway that lead from the dorms to the gather ingrediants for a special meal. Being a chef at heart, she knew that thinking with her slightly plump stomach was the way to go. She had a very specific list and she knew just where to go. As she strolled down the sidewalk she noticed her teacher, Negi, with his hands raised and his eyes closed. She approached him slowly, not wanting to disturb him. Just as she got close enough to touch his shoulder a shot of blue light from the tip of his staff shot through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Yotsuba yelped, confused by the light that shot through her, closing her eyes from its brightness. She then touched her body to see if anything happened to her. It didn't hurt, though she was greatly confused by what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei...what were you doing?\" she politely asked her teacher as he started to sweat fairly big drops from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Satsuki-san...well, um...I hate to tell you this, but...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" she innocently smiled at her teacher, unaware of the growth currently happening to her, slowly developing her body in size, now at the 7 foot mark! Negi wanted to tell his student of her growing development, but he was too shocked by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, is there something wrong with me? Do I have something on my face?\" Now at the 11 foot mark, Yotsuba slowly noticed that she was growing. She didn't panic, though, much to a bewildered Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satsuki-san, um....you're growing..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? You're silly, sensei. I know I'm a growing girl, but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as in you're growing really big! You're over 15 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" a baffled Yotsuba said to herself again, standing back-to-back alongside her teacher. He was right; she <i>was</i> growing! And getting bigger, now at the 25 foot mark!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Satsuki-san, I should tell something that you may or may not have already figured out. I'm a mage..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mage!?\" a shocked Yotsuba, now over 35 feet tall, asked her teacher. \"Is that why I'm growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm afraid. And if anyone found out about this, I'd be stripped of my powers and turned into an ermine. Also, I don't even know how big you're going to get. I wouldn't be surprised if you were upset right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi was too afraid to look at his growing student in the eye after having spilled the beans on his being a mage, not noticing her growing  to 60 feet tall. He did feel something, though; her growing hands grabbing hold of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't hurt me, Satsuki-san!\" Negi screamed, fearing the worst. He then heard loud laughter coming out of the cheerful, growing cook as she patted him on the head with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, I'm not mad at you! An I'm glad you told me the truth.\" And with that Yotsuba hugged in her arms as she finally stopped growing at the height of 120 feet tall, surprising even herself when she noticed the change around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Everything seems so small now..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satsuki-san, it's a little late to ask, but why were you out here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was getting ingredients to cook something, but it doesn't look I can do that now that I'm so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true! I-I can help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Negi-sensei!? That's so sweet of you!\" With that, Satsuki (who was still holding her teacher in her arms from earlier) hugged Negi once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being so kind to me over the last few months, Negi-sensei! But how exactly are we going to go about this?\"</span></div></div>",

She ran past an empty clearing where she barley saw her teacher, Negi. She stopped abruptly but the ball slipped from her grip, careening towards him at a very high speed. Just as Negi finished the growth spell's incantations, the ball smacked into the back of his head. A flash of light shot from his upraised staff and ran directly through Yuna's torso. She then collapsed on the ground, clutching the area where the light had gone through. Her eyes were tightly closed, so she couldn't see Negi running to her aid. She felt him resting her head on his lap and the icy touch of his hand to her burning forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Negi-kun?\" she gasped. \"W-what was that light?\" Her question resulted in Negi's sighing. How could he explain to his student that he was a mage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the thing is... I'm a mage\", he said reluctantly to his student. As he finished saying this he felt a large weight press against his lap. It was Yuna's head! It was growing so rapidly that he had to lower it as gently as possible to the ground and step away from it, as well as the rest of her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun!? What's happening?!\" she said, frightened by the size difference between her and her teacher. She curled into a ball until she reached what seemed to be her final height of 50 meters. The results left Negi looking at her in awe and shock. She rolled over to look at her tiny teacher and picked him up gently, bringing him up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-how did I get this big?\" she asked, so confused that Negi could feel her shaking, quivering hands vibrating his body as she asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..you said you were a mage right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi nodded to his student in reply, looking ashamed of what he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Then you did this, sensei?\" a confused Yuna asked her teacher, inching him a little close to her face. Again Negi nodded in reply, half expecting the worst. Instead, Yuna only kissed him and set him back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" Negi yelled. \"I make you a giantess and you kiss me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm\", she replied, smiling a bright smile to her \"small\" teacher. \"I've always wanted to be really big! Thank you, sensei! Now I can beat anyone at any sport! HAHAHA!\" And with that, Yuna laughed as she ran off to show off her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUNA-SAN, WAIT!\" Negi yelled. He began to sprint after her, but does he stop her?</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be for naught, though...all of a sudden a smiling Yuna walked back up to Negi, holding Ako and Akira in each of her gigantic hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo\", Yuna said to her teacher with a monosyllable reply. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuna-san, why are you holding Akira-san and Ako-san in your hands..?\" a befuddled Negi asked his giantess student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was about to challenge them at sports.

I thought this only happened in the movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. It's quite a surprise\", Akira added. Yuna, however, was getting tired of waiting for something to happen, so she placed Negi and both of her friends in her left short pocket and proceeded to walk once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Negi reluctantly asked his student, feeling every bump and movement Yuna made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To play sports!\" Yuna replied, not really answering Negi's question.

My basket will be to the left, and yours will be to the right\", Yuna explained to the \"tiny\" people below her feet. \"Do you guys want to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuna-san, this isn't fair! You're so much taller than we are!\" Ako told her friend, shouting to her in an attempt to make her opinion more heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Do you want to grow bigger as well?\" asked Yuna, quieting Ako up pretty quickly, not wanting to grow to a building sized girl herself. And with that silence came Yuna lifting the ball and placing it in her teacher's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first, Negi-kun\", she told his teacher as he gently patted his head with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not very good at this game..\", Negi told Yuna as Akira blew the whistle, signaling the start of the game. She then took the ball politely from her teacher and proceeded to ran to the left side of the court, hoping to avoid Yuna's long legs and feet. Although a swimmer at heart, Akira was still fairly athletic and agile, and although not as fast as some of the other girls in her class, could still hold her own in a basketball game. Yuna barely moved around the court, instead waiting for the opportunity to grab her friend and take the ball by force. It wasn't any good, though: Akira quickly threw the ball to Ako right after being snatched by the athletic giantess, who proceeded to run as fast as she could and scored the first goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys are better than I thought\", Yuna admitted, smiling at the surprising coordination her two fellow students had. \"Perhaps you'd like to grow and make this a fairer game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", Akira pandered. \"I don't think I want to grow really big..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I\", added Ako, Negi nodding in agreement with her. Yuna was disappointed by this reaction. She wanted to have a really interesting game, and although her friends would soon exhaust themselves to avoid the giantess before them, it wouldn't make for a fun game if she simply took the ball from the tired girls and proceeded to score several shots consecutively in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, do you know a spell that can make people always full of energy or something similar for long periods of time?\" Yuna asked him, holding him in her left hand and placing him at her eye level. \"I want this game to be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did once use a spell that made my class more focused. I don't know if it will work in this case, but I could try. Then again, I could...always grow Ako-san and Akira-san...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's up to you, Negi-kun. You're the one with the power here\", reminded Yuna. \"But I'll be happy with whatever decision you make.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately she wasn't able to dodge the blast at the end, but it faded to near nothingness before hitting her, so Akira didn't even notice.

Are you all right?\" a worried Akira asked him, proceeding to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..it's not that..it's just..well..\", Negi began in a rushed, hectic manner, knowing full well that the spell was going to grow his 5 foot or so student into a gigantic giantess in a manner of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei...what are you trying to say-y-y-y-yyy....!?\" Akira asked before the growth spell started coming into effect, first growing her feet by ten times their normal size. Then her legs grew, causing her to grow over 30 feet in size. Next up was her stomach and chest, then her arms, hands, and hair. Lastly was her head, which looked quite awkward in comparison to the rest of her grown body, growing to ten times its regular size like the rest of her. When all was said and done, the somewhat shy swim club member had grown to a staggering height of 50 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-wh-wh-what's h-h-happened to me!?\" Akira shyly blurted out, sitting on her knees and looking quite upset. \"Sensei...did you do this??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um........maybe\", Negi hesitated to reply, fearing the worst of Akira's reaction. Normally she was very gentle and kind, but at this height there was no telling what she could do at her newfound size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akira-san....it's time to tell you what I've told a third of my class already. I'm actually a mage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WHAT!?\" a surprised Akira looked in astonishment, sitting down now on the ground on her butt and placing Negi on her lap. \"Are y-you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am.

I guess that may explain to you some of the odder events in this school in the past few months..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it...I always did think there was something different about you, sensei.

Although only a couple of inches off the ground, to Akira it seemed like several stories! And all she could do was flail her arms and hope to land on something soft upon arriving back on terra firma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, Akira felt straight into the mud, soaking her body from hair to toe. She also found herself spewing out quite a bit of mud as she proceeded to move forward, hoping to rinse her body off with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seemed to have lost of Negi-sensei now. I should've stayed big..\", Akira told herself as she continued to walk pass giant-sized nuts and grass blades, hoping to not get spotted by a bird or an ant or some other animal. She soon enough found a little water puddle to rinse the mud off of her clothes...but several earthworms were in the water as well. Normally tey wouldn't bother Akira, but at her size their grossness factor went up significantly when seen up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck!\" a disgusted Akira gagged as she decided to dip her body in the water anyway, soon enough getting somee of the mud off of her. Thankfully she wore her swimsuit, so getting her clothes soaked wasn't quite as bad as it would if she were, say, in her school uniform. After a while of scrubbing with her hands (which, again, grossed Akira out), she proceeded to continue walking around the field, hoping to be spotted by either Negi or another one of her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her teacher in question was about to shrink himself and his staff down so as to find Akira, using a mirror to deflect the blast back at him to find her. However, Negi was a shoddy aim when it came to this growing and shrinking stuff, so did it end up shrinking him, or did it end up hitting someone else on the field?</span></div></div>",

Instead, the spell bounced off the mirror and scattered all across the field, shrinking various flowers, rocks, and insects here and there. Thanfkully Akira was not struck by this blast (she was small enough as it is), but she knew that her teacher was close by when the grass blades only a few feet in front of her were now \"normal sized\" in comparison to her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty weird, actually. One square foot everything looked normal sized to Akira, the next she was extremely tiny. It was nothing short of awkward, especially when she found a nearby dog. The dog seemed to be a puppy, barely a couple of months old. It fur was dark brown, its ears short and pointy, and it looked both happy and scared at the same time, wagging its tail happily around Akira while also whimpering. The puppy was about 5 times the size of Akira, but it definitely seemed to have shrunk down in size from the spell. She slowly walked up the to the puppy and reached out her left hand to it, watching as the dog licked her face in response, soaking her whole head, as well as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira then attempted to climb up the shrunken puppy, finding a nearby tree branch and climbing up it. She then slowly made her descent down to the backside of the puppy, thankful for her athletic ability to do so in a time like this. When she got on the puppy, she then climbed up to its head and started rubbing its head with her heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll help you find your owner. Do you know where he or she is?\" she cutely asked the puppy, who just started walking forward as she asked. Akira was not so sure if the puppy was even listening to her or not, and simply held on to its fur as it began to take move.</span></div></div>",

During that time she did not see hide nor hair of anyone from her class, or of her teacher Negi. Akira sighed in frustration as the puppy to a rest at a puddle to drink some of its water. It was at this time that she mounted off the puppy and tried to look at its collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA further look on the dog's collar revealed that it was owned by someone named Chihaya Inutsuki. That was not a name that Akira was familiar with, though truth be told she never quite learned all her classmates' names. Akira figured that the owner was probably a girl, considering how young and youthful the happy was. She doubted an adult would buy a newborn puppy unless they bought it for someone or they were taking care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time the puppy decided to lay around on the dirt underneath its feet, gathering dust in Akira's direction. As the girl coughed from the dust it was forming, she heard a familiar voice not too far from her. It was Negi! Akira screamed aloud to her teacher, waving her arms in the air jumping as high she could. The puppy also joined in, barking its tiny, high-pitched barks aloud for him to hear. Fortunately he heard the noise and stopped walking mere feet in front of Akira, who sighed in relief that she was able to avoid meeting her teacher's foot. Negi then looked down in the grass below and started feeling the grass underneath him before finally finding Akira, who was knocked down by his left hand's sheer force against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful, sensei!\" she scolded the boy as he drooped his head and apologized. \"Negi-sensei, do you know of a way to make me normal sized again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could use the spell I used to make you big again, but it may not work...\" Negi hadn't yet noticed the small puppy, but he did when he felt something rubbing against his left shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, that's a liost dog I found\", Akira explained as she climbed up Negi's right pant leg, his shirt, and then all the way up to right in front of his nose. \"Could you perhaps make it bigger? I doubt it'll find its owner at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\", Negi nodded, making a fairly big circle in the dirt below and performing the same spell he made Akira grow with earlier that day.

As he uttered the final incantation the small dog rolled over and looked expectantly at the child teacher. Slowly but surly the puppy grew. Hair by hair, limb by limb the dog returned to its original stature of just about two feet tall. It yelped as it jumped so high that Negi had to catch it and hold it back to avoid having his face become drenched in the dog's drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira carefully strolled across Negi's arm and patted the hyperactive little creature on its fury head. \"Now you go run along and find your master alright?\" she told it with a smile. The puppy wriggled out of Negi's grasp and  landed on its feet on the grassy terrain. It then looked back and barked, then continued in running across the field towards where it had no doubt become lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sensei? Do you think you can repeat your actions?\" Akira asked her larger counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But I'm unsure of how large you will become. For all I know you could end up being two feet like that dog, or you could continue growing until you reach giantess status\", Negi replied with a grimace. \"The chances are unknown to me at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should try anyway. Just make sure you stand with your back to the wind so I don't fly off again\", said Akira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Here\", he said as he placed her in the same circle as the puppy. However, this time he was placing himself between his student and the gusts of the Sunday afternoon as he started the spell again. But does it have any effect on growing humans?

One of the more reclusive students of his, he seldom talked to her outside of school, though he did remember hanging out with her at the school festival just a little while back (including being surprised by her wielding of guns), and before that helping \"reveal\" Sayo the ghost girl to both his class and himself. Today she was dressed casually, however, dressed up in a long, black dress that looked quite good on the dark-tanned girl, with matching black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, I'm surprised to see you out here so early\", she gasped at the sight of her teacher. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trying out a spell. Nothing special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. What kind of spell, may I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....a growth spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Growth??\" Mana wondered, stepping closer to her teacher. She then rubbed her chin a little. \"Your magic is that powerful, Negi-sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just learned it last night, so I'm going to test it out on this pebble here in the dirt first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi watched as his student proceeded over to the dirt circle and picked up the pebble with her right hand. She then flicked it away from her, causing him to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, what are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, it's dangerous to do this in front of so many people. What don't you try this inside or in the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. It was so silly of me\", Negi sighed, Mana sighing quickly after him. However, she also patted his head, smiling at the boy as she began to suggest something to him regarding his growth spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to polish my guns today , but you have me intrigued now, Negi-sensei. So why don't we go to the Tatsumiya Shrine? It's usually fairly quiet on Sunday, so we can try it out inside. It won't be too difficult to get in since it belongs to my parents and that I work there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That''s right!\" Negi remembered, recalling seeing her dressed up in priestess clothes before. \"I recall seeing you there before, Mana-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's go!\" Mana told her teacher, walking ahead of him. Negi hurried behind her, shouting to her \"Wait up, Mana-san!\" as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too far of a walk away from where they were, thankfully. The Tatsumiya shrine was on the Mahora Academy campus itself, so it wasn't something Negi was unfamiliar with or anything like that. When they finally arrived there, Mana and Negi then headed inside, and Negi made a circle on the ground with chalk instead of dirt, putting another pebble in the center of the circle. Mana stood on the opposite side of the room, watching as Negi lifted his staff in the air and began to recant the incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light then followed, causing both Negi and Mana to close their eyes due to its intense brightness. When the light finally died down, though, the pebble seemed to be the same size. The child teacher looked upset, the same expression on his face that a kid gets when he barely misses the ice cream truck that passed by his street. Mana came up to the saddened boy and patted him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel too bad, Negi-sensei. One day you'll get it right\", she assured her teacher. \"Just keep practicing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\", a more determined Negi replied, pumping his left hand into a fist. \"I will get stronger, and one day I will get it to work! Thanks, Mana-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Ouch!\" Mana went, rubbing her head against the top of the ceiling. She then looked down below her, noticing that her legs were over twice their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-M-Mana-sssss-an....\" Negi gasped, stepping back a few steps at the sight of his growing student. Mana quickly crawled on her foot out of the shrine and stood right outside of it, her legs then expanding in size once more. Then her feet grew to compliment them, as did quickly her hair, arms, hands, her stomach, chest, butt, and head. She then surged in growth bit by bit afterwards until she finally stopped at the incredible height of 70 feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei.....! It worked....but...\", Mana whimpered, standing on the ground on her butt, her long legs stretched out before her teacher. Even her feet seemed gigantic, with one of her feet being alone taller than Negi himself! She continued to blush red in embarrassment as she wondered what happened, which was a rare emotion for Negi to see from her. Usually Mana was serious and level-headed, but now she was panicky, even nervous at her new giantess height. Is it possible her mood changed when she grew as well?</span></div></div>",

She then stood up once again, walking away from the shrine, with Negi running behind her. She was heading away from campus, only finally stopping once she made it to a clearing near a river. She then stood down again on her butt, looking at the river below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Mana-san!!\" Negi profusely apologized as he continuously bowed up and down to his student. \"This must affect your entire day's routine! I wouldn't have done this if I kn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh\", commented Mana as she placed with her giant fingers on Negi's mouth. \"It's okay. You didn't do this on purpose.\" She then smiled a warm smile at him, yet another sight Negi seldom saw from her (if ever).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem really different, Mana-san. I thought you would freak out and stomp me for causing this change in you, but you act like nothing happened! I'm confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sensei, it seems that the spell changes not only a person's height, but also their attitude. At least from what I gathered. I do admit that at first, yes I was quite angry (and scared), but the taller I got the more serene I felt.\" Mana then hugged her teacher in a warm, soft giantess embrace, growing to a further 80 feet as she did so. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess so...but I don't know how to reverse this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time! I wasn't planning on anything today aside from polishing my guns\", chirped Mana, once again hugging her teacher in a soft embrace. Negi, meanwhile, kept blushing red all through out. \"Isn't it a nice day outside, sensei? It's so rare that I get to spend time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yeah\", Negi replied, a bit worried about Mana's new height. As she continued to stare at the scenery around her, she grew once more to 90 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, want to hang out somewhere?\" she asked him, her voice being a lot more cheerful sounding. Her clothing seemed to have changed as well, going from her long, beautiful black dress to a more casual pink shirt and black, medium-length skirt. Her boots slowly changed into a pair of cute, white sandals as well. Even her hair, when usually went straight down her back, was now in a braided ponytail. It was official: Mana was becoming more playful and acting more like a typical teenage girl before his eyes. She even wore little star earrings on her ears now, as if that wasn't enough of a change already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Negi-kun!\" she playfully demanded her teacher, kissing him on the lips and then scooping him up with her hands, placing the boy on her head. She then grew again to exactly 100 feet tall as she headed off somewhere.</span></div></div>",

Negi quickly grabbed something to eat from inside, coming back with a few rice balls in his hands. He then grew them with the same spell that made Mana grow, and the cheerful giantess quickly grabbed them (and Negi) and headed back to the clearing she was at earlier. She felt very serene around the water..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Negi-kun!\" she thanked her teacher, bowing down to him even. \"I was getting pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stomach rumbled like a small earthquake\", Negi commented, laughing a little bit, soon joined in by Mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty loud, wasn't it?\" she agreed, continuing to eat her giant rice ball (although to her it was a little smaller than a typical rice ball. Fortunately there were 3 of them for her to eat). Once she finished eating them, she then stared at Negi once more. She noticed he had some rice on his face, so she picked some off with her giant left index finger and proceeded to lick it. Negi blushed at the girl's cheerful smile she gave him. There was no doubt that Mana was pretty for a girl her age, but her tall stature made her all the more so. She then laid flat on the ground and turned her head to Negi, looking ready to ask the boy a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun....do you like....anyone in particular in our class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question caused Negi to choke on the food he was eating, being saved by Mana's quick reflexes, slapping the boy's back to help him swallow the food down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-of course I do! I l-like all my students!\" he explained haphazardly to a smiling, giggling Mana, who then placed the boy on her lap facing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...do you like me, in particular? I  know I'm the most attentive student in your class, but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, I don't think of you any less than I do the students I spend more time with\", he explained point blank to his student. He felt very confident about what he said, and he didn't stutter once in that whole sentence. And then suddenly he met with Mana's big, giantess lips, which softly kissed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a sweet boy, Negi-kun!\" she told him growing in size to 120 feet. \"That made me very happy to hear you say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Negi and Mana could continue talking, though, she scooped up the boy once more and placed her on her head again. She then seemed to be moving forward into the forest, soon leaving it and heading constantly north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, where are we going!?\" Negi wondered, holding on tightly to his student's braided hair as they continued to move forward, feeling each step she made on the ground as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hang out some more, Negi-kun!\" she replied with a grin. \"It's only 9:30. Let's spend the whole day together!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only was she starting to grow again, but it seemed like she was getting smaller in some areas. Her eyes were becoming bigger in proportion to her head, her breasts shrunk in size, and her arms and legs seemed a little smaller overall to her body, and a little chubbier as well. Even her hair was going through some changes, becoming shorter and slightly lighter in color. She looked almost Negi's age now, and the 140 foot tall giantess ran like a shot closer to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Negi-kun. I wanna see the sights!\" she exclaimed to her teacher in a more childish sounding voice, which had gone up a pitch since earlier. However, when she came up to the gates, she was met with some disappointment...and slowly she walked back to the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say I'm too 'big a prop' to enter through\", Mana sighed as she sat down on the ground below her. \"Mana really wanted to go to the park today, too..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, it's okay. We'll do something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I want to go the amusement park! Oh how I wish I could shrink in size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, you can't shrink yourself...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Negi tried to say, anyway. He was quite surprised when he realized that Mana <i>was</i> willing herself to shrink down in size, dwindling down and down before her teacher's eyes. Before Negi went up to the tip of her feet when standing up, but now his student was at a much more manageable level in terms of size. She continued to shrink down until she was only 50 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That's better!\" Mana gleamed with delight as she grabbed Negi by the hands and raced to the gates again. This time the \"robot\" and her \"operator\" were allowed in, and Mana was all smiles about the sights and sounds around her. Candy, rides, games, face paint...she wanted to see it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really caught Mana's eye was an upside-down roller coaster on the far end of the park. It went up to 90 feet in the air at a speed of at least 60 miles per hour, dropping down to a 80 foot fall before spinning around the rest of the end of the park for the next minute and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, want to ride that with me?\" wondered Mana as she and her teacher went to a nearby ticket booth to buy tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mana-san, you're too big..\", the child teacher noted, which she wasn't surprised to hear. She was just a few minutes ago even taller than the coaster, so it came to no surprise to her that she couldn't ride it...at least not at her current size.</span></div></div>",

It certainly looked like it to him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-kun, what's wrong?\" Mana asked, putting her face close to his. \"Are you daydreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, no!

You look nice, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T..thank you..\" the flustered boy replied, unable to think straight after the kiss.

As he was able to stop, though, he noticed a girl walking by. She was a fairly short girl, with black hair in braids and very large glasses on her face, and she was wearing a white lab coat. In her hands were mechanical supplies of some sort. Negi quickly knew who that was right away; one of his students, Satomi! Not only one of the smartest students (if not <i>the</i> smartest) in his class, but in all of Mahora Academy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, good morning!\" the excited girl said to her teacher as she stopped in place and slowly walked over. \"What are you up to this early in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's kind of silly. Out of curiosity, Satomi-san, do you think people can grow to bigger sizes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Sensei, are you okay..?\" Satomi looked extremely baffled by her teacher's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an innocent question, Satomi-san. I mean, you made a talking, functional robot who looks and sounds human, so I figured that you maybe..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei, I don't believe that humans can grow to giant proportions. That's just silly, especially coming out of you. Do <i>you</i> think they can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course n-not! It was just a simple question..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi attempted his hardest to defend himself from the corner that he put himself at, thinking that Satomi already saw through him. That she hadn't yet asked why he made a circle in the dirt and was wielding a wooden staff in front of her eyes surprised him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, are you hiding something from me?\" the curious student asked him as she placed his forehead right next to his. \"I don't think the question you asked was simply out of the blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if I tell you, will you promise not to tell anyone? Like, really promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of what? That you have magic powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW!?!? Oh great..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sensei. It's not a big deal! Evangeline-san told me from time to time in the past, so don't be too surprised. After all, I AM the one who takes care of her partner Chachamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is true. But if you know I have magic abilities, then why do you doubt growing people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I do. Besides, I've never heard of such a thing in any of my visits to Library Island, and I've read most every book there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. You could give most high school students a run for their money, Satomi-san. Well, if you're still skeptical, I was going to ask if you could witness my growing of this pebble with a spell I recently discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discovered....?\" Satomi paused, never hearing of such a thing in the very few magic books she ever read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. But I'm going to relocate to behind the school, so if you want to check it out, follow me\", Negi told his student as he picked up the pebble and brushed off the circle in the dirt with his shoes. Satomi quickly followed behind, like a dog following behind a person with meat in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Negi was in a patch of green scenery not too far from Mahora Academy. Satomi, meanwhile, watched on a log about 15 feet away, looking fairly unimpressed and even yawning in response to what her teacher was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei, please hurry this up! I have work to do on Chachamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\", he quickly blurted in reply, then drawing a circle in the dirt and placing the pebble there once again. He then proceeded to pick up his staff and incant the spell, pointing his staff right at the pebble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi watched as a light blue light shone from his staff and hit the pebble, causing it to slowly grow. Unfortunately, that same blast reflected a little off the pebble and right into Satomi's chest, like an arrow going through her body. It didn't hurt her, and she barely saw the light (as did Negi), but he still felt that something had gone wrong when the spell ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" the surprised teacher said to himself as he saw the pebble had grown to almost 3 feet tall, almost 30 times its regular size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satomi-san, did you see!? The spell worked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unh....Negi-sensei, I don't feel so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi quickly ran over to his student and proceeded to lift her up from the log, her body feeling as if it was paralyzed to him. It didn't help that she continue to shiver rapidly, and a few seconds later even glowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satomi-san!!!\" he screamed as Satomi closed her eyes and fell stomach first on the ground, heavily panting and sweating. He quickly turned her over and prepared to try to lift her up again, until he noticed something...Satomi was getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly her head and neck grew in spurts of growth until they were a little more than 30 times their original size. Then came her chest, her arms, her hands, stomach, butt, and lastly her legs and feet, all of which also grew to 30 times their size! By the time it was finished, Satomi had grown to a height of exactly 150 feet! And everything, including her glasses, had grown along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Satomi proceeded to sit up and look at the environment around her, but especially at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sensei..you were right\", Satomi yawned, acting as if she had slept for 10 hours, when she was only out for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satomi-san, are you all right? Can you stand up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I think so\", Satomi replied, standing straight up, though a little slow at doing so. \"Wow! Everything looks so tiny! Including you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new giantess then gave Negi a quick peck on the cheek, both bewildered and happy at the same time by the recent events around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satomi-san!...\", Negi gushed, still shocked by the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi-sensei! This is the coolest thing ever! Could you possibly make me even bigger!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-E-E-EH!?!?\" Negi was unsure of how to respond!</span></div></div>",

One, he was afraid Satomi would blab if he didn't listen to her (and considering the height difference now, he didn't like that option). And two, he felt something odd about the grown Satomi. One of the more quiet students of his, he saw this growing of her as his way of spending time of her. A weird way, indeed, but a way nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatomi was all smiles as she felt her body ever expanding in size once again, delighted by the growth of her feet, which slowly crept all the way up to the rest of her growing body until she was an amazing 300 feet tall, twice the size she was before! When the growing was all finished, Satomi proceeded to pick up her teacher once again and kiss him. She had to careful, though, as Negi was a little less than an inch high in scope to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so...powerful! So big! So wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satomi-san...you're not going to do anything reckless, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Satomi could do was cackle a little at her teacher's reply, placing him in her lab coat pocket as she proceeded further away from Mahora Academy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zazie Rainyday was a student of few words. She didn't speak in class, much less anywhere else. On the incredibly rare occasions when she {i]did{/i] talk, it was usually a simple one or two word sentence. She was also the class clown...literally. She was a circus performer, and a good one at that. The tattoos on her face shown brightly in the gorgeous sunlight on this fine Sunday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Zazie was taking a stroll through the wooded areas within Mahora. Not a lot of people were out, or even awake for that matter, at 9 or 10 o' clock A.M. on a Sunday.<br>\r\nShe walked through a clearing where she saw a figure to one side; it was her teacher, Negi. Throughout the entirety of the time he has spent teaching, the two of them had never properly been acquainted. A shadow of a smile touched her tattooed face as she decided that would change as of today. In a few long strides she reached her teacher. She waited for him to open his eyes instead of saying anything to him. A moment later a shroud of light blue light shot up, wrapping itself around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite any struggles made (though she made very little), the light would not release its grip on her. After a short while the glow softened and seemed to sink into her skin, leaving her with a feeling of warmth and comfortableness. She looked at her teacher who, for some strange reason, was slowly growing further and further away from her. \"Hmm?\" she faintly grunted. She looked down at him and noticed that he was small enough for her to pick him up with one hand. Her hand descended on him and lifted him to her still ever increasing eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei?\" Zazie asked her teacher simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden change in altitude, as well as the bland remark, were enough to make Negi open his eyes, breaking him off of the concentration of the spell. It also stopped Zazie's growth, which ended at a very tall 50 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Z-Zazie-san?!\" Negi said, appalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving only a nod in return, Zazie smiled at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZAZIE-SAN! Oh no! This is bad! If anyone finds out..especially if Asuna-san finds out..I'll be in big trouble!!!\" Negi blurted. If not for a finger raised by the giantess student of his asking for silence, Negi's ranting may have lasted for a good hour and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen her peers \"handle\" Negi gave Zazie a few ideas. First, she hugged her teacher as best she could at her new size. Secondly, she placed him on her lap while gently toying with his hair. Negi was at a loss for words when his student's lips came together to give him a true giantess' kiss. Finally snapping out of his confusion, he looked at his student, who smiled down at him, the first smile she had awarded him since the Mahora Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei...can we...hang out, today?\" she shyly asked, as if she somehow gained the ability to speak aloud. \"I can...show you some tricks...I've learned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then continued, still adjusting to actually speaking to someone. Negi stood up, looking up from his student's palm about what he should do about this. Well..what SHOULD he do?</span></div></div>",

He lifted his staff up to his face, holding it right in front of him. He then quietly and slowly began to cant the incantation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incresco Tantus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Negi, the spell did not hit its destination target at all. In fact, it completely missed, and the beams of growth that came from his staff instead hit a nearby window, scattering them into several smaller pieces that rained down on the academy, both outside and even indoors! Needless to say, Negi was quite worried about what just happened. The worried child student then felt a sensation in the ground, almost like an earthquake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on!?\" Negi asked himself as he shut his eyes in fear for the noise that was being made. He then noticed many of the buildings breaking apart and being completely destroyed, covering the areas in huge clouds of dust. Negi couldn't see or hear what was going on and quickly flew on his staff to avoid breathing in all the dust. It took quite a few minutes for it to clear, but when it did, it revealed something that made the 10 year-old speechless:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire class had grown to the size of giantesses!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi noticed before him that all of his students, from Asuna to Zazie Rainyday, had grown in heights ranging from 40 to almost as high as 130 feet tall! Asuna, Konoka, Setsuna, Nodoka, Evangeline, Yue, Haruna, Kaede, Chisame, and Kazumi knew it was clearly Negi, but the rest of the student body were either confused, scared, or annoyed by the recent events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnnnneeeeeeggggggiiiiii!!!\" an infuriated Asuna yelled to the heavens, the yell itself causing a gigantic shock wave to Negi as he continued to fly on his room. Asuna was one of the taller girls among the giantesses at about 120 feet tall, and she was one of the most annoyed as well. Negi lowered himself on the ground and proceeded to attempt to get away, but found Asuna quickly catching up to him. Eventually the giantess student catches up to the littler Negi and holds him head up in the palm of her hand, furious as she lifted him up to her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explanation. Now!!\" demanded Asuna.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure there is a completely logical and normal explanation for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this NORMAL!\" Asuna shouted. Ayaka acknowledged that she had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There IS an logical explanation for this. R-right sensei?\" Ayaka stammered. Negi was frightened out of his mind. He knew most of them would be o.k. if he told them he was a mage, but how would they react when he told them he had caused this? Negi only sat in a fetal position, rocking back and forth in the class rep's massive hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with him?\" whispered Fukka. Everyone turned to find the to twins, as well as Evangeline, the tallest among the giantess group. Everyone's face went white upon seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cruel irony, it seems\", said the 150 foot tall vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you get for making fun of our height!\" yelled Fumika, sticking her tongue out at them. Throughout the confusion Ayaka had not noticed the absence of the mage's group as well as Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few miles away Asuna was pressing Negi for answers, literally, and not very gently, either. A few jabs of her enormous thumbs knocked the senses back into the minuscule teacher and he began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop that!\" Asuna shouted, coming in for another jab but Setsuna's quick reflexes stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san, do you understand why sensei is crying right now?\" Setsuna calmly asked her friend. \"It is because he is a child, you are hitting him mercilessly, and he has made his class into an even more unmanageable size than it first was. No matter how angry you are with him, you must understand what he is going through as well.\" Asuna stopped and looked at her teacher. He was black and blue with bruises. Realizing that that was her doing, she took him more gently in her palm and apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, I'm so sorry. I didn't know what was going on and i just lost control. I'm sorry\", Asuna said to her teacher. \"Now can you please tell us what happened?\" After a long moment of silence Asuna looked closer at Negi. Seeing his facial expression she looked up. \"Aww man, I did lose it. I knocked him out cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well give him to me. I can heal him up and he might wake up faster\", Konoka said as Asuna handed his limp body to her. After a quick healing spell Konoka handed Negi back to Asuna. Noticing that he would not wake up today they went back to the regular group, still not realizing that they had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should find a place to sleep tonight\", Asuna said. \"We can find away to reverse this in the morning.\" Everyone nodded with her. Ayaka, noticing Negi was no longer in her self proclaimed \"caring\" hands, shot a menacing glance at Asuna. \"Don't worry, Ayaka. Negi is already asleep. Now come on, everyone. I have an idea of where to go.\"</span></div></div>",

What possible reason could you have for thinking that we could hide there for the night?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three reasons\", Asuna stated confidently. \"One, most of the students and staff are preparing for summer break tomorrow, so not many people will be here to see us or hear us early in the morning. Two, because of the places we all grew, which were all close to the plaza itself, the school will have to close down the plaza for the time being. And three, the plaza is the only place where we can all fit and talk about a way to fix ourselves.\" For possibly the first time in either of their lives Ayaka couldn't find a hole large enough to shoot Asuna's plan down through. It was a good one and she, as well as everyone in the class, knew it was their best and possibly only bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", a very reluctant Ayaka admitted. \"We will stay the night at the plaza.\" With that the whole class stood and walked the short distance to the world tree ,which they almost could see over the top of, and soon fell fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA FEW HOURS LATER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi woke up in an incredibly uncomfortable position. Not knowing where he was, he climbed in the position he thought was up. He was beaten up and still badly bruised despite Konoka's healing spell. He soon reached the top of whatever fabric prison he was trapped in to find his entire class sprawled in random places on the ground, their now enormos bodies making slight indentations and cracks in the weakened tiles. Negi looked around at them solemly. He knew that once he told them they would rush to tell someone. Even if it was by accident and even if he did return them to their normal sizes, he realized they would talk. He decided it would be best to tell the proffesionals and turn himself in. He knew what this meant. It meant he was finally giving up. That he was to be an ermine for a few years and after that never be allowed to practice magic ever again. He left a note scratched where it was easy to see. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my pupils and friends,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't live with the fact that I have done this to you all. Yes, Asuna-san was right. I did cause you all to grow. The reason is something I can't explain in writing but I am pleading that the select few of you that know the reason, share it with the others. I am going to turn myself in so please don't attempt to follow me. A team will be here in a short while to resolve this mess I've created. I won't be seeing any of you for a long time, so I'm very sorry that we had such a short time together. Despite that, I had fun and would like to thank each and every one of you for the help you have given me.<br>\r\nGoodbye, and once again I'm sorry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former teacher,<br>\r\nNegi Springfield\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach girl cried giant tears after Asuna finished reading, Asuna herself probably crying the most. When a few girls got up the courage to ask Asuna what he meant by 'the reason he couldn't explain', she shook her head slowly in disbelief. Then came a clap on Asuna's shoulder, and she twirled around to stare face to face with the tear-stained swordsman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san,\" Setsuna stammered. \"I-I-I-I don't c-c-care what he said in that note. We have to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Negi wouldn't listen to us if we told him to stay here, so we have to do the same! Who's with me?!\" All the girls (even Evangeline) cried 'aye!' to the heavens as they rushed out to find their teacher, turning over every roof and boulder until Evangeline told them that she knew where he went. After feeling a little silly about going hog wild with the search, they followed the vampire soundlessly. But do they arrive in time?</span></div></div>",

As he neared the large building, currently teaming with the majority of the mage teachers and students, he couldn't keep from collapsing onto his hands and knees, mid-stride, and breaking out into the tears of the frightened child he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've failed\", he said shakely. \"Asuna-san, Master, Konoka-san, and Setsuna-san too. Everyone in the class believed in me and now I've failed. I'm sorry everybody...please forgive me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand gentle enough to be a cloud swooped down and picked up the sniveling boy.

If it was my fault please tell me. I know I can get a bit out of control sometimes, but that's just how I am. I don't really mean to hurt you even when it seems like it. You shouldn't be the one to be saying sorry.\" The giantess hugged him closer and, with tears still rolling down her cheeks, kissed his forehead as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to trust us, Negi\", She told him in the same soft voice. \"I know you thought we would tell, but none of us will. Everyone of us in the class loves you, even those who seem like they don't.\" Negi knew that she was talking about herself and he finally stood wearily on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna-san\", he said, drying his face with the back of his sleeve. \"Have you told the rest of the class yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I was waiting for you to do it. After all, you're our teacher. So educate us\", she added with a smile. Negi then looked to his students and, with Asuna's help, explained what happened, what he had done. To his surprise, not one angry or disapproving face was seen. Once he was done he heard a massive chorus of voices scream out;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE LOVE YOU, NEGI-SENSEI!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi soon felt the hand underneath him becoming smaller. His platform was shrinking, as was its owner. Soon the other girls began to shrink down as well. At the last second Negi jumped onto Asuna, as she returned to her normal height, hugging her as she twirled around, hugging him back. The other girls took their turns as well of either hugging or kissing their teacher, and he did the same back. Asuna walked over to him once he was finished and she clasped his hand in her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess a little love really is the true magic\", she said as she kissed his forehead. With that, all of them returned to the campus with their teacher, happy to know that there were all a part of his life<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Chamo was in Negi's coat, counting all the money he would get if all the girls just decided to make one more kiss with Negi.

Oushi-san, Sachi-san, go and turn the girls back to normal. Negi-kun, stand there.\" Negi's senior mage teacher then began to chant a spell..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi just closed his eyes and stood there. Finally, Negi heard him finish the spell and he instantly felt the effect. His body shrank to about a foot and a half, fur started to spurt out of his body, his arms turned into front legs, and he grew paws. He basically turned into Chamo, except he still he still had his hair and small glasses (and he wasn't a pervert). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very second, Class 3/A ran in, the teachers shrunk them, and saw ermine Negi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No!\" they all yelled. Even Evangeline was surprised as they ran all over to their ermine teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this Negi?!\" Asuna yelled with tears streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because..I exposed magic and almost ruined all of the class's lives, including yours.

Negi, you are turning back to normal!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNegi squeezed out of her hug, looked at her sadly, and said,\"I'm sorry everyone. I hope we meet again. Their former teacher left with everyone watching him. Right after he left the building, his whole class ran out and picked him up while saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negi, you are going nowhere! Even if you ARE an ermine, you're staying with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna picked him up and hugged him to her chest, smothering him in the process. The class then...</span></div></div>",

The updates have slowed down in recent months, but thank you all for reading this story. I would like to especially thank Sarlen Raine and Shakemaker for their contributions, which have been a very big help in rounding up more reader interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should warn you now that this story requires the reader to have knowledge somewhat of the events of the manga. Please be advised that spoilers might be present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, rules / other info:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Characters may grow or shrink to any height you wish, but each story must start off with growth. All chapters must also at least be one paragraph long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Negi can die, but he must be brought back to life by story's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I will edit any chapters for spelling, so don't get too wrangled up about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look forward to submissions.</td>",
