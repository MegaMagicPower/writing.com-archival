You was too far out of it to realize the truth, and fortunately mom and the twins (who were back from the mall) were all downstairs, hence sparing them the sight of an unaware, naked little girl. You barged into the bathroom, and intinctively reached for your now vanished manhood, and released. the fact your hand only grabbed empty air, and a small trickle of urine flowed down your leg shocked you fully awake. Ignoring the embarassing fact you peed yourself, you took a look at your 5 year old body, and let out the most piercing shriek of your life.</span></div></div>",

While you're crying, mom comes back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no what's- WHAT IN THE...\" She stands there for a moment opening and closing her mouth, but no sound comes out. This is fine though, as you realize you're making more than enough noise to cover both your shocks. You are also keenly aware that even though you are now much younger, you still have full brain activity. As long as you don't go back any further, things should be fine. That'swhen you stop crying and realize something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[i]Wait, this could be great. I could be lie, a baby genius or something.

You don't have that many teeth and it is hard to form words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom bursts out laughing. \"Oh my you are the CUTEST thing!

Enough time to get her ready\" Ella announced. You paled, as the girls started who should get you bathed, and who to get your clothes. It was a pointless agruement, since Ella had already stocked your wardrobe with things far too girly. Least with Zoe giving you a bath, you knew you wouldn't end up smelling like Ella's rose garden. After an awkward bath, you got dried, and got dressed. It was as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to do that to... her?\" Zoe asked as soon as she saw you.

These were notes taken after his thorough examination of you earlier. He occasionally glanced at you before reading again.  You fidgeted in your seat, impatient as you really wanted to know whether you will ever be your old self again.  Mom looked worried but said nothing while the doctor read his notes.  He finally paused and peering over the glasses perched on his nose, asked you, \"How do you feel now young man?\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not sure how to answer that question.  Clearly, you felt weird being a girl over these past twenty four hours but otherwise you did not feel any ill effects.  \"What does he really expect me to say?\", you thought.  You answered, \"I feel just fine but I wanna know when I'll be myself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor adjusted his glasses, looked back on his notes before answering, \"I'm afraid we don't know the answer to that question, er son\".  \"You see\", he continued, \"we don't know how strong the dose was and whether there will be any further regression before you start to age again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", you screamed, \"I wanna be myself again!\".  Mom interjected, \"Surely you could do something in the meantime. Don't you have an antidote in case something like this happens?\".  The doctor walked over to the phone on his desk and pressed the intercom button, \"Shirley, get me Doctor Hanson.\"  He returned to you and your mom.  \"I need to discuss this with Dr. Hanson, our Senior Geneticist who can perhaps give you better answers than I can.\"  You looked up to your mom who immediately asked, \"How long do we have to wait for a definitive answer Doctor...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Blake, Dr. Blake.\"  You suddenly realized that the doctor had not introduced himself earlier.  \"Dr. Blake\", your mom continued, \" will this mean more tests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Blake cleared his throat and replied, \"Yes, perhaps your son will need to be here at the lab for a few days while we run some tests.  They shouldn't be too much trouble..\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson entered the room, \"Vernon, I was in the middle of another experiment when Shirley called, this better be important...\",  he then noticed you and your mom, \"Oh, hello folks.\"  Before either you or your mom could respond, Dr. Hanson was talking to Dr. Blake again, \"Alright, whats the problem here?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Blake patiently explained the situation to Dr. Hanson.  As the older man listened, Dr. Blake related what he had already told your mom and the possibility that you will need to be kept at the lab for tests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson turned to you, and you felt uncomfortable, much like a lab rat, as the Senior Geneticist closely scrutinized you from head to toe.  Finally he said, \"we will definitely need to keep the youngster here for a few days to test for any further effects.  Until then, we can do nothing to change the situation.\"  </span></div></div>",

Of course, you could only hear her side of the conversation.<br>\r\nJames' friend's father placed the bags on the floor and waved goodbye to Mrs. Storms, heading for the door.  \"Thank you\", mom mouthed, as he opened the door and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Dr. Hanson, what the hell is this call about, and don't you bullshit me!\", mom said tersely.<br>\r\nYou could not help overhearing the attempts that your sisters were making to answer James' question, and his protests of disbelief.<br>\r\nMom in the meantime was getting increasingly agitated on the phone as she listened to what appeared to you to be lengthy intervention by Dr. Hanson.  Maybe he was trying to convince mom to return you to the lab for tests, you thought.  You were relieved to realize that mom was not buying it.<br>\r\n\"No Dr. Hanson!\", mom said, \"As I said earlier, I will not be returning Jazz to that lab.  You told me already that you had no antidote, which by the way, I do not believe!\"<br>\r\nMom listened for a moment, just as James grabbed you hard by the shoulders, demanding an explanation of your presence in this house.  You were startled, and you stuttered, \"H-h-hey, you're hurting me!\".  You cried out, \"Mom!\"<br>\r\nMom said quickly into the phone, \"Dr. Hanson, I really have to go, but be assured that this is not the end of the matter as I will sue the shit out of you and your buddies at the Genetics Lab!\"  She then slammed the phone into its hook and turned to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James Storms!, Let go of your brother this instant!\"<br>\r\nJames quickly let you go and looked aghast at your mother then at you.<br>\r\n\"You all can't be seriously pulling this mean prank on me now are you?\", he asked.<br>\r\n\"James, honey,\" mom said, \"I didn't want you to find out this way but you are looking at your brother Jasper.\"<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\", James shouted, upset.<br>\r\n\"Watch your language and tone, James Storms\", mom said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Mom, please tell me this is just a prank and that Jazz is in his room.\"<br>\r\nMom signed in resignation and with tears streaming down her cheeks related to James the sequence of events since the field trip, ending with the phone call she just received.  You were silent, waiting anxiously for mom to finish telling James the truth of what happened.  Your sisters were equally anxious waiting to see James' reaction to this revelation.<br>\r\nJames himself was silent, and quite subdued as the reality of what mom had said sank in.  Your brother looked at you, the five-year old girl, and for a moment you feared that after all that was said, he still did not believe that you were his brother turned into a girl, and that you were nothing more than a fraud.  You said, \"James, it's really me and I wish it wasn't true but as you can see, it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

What you don't expect is for him to kneel down and hug you. Yet that's what he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, man,\" he moans, his arms wrapped around your dainty frame a little too tightly for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, isn't that sweet?\" Ella chirps in a tone that sounds a little too much like mockery for your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you respond, barely able to turn your head enough to look at her. Still, James's embrace is comforting... at least until you realise you feel exactly like a little girl being comforted by her big brother. Then it's awkward. But you don't want to upset him by struggling to get away, so you rest your head against him and wait until he lets go and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence ensues. James nervously shuffles his feet, not knowing what else to say to you, while you gaze warily at your sisters. After yesterday and this morning, you need a break from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, James,\" you say, leading him toward your room without further explanation. Zoe begins to follow you, but Mom holds out an arm to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eager to get away from those two?\" James asks as you arrive in your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been a pain,\" you say. \"They just fight over how to dress me and things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... Ella's been winning, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug at your dress and sigh, seeing no need to answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, man. You're just letting her do that?\" James asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can I do about it?\" you reply. \"She won't listen to me. And... I don't want to upset her, I guess. She can enjoy this just a little while it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turns his gaze away from you and gains an expression of concerned thought. He's probably wondering if you're going to be stuck this way, a possibility you still don't want to seriously consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom seemed really angry at that guy on the phone,\" he eventually says, making you wonder what line of thought led him back to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she really flipped out when they wanted to keep me there,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot Mom approaching your open door, and go out to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" you say, \"Do you... really think they could be withholding the antidote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighs. \"All I know is I don't trust them. I really doubt whatever tests they wanted to do would actually help, and the fact that they let this happen in the first place... I have a hard time believing qualified scientists would be so careless. There has to be something shady about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know whether to be encouraged by the prospect that there could still be an antidote somewhere, or discouraged by the idea of the scientists being untrustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what are we gonna do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom decides to...</span></div></div>",

It seems like it could result in a huge media circus centered directly on you, and the last thing you want is for the whole world to know what happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom seems to sense your apprehension. \"... Maybe it would be rash to do that right away. We need to figure out what's going on in that lab.\" She pauses to think. \"I know. I'm going to hire someone to find out for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean a detective?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now there's a cool idea!\" James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems like a safe enough thing to do,\" Mom says. \"I'm sure you don't want to wait around, so I'll look for someone right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her walk off, feeling increasingly uncertain about your fate. James notices your forlorn look and puts a hand on your tiny shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're gonna be alright, man,\" he says. \"I'm here to help ya. How about I start by getting you some real clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that,\" you sigh. \"I mean, I've already failed to make it through my life without wearing a dress. And Ella already bought a bunch of other things she wants me to wear. I don't intend to do anything else for her, though, so if she gets pushy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. You're safe with me around, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at James's resolute expression. As much you appreciate his sympathy, you're starting to see that he too has his own angle here. He seems eager to be the big brother and look after you, which may not be a bad thing, but you're a bit afraid of losing the respect he's always had for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh... you wanna go out and play ball?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not,\" you reply, remembering what happened last time. The last thing you need is start crying in front of James. Also, a small part of you is complaining that you'd ruin your dress. You tell yourself, again, that you just don't want to upset Ella. After all, it's not like you couldn't have stood up for yourself when she picked this thing out for you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" James says. \"Play some games, then?\" he asks, gesturing back into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of play video games for a while, an activity that almost manages to feel normal. Before too long, your mom pokes her head into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hold of a private investigator,\" she says. \"He wants to come and see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay,\" you say, a bit nervously. You thought you could relax for a while, but you can't complain about progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue your game until you hear the doorbell. You exit your room, and Mom directs you to the living room. Ella and Zoe are standing there, and James comes in behind you. You climb up onto the couch and hear the front door opening, but still have to wait a minute or so before Mom comes into the room followed by a man in a black coat and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Jasper, huh?\" the man says, moving to stand in front of you. \"Harry Robertson, at your service. Your mom's told me about what happened to ya, but I wanna hear what you've gotta say.\" He turns to face Mom. \"Alright if I have a little one-on-one with the kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nods and herds your siblings out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at this Harry and wonder if he actually believes your story. You study him, looking for signs he thinks you're crazy, but he has a pretty good poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decide you might as well just ask. \"Do you actually believe...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you reckon I must think you're all a buncha nutjobs, eh?\" he says. \"Well, I ain't rulin' it out, but lemme tell ya... I've had some weird cases before. Can't disclose 'em, but suffice to say that when I hear some guy's been turned into a little girl, it seems possible enough.\" He looks you up and down. \"Gotta say, though, you ain't dressed like it bothers you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshly embarrassed, you glance down at your girly attire and cringe before making your excuse. \"It... makes my sister happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Ain't that the sweetest. Well, don't worry, son. You won't be in skirts for long if I have anythin' to say about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not particularly reassured, but you do like that he called you \"son\" without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me how this came about, then,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not much to say,\" you answer. \"We were in that lab on a field trip, it was crowded, and I bumped into a shelf and that serum fell down and spilled on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry raises an eyebrow. \"So they just had open containers of the stuff sittin' around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suspicious,\" Harry says, rubbing his chin. \"Very suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like what he's implying. \"What, you think they let it happen on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be it. Typical mad scientist behaviour. Never seems to occur to 'em they could look for willing test subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad scientists? This guy seems a bit paranoid, you think, like some kind of conspiracy theorist. You suppose you have that attitude to thank for him believing you, but you wonder if he can really help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about that field trip?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question confuses you. \"Uh... what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd they send you there in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? It was for biology. The scientists talked about really interesting stuff. It's not like it was a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do, of course, still wish you hadn't gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know anything else?\" Harry asks. \"Can't tell me how or why it was set up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not really,\" you say, giving him a funny look. Then you realise what he's thinking. \"What, you think the school's in on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe. Could be some shady dealings involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea seems a bit absurd to you. \"I really don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start from the beginning, I say, and this begins at the school,\" Harry says. \"Even if they weren't in on it, odds are good they know somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour continued look of skepticism seems to discourage him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what, kid,\" he says, \"Since you're the one in the middle of this mess, I'll let you pick where I start. I'd wanna look into how the trip was set up, but it's your call.\"</span></div></div>",

How hard can it be?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let me level with ya kid\", Harry said, \"after what happened a while ago, that lab ain't gonna give me squat.

The truth was, you could not say for sure which teacher actually made the arrangements. You were however intrigued that Harry could have suspected that one of your teachers could shed light on this whole mess.  You remembered that Miss Roper, your Biology Teacher had made the announcement about the field trip days before.  You vaguely remembered that in her announcement, she had mentioned the name of another teacher who you were not familiar with.  \"What was the name again...?\", you tried desperately to remember.   It was a male, a Mr....,  Mr...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid..., you still there?\", that was Harry.  \"Y-Yes\", you answered, \"I'm trying to remember the name of the male teacher who my Biology Teacher, Miss Roper said had made the arrangements.  I just can't remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK son, I'll just talk to Miss Roper. I'm sure she wouldn't mind giving me the name of the other teacher.\", Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me\", you said, relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then, I'll go to the school tomorrow and speak to Miss Roper.\"  With that, Harry hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to James, who was still playing a game on his portable gamer, \"Up for another round?\", you asked.  The truth was, you wanted a distraction from all the heavy stuff that was happening and a game with James seemed like just the outlet you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mom walked in with milk and cookies, \"you must be hungry after all of that excitement\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing mom\", said James, reaching for a cookie.  You realized that in all the excitement, you had forgotten to eat and as if on cue, your tummy rumbled.<br>\r\nYou eagerly reached for one of the glasses of milk and a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did Harry say?\", mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told mom about the missing intern and Harry's suspicion of one of your school's teachers.

Don't worry yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the four of you are making your way out the front door. Just as you leave, you notice Mom reaching for the phone. You hope she's not going to keep anything from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow your siblings down the street, feeling quite self-conscious and nervously looking out for anyone you know. James and Zoe, avoiding further discussion of your situation, start up a conversation about sports, but you're too distracted to pay much attention. Ella, meanwhile, just sort of admires your appearance the whole time. She seems to be biting her tongue, and whenever you glance up at her, she looks away. At least now she's trying not to annoy you too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the mall's food court and, once your sisters get you your food, sit down at one of the tables. Zoe sits next to you, with James and Ella on the other side. The burger in front of you is your usual fare, but it looks a bit daunting to you now. Ella giggles when you pick it up and take a little bite from it, prompting you to give her an annoyed look as you start chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you're just so cute!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble and idly scan the crowds until you spot your friend Nathan approaching the food court. You almost choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Nathan over there!\" you urgently whisper to Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? ...So what?\" she replies. \"He's not gonna know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, he was on the field trip!\" you say. \"He knows that stuff spilled on me. If he sees me here with you guys, he's gonna figure it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Zoe says before taking a bite from her cheeseburger. \"Even if he was there, who would believe it?\" she asks with a full mouth, her lack of manners earning a glare from Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan would!\" you insist. \"He really looks up to scientists like those guys... I'm sure he thinks it's possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looks thoughtful for a second. \"Well... so what if he does find out? He's your friend, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gives you pause, but you're not going to change your mind that easily. Friend or not, you can't help fearing how he might react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want this to leave the family, okay?\" you say. \"Besides, we're in public! What if he starts shouting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, calm down. Who says he's gonna come over here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Nathan reaches the front of the line and starts making his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's ordering food!\" you say. You frantically look around and take note of the two empty tables next to yours. \"He's definitely gonna notice us!\"</span></div></div>",

We better sit down for this.\"  You suddenly felt uneasy, and looked at the others to see whether they felt the same.  Their anxious expressions was enough to tell you that your siblings were just as uneasy as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have done this before, I don't know why I didn't\", Mom started.  \"After that phone call from Dr. Blake, I got to thinking about what his warning could have meant. Besides, I haven't heard from Harry since your last phone call with him, Jazz and I was getting really worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried about what, Mom\", you asked, your voice betraying a tremor of the fear you are beginning to feel.  Ella and Zoe huddled closer on the coach as Mom continued, \"I went online and did a Google search on that Genetics Center and I wished I didn't\", Mom burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Mom was more composed and she continued her news.  As she spoke, the reality of what she was saying slowly sank in and you too began to cry. Zoe and Ella quickly held you to hush you.  Even through your tears, you felt silly for being treated like a little girl by your big sisters.  You were however too distraught to laugh at the funny irony of this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gist of Mom's discovery was that the Genetics Center had been experimenting with human subjects long before they got approval to experiment with lab animals with the youth serum. It is now under investigation for unethical practices after the disappearance of three young men, around your former age, from two states.  Investigators were however no closer to the truth as no sign of the young men were ever found.  The investigation is five years old as the first reported disappearance occurred around that time.  Then there is the intern, who according to news on the web, has been reported missing from home and has not yet been found.  Speculations are that he may have been kidnapped or worse, killed.  Mom, however reminded you of Dr. Blake's warning about not liking what you may find out about the intern, suggesting that he may possibly still be alive.  \"But in what condition?\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do now?\", James asked.

Mom retreated  to her home office to catch up on work that was being neglected, Ella took you, protesting of course, to her room to listen to some music.  At least listening to music was better than pouring though her fashion magazines, or worse yet, playing with her huge Barbie doll collection.  James and Zoe went outside to shoot hoops, until it became too dark to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the first to wake up the next day.  Truth was, you had a restless sleep during which you had a bad dream about being chased by mad scientists bent on experimenting on you some more. You vaguely recalled at one point during the night, Mom coming into your room, and cradling you in her arms, rocked you back to sleep.  \"Man, that was one weird dream, I hope I'll never have again\", you said to yourself, as you made your way to the bathroom to brush your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you heard signs of the others stirring.  Today will be an interesting day, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was having breakfast when the doorbell rang.

Everyone I spoke to denied that they know anything about any research with a youth serum.  Fact is, I couldn't ever get any further leads on that intern, its as if he doesn't exist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mom's turn to be stunned, \"Don't tell me the lab is covering up its tracks!\", she said, dismayed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry hesitated, \"er, It would seem that way.  I'm really meeting a roadblock here. But I did get an interesting tip from one of the janitors at the lab.\"  Harry paused. Everyone in the room looked at Harry in anticipation, as though his very next words will contain the lifeline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The janitor told me that he overheard the two doctors,  er  Blake and Hanson,  talking about one of their experiments gone wrong.  Of course, he couldn't tell me whether it was the youth serum experiment.  What he did tell me though was that this was not the first time something went wrong with experiments at that lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting nervous as you heard all that was being said and you wondered whether you could have been included in that experiment gone wrong.  It suddenly dawned on you that the antidote must be found quickly if you were ever to return to your normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got up to leave, \"I'll just have to continue diggin', and find that intern.  I'll also check out that website for you seeing that if it is true that there is an investigation into that lab, there will be a paper trail I can follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You... are you, uh, Jazz?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. How does she know your name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry,\" the girl says. \"We shouldn't talk right here... um, can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom eyes the girl suspiciously, but allows her inside and closes the door. The three of you enter the living room to find Ella, Zoe and James already there, looking very curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, who are you?\" Mom demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... well, the other victim,\" the girl says. \"My name's Lisa Brown... er, formerly Liam, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at her. \"You... so you were the intern?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa releases her held breath and relaxes, relieved that you know what she's talking about. \"Yes. I was working there when I was exposed to the youth serum, and I ended up like this. That was about a month ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month ago... that means that guy at the lab was lying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they did have someone pretending to be me?\" Lisa asks. \"You know... I believed everything they told me at the time. That it was an accident, there was no cure... but now, after talking to that detective, I just don't know anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room goes quiet. You ponder what questions you should ask until Zoe breaks the silence with, \"So why did you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just wanted someone I could talk to,\" Lisa says. \"It's been hard, trying to blend in as a girl... I'm always worried people will find out the truth, or I'll do something all wrong and everyone will think I'm weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you've been going to school?\" Ella asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeah, I think I've seen her around,\" James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. No way are you going through school all over again as a girl. You'd better start figuring things out so you can avoid that fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about that web page?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I saw a page like that about a week after I changed,\" Lisa says. \"But the next day, it was gone. I convinced myself they deleted it because it was wrong, but... I guess it could be a cover-up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, with a renewed determination in her eyes, puts a hand on Lisa's shoulder. \"Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this and make those bastards take responsibility for what they've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know about that,\" Lisa says. \"If there's really some big conspiracy here... I don't want to get involved. I should just put my old self behind me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they could still have an antidote somewhere!\" James says. \"Don't you want to try and find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighs. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

There was something about this tall, gray haired man, dressed in a neat gray suit that just did not sit right.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, young man, I'm here to see your mother about unfinished business\", he replied condescendingly,  \"Is she home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at James who looked as though he would have slammed the door in Dr. Hanson's face, but just then, Mom walked in from the kitchen.  \"Who is it James?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore James could reply, Dr. Hanson answered, \"Just me, Mrs. Storms, Dr. Hanson\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's tone changed instantly to one of subdued anger, \"What are you here about Dr. Hanson?\", she asked icily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson replied, \"Mrs. Storms, you really don't need to get your defenses up, all I am here to do is to talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's anger rose, \"We have nothing to talk about Doctor.

As each day passes without an antidote, subtle changes in your son's mental capacity and his behavior will occur.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was flabbergasted.  You, James and Zoe stared at Dr. Hanson in disbelief.  What is he trying to say?, you thought.

She walks out of the room, and you're about to follow her when Ella finally speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz... I hope you...\" She pauses, a pained look on her face. \"Oh, I don't know what I hope for... I just want this to be over, one way or another...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know things have gotten bad when you're off to play with a little girl, and Ella isn't the least bit happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon leave with Mom, who holds your hand the whole way to Lilith's house, making more of an effort to look natural than your siblings did when they took you out. Once you arrive, Mom knocks on the door and is promptly answered by Lilith's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" she cheerfully greets you. \"You must be Mrs. Storms. Thank you for coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Parker,\" Mom replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Parker kneels down to talk to you. You're briefly relieved to be at eye level with someone before logic kicks in and you feel patronised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Jasmine!\" she says. \"Oh, you look a bit shy. It's okay, I don't bite!\" She stands up and addresses your mom again. \"I'm so glad to find someone to play with my little Lily. We've just been here a few weeks, you know, and she's been a bit lonely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, you feel a little guilty... or at least, you hope you have reason to feel guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith!\" Mrs. Parker shouts into the house. \"Your new friend is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith emerges from a doorway and lights up at the sight of you. \"Yay! Jasmine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be back in an hour or two,\" Mom says, giving you a gentle push inside. \"You two have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leaves, and as soon as the door closes behind you, you realise she definitely had some sort of point about leaving you here alone. With nobody around who knows who you really are, you suddenly feel less like a teenage boy in a little girl's body and more like a little girl with the mind of a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Lilith into her room. Your first thought is that it's huge, but that might just be the effect of seeing a new place from your current perspective. The room is decorated in line with Lilith's dress sense and features an abundance of dolls and stuffed animals scattered around. You get the impression that she's a bit spoiled... and also very girly, but you knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea party!\" Lilith gleefully declares, walking over to a child-sized table. \"What dolly you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, you grab one of the nearby dolls and begin your attempt to act in a way befitting your appearance.</span></div></div>",

Besides, this is the first time you have ever played with dolls and you were not sure you were doing it right.  Lilith had also picked out a doll and was busy cooing with it as if it were a living child, \"want some tea now bubbles?\" she asked the doll.  You watched her manipulate the doll to give her an affirmative nod.  \"Good, here you goooo...\", she cooed as she pretended to pour some tea into the doll's cup.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that this was the way to do it and followed Lilith's example, \"Want some tea, er, er, Dolly?, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name's Candy\", Lilith corrected you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK.  Want some tea Candy?\", you asked as you took the teapot and unceremoniously pretend dumped the tea into her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, No!\", cried Lilith, \"You have to pour nicely or she won't drink it.  She don't like it when you're rough on her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh for crying out loud, you thought, its only a doll!  You instead meekly said, \"S-Sorry, Candy, here you go...\".  You blushed in embarrassment as you realized that you just apologized to a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe play continued with you and Lilith fussing over your dolls and even sharing talk, doll to doll.  As the minutes passed, you realized that you were beginning to enjoy playing with Lilith and her dolls and stuffed toys.  The \"tea party\" progressed until Lilith announced another game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Parker poked her head in to see how you two were doing, \"Hey girls, everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mommy\", Lilith replied excitedly, \"Jasmine and I are in the middle of  our game\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at Mrs. Parker to show that you are actually enjoying the games and found to your surprise that you actually gave a genuine smile instead of the fake one you intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whooooo's hungry?\", Mrs. Parker asked cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meeee. meeee. meeeee!\", you both chorused, jumping with excitement and clapping little hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll be right back with cookies and juice.:\", with that Mrs. Parker left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both returned to your game, with a little more excitement than was there before.  Soon, Mrs. Parker returned with a serving tray containing a plate with a mix of cookies and chips, as well as two classes of orange juice.  \"Enjoy\", she said placing the serving tray on the table on which you were earlier playing \"tea party\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mrs. Parker left, you both dived into the cookies and juice and ate until you were full.  When Mrs. Parker returned to retrieve the serving tray with the plates and glasses, she cooed, \"Oooh, Jasmine, look at you, you;re such a mess.  I'll have to clean you up...\" .  With that, she took you into the nearby bathroom, Lilith's you presumed, where she wiped the cookie smudges from your mouth and, dampening a wash rag, attempted to wipe the orange juice stains from the front of your dress.  You were surprised to see the spill on your dress as you had not realized that you had made a mess while drinking your juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bathroom episode, you and Lilith continued playing until you heard the sound of the doorbell, \"that must be my mommy\", you said with childish excitement, \"She's here, she's here\", you screamed gleefully as you sprang up and dashed toward the door.  Lilith ran behind you, \"hey, wait for me...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed your mom at the door and she was talking to Mrs. Parker, \"How was Jasmine?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommiiiieeee!\", you screamed with delight as you literally jumped into her arms.  Mrs. Storms was taken aback by your enthusiastic greeting and was not sure how to react.  Mrs. Parker laughed, \"Well, she sure is happy to see you.  Both girls had fun today.  We should arrange another play date...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please, please, please...\", Lilith pleaded, jumping with excitement.  You too wanted another play date, and you joined the plea, \"Yes mommy, pleeeeaaase...\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh, OK then, it looks like we have ourselves another play date to arrange\", your mom said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we certainly do\", smiled Mrs. Parker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To your surprise, it turns out not to be Dr. Hanson, but Dr. Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you two,\" he says. \"I know you haven't gotten along with Dr. Hanson, so I figured you'd rather get this from me. He wasn't happy about it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom regards him warily for a second before replying, \"Thank you, Dr. Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is gonna fix my brain?\" you ask, gazing hopefully at the vial of cloudy liquid in his hand. \"Did Lisa get this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lisa Brown? Didn't I advise you against making contact with her?\" Dr. Blake respond. A scornful look from Mom prompts him to continue, \"No, she did not receive this. I imagine the youth serum has run its course on her brain by now. That's why I was concerned that you'd be frightened if you met her. We weren't sure we'd have this ready in time for you either, but we're quite certain it's safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did she change?\" you ask, wondering if it could be more than she realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know. We've sort of made a point of not knowing, actually. Dr. Hanson wanted to study the changes in her behaviour, but we convinced him not to put such stress on the poor girl. He's always been impatient when it comes to furthering our research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly does this chemical of yours do?\" Mom asks, taking a confrontational step toward Dr. Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This formula is designed to halt the ongoing effects of the youth serum,\" he replies before looking down at you. \"You see, although the serum made short work of most of your body, brain cells are affected much more slowly. By neutralising the lingering serum in your brain, this antidote will prevent further mental regression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like his use of the word 'further'. Mom asks the obvious question: \"But... will it reverse the changes that have already happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... difficult to say,\" Dr. Blake says. \"What symptoms have you noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip and avoid listening as Mom tells of your episode with Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Dr. Blake says afterwards. He sounds more intrigued than concerned, but quickly switches back to his helpful tone. \"I'm afraid I don't know what will happen, then... the brain may or may not reassert its original shape after this treatment. At the very least, however, it sounds as though you should be able to control yourself as long as you avoid indulging in childish things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, imagining yourself living a double life where you slip into a little girl's mindset on a regular basis. Ella will have a field day if she finds she can get you to act girly without having to worry about you being stuck that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we shouldn't waste any more time,\" Dr. Blake says, uncorking the vial and handing it to you. \"The serum is still acting on your brain as we speak. You had better swallow the antidote right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to drink it?\" you ask, feeling very apprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ideally, yes. It will act faster if ingested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mom, sharing in the worry shown on her face. You look at Dr. Blake, dearly hoping you can trust him. Finally, you take a deep breath and gulp down the contents of the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unh... ow...\" you moan, feeling a dull burning in your throat and dropping the empty vial when you start to feel lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz!\" Mom exclaims, catching you as you fall over sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may feel sleepy,\" you barely register Dr. Blake saying. \"Don't worry. You'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the floor, unable to form thoughts, until you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in what seems like a hospital bed, finding your body in a strange state of partial paralysis. You don't feel tired at all, but it's difficult to make yourself move. Mom and Ella look down at you from your right, while James and Zoe are on your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz!\" Mom says. \"Are you okay? They said you were in a coma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it was nothing to worry about, Mrs. Storms,\" you hear Dr. Hanson say.  You slowly turn your head to see him in the doorway of the small room you're in. \"A brief cessation of conscious activity was within our expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brief?!\" Mom incredulously exclaims. \"It's been six hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's awake now,\" Dr. Hanson impatiently states. \"Now, we should test to see if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" Mom orders him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson sighs in frustration. \"Very well,\" he grumbles as he turns to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the power of movement return to you, you manage to sit up, mumbling incoherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're alright, dude,\" James says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Zoe and Ella say in unison. You chuckle weakly at their rare display of unity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They scanned your brain, and they said there's no more youth serum in there,\" Zoe says. \"So you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine except for being stuck with a little girl's body, you think. But this is no time to complain about that. You look over your family, waiting for someone else to talk, but they all seem to be hesitating, like there's something they don't want to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, Jazz?\" Ella finally starts. \"Don't be mad at me, but... I thought you might like to see your friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, thinking you're about to see Lilith, or maybe Nathan. But instead, Ella lifts up her hand and you see she's holding Candy... er, she's holding that doll from Lilith's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Ella says, wiggling the doll in front of your face. \"Would you like to play with her?\"</span></div></div>",

Our brother is like this and you're offering her dolls! What's next. Pink bedrooms and dress-up costumes?\" Zoe snapped, triggering another twin quarrel. You zoned out, wondering what is going to happen now. You're stuck like this, a five year old girl, and any chance of you continuing your life is gone. Yes, you had no desire to play with Candy.. er Lilith's doll, but what would happen if you're with other girls. You don't know. plus, as the twins had unhelpfully pointed out, since you're stuck you''re going to need a new bedroom, and soon. Having nothing left here, mom motioned for the still arguing twins to head for the car. She left, leaving you and James behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Its starting to sink in what this all means\" you said. As you took a step, you noticed that Ella must have dropped Candy. You picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you picking that thing up? Y-you don't really want to play with it, and you're hiding it\" James asked, concern in his voice. You gave a slightly bitter laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But i was given this. It doesn't feel right  leaving it, somehow\" you said. After a few seconds, you started smiling mischieviously. \"Maybe I should keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hello to 'Blackmail Candy', Ella's new bedtime doll\" you said.</span></div></div>",

Ella signed in contentment and snuggled the doll closer to her face.  You slowly exhaled as you backed cautiously away from her bed.  James crept softly towards Ella's bed and snapped her picture.  When Ella did not move, James snapped another picture, \"just in case...\", he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly, but silently scampered from the twin's bedroom and ran to the safety of your room.  Once inside, you both collapsed with laughter.  \"Can't wait to hear Ella's reaction when she sees that doll instead of hers\", James said between stifled laughs.  \"Yeah..\", you replied, barely containing your own laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and James talked for a while longer, the bond between you just like old times.  You felt good that you and your brother are once again in that familiar \"guy zone\", although you were, for all appearances, the kid sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla's piercing scream woke you up with a start, and your eyes opened to the daylight from your bedroom window. James also bolted wide awake by the same scream.  You barely made it out of the bed, however, when your room door burst open and an angry Ella stormed in,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one of you did this??\", she demanded, holding Candy the doll by one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and James exchanged innocent glances, \"not me...\", you said.  James echoed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla was not amused, \"I know it's one of you so fess up, or i'll call mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same innocent demeanor, you smiled and asked, with a hint of \"sisterly\" concern, \"Ella dear, don't you remember taking Candy to bed with you instead of your usual doll?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what??\", Ella exclaimed, \"I couldn't have!  I know I didn't take this doll to bed with me.  James, where is my doll??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at Ella, and just as innocently as you did, replied, \"Ella, sis, you have been through a lot lately so we'll forgive you for thinking that Jazz and I could have pulled such a  prank on you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmooomm!....\", Ella whined, and more urgently, \".....mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe slouched in, still bleary eyed having just woken up, \"H-hey guys, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, did you see James or Jazz enter our room last night?\", Ella asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I was fast asleep\", Zoe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom entered the room, concern etched on her face, \"What is it?  Did something happen to Jazz??\", she asked, breathless from running up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou piped in, \"I'm OK mom.  It's just Ella who thinks we did something to cause her to sleep with Lilith's doll Candy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true Mom\", Ella said desperately, appealing to Mom, \"...the boys did something, I know they did something to switch my doll for this, but they won't admit it!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that Ella just referred to you and your brother as the \"boys\", and you smiled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and what are you smiling about?\", Ella asked, at the same time turning to Mom, \"see, see, Jazz knows something that's why she's smiling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"she's\"..., so much for being one of the boys, you thought ruefully. Mom turned to you, and in the tone she uses on you kids to get the truth, intoned, \"What do you know about this Jazz?\"  Normally, mom's tone would have been enough for you to immediately confess to your part in any wrong doing.  This time though, you were determined to conceal the truth.  \"Honestly mom, I don't know what happened with Ella's doll, it must have been transformed into Candy..\", you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed with you Jazz, and as for you James, don't think you are off the hook.  I want you both to get Ella's doll back and apologize to your sister.  Now get ready for school, you don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mom left the room to prepare breakfast.  You made a face at Ella and stuck out your tongue, \"Won't tell you anything\", you said, all too childishly, but you hardly noticed.<br>\r\nElla was still upset but she knew that it was pointless trying to get you or James to fess up.  \"Wait until I get back from school later, I'll deal with you then..\", she promised, with more than a hint of animosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zoe who changed the tone of everything,  \"Yes, we all go back to school today, but what about Jazz, where will she go...?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on you that in all that had taken place over the past few days, you had not thought about how you will return to school. In fact, it appears, no one else did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's looking forward to seeing you at school today...\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe your ears.  \"Mom, I can't possibly go back to school now, not like this. What would my friends and classmates think seeing a 5 year old in school?\", you protested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe appealed, \"Yeah Mom, you really should reconsider this.

You suddenly felt queasy and for a moment wished desperately to lie down.  Zoe and James stared wide eyed at their mom as though she had suddenly gone insane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom, you're not serious, I can't possibly go to kinder.  What will I do there?  I'll die of boredom\", you said, trying your best to sound like a teen but only succeeding in whining like a five year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz, please understand that I cannot leave you home alone while your sisters and brother are at school...\", Mom explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were, however,  not listening.  How could mom do this to you?  Your mind reeled as horrible images of you at kindergarten flashed through your mind.  Painful memories of your first day at school flooded you and before you realised it, tears welled up in your eyes and your face crumpled.  You threw a tantrum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaaa, I don't wanna go!, I don't wanna go!, Please mommy, I don't wanna go!....\", you wailed.  Throwing yourself on the ground and kicking your little feet furiously, you continued to scream, \"...Don't wanna go to school!  Please mommy, let me stay home...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Mom to regain her composure in the face of your unexpected outburst.  \"Jasmine...\", she said soothingly, \"...we cannot spend the whole time arguing this.  I simply cannot leave you home alone, I cannot find any baby sitter available today to babysit you...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't wanna baby sitter!\", you screamed, petulantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom continued, ignoring your outburst, \"...and besides, I would be breaking the law if I allowed you to stay home on a school day when you are not being home schooled...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take me to work with you...\", you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, I wish I could but you know the nature of my business.  My office is no place for little kids like you...\", Mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puleeeeaaase...\", you begged, \"I'll be on my best behaviour you won't even know I'm there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was loosing her patience with you and had just about enough of your whining protests.  Holding you firmly by your shoulders, she shepherded you, kicking and screaming,  towards the bathroom, \"Come on now Jazz, lets get you dressed for school.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround forty five minutes later, you were dressed for school.  The navy blue dress with the brightly coloured animal patterns made you look everything like a five year old on her first day at school.  The small pink and white backpack along with the bright yellow Sponge Bob lunch kit completed the look.  You were however scowling and petulant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tried to make light of your discomfort, \"Come on Jazz, you know this is only temporary until you return to normal.  Then you can look back at this day and laugh.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you close and planted a wet kiss on your cheek, which you immediately wiped off.  At least the others are not here to see you like this as they had already left on the school bus, you thought in relief.  You didn't think you could ever live this down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smile for the camera Jazz!\", Mom coaxed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my little girl ready for her first day at her new school...\", she cooed as she snapped a photo that you were obviously not posing for.  Mom then pulled you toward the car, and with you still scowling, strapped you into the child seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Mom was driving you to your new kindergarten school. </span></div></div>",

I'll try my best not to leave you stuck with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than encouraged, you let out a long groan of frustration and despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, honey,\" Mom says, \"Just try to enjoy yourself a little, will you? This doesn't have to be all bad... I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she gets back in the car and drives off. Once again her departure brings about that sense that you really are just a kid, as if she's taking a part of you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudge into the kindergarten grounds and look over the children playing outside. You don't see Lilith anywhere, so that's a small relief. Hopefully she doesn't come here, but she could simply be absent today or even just hiding somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, whassa matter?\" comes a kid's voice from your left. You wince and grit your teeth before turning to look at this... girl, you think? The stick-thin limbs and just-shy-of-shoulder-length hair suggest as much, but the T-shirt and shorts display no pretense of femininity. You wish you were dressed like that. \"Are you lonely? I'll be your friend!\" she says. Your dismissive muttering does nothing to discourage her, and she forcefully grabs your hand. \"I'm Connie! Who're you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine,\" you sigh, reluctant to let your new moniker escape your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meetcha, Jasmine!\" Connie beams, shaking your hand so vigorously that you lose your balance for a second. \"Wanna come play with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures to two boys short distance behind her throwing a soft ball back and forth between themselves. A pretty pointless activity, but there are worse things you could be roped into, and you should probably take the opportunity to establish yourself as a tomboy. \"Sure, why not,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Connie cheers. She swiftly drags you closer to the boys; again, you almost fall over. You can hardly believe this scrawny kid can throw you around like this. \"Jasmine's gonna play with us!\" she announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy currently holding the ball frowns at you. \"She can't play. She's a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl, stupid!\" Connie retorts, conveniently erasing your remaining doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... she's a <i>girl</i>-girl!\" the boy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not!\" you object. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you dimly recognise how childish you just sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Come on, she's playing!\" Connie says. \"Jasmine, this is Justin,\" she points at the boy with the ball, then at the other one, \"And Davey!\" She then walks into position and holds out her arms. \"Pass it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a short while participating in the aimless game of catch. The rhythm of it (as much as a bunch of kindergartners can achieve rhythm) is sort of relaxing, and it certainly beats some of the things you've been made to do recently. Still, being an equal to these kids doesn't sit well with you. Feeling a need to assert your superiority, you decide to mess with them a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time you catch the ball, you hold it up and swing it in a fake throw toward Justin. He stumbles comically, and Connie bursts out laughing at him. While she's distracted, you lightly toss the ball at her. She produces a little \"Oof!\" as it bounces off her, then stares blankly at you for a moment, making you wonder if that was a bit much. But then she laughs again. \"I like you! You're funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but chuckle and grin, if only briefly. Everything aside, there's no denying the charm of a smiling little girl... as long as it's not you, at least.</span></div></div>",

You and your new friends ran toward the classroom and noisily settled down in the seats.  It took a while for your teacher, Miss Summers, to get you all settled.  \"Be quiet children!\", she said, as you slid into your seat and adjusted your bag by your feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now a little more settled and Miss Summers began the roll call. You hardly paid attention as you looked around and noticed Lilith sitting to the right of the room.  You had not seen her earlier during play and you were actually relieved to see her.  At least I have some friends here after all, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine Storms\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not answer, as you had not been paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine Storms!:, Miss Summers said again, a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....I'm here!\", you responded.  The other children laughed.  Miss Summers was not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see we have a smart one here, have we?\", she said, looking at you closely.  \"I know you are new here so you are not fully aware  of how to behave yet.\", Miss Summers continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were puzzled.  What the hell is she talking about?  What have I done wrong now? you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, when we do roll call, the correct way to answer is \"present Miss Summers\", or \"Here Miss Summers\", is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and catching yourself, responded, a little reluctantly \"Yes Miss Summers\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Summers continued the roll call to the last name, \"Jonathan Zlot\", to which a big kid with shaggy red hair answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK class, we will be doing some phonics so get your books out for this exercise\", Miss Summers announced,  \"We are looking at vowels and will start with the Aa sound.\"  <br>\r\nThe rustle  of books on desks as the children eagerly pulled out their phonics books contrasted with your slow and reluctant effort to take your book out. This is definitely going to be one boring day after all, you thought ruefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was not long before you were proved wrong.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Apart from the mind numbing boredom, that big kid, Jonathan Zlot, was next to you and didn't take your under the breath comment that this was easy too kindly. As you saw the kids begin to pick out things to play with, you was disappointed to see that all the balls were taken. you looked up and saw that connie had the last ball. You was about to go to her, since she looked up and saw her, when Lilith came over . She had some dolls and urged you to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Like like home you thought to yourself. You didn't want to choose. While you had no desire to really play with dolls, you did appriciate a friendly face, and didn't want to lose it. Nor did you want to lose a friend who could make up feel almost normal. As you waited, a voice hissed, \"Princeth smarth mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away Johnathon\" you said to the boy who was much larger than you. As you said it, both Connie and Lilith turned back and saw you was in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say. 'i learnth thith...' Fine. Burb the abc's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww. That's gross\" Connie said. You wasn't paying too much attention, but Jonathon grabbed you by your hair and hissed for you to do what he says. You was determiined not to give in, but when he pulled even harder, you started to cry, just like when you was hit in the face with the basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathon Zloty. You don't pull a girl's hair. go to the time out corner\" miss Summers yelled, as she saw and heard your sobs. He released you, and walked off. Both lilith and Coonie went up to you at once, while all the other girls were grouped nearby.</span></div></div>",

This should be an easy choice, but as you look into Lily's expectant eyes, the thought of turning her down becomes difficult to bear. The part of your brain urging you to get away from her is countered by the part that feels a strange bond with her, perhaps because your subconscious can't quite register your trip to her house as anything other than a good time.</span></div></div>",

You turn around just in time for the ball she had to fly into your chest, and she laughs as you instinctively fumble to try and catch it, eventually managing to get a hold of it before it falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't do that!\" an affronted Lilith objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sharing her complaint, you grin mischievously and fake a low throw before tossing the ball over Connie's head. After a belated little hop to try and catch it, she runs to retrieve the ball, and upon doing so immediately spins around and throws it back, making you jump to the side to intercept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of you are running around, having left Lily in the dust, making all sorts of attempts to outwit each other with your throws - with you having the most successes, of course, since she's learning all the tricks from you. Part of you objects to how much fun you're having, but it's certainly better to enjoy this than playing tea party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the school bell is ringing before you know it. If only the lessons could feel so short. Inevitably, on your way back to class you encounter a hurt-looking Lilith, ready to give you the guilt trip of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine... I thought we were friends!\" she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are!\" you instantly respond. You don't even know anymore if it's the truth or not. \"But... Connie's my friend too. We can play later, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise?\" she pleads, puppy dog eyes and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I promise,\" you say. You're probably going to regret this at some point, but what else could you do? It's too late to just get rid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Lily hangs her head, still looking upset, but with not much more either of you can say, you walk off and take your seat. As you wait for the next round of drudgery to begin, you have a little time to contemplate the absurdity of your situation. Are you seriously going around trying to manage your relationships with other kindergarten pupils? How did it come to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day is about as unremarkable as it can be. You consider playing dumb on a couple of occasions just to get Jonathan off your back, but you'd hate yourself for doing that. Regardless, he doesn't really bother you again outside of the odd muttered remark. Lilith, meanwhile, hangs around you whenever she can, but Connie proves able to snatch your attention away from her at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the school day finally comes to a close, you rush outside almost as eagerly as any other child. Lily's mom is already out there waiting, and Lily runs ahead of you to meet her. You hang back, not wanting Mrs. Parker to see you, and thankfully Lily doesn't seem to point you out before the two of them are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Connie startles you by coming up behind you and putting her arms over your shoulders in a flagrant violation of your personal space. \"Are you waiting for your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you flatly answer, no longer in any mood to indulge her now that you're almost out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that her?\" Connie asks, pointing at some random woman entering the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you reply, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie promptly points at some other woman. \"Is that her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... is that her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she guessed right this time. Mom comes through the gate having parked the car somewhere you didn't see. \"Yes,\" you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Connie cheers. \"And there's my mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie runs off to greet her mother, who is standing... right next to yours. Uh-oh. You walk towards Mom, who starts to say something, but stops when Connie gestures to you and says to her mom, \"Mom, this is Jasmine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Hello there!\" Connie's mom says before turning to your mom. \"I haven't seen you around; are you new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes,\" Mom says. \"It seems we have a pair of little friends here, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. You know, I'm glad to see Connie get along with another girl for a change, she'll need female friends when she's older...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your dismay, they just keep on talking. Connie just smiles up at her mom, seemingly admiring the adult conversation, but you stop paying attention in favour of expressing impatience. After a minute or so of grumpy foot-tapping and a couple of failed attempts to get Mom's attention, you start pushing against her leg to try and make her move, only to stop when you realise how silly (and doubtlessly adorable) you're being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat relatively minor embarrassment seems to pay off, though - your mom soon says goodbye to Connie's and takes your hand to lead you to the car. Connie waves at you as she skips off in the other direction. \"Bye, Jasmine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't sound like you had such a bad time,\" Mom says with a smile you really don't want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that,\" Mom says as you get in the car. \"Having some good friends will help you deal with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, come on!\" you exclaim. \"You said you'd keep trying to fix me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dear,\" Mom sighs. \"But I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trails off, but you think you know why she doesn't want to finish that thought. She doesn't really think anymore that there's any way back to normalcy for you, but she's trying to act otherwise because she thinks you'll complain less if you still have hope that this is temporary. You don't feel like pressing the issue, though. What would be the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get home, your siblings inquire about your day with varying levels of interest, but you brush them off. You don't want your life at home to be tainted by the things you're being made to take part in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it soon is. After about an hour of playing video games and generally lounging around while refusing to answer anyone's questions, you hear the front door open and exit your room in time to hear part of a conversation in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some time with the husband,\" a woman says. You can't see her - Mom's in the way - but her voice sounds familiar. Is that Lily's mom, or Connie's? They must sound pretty similar, because you can't tell. \"I could get a babysitter,\" whoever-she-is continues, \"But she was eager to come and see Jasmine anyway... it's not any trouble, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not,\" Mom says. Great, thanks, Mom. This is the worst day she's given you since you broke that vase when you were seven... you take a moment to wrap your head around the idea that you're younger now than you were then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mom steps away from the door, you can finally see who's come to visit you...</span></div></div>",

I'd admit, mom did surprise me with her little camp out gear downstairs, but that can't last forever\" Ella said seriously, none of her usual cheery tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done what? What have you done?\" you said, bordering on a scream. You took your eyes off Ella and realized that all your posters had been removed from the walls. \"You're renovating my room!?\" Your panic deepening, you turned, and realized it wasn't just your posters. A single brush-stroke of pastel pink paint was on your wall where it wouldn't be immediately seen. the sight of it send you madder than you've ever been. \"Pink?!\", the only word you managed to spit out in your rage induced state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz.

Lily and I are doing painting\" you said, hoping that you'd use it all up. before Ella could react, you rushed back downstairs, and past your surprised brother and sister. Mom was also in the room, thanks to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What have you got there\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pink paint from Ella\" you said, causing James and Zoe to share a glance at each other. Not again mom thought as they rushed upstairs to confront her. Sighing, mom walked after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, Lily, look what I found!\" you announce as you re-enter the room with the paint can... which is starting to feel <i>really</i> heavy, so you drop it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Okay, not a question you were expecting, but she <i>is</i> five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's paint!\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! What'll we paint?\" Lily asks, fiddling with the can's lid and eventually managing to remove it. \"Where's brushes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...\" In your impulsive course of action, you hadn't considered that. \"I think there's some stuff in the garage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garage? Are we s'posed to go there?\" Lily doubtfully inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit late to think about what we're supposed to be doing,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me,\" you say. You lift the paint can up on your shoulder - neglecting to reattach the lid, which is still in Lily's hands - and make for the door to the garage. Almost as soon as you get inside, you trip over, grazing your elbow and spilling a large puddle of paint over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. Not the smartest thing you've ever done, but... mission accomplished, you suppose. Mom's not gonna be happy, of course, but at least you missed the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" Lilith yelps. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" you stutter, holding back the tears summoned by the pain in your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna get in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I... don't worry about it. You stay here, I'll talk to Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gives no response in the instant she has before you rush off to find your family at the top of the stairs. You sort of expected it to be World War III up here, but as you approach you find to your surprise that the argument seems to be coming to a peaceful conclusion. You see Zoe put her arm on Ella's shoulder in an uncharacteristically friendly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fair to say that Jazz won't make all the right decisions herself.\" Oof. Clearly she hasn't noticed you. Ella, however, shoots you a glance before Zoe continues, \"But that doesn't mean you can just put yourself in charge. You at least have to go through Mom before you go doing things like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you just want to help, dear,\" Mom adds. \"Bur we all do. We need to work together and get through this as a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looks at you thoughtfully, causing Zoe to jump a little when she finally realises you're there. \"Jasmine,\" Mom says, \"You trust us, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you together? Sure, I guess.\" Your answer would, of course, be more confident if Ella wasn't included in the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then here's what we'll do. The four of us will work together to renovate your room. We'll properly discuss everything, we'll do all we can to work out what's best for you, and...\" Mom directs a pointed look at the twins before finishing, \"There will be no shouting matches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why can't I...\" you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard for you,\" Mom cuts you off, \"But if it were up to you, you wouldn't change a thing, would you? Sometimes... it's better to let others make decisions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she's right, you think as you slouch in defeat. Maybe you're not capable of being rational about this. James and Zoe silently urge you to accept... well, at least with them involved, it shouldn't turn out totally unbearable. With a heavy heart, you nod slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Mom says. \"Now then... tomorrow after school we'll leave you with Lilith...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connie,\" you interject. Your time with Lily today hasn't been the worst thing in the world, but you certainly don't want to make a habit of hanging out with her every day. Your siblings exchange questioning looks while Mom, after a moment's thought, nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We'll leave you with Connie, if we can, and we'll get started on shopping for new things for your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you start. But what? You don't want your old things to go, you don't want to leave your decor at anyone's mercy... but you already agreed it was for the best. \"Okay,\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then...\" Mom stops when she sees Lily approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Jasmine? What's going on?\" Lily asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno,\" you lie. \"Grown-up stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looks at you blankly for a second before turning her attention to Mom. \"Uh, Mrs. Storms?\" She hangs her head and puts her arms behind her back. \"We spilled paint in the garage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and smile nervously in response to Mom's withering stare. Without a word, she lets out her familiar can't-catch-a-break sigh and heads for the garage, Lilith in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face, it, sis, it's not gonna be pink walls,\" James snickers at Ella. \"So who's Connie?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to share details, you answer, \"Let me put it this way. Ella wouldn't like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! When can I meet her?\" Zoe asks. She and James burst into laughter, prompting Ella to march off to her room, grumbling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo or three hours later, once Lilith has left, you hesitantly enter the garage to find Mom cleaning the paint off the floor. You've been expecting her to give you hell ever since she saw the spill, but she never said much and still doesn't look angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this brings back memories,\" she comments wistfully. \"I don't know how I ever handled having four little rascals of my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at the thought that you're reminding Mom of raising actual kids. \"Don't say things like that,\" you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom arches an eyebrow. \"Well, would you rather I grounded you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ground me?\" The concept strikes you as meaningless. \"I might as well be grounded already. It's not like I can go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you were grounded, we couldn't take you to see Connie,\" Mom nonchalantly remarks as she continues cleaning. \"You like her, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, go ahead and ground me, and then Ella can stay here to watch me instead of going shopping with you,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shakes her head. \"I never did think grounding was a good punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. Subject matter aside, this is actually a nice, casual conversation you're having for once. But you doubt you'll like where it'll go if you keep it up, so you head upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around your mostly untouched, comfortingly familiar room and sigh before looking down at yourself. You can't deny it's a total mismatch. You climb onto your bed and take a few pictures of the place with your phone. Soon afterward, you decide you might as well get some sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The teacher, Miss Summers, was going through numerals and basic maths, and you were, as usual, not paying attention.  What the hell for, anyway, you thought.  After all, this is kid stuff and you had done this before.  Instead, your mind was on the impending changes to your room which, you really did not want.  You felt almost powerless to stop what is happening around you and this is becoming a little maddening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASMINE STORMS!\", followed by a loud rap on the teacher's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literally jumped out of your seat in fright at this unwelcomed interruption to your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Huh?\", you stuttered before realising that all eyes were on you and Miss Summers was glaring angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh....., yes Miss Summers?\", you asked, a little timidly.  You did not know what kind of trouble you are in this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question young miss\", Miss Summers said tersely, a few snickers followed her remark.  \"I am waiting on your answer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not know what to say, since you actually did not hear the question.  You wondered if it was a good idea to ask her to repeat it since as you could clearly see, Miss Summers was not in the least amused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Uhmmm,  I don't know?\", you managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then.  You will have to do that for your homework and return tomorrow with the answer.\", she said before continuing with the lesson.  You were bewildered.  Of course, you just answered a question you did not hear, and being incorrect, you now have it to do for homework, still clueless about what this entailed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Great shit to be caught in. Just my luck.\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say???\"  Miss Summers thundered.  The class fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-nothing\", you quickly said, realising at that moment that what you thought you were thinking was actually said out loud and Miss Summers heard.  You braced yourself for what might happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painful grip on your upper arm caused you to yelp involuntarily, eliciting laughter from the rest of the class.  Miss Summers was pulling you and muttering angrily, \"Off to the Principal's office with you young lady.  I have just about enough of your inattentiveness and impertinence!.\"  Your little feet could hardly keep up with the angry strides of your kindergarten teacher and the pain in your upper arm seemed to grow more intense with every step.  Tears sprung to your eyes and you protested weakly, \"P-please, you're hurting me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Principal's office, you sat miserably as Miss Summers related what had just transpired, adding some generous embellishments as she did. You squirmed as you realised that what Miss Summers was doing was building a bad case against you so that the Principal will have to dish out the harshest punishment.  You wanted to blurt out that she was telling a load of crap but you remembered who and where you were and kept quiet.  Shit, this is not good, you thought.  I might as well be hit by a bus and be done with it, you thought miserably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miss Summers was through telling her lies, you were simmering with rage and had to bite your lips hard not to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Miss Storms\", the Principal, Mrs. Forrest said, looking at you deeply.  \"What have you got to say for yourself?\", she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all this stuff already and the class is boring!\", you blurted without thinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth adults were taken aback.  You realised too late that you have blurted a secret that you might have to explain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm, I mean, my mom taught me all that stuff already so it's not new to me. And I'm bored...\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why did you answer the question I asked with an \"I don't know\", huh?\", Miss Summers asked.  The Principal gave the teacher a \"Let-me-handle-this\" look before turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your mom taught you everything.  That does not give you the license to do anything less than pay attention in class, is that clear?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and realising that this is not the best thing for a five-year old to do, mumbled, \"Yes Mrs Forrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not put this on your record this time Jasmine, but you will have to learn to control yourself and your utterances.  Remember, we are an institution of bright little minds that need to be shaped with only good things.  We do not want any disruptive forces here.\", she said, a little too coyly for your liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered a barely audible, \"Yes Miss\", before being ushered out by Miss Summers, back to class.  On your way back, Miss Summers stopped, spun you around and stooping so that you were both at eye level, hissed  \"Now let me tell you this missy, I don't know what your game is but I will not have you mess with my class.  I have my eye on you, so from now on, you keep your butt out of my hair and we will be really good friends...\".  The last bit ending as though she was reciting a poem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, not knowing how to react.  You really did not expect this venom from your class teacher and was a little terrified about what might happen if you dared to say anything smart.  You only managed a small squeak, \"Y-yes Miss Summers...\" before the two of you continued walking towards the classroom as though the little exchange did not happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resolved in your mind never to return to this kindergarten no matter how much pressure mom might put on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sick of Ella forcing me into being her private doll! Guess she replaced the one we stole with me\" you said ruefully. James smiled thinly, remembering how he and you stole her doll with the intent of getting her to back off. Pity it seemed to result in the opposite response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I hadn't been too much of a help stopping you from ending up in skirts. I was just too stunned for me to respond\" he said. You gave a sigh and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. You see why I was freaked out at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" James said. 'What are you going to do about it, Jazz? Nathan rang while you was painting, and the whole you've got flu going to work forever. He's suspicious, especially since he knows something was spilt onto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'll think of something\" you said tiredly. \"Where is mom having this big talk of hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your room, but...\" James started, but you was off before he could finish. You bounded up the stairs, opened your room and gasped, as you saw that your walls had been fully painted pastel pink. Mom, Zoe and an awkward looking Ella was sitting on your bed, which thankfully, looked the same as always. Other than your walls, your room looked more or less intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my room?!\" you yelled, realizing Ella must had a second tin of paint.

A part of you wondered how James or Zoe would like their rooms girlified. The pleasing part was that mom made it clear your room was the final thing that would be changed and Ella would not force you into anything more girly like ballet or whatever torturous thing she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Jazz.

Why do I have to go there?\" you whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jazz, but you have to\" mom said, her face sympathetic. As you slouched towards the stairs, you heard the phone ring. Without thinking, you picked it up. \"Hello. Jazz....\" you began to say, but you stopped yourself. It could be anyone on the other end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz!

I don't want to play with Connie!  I want to play with you!\", she yelled.<br>\r\nJust before anyone said anything further, your teacher, Miss Summers entered the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK children, lets settle down now for today's lessons\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved as you took your seat and the others went to theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful and you were only too eager to meet mom when she returned to pick you up.</span></div></div>",

I really don't care if it's ten million these bastards cannot hope to buy my silence about what has happened to your brother with a measly two mill...\"  she stopped and poured herself a drink, tossing two ice cubes into the glass.

You were surprised to realize that these clothes were new and not any of your old clothes or belonging to James.  Zoe saw your expression and chuckled, \"Remember when we went to the mall to shop for clothes for you?  I just had to grab these although Ella had gotten you all those feminine clothes.  Now these have come in handy.  Quick, put them on before Nathan gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gratefully put the boyish clothes on and was quite pleased with the effect.  As you looked at yourself in the mirror, you realized that it was not so hard to look like a boy again, with the help of a hat or other headgear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, If only I had known, I would have done this long ago\", you said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe laughed, \"well, butt head, all you had to do was to ask me, I would have fixed you up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.... better late than never.  ....All you have to do when Nathan gets here is not to breathe a word that I am a girl\", you said, a little more seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both headed back downstairs, just as Ella entered the family room followed by James.  They had been over next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what happened to you??\", Ella blurted.  James looked at you, noticing the change for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, I'm a boy again!\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-how did that happen?\", sputtered Ella, \"Zoe, when did this happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz's just pulling your legs guys.  Nathan is coming over and we don't want him to be bugged out by seeing Jazz as a girl just yet, so I gave him the clothes he's wearing\", Zoe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like it!\", Ella pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough bananas Ella.\", Zoe retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ella could reply, the door bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Nathan, guys remember what I said, not a word...\", you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe went to answer the door while you settled in one of the couches. Ella and James left the room, Ella muttering something about having other things to do. James headed toward the kitchen, to raid the fridge, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe returned with Nathan who stopped and stared at you the moment he entered the family room area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude....wow....this is mad, ....crazy...\", was all he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me, just a little smaller.\", you said, trying to make light of the situation and alleviate his obvious discomfort at seeing you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is weird.  ...How does it feel to be a small boy again Jazz?\", he asked with awe.  You took mental note that your best friend had not done the usual back slapping, buddy handshake routine with you.  How could he, with someone who has become a total stranger, practically overnight?, you thought ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a little getting used to, but I'm getting the hang of it\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's with the cap?\", Nathan asked, and before you could stop him, he knocked the cap from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Nathan's expression changed to shock, as your long flowing hair fell to your shoulders.  Zoe stifled her shocked outburst, making only a muffled cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooaa, ....Jazz...your hair has grown!  Is that because of the serum?\", Nathan finally sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\", you sighed.  You did not offer any further explanation, leaving Nathan to draw his own conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then. We'll just have to get used to your new look then\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to invite Nathan to your room for a video game but remembered that it had undergone a pink makeover thanks to your siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nathan\", mom said as she entered the family room from upstairs.  \"Jazz, may I see you in the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Mom.\", you said as you followed her to the kitchen. James was finishing a sandwich, and as you entered, he took the last bites and left for his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom went to the sink and after a few minutes, turned to you and said, \"Jerry agrees that we have a case against the lab but he's asking me if I am sure I wanted to go ahead with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he say that mom?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerry thinks that this case is a sensational one already and will attract some unwanted media attention.  I actually forgot about that...\", mom sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he recommend then mom?\", you asked, your voice betraying your increasing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He recommended...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to wear it so\" you groaned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but why don't you cut it off?\" Nathan suggested. Zoe gave you a look, confirming your thoughts. If you cut your hair and styled it boyishly, Ella would have a major freak-out, and you doubt mom would be too happy about it either. If you refused to cut it, Nathan would know something's up, and probably guess the truth. Better think fast, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The serum.\" you said, shaking your head. \"Those 'scientists' said its going to continue to make things like my hair grow really fast. And since I don't want daily haircuts, its best to keep it at this length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daily haircuts?\" Nathan said, shaking his head, though you could see he brought it. You felt pleased with yourself too, since that explanation covers your nails, which were starting to get worryingly long, though Nathan didn't appear to see or care about them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan, what am I going to do about Chelsea? I know she's going to dump me...\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think of something for you, Jazz. Better get going.

Once he was gone, you headed for your room, but you got a shock. Ella's something to do apparently meant waiting in your room. You stared at your girly sister. \"out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real nice going, Jasmine. You lied to your closest friend\" Ella said in a displeased tone.</span></div></div>",

Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise,\" you state as she skips away, satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Nathan who used to be slightly shorter than you, \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan smirks, \"Ready, Jasmine.\" He put emphasis on Jasmine and you frown but follow him to his car. He opens the back door and to your surprise, buckles you into a booster seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\" you inquire, squirming in your new seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to obey the law so I borrowed it from my neighbor.\" Nathan says starting the car and driving out of the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you picking me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Mom was busy. Now tell me what's really going on, Jazz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed reluctantly, \"I'm a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan whipped his head around, \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look where you are driving, dude!\" you shout. Nathan turned his focus to the road again and you continued, \"The serum has changed my gender to a girl, it has on every experiment they've performed at the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about the guy who had it spill on him and nothing happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a cover up. The man became a teenage girl named Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Didn't see that coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did we,\" you say reminiscing on meeting Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to explain how the serum could have possibly changed your mentality to that of a girl but you took another serum that should buy you more time. You explain that you are hoping to receive the antidote soon because you hate being a small girl. You skip over the incident with Lilith in which you became a complete 5 year old girl. After explaining everything with the doctors, lawyers and investigator, you stare at Nathan waiting for a response. Nathan had kept quiet through your explanation, except for a few nods here and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan looked back at you, \"I'm still stunned. I mean, only a week ago I was hanging with my best bro and now I'm driving a 5 year old girl around in my car, who is the same person. It's weird. I miss you. The old you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, letting a few tears roll down your cheek, \"Me too, man. Me too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Nathan who sees your crying. Nathan gazes at you with sympathy in his eyes, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, tell you what Jazz, let's just go somewhere and hang out for a while and do something fun, just like old times\", Nathan suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were a little surprised that Nathan would still want to hang out with you considering that he just found out the truth about your change, which you had lied about in the first place.  You suddenly realized what a good friend he really was to want to spend time with you although now you were a mere child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we could do that, ...but what about mom?\", you asked, concerned that she might be mad if you did not return home on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't take long and I could always drop you home before curfew.\", Nathan said, with a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan adjusted the car's radio until he settled on a pop station.  You were silent for a few minutes then asked, \"Hey where will we be going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww..., well, we could check out the Mall for starters...\", Nathan replied.  You looked out the window and saw that you were passing the City Park which was a few minutes from the Mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, that would be cool.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n _______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Nathan pulled up at the Mall and parked than a group of five guys, who were actually part of your old school's basketball team, came up to Nathan, \"Hey dude, whats up?\", the biggest one grinned, \"Taking your baby sister out, eh?\", he ribbed.  The other boys laughed, \"Yeah, baby sitter, whats up?\", one of them hooted, to more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt terrible and wished you had not agreed to go with Nathan after all.  Nathan, however, calmly replied, \"Yeah Josh, I'm out with my baby sis today, what are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me, just hanging with the guys as usual.  Just kickin' it.\", Josh replied.  \"By the way, have you seen Jazz lately?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh damn!  Hope Nathan keeps his mouth shut and not give me up now</i>, you winced as that thought crossed your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him lately\", Nathan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, but you are his best bud, how come you haven't seen him?\", Josh asked. Before Nathan could reply, he continued,  \"When you see him, let him know that he has missed a couple of practices and coach is gettin' really mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, and was a little relieved that none of the guys picked up on it.  You knew you were in deep trouble as since school resumed, you were in Kindergarten and had missed quite a few practice games and a big basketball tournament was just a few weeks away.  No wonder coach was mad, since you were the team captain.  You wondered whether mom had gotten a call from your coach.  You made a mental note to ask her about this when you get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Josh, I'll let him know\", Nathan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to tell him now,...\", Josh said as he and the others walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a close one\", you breathed with relief, but you saw in Nathan's expression that he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's with the dark clouds Nathan?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, do you?\", Nathan said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled and did not know what to say.  <i>Where is this coming from?</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you are missing in action, life goes on Jazz.  Everyone at school is asking for you and guess what, many of them are coming to me!\", Nathan almost shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before yesterday when I finally found out what happened to you, it was easy for me to just say \"I don't know\", but now, how am I going to face every body, knowing what I know now?\".  Nathan looked at you, a mixture of frustration and exasperation on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now beginning to realize how hard it must have been for Nathan after the field trip to account for you and it dawned on you that in all this, you had not really made any effort to deal with the effects this change was having on your friends and other relationships at your old school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks...\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right it sucks!\", Nathan exclaimed, \"Ever since that field trip, everything is one big mess and you are not the only one affected.  The other day your girlfriend, Chelsea, came crying to me, begging me to talk to you for her because she couldn't reach you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\", was all you could say.  <i>This is indeed a real messy situation and here you were playing kindergarten with a bunch of kids</i>, you thought ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better make up your mind Jasper Storms.  Continue to play kindergarten with those babies, or do something to get your old life back!  It's your choice. There must be something you can do to reverse this,.... this, curse!\", Nathan raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt really awful and suddenly wanted to go home.  \"You're right Nathan, there is something I can do. Let's go home.\", you finally said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after Nathan took you back home, you headed for your room, to sit and brood.  Nathan was wrong; you hadn't sat down and done nothing, since you still had your computer, and it still had the records of all your web searches, including those on the lab. Nathan had intended to just drop you off and head home, but he ran into Zoe. Zoe was the only one home, and she looked shocked to see Nathan walk you in, and from the response he gave her, you wasn't the only one that he wanted to rant against. It wasn't too smart, since she had years of practice arguing against Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done nothing\" you said to yourself as you stared at your room, but as you stared at the pink walls, you realized you argued furiously, but accepted things far too readily. And even thought your ability to act had been seriously curtailed, you accepted there is nothing that could be done too easily. So had mom, in a way. She was too focused on vengeance, and not enough on cures. Unless she saw there is none... Ella tried something, but returned pale, like if she was trapped watching Zoe's horror movies all night... Why wouldn't they tell you? Its your life that has been ruined. Quickly, you jumped off of bed, and headed downstairs, where Zoe and Nathan were still argueing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believed you allowed that\" Nathan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my sister\" Zoe fired right back. She must had heard your approach, since she turned and faced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a ride. I'm going back to that lab\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked at you surprised. \"Mom won't be too happy...\" she started, but Nathan glared at her, like if he was saying, 'so I'm right?' \"Fine, but he's coming too\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you, Zoe and Nathan were standing in front of the labs entrance, and you could see Zoe was getting cold feet, since she kept muttering something about experimentation. Even Nathan, despite his previous bluster looked uneasy. After all, you surmised that this was the place that reduced you  down into a little girl,  and he must had been worried that they could do it to him</span></div></div>",

I'm tired of being told what's good for me. It's time I made my own decisions, and I'm deciding to go in there and give them a piece of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you march into the building, Nathan and Zoe reluctantly following you. You pace around the foyer for a bit, the receptionist looking at you quizzically as you consider your plan of attack, until you see Dr. Hanson emerge from one of the corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" you shout at the sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he says, \"What is it now, Miss... Mister... ugh. What do you want, Storms? ...And where is your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sixteen,\" you assert. \"I don't need my mom with me all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" he sneers. \"Think yourself independent, do you? Why the escorts, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Nathan and Zoe giving you \"he's got you there\" looks, but you don't think so. \"Because this place isn't safe no matter how old you are,\" you say.  \"That's what started all this in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Dr. Hanson starts to look angry. \"I'll have you know we take safety regulations seriously during our research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" you retort. \"Is that why you had your experimental goop just sitting there waiting to spill on someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. So mistakes were made,\" Dr. Hanson states coldly. \"Never mind that. What's done is done. Now why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here because I want my life back!\" you shout. \"I'm stuck getting sent to kindergarten and socialising with five-year-olds, and you're gonna do something about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson is unmoved. \"Bah. Feeling emotional today, are we? Calm yourself down and think for a moment. What would you have us do? I understand none of us want this situation to become public knowledge, so how are we meant to justify sending a five-year-old to high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having any particular answer to that, you just stand there fuming until Zoe hesitantly speaks up. \"There must be something you can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't,\" Dr. Hanson flippantly replies. \"Certainly not now, and not without creating more problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt in frustration at the qualifiers. He clearly hasn't been trying that hard to help you. But first you try for the solution you'd prefer. \"Get me an antidote then! I know you can make one if you try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be difficult,\" Dr. Hanson says, \"And more to the point, not worthwhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really so self-absorbed you haven't thought at all about what you're a part of?\" Dr. Hanson asks, suddenly raising his voice enough to make you flinch.  \"Our research is going to change the world, and the sooner it's complete the more lives will be saved. We are not going to waste our time to satisfy one little brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, you stand there listening to Dr. Hanson breathe heavily until you see Dr. Blake walk up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... Dr. Hanson,\" he says, \"Perhaps I could deal with this interruption?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think it's already dealt with,\" Dr. Hanson grumbles. You exchange glares with him as he turns away and stomps off, heading through a door and slamming it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologise for Dr. Hanson's temper,\" Dr. Blake says, \"But... perhaps you understand him better now? He may not be what you'd call a nice man, but he has good intentions at heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" Nathan suddenly spits. Apparently <i>this</i> doctor isn't too scary for him to confront. \"The serum obviously works already. You could be using it to help people right now, but you're still keeping it under wraps. I bet that guy just wants it for his own selfish uses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... not the case,\" Dr. Blake says. \"Just because the serum functions doesn't mean it's safe to use. We barely averted a significant psychological breakdown in this case, and in the long term we don't...\" He trails off seeing the concern on your face. \"Ahem. Besides, we're only producing the serum in very limited amounts at this point. It's very valuable, and if everyone knew of its effects on humans... well, we could become a target for all sorts of unsavoury types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what about an antidote?\" you ask weakly, trying to get the conversation back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've already done more work on that than Dr. Hanson would like,\" Dr. Blake sighs, \"But we haven't accomplished much of anything. Our first test batch was, well... destructive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... can't you at least get Jazz off school?\" Zoe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have made contact with the government,\" Dr. Blake says, \"But... I don't know. It would arouse suspicion. I'm sorry, but you must realise you aren't going to achieve anything by being here today. This is a serious matter and it needs to settled formally.\"</span></div></div>",

It appeared that you had encountered another dead end, just like the one with that detective, Harry.  <i>What do you do now</i>? you thought.  The silence that followed was getting awkward until Zoe cleared her throat and spoke up, \"Dr. Blake, please there must be something you could do, for us.  Ever since that field trip accident, things have become very hard and confusing.  I really wished I had my big brother back...\".  To your utter surprise, Zoe started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time in a very long time you have seen your tomboy sister cry.  The thought that she was crying on account of you touched you and you realized that for Zoe, more than Ella, your transformation into this little girl may have been more traumatic than she was letting on.  You reached out and touched her sobbing shoulders while Nathan stood by uncomfortably. Dr. Blake adjusted his tie nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sniffed and wiped away tears, her cheeks red with embarrassment for having broken down in front of Nathan and Dr. Blake.  \"Sorry about that Dr...but you really don't know what it's like to lose a brother this way.  We can't play basketball anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Blake replied reassuringly, \"I understand and I wish we had the antidote right away to apply.  The simple truth is that we are trying but without much success.  Something always goes wrong and I'm afraid we'll need much more time to work on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much time!\", you interjected.  \"Every day that passes, I'm afraid that I will lose myself and be this little girl forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Blake thought for a moment and then excused himself to retrieve his notes.  While he was out of the room, you turned to Nathan and Zoe, \"What do you think guys?\", you asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really hope that this Dr. Blake will find a way to help us\", Nathan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Dr. Blake returned with a file folder in which you presumed were his notes on your case.  He perused the file and after a few minutes said, \"There might just be something we could try...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What?\", you asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will however require your mother's consent\", he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll get it.  Just tell us what it is\", Zoe said, a little impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will need to draw some blood from your sister...er brother here and check to see how advanced the youth serum really is and whether there is likely to be any further action by the serum. We would also need to test whether we could apply a new growth inducing drug we are testing to see the results.  Granted this may not have the same effect as an age serum but it might buy us some time until one is developed. There might not be anything we can do right now about the gender though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened carefully to what Dr. Blake had to say and you thought you understood what this meant.  Zoe and Nathan were also attentive.  You got the feeling though that Nathan was not fully comfortable with what he was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that Jazz will still be a girl even if she grew?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to test and see\", Dr. Blake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have a big basketball game coming up!\", Nathan cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way, the quicker Mrs. Storms agrees to have us proceed, the faster we can bring your friend as close to normal as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You know what that is?\" mom said. \"And what about the fact even if we take those risks, I don't like the idea of them having to test you.\" She paused, as if she was gathering her thoughts. \"I'm sorry, Jasmine, but  you're going to have to grow up again. I thought you accepted that after the remodelling of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It s my life that's over! What about coach? My friends?

Mom tried to reassure you that her decision was the right one and she had your best interest at heart.  You, however were not happy and blurted, \"so after all this, I am forced to grow up again??  Do you know what this means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tried to reassure you, \"No matter what happens Jazz, I love you, we all love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on, \"I'll be forced to live childhood again as a girl and by the time I'm 16 again, you will be close to 50 years old, mom!  Ella and Zoe will be 25 year old adults, even my baby brother James will be an adult.  I will be the only child left with no one to hang with!  How cool is that???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dude, I'll still be your friend\", Nathan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Nathan but when you go off as a 27 year old adult by the time I hit 16, where will that leave me??\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all do not understand what this is doing to me.  You all will be going on with your lives, I will be stuck as a child.  What if I end up a child with an adult mind by the time I hit 12??  Worse, what if I end up with a childlike mind by the time I reach 16 again, when I should have been 27??\", you asked,  \"Huh?, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered, as each thought about what you have just said and the implications.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finally said, \"but I am still concerned about possible side effects of those drugs the lab is developing.  Don't you understand, Jazz, what might happen?  We have no way of knowing how badly the drugs will affect your growth rate and even your development.  I am prepared to accept you as you are, and be with you as you grow up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still not happy as you felt that there must be something out there that could help you to return to normal.  An idea struck you and you gave voice to it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the serum's effect is just temporary and will wear off after a few weeks, or months?  Shouldn't we at least test to confirm whether this is possible?  In the meantime, how will you explain my absence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought for a moment, and sighed, \"We can write a letter to your school explaining that you have been sent abroad to live and go to school with a distant relative.  That means that you all need to keep what you know very confidential, that means you, Nathan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan nodded.  Zoe said, \"That means we need to say the same things to everybody we have come into contact these past few days.  What do we say to dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom snapped, \"Leave your father out of this!...I will prepare the letters and make the calls, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Nathan replied in the affirmative.  You said nothing, as you felt defeated and resigned to your fate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nathan hesitated, but followed you, not that you cared. You felt you life was over, and you didn't care if he saw your pink, girlish room or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man\" he breathed as he saw all the pink. He knew why you was so hesitant to bring him to your room, and began to wonder if he was too harsh about you accepting your fate; to him, it was clear you had nothing to do with your room. Silently, he looked and wondered if he could hook up a video game console or something, but he forgot you no longer had a tv in your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz...\" he started, but your 'Jasper phone' starting ringing. It was your friends, learning that you was gone expectantly. You stared at the text, as you found message after message. Finally it was Chelsea's turn. As you read, your started sobbing. Even from the words, you sensed she felt betrayed and disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Nathan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea. She broke up with me. She furious that I didn't tell her that I was going away\" you sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not so bad\" Nathan said, trying to comfort you. You continued to sob. Eventually, Nathan saw that his attempts at comforting you wasn't working, so he got up' hoping someone else would be more successful.

You even sat quietly at your desk and meekly did what you were told.  No protests from you and your teacher at one point wanted to find out why you were so morose. She did not persist, content to let you do what you liked except for when you had homework.  Then, you would have to participate n class and answer some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week went by, but for you, everything was one big senseless blur.  Ever since the decision your mom took to tell everyone that you were not in the country, you felt betrayed.  All your friends were no longer in touch with you, all that is, except for Nathan who still came around.  You noticed however that on each visit, you were having real difficulties relating to him.  He always wanted you to play video games and would have liked shooting hoops as you used to do but you were not in the mood, and besides you were too small to handle shooting hoops with your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour routine for the past week was to get dressed for school, be dropped off by your mom, endure another mind numbing boredom while the teacher taught lessons you had learnt what seemed to you now like a lifetime ago.  It was during these moments that you desperately wished you were your old self again and you had never gone on that field trip.  Sometimes you became angry at yourself for the loss of control and the fact that everything now is being done for you and you do not have much  say over anything.  You thought of how you had tried to reason with your mother about taking the lab test, and the resistance your mom had given. You felt trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday the school had to call your mom to come get you.</span></div></div>",

I had just asked Connie, when Jasmine started bursting into tears, and before I knew it, she ran out of the class. She curled up by that fake wooden log, and hasn't stopped crying. I sent her friends out to find out what had happened, but neither of them has gotten anything from her. Do you have any idea what would cause your daughter to react like this?\" Miss Summers wanted to ask more, since to her, your behavior had been weird from the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" mom said grimly. \"Jasmine is currently experiencing extreme trauma. I thought putting her amongst kids her own age would help..... Let me talk to her.\" Miss Summers nodded, and lead her out to the play area, where you was still curled up, with a very concerned Connie and Lily asking you what was wrong, as well as things like whether you wanted to play. You was unresponsive. lily noticed mom first. \"Mrs Storms? What's wrong with Jasmine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz feels sad because she feels like she lost someone very close to her\" mom said, as she picked you up.

With that she walked out with you in her arms.  You were relieved and comforted by your mother's arms as she walked to the car carrying you. You even like the smell of her perfume and for some strange reason, this smell gave you comfort.  As you sniffed and sobbed against her neck and shoulders, mom hushed you and rubbed your back.  You became a little calmer, as she continued to soothe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, tell me. what's wrong\", mom asked as she strapped you into the car seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed, but said nothing.  In fact, you did not know how to express the mix of feelings that has come over you.  Yes, you were unhappy but what exactly was causing this was not immediately clear.  Was it because this was your first day at school and your mom was not there? Or was it because you were scared and really wanted to stay home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom got into the car and started the engine, but she did not immediately drive, instead, she sighed, \"Jazz, please, don't shut me out now....Tell me what's wrong. What should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at mom and although she was not looking at you, you sensed that she was herself close to tears.  She continued, \"Did I do the right thing, Jazz?  Not letting your old school know the truth of what had happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what had taken place a week ago and somehow, it seemed like a lifetime ago.  Nothing makes sense to you now and you tried hard to remember what had happened before that week, and came up with nothing.  It seemed as though you had just woken up from a bad dream which you knew to be a nightmare but for some reason, you could not recall the details of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy....I wanna go home now.\", you said, sounding every bit the five year old you are, and nothing of the teen you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom was startled,  \"Jazz?!....Jasper?!....Are you sure you are alright? I could take you to the doctor right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a boy mommy, .....Why do keep calling me Jazz?\", you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh My God! .... Jazz, what did you just say?!\", mom asked, turning to you, the engine still idling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the anguish on your mom's face and wondered why she was so troubled, after all, apart from your crying fit, which you were still not able to properly explain, you did not see what all the fuss was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep calling me Jazz...Why would you do that mommy? You know I'm Jasmine.\", you said emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was silent for a few minutes as she was stunned by your statements.  It was as though you were never a boy. You were getting agitated, all you wanted to do now was to leave the school and go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,...I wanna go home!\", you demanded, your little fists tightened, \"I wanna go home NOW!\", you kicked your little feet furiously at the seat in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom said nothing as she pulled out of the school's parking lot and headed...</span></div></div>",

But after a while you realise this is taking too long. You peer out the window and aren't sure of where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy? Where are we going?\" you ask, leaning sideways in your seat to look at her. She doesn't reply, but you can see her pained expression in the mirror, which worries you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom soon parks the car and gets out. You recognise the nearby building as the doctor's office. \"Why are we at the doctor?\" you ask as Mom lifts you out of your seat, hoping she'll answer you this time. She hesitates for a moment before doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... just for a checkup, dear,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's something weird about that, but you can't put your finger on it. Well, at least you'll to see Doctor Taylor again. She's a nice lady, and you haven't gone to her since you... since when? You can't remember for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leads you by the hand into the waiting room, and you look over the various people sitting in chairs. Most of them are boring, but a few look sort of familiar to you. You can't remember where you've seen any of them, though, and they're not saying hello or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see Dr. Taylor right away,\" Mom tells the receptionist in an urgent manner. Again, something's not right here, but you don't know what. Mom and the receptionist say some more things, but they talk quieter and you can't hear them. You wander over to the little play house in the corner and start arranging the dolls in the order you think they'd like best, but you keep having to glance back at Mom and wonder why she looks so upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Mom walks over to you and takes your hand. \"Jasmine, it's time to see the doctor now,\" she says. You wave goodbye to the dolls as she leads you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Dr. Taylor!\" you say when the doctor turns to see you walking through the door into her office. She looks somehow confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi,\" she halfheartedly waves. \"Becca, who is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leans in close to the doctor and says something quietly, eliciting a very strange look. then she opens another door. \"Jasmine, honey, you wait here, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pout, but Dr. Taylor cheers you up by reaching for a lollipop and handing it to you. \"Here, you have a lollipop while you wait, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" you beam, sticking the lollipop in your mouth. Instead of saying \"you're welcome,\" the doctor just stares at you for a moment before following Mom through the door and closing it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can just barely hear Mom and Dr. Taylor's voices on the other side of the door. You want to peek out and see what they're saying, but you're a good girl and Mom told you to wait. You pace around sucking on your lollipop until you get bored, then climb up on the doctor's chair and amuse yourself by making it spin. You also try reading the stuff on the computer screen, but there are a lot of really big words that you can't even imagine how to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mom and the doctor come back into the room. You grab the table to stop spinning and face them. They gaze down at you without a word until you start to fidget nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" the doctor says softly, \"I'd heard they were getting close to this, but I can still scarcely believe...\" she trails off seeing Mom's forlorn expression. \"Becca...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom covers her face with her palm. \"This is my fault,\" she groans. \"I pushed him too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up.\" Dr. Taylor puts a hand on Mom's shoulder. \"I know you were only trying to do the right thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what <i>was</i> the right thing?\" Mom sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the doctor says sadly. \"But I don't think it's too late to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really confused now. You have no idea what the two of them are talking about. They stand in silence for a minute while you sit there awkwardly looking back and forth between them, swinging your legs in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll contact the lab and see if I can learn anything else,\" Dr. Taylor says, \"But from what you've told me, I believe this is mostly psychological. A coping mechanism. I'll get back to you, but in the meantime you should try and find a way to snap him out of it. Something that will remind him of who he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom just nods and opens the door to leave. \"Come on, Jasmine,\" she says, prompting you to hop off the chair and follow her out. Only when you're nearly out of the building does she add, \"I want you to meet someone.\"</span></div></div>",

Mom knew that Chelsea hadn't been told about what happened to you, and the fact she was left waiting, and thinking that you had just left without even contacting her left her leaving you a tearful and anger-filled message on your phone. That was a mistake, mom thought, knowing that you needed a big jolt to snap you out of your psychologically-induced Jasmine persona. Quickly, she dialled the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Storms? What? Why are you calling me again? Your jerk of a son....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't hang up\" mom pleaded. \"Jazz wanted to call you, but I forbade it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!

You're being too cautious in talking to me\" Chelsea demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeast she is listening, mom thought. She gulped. \"The reason why Jazz was forbidden to contact anyone is because the accident turned him into a little girl\" mom said. After a few seconds, she asked, \"Chelsea?\". but she got no response. After a minute, she hung up. After staring at you, she wondered what to do. Most of all, she didn't want to have you doing anything too little girlish, mostly out of fear it would reinforce your coping induced mechanism. Once her Jasmine personality had taken root..., mom thought shaking her head.</span></div></div>",

Of course, you did not know what it was since you were not in the room the whole time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued looking out the window but you were not really connecting with anything you saw outside.

You could tell that the conversation was intense and it was a few minutes before you realized that the conversation was about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that this is hard for you Mrs. Storms but by what you described, I can most certainly say that he has regressed further...\" the first stranger, a white haired man, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to believe that Dr. Hanson\", mom said, \"I really agree with Dr. Taylor that this is purely psychological and he would soon snap out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,... Rebecca, I'm not so sure now...\", Dr. Taylor interjected, sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the youth serum must have been activated again by something that could have triggered him\", the other stranger, a balding man, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what could that be Dr. Blake?\", mom asked plaintively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the kids visited the lab on their own the other day, they were desperate for me to tell them of a cure for his condition.  I did not have anything to offer at first but then I remembered another drug we are currently working on that could offer some hope...\", Dr. Blake continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were the one who told my kids about that....that growth drug?!\", mom blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did.\", Dr. Blake admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do that Vernon?\", Dr. Hanson interjected, \" you know that it is still experimental and hardly ready for full application yet..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,... but as you can see from what Mrs. Storms just said, we were working against time here.  I really wanted her permission to do a blood test to see how far the serum had gone then we could do something about the child's condition.\", Dr. Blake went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson nodded, and said nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must ask, did anything happen that could have triggered this drastic change in your son, Mrs. Storms?\", Dr. Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought for a moment before answering, \"Y-yes, I think it all started when I refused to allow that blood test.  At the time I was concerned about the possible side effects of the drug Jazz said you were proposing and I was afraid to risk that on him.  How was I to know he would have taken it so hard?  The last week was traumatic as I had to tell all his friends and associates that...Oh God, What have I done??...\", mom wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was amazed at what I saw today doctors, and if Rebecca here had not told me who it was, I would have sworn that she had gone out and had another kid I did not know about.\", Dr. Taylor interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain hidden by the stairwell, growing increasingly fearful about what is being said about you.  Admittedly, you had no idea what most of this meant, but words like \"experimental\" and \"serum\" sounded strangely frightening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might  be too late now to do a blood test just for exploration.\", Dr. Blake signed.  \"Now we must urgently find a way to stop this serum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean Doctor.?\", mom asked, panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that we must ensure that the serum does not go any further to affect you son's brain beyond repair.\", Dr. Hanson said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you propose to do that Doctor?\", Dr. Taylor asked.  \"It seems to me that if this is not psychological but physical, as you are suggesting, then normal psycho-therapy is out of the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked first at one doctor then the other, \"Do you mean that if we do not do anything about the serum, things will only get worse?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered immediately and there was an awkward silence in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt fearful and desperately needed your mommy.  You ran into the room straight to mom and snuggled beside her.  She absently stroked your hair as you curled up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two doctors from the Genetics Facility exchanged glances, their faces pale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we better start that Youth Serum Reversal Protocol right away.\", Dr. Hanson said in an awed whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A few minutes later she returned with three photo albums and excitedly placed them on the couch and opened one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"look at this picture of you when you are around five Jazz\", she said as she showed you a picture of a boy on his tricycle with a big grin on his face.  You looked at the picture but did not recognize it, although you had in fact seen it many times before.  You had even commented on one occasion how silly you looked in that Sesame Street Tee-shirt and blue shorts you were wearing.  Now you stared at it with no idea why mom was showing you this photo of a five year old that was obviously not taken recently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno who this is mommy.  Was this James?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was disappointed that you had not recognized yourself but she tried not to betray it.  Instead she turned to another picture of you, at around ten years old.  \"How about this one Jazz?  You know who this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely glanced at the tall ten year old standing beside his eight year old twins Zoe and Ella.  You giggled at the sight of the twins, \"Ohh look at Ella and Zoe.  So silly in matching outfits.  But this can't be James, is it?\", you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is not working!\", Zoe protested as you flipped other pages and did not recognize yourself in any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, \"You're right.  We got to get to the lab after all and do what they had recommended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the photo albums back to where they were kept while your siblings tried to jog your memory in other ways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz, remember when we played basket ball together how you usually ran rings around us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, remember how protective you were of us?  You wouldn't allow anyone to tease us at the playground...Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that time in the Mall, when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. That's enough.  Jazz, lets get you dressed for the Lab.  We will leave in a few minutes\", mom said as she entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you decided to try this procedure out\", Doctor Hanson said as he finished his examination of you.  You mom simply replied, \"Yes.  I guess it has to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we will be doing is to administer a serum inhibitor which will stop the effect of the serum and begin to reverse what has been happening to your son.\", Doctor Hanson continued.  Mom nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we start this treatment, we will have to monitor how it is doing so you will need to bring him back for follow-up assessments.\", Doctor Hanson said as he put his notes on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many treatments will this take, Doctor?\", mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Storms, from our examination just now, we think the serum has done some damage to your son's brain, that is the portions that control emotion and memory.\", the Senior Geneticist replied.  \"It will take about five treatments to get him back to normal.  The first few hours are however crucial.  During this time we will know whether the Inhibitor will work\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", your mom replied, \"Let's get started then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Blake entered the room with some documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Storms, Normally we would have asked you to go to our Administrative Section to sign some paperwork as soon as the procedure is explained.  You, know, \"Informed Consent\".  We have however taken the liberty of bringing the paperwork to you, given the urgency of what we need to do.\"  Doctor Hanson said as Doctor Blake handed him the documents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took the documents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take a look at this as well as this section that explain our legal obligations, and the indemnities.\", Doctor Blake instructed as he pointed to sections on the documents your mom was about to sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure for you was surprisingly simple, just an injection followed by ingesting of a sweet tasting medicine.  You expected that you would be heading home right after, but you were actually placed in a room with a hospital bed and other apparatus. A soon as you were put to bed, you fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not know how long you were out for, but when you woke up it was night, at least you thought so by the number of lights that were on in the building.  Your eyes took a while to focus until you saw mom, and your brother and sisters looking anxiously at you.  No one else was in the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you did not know why you were in this strange room, until you remembered that you and your mom had come to the lab earlier.  You could still feel the spot where you were injected, although the sensation was a little duller now than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the two doctors that you had seen earlier, Doctors Hanson and Blake entered the room with a nurse you had not seen before.  Doctor Hanson smiled at you and said, \"How's the little fellow now?  Mind if I check your chest and arm?\", he asked.  You shook your head and looked at your mom for confirmation.  She smiled reassuringly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Doctor was through with your examination, he frowned and beckoned his colleague for a quick consultation.  You did not really pay attention to what they were doing but you saw that your mom was becoming concerned. \"What's the matter?\", she asked but the doctors were still whispering urgently with each other while the nurse was trying to make you comfortable by adjusting the bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctors!  What's the matter with my son?\", mom asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Hanson cleared his throat while Doctor Blake adjusted his tie nervously.  The nurse left the room.  Your siblings looked at the doctors eagerly while you were trying to fight the sleep that was coming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Hanson finally spoke....</span></div></div>",

No sign of your former self was seen.  Even when your siblings tried to stimulate your memories of when you were a male, you just could not relate.  They eventually gave up, especially since your mommy took you back to Dr. Taylor who could not find anything physically wrong with you and with the help of a Child Psychologist colleague of hers, tested you and concluded that your behavior and mannerisms were that of a normal five year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour days at kindergarten were remarkably fun-filled,  as you enjoyed playing and interacting with the other kids your age.  Your teacher, Miss Summers, was quite surprised with your change of behavior although she did not know what caused it.  It seemed to her that you were a completely different person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no connection with your old school and your former friends.  It was as though the old Jazz never existed.  How could he?, for as far as you were concerned, he was a figment of somebody's imagination.  You still could not explain why you were never in your family photo albums although there were these mysterious photos of a boy you just did not recognize, although your mom and siblings insisted it was you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genetics Lab, that had caused the problem in the first place approached your mommy about a week after your procedure and together with your mommy and her lawyers crafted an agreement which saw the Lab making a generous settlement to finance your care and education until age 21 or after you have finished your education.  Part of that fund would be put aside in Trust for you to access when you achieved the age of 18.  In exchange, your entire family were never to mention the existence of the Youth Serum.  Not that it mattered to you, as you had no recollection of the accident on the Field Trip to the Genetics Facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only former friend you had a new connection with was Nathan, who still came around.  The day you returned from the Genetics Lab, Nathan came by but for some strange reason, you did not recognize him, so your mom re-introduced him as a friend of the family.  Nathan had to adjust his relationship with you, no longer referring to you by your old nickname, but by your name  \"Jasmine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who had the hardest time with your transformation was your daddy.  Your mommy eventually called him and explained what happened to you.  He was upset that he was not told before and he could not accept that he did not have his son anymore. You, of course did not understand the extent of his anger, and you felt rejected by your father, who did not even attempt to speak to you over the phone. His infrequent visits to the family stopped altogether (although he continued to send the child support payments).  It took much effort from your mommy to get you not to harbor ill-feelings about your daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one year since that fateful Field Trip to the Genetics Facility, which of course you had no memory of, and a lot had changed.  Your mommy sold her house and closed her business and took the family away to another State. You were enrolled into an Elementary School, while your siblings were enrolled into new high schools.  Nathan of course was sad to see you go, but you had exchanged numbers and promised to keep in touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the first day in your new school, you were asked by your new teacher, Mrs. Baker, to introduce yourself to your classmates.  You stood up, and with as much confidence as you could muster in your, slightly taller, six-year-old body, announced:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"I am Jasmine Storms, but my friends call me Jazz.</i>\"</b></span></div></div>",

You was watching all this, mostly not understanding what was going on, but you was alarmed by mom's suddenly irritated stance towards the man that creeped you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though her memories should be restored, Jazz's mind could be very malleable at this point, like a child's. its is more than possible that whatever triggered her to go 'Jasmine'  could reoccur. also its possible that she could still have gaps in her memory. Basically whatever caused her 'Jasmine' self to emerge could block out her from remembering what she did during the last 24 hours. We believe its a 92% chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz remembered everything before\" mom said, focusing her mind on that rather than the idea you could simply regress back into Jasmine again. \"So you're saying she would likely just have localized amnesia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Dr Blake said. \"However, there would be no way we can restore whatever she has forgotten. I hope we don't see the worse case scenario....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse case? That's bad, isn't mommy?\" you said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth doctors turned to each other.

The past few days were weird to say the least and you still did not get why everybody around you were acting so strangely.  You noticed that your mommy appeared at times to be unsure of how to relate to you, and what with the constant insistence before, that you were a different person?  For all you knew you have always been a girl and now that you were five years old, what does everyone expect of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging on your bedroom door interrupted your thoughts.  The twins wanted James to let them in but he ignored their pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you open the door James?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, let them stay there, I don't want them in here while we talk.\", your brother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging continued, and your sisters were asking to be let in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and opened the door despite your brother's protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jasmine.  James, why didn't you open up?\", Ella asked her brother accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames got up from the bed and went to one of the chairs in your room.  \"Because I didn't want any of you to be an influence on Jas', I really don't\", he sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would never do that now, would we?\", Ella said sweetly while Zoe murmured her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are all sisters here, and you are our big brother\", Zoe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled despite his misgivings, at Zoe's reference of him as \"big brother\".  \"Yeah, that's right I am now the  big brother and I think...\", he started but Zoe interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah bro, don't let that \"big brother\" power get to your head, remember we are still older than you, and we know what's best for Jasmine.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.  Then ask her who she would rather hang out with, me or you?\", your brother retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy, she would rather hang out with us any day, ain't that right, Jasmine?\", Ella replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your sisters then at your brother and smiled at the thought that they were fighting over a chance to hang out with you.  You found it amusing that they needed to do that since as far as you could remember, you had always enjoyed playing with your twin sisters, while your brother hung out with his friends.  You did not want to hurt your brother's feelings though so you responded with what you thought was a good compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like hanging out with all of you.  James, what game shall we play today?\", you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Ha,  I win, now you guys scoot out of here so that we can play our game!\", James laughed triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. James, you win this time, but we will see Jasmine later anyway, so we better go see what Mom is doing.\", Zoe said, taking her twin by the hand and leading her, protesting of course, to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the girls left, James took out a video game, that you used to love playing and were good at, and set it up.  Although you were not familiar with that game, you allowed him to set it up and you both started.  While playing, James continued asking about what you wanted to do with yourself.  You really did not have much to say about 'dreams' as you had never thought of that, and anyway, you were making wrong moves in the game, as you actually couldn't understand how to play it, and your brother was winning.  It was only after winning for the umpteenth time did it dawn on James that you did not know how to play that game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\", he finally asked, as he turned off the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what?\", you asked, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me that you couldn't play this game at all?  That you would rather do girly things with your sisters?\", he asked hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought... I don't know...Oh alright, I didn't want to hurt your feelings.  As far as I remember, we never hang out together.  You were always with your friends.\", you blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was crestfallen.  It had not occurred to him that your total transformation meant that everything he knew about you will never be the same.  It took him a few moments for it all to sink in.  He finally sighed and gave you a hug.  \"I love you sis.\", he said.</span></div></div>",

You were extremely confused about your identity. On the inside, you were an average 16 year old boy but on the outside, everyone saw a 6 year old little girl.

You spot a few boxes in your closet you never noticed, you pull them out with a lot more effort than you would prefer. You pop the cardboard open and dig through what seems to be some of your old things. You smell the fabric of some tee shirts and detect the slight smell of cologne. You smile, it was Chelsea's favorite cologne. You peel back the shirts, revealing some old photos. You freeze, unable to pick up a photo. You know what these photos hold. The memories of your past. The top photo was of you and James posing on a bench by a basketball court. Your brown hair a sloppy and unkept.

Even James and Zoe did it this morning, though to their credit, they looked awkward a few seconds later. Of course Ella wholeheartedly is doing the whole girlie thing towards you. When you complained to Zoe, she just said its her way of dealing with everything. The other thing is that after a while of using words like 'mommy' it was starting feel right, somehow. It reminded you of your doll playing session with Lilith and how for a while, you was actually a little girl. it scared you, especially since you appeared to keep all of your knowledge. When alone in the bathroom, you recited off 16 year old maths. You stared at her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Jasmine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing' you said pouting slightly.She frowned, and quickly made a decision. you noticed immediately with her changing direction. \"Momm- mom? Where are we going?\"</span></div></div>",

You hardly paid attention as you looked outside the window to see what interesting thing was there to see.  The only thing you saw was the caretaker tending to hedging in a section of the school yard.  Your eyes focused on him as he carefully pruned the leaves from the shrubbery that have grown unkempt.  He seemed quite diligent and hardworking.  I wonder how long he has been working out there?, you thought.  What other things does he do all day besides tending to plants?, you wondered.  You continued to watch as the old caretaker ambled to another section of the hedge and with pruners in hand, started to trim the other side of the green line of shrubbery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were deep in thought that you did not notice that the room had gone quiet.  No talking from the teacher, Miss Summers, and not a sound from the class.  \"Jasmine Storms!\", Miss Summers called.  You snapped out of your distracted thoughts and looked around to see that all eyes were on you and that Miss Summers was peeved at your failure to respond to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, I expect you to pay full attention here in class!  You certainly have no time to look through windows at anything outside while I am conducting class!\", Miss Summers scolded.  You casted your eyes down in embarrassment as the teacher let you have her caustic tongue.  \"Do you consider what we are doing here a waste of your time Miss Storms?\", Miss Summers continued. Giggles from the class greeted this sarcasm. You were becoming more uncomfortable.  \"Have you got better things to do than pay attention to what is being taught here, Miss Jasmine Storms?\" Miss Summer asked, her cheeks getting red with anger.  You muttered, \"N-n-no Miss Summers.\"  More giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you obviously already know everything in this text book, you get right up here and take over the class.  Read and let these, your unenlightened classmates, have the benefit of your superior wisdom!\", the teacher said, clearly annoyed at your show of disinterest.  You tried hard to suppress the laughter rising to your throat.  If only she knew that indeed, you already knew all there is to know from that phonics text book!  It was an updated edition to the same one you used eleven years ago when you were in kindergarten.  You managed to keep a straight face as you slowly made your way to the front of the class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Summers handed you the text book and stepped aside, so now you were standing in front where the teacher would normally stand.  All the children were looking at you expectantly.  You opened the book and started to read...rapidly like a sixteen year old who was not really interested in the words but must read them anyway.  You flipped the page and continued reading at the same speed, not noticing that your teacher was wide eyed with shock and your classmates were speechless.  You were on the sixth page when you suddenly felt the book being ripped from your hands and Miss Summers stood over you, her expression dark and ominous.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"What kind of joke do you think this is Miss Storms?\", the teacher thundered.  You looked at her and in a calm voice that surprised you, replied, \"I just did what you told me to, I read to the class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn to read like That?  Oh don't bother answering that!\", the teacher said.  You stared at her, not knowing what she will say or do next.  The children were chattering in excitement, \"Jasmine can read!  ....She can read!\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK young lady get back to your seat.  I will have to give you something else to do while I attend to the others\", Miss Summers said, her voice a lot calmer than it was just seconds ago.  For the rest of the day, Miss Summers gave you other tasks to do , which were mainly puzzles and problem solving exercises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else happened during the rest of the day that got you into trouble.  At the end of school, however, you were only too happy to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Mom was however busy on her laptop downstairs so there was little conversation between you.  You were still playing the video game when you heard voices downstairs.  You put the game down and went downstairs, wondering who could be speaking to your mom.  The voice was that of a man, which sounded vaguely familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you crept closer to the family room, you realized that the voices were actually at the front door and not in the room at all.  Why wouldn't mom let the person in? you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should we believe you this time?\", mom asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, Mrs. Storms, I am telling you the absolute truth, and besides why else would we come all the way here?\", the male voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as you saw that the man at the door was Dr. Hanson from the Genetics Facility.  You also saw that there was a second man with him, someone you had not seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on mom?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz, these gentlemen were about to leave...\", mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Mrs. Storms, we are here to check up on the progress of your son, since the, uuhhmm, little accident...\", Dr. Hanson said.  The other man shifted his briefcase from one hand to the other, and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon the poor manners of Dr. Hanson, I am Donald Wainwright, from Wainwright and Partners..\", he said, extending his hand.  Mom did not shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then..\", the tall, thin man in the tan suit said as he lowered his hand.  \"What Dr. Hanson needs to tell you is that we have been retained to ensure that no harm comes to the Genetics Facility as a result of the, ....shall we say, \"little accident\" with your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at Dr. Hanson then at Mr. Wainwright, her anger growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dr. Hanson, you have retained the services of lawyers, to do what exactly?\", she asked icily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhhm, ........Mrs. Storms, you have to understand our position, we know how hurt you may be because of what had happened to your son and the fact that we are unable to reverse it...\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid I would sue your ass??!!\", mom hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wainwright interjected, \"What my client has instructed is that we do everything to prevent anything that will negatively affect the good name of the Genetics Facility, so if it means preventing a lawsuit, then that's what will happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have some nerve!\", mom shot back. \"Look at what your so called \"accident\" has done to my child !, Just look !\",  mom was livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I wanted this??!!  Do you think the Genetics Facility has enough money to pay for the damage caused by its carelessness and experimentation??\", mom's voice was getting louder with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Storms, .....Mrs. Storms,  let me assure you that...\", Mr. Wainwright started, but mom slammed into him, \"You better think carefully what you are saying to me right now!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuhhm, ......we better get going...\", Dr. Hanson said to Mr. Wainwright, \"...it's clear we won't get anywhere with Mrs. Storms right now...\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right you won't.  How dare you come here with your lawyer, trying to get me to shut up about what happened to my child!  You better be damn well advised that I intend to take action against you for this negligence!\", she raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may certainly go ahead and take any action you choose Mrs. Storms, but be prepared for a mighty long fight.  We won't roll over and quit, not by a long shot.\", Mr. Wainwright said, as he turned on his heals and strode away.  Dr.  Hanson followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what are you going to do now?\", you asked anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom tightened her fists to stop her hands from trembling, and through gritted teeth replied.... </span></div></div>",

Not only have you found yourself on the wrong side of the school's rules on your first day, you also realized that you really have not made many friends.  The boy who had tried to bully you was sniffing softly and wiping away tears.  Miss Summers knelt down to his eye level and said soothingly, \"Jason, did Jasmine hurt you badly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, Jason, sniffed a little louder and in almost a wail sobbed, \"she hit me hard and I think my nose is broken...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\", you shouted defiantly, \"I never touched your nose you little prick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Summers looked at you in shock, and you heard some of the children gasp, and a few nervous giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine Storms!

Jason was sobbing softly, still putting on a show of being badly hurt.  So you thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really did not care anymore what happened here at kindergarten.  As far as you were concerned today might as well be the last day you go to school here.  You couldn't help but reflect that just a few days ago, you were Jasper \"Jazz\" Storms, sixteen years old high school student, already six foot one, and captain of your school's basket ball team.  Now, on account of that stupid field trip, you have been reduced to a tiny little girl who is forced to relive kindergarten.  This was not what you wanted.  Hell, you missed your real friends, your popularity, and relative freedoms.  You ruefully thought that if you were not returned to normal very soon, you will be forced to relive eleven years of your life while your friends grow into adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered under your breath, \"life sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that young lady?\", Miss Summers demanded, her tone impatient. \"You are really working yourself into a visit to the Principal's Office.  Now let me hear that apology\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked defiantly at Miss Summers, and all the children around you.  I rather be expelled than to apologize to that louse, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and looking straight at Miss Summers shouted, \"I am not sorry for what I did. I wish I never come back to this school again.  I hate it!\"  Without thinking, you delivered a swift kick at Miss Summer's shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Summers grimaced in pain but managed to grab you before you could make any further move and marched you to the Principal's Office.  \"Your mother will definitely hear about your obnoxious behavior Jasmine Storms!\", she declared.</span></div></div>",

For the last time, what is causing your behavior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna let anyone bully me\" you said definately in a tone that shocked Miss Summers. it was far older in tone than she was used to. She stared at you as you waited and soon enough, you was let in. the Principal was a woman about 40 years old by the name of Jackson, and to your surprise, held a file on her desk clearly marked 'Jasmine Storms'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping not to see you so soon, young lady\" Ms Jackson said staring at you. You gulped, realizing that she must had known all about you. Miss Summers though looked surprised. \"What is going on? Why where you expecting her, Terri? Had she been expelled from other schools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite\" Ms Jackson said. \"This file should explain exerything. I thought it was complete nonsense when I first read it, but I am now convinced...\" You stared in horror. While you hated the thought of being treated like a little girl, you hated the idea of everyone knowing that a youth serum turned you into a girl even more. \"Pwease don't read that file. i'm sorry i hit you! It was an accident! I wasn't thinking...\" you gulped, as you tried to reach the file first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she hiding?\" Miss Summers wondered as she gave Ms Jackson a curious glance. Ms Jackson glanced at you grimly. \"Miss Storms was the victim of an accident at a science lab and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwease don't tell. I'll apologize to that lying prick that yanked my hair and tried to steal my ball\" you said. \"The girls saw it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you leave us alone for a while?\" Ms Jackson asked. Miss Summers nodded and walked out of the office puzzled. once alone, Ms Jackson turned to you. \"I know things must be hard for you, Jazz. Bet you're wondering where I got this file telling me about what happened in the genetics lab? Anyway, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I can't have my students hitting each other or their teachers. Whether its from the persective of a 16 year old boy, or a 5 year old girl, it is unexceptable. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I could have you expelled, but I suspect you secretly want that to happen, so I won't. Instead, I think I can find a more creative punishment that would burn off some of that excess energy you're got. Now get back to class, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back where the kids looked at you warily, both some of the girls, including Lilith came up to you. \"Stupid boy\" she said. Another girl nodded in agreement. \"They're dumb. You have an older sister? I have one. I gotta into big trouble when I repeated what she said.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later at home you were the center of attention.  \"How was your day?\", asked Ella and Zoe.  \"Yeah, how was it?\". James echoed.  You gave a nonchalant response, not wishing to recount the full story of your terrible first day.  The principal, Ms Jackson, had told Mom all about what had happened at recess and how you behaved afterwards.  Needless to say,  Mom was not pleased and it was all she could do not to let you have it there and then in the Principal's office.  In the end, Mom agreed with the Principal not to have you expelled but to give you another chance to redeem yourself at the school.  Your first \"punishment\" was to be a public apology in front of the entire class the next day.  You were not looking forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you settled in your room, with James doing  homework at his desk and the girls in their room also doing homework, your phone rang.  \"H-Hello...?\", you answered tentatively wondering who it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, may I speak to Jasper?\", asked the female voice on the other end, which you recognized as that of your girlfriend Chelsea's.  \"Hold on, I'll get him...\", you replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind raced.  How can I talk to Chelsea without sounding every bit like a five year old?, you thought. You waited for what you thought was long enough for you to \"get\" yourself before continuing, \"Hi Chelsea.\"  You hoped that the voice you had adopted was deep enough to convince Chelsea that she was not talking to a five year old.  You sounded more like someone with a bad case of the flu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi yourself, Jazz\", she said.  \"You sound terrible, like you're down with the virus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\", you replied, relieved that she thought you had the flu. You coughed for emphasis before continuing, \"...I'm so sick, hardly could get out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, poor baby\", she sympathized, \"...I'll just come over to keep you company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No!...\", you cried, a little too quickly.   You hoped Chelsea did not pick up on this, but she did.  \"Oh!, ...you rather have that bitch Dianne come over instead of me, huh?\"<br>\r\nDianne was another girl in your school who was Chelsea's rival in everything including getting your attention.  While admittedly you had done nothing to discourage Dianne's attentions, you had made it clear that Chelsea was your girl.  Now, you did not like her accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No!...\", you said lamely, trying hard to keep your voice from sounding like a five year old, \"...it's just that the doctor has me under quarantine and I don't want to infect anyone else\", you replied, mentally congratulating yourself for that quick save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, OK\", Chelsea said, a little placated.  \"Want me to email you what we got for homework today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, send it..\", you responded.  Just then you heard a beep on the line signaling an incoming call.  You quickly ended the call with Chelsea and picked up the other call.  It was Nathan.  After exchanging preliminaries including about your bout with the flu, you and your best friend had a long conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening before dinner was spent on the phone.  It seems that everyone missed you at school today and were calling to check up on you.  Your friends were calling to to see how you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time the phone rang, you were a little cranky.  You were exhausted  after spending more than two hours holding conversation in a fake voice.  You answered  exasperated, \"...Hello!...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya kid, how're you holding up...?\", it was Harry, the detective.  \"I have some news for you so listen up...\", he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You shuddered. He doesn't know abot your reaction after being hit in the head by a basketball, or how girlishly you acted when playing with Lily. Nor he knows how scared you are of displaying any of those behaviors again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz....\"</span></div></div>",

Your life has been turned upside down by Harry's news and you had not yet digested the full implications of this turn of events.  You were just a little hopeful that Harry was wrong and that he must have missed a vital clue.  As it is, Harry had indeed met a dead end in his investigations and had apparently given up any hope of finding an antidote to return you to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want to play?\", James asked.  He looked at you and finally realized how troubled you really were.  \"...uh, sorry Jazz, ....I just thought you could use a little distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not in the mood to play right now\", you replied despondently, \"I just need to speak to mom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll call her...\", James volunteered, but you were already heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely out the door when you bumped into Ella and Zoe.  They were in the middle of an argument about Ella's threat earlier this morning to \"deal\" with you both after school for the doll prank you pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're going twerp!\", Ella said.  Zoe grabbed you by the shoulders, \"where are you running off to?,  ....Hey,  what's the matter?\", she asked after seeing your troubled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I  really need to speak to mom\", you said in a trembling voice, and before you could stop yourself, you began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla and Zoe exchanged glances, not knowing what to do now with you crying.

Ella forgot her anger for a moment and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smile for Ella\", James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just that I really don't see the big deal.  So what if Jazz is a girl now, she'll just have to get used to this and just go with it...\", Ella said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wailed even louder as you heard Ella's cold assessment of the situation you were in.  Both James and Zoe turned on their sibling in reproach.  \"Ella, take that back now!, Don't you see how upset Jazz is?\", Zoe demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I still don't see why I should.  Jazz will later see that being a girl is not as bad as she thinks.  She might just enjoy it...\", Ella replied, much to your dismay and to the consternation of both James and Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you heard Mom's call, \"Dinner's ready!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Jazz, lets go to dinner and ignore Ella..\", Zoe comforted, with her arm around you.  You dried your tears and allowed her to lead you downstairs.  James and Ella were bickering behind you about Ella's insensitivity to your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom glanced at you, wondering what to say. Finally she said, \"When you want to, come and see me. Its not healthy for you to keep all this to yourself, Jasmine.\" You felt like screaming. She knew what was wrong, and you hated the fact that she seemed to be toying with you. However you said, \"Okay mom.\" Mom shook her head as she left you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, you lifted your head from your tear-stained pillow.

Your terror mounted when you saw Ella, Zoe and James among the jeering faces.   \"Jasmine!, Jasmine!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jasmine!, wake up!\", your Mom said, shaking you gently out of your sleep.

I want you all to give her a chance to say it by paying full attention.  You all know what to do when someone gives an apology, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Summers\", the children all responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Jasmine, come right up front here and say your apology.\", Miss Summers invited, indicating with her hands where you should stand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach felt like lead and you felt queasy as though at any moment you would lose your breakfast.  \"I really need my mom right now\", you thought desperately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're waiting...\", Miss Summers said, with more than a hint of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding shakily, your knees buckling, you slowly made your way toward the front of the room.  With every step, you wished that Miss Summers would tell you to return to your seat and spare you the agony of this apology.  You felt all twenty-eight pairs of eyes on you and heard the excited whispers of the children behind you.  \"Be quiet children!, Let us hear Jasmine...\", Miss Summers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to face the class and felt even more scared as all the children were leaning forward in their seats in anticipation of what you were about to say.  The expression on Jason's face was one of smug triumph. You looked over to Lilith and saw that her face was etched with concern for you.  You smiled despite your fear, but only briefly, as you tried to form the dreaded words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm s-s-sorry...\", you stuttered, weakly, your voice barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you all hear her class?\", asked Miss Summers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Miss Summers!\", the children chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now Jasmine, ....speak up.\", Miss Summers demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped nervously and taking a deep breath, you began \"I am sorry for what I did yesterday during break....\", you paused, tears welling in your eyes, wishing that you did not have to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know that I was wrong...\", your voice trembling, \"I'm also sorry for hurting Jason...\", you twisted your feet uncomfortably and wrung your hands in your dress...\"I'm sorry for kicking Miss Summers and for the hurtful things I said...\", tears streaming down your face, you really hated to do this, why did you have to apologize like this, in front of everyone??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I promise not to do anything like these again...\", you ended, a little rushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to return to your seat, when Miss Summers held you and to your utter surprise, gave you a big hug.  The children broke into spontaneous chatter, while Jason came up to where you were standing and also gave you a quick hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Jasmine, we must always take care how we relate to each other at school.  We hope we can get along from now on and not have a repeat of your bad behavior.\", Miss Summers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to your seat, glad that this ordeal was over, but wondering how come Jason was not asked to apologize to you for his bullying attempt on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at break, Lilith and two of her friends joined you by the toy box and chatted as though your ordeal earlier this morning did not happen.  You were happy for once to be in the company of friends.</span></div></div>",

You're still uneasy seeing your body, let alone allowing anyone else see. Ella smiled slightly as she picked up a pair of pink tights and starts pulling them up your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! i'm not your girliy doll!\" you protested as you tried to stop her. Unfortunately she was too big for you to give any effective resistance. Next  she picked up a pink leotard, something that made your heart sink. \"no! I'm not a ballerina!' you yelled as you began to tear up again, knowing she would dress you in it as easily as she did the tights. As she pulled the leotard up your body, you had a thought. 'this leotard isn't new.... its hers! Why is Ella dressing me in one of her prized possessions?\" once Ella pulled the leotard up, she released you and pulled out a camera of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay young lady. You tried to blackmail me by saying I sleep with dolls...\" Ella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do sleep with dolls\" you protested. ella ignored that, and grinned. \"Now i want some pictures of you. you can lace up your own shoes' you watched as she passed to you another of her prized posessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i don't wanna. I'm not a girl. I don't wanna do these girly things\" you pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think would had happen if i was exposed to that youth chem instead of you, Jasmine?\" Ella said, surprising you. You stared at her open mouthed. \"Is that what this is about. Insurance against me posting those photos, and a misguided belief in trying to 'help' you\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only is she already a girl, her interests have hardly changed since she was little. She'd have no problem dealing with this. In fact, you almost get the impression that she's jealous of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put the shoes on already,\" she says. You look at the little pink ballet shoes and sigh in defeat. It doesn't seem like there's any way out of this; Ella won't let you go anywhere, and no-one else is here to rid you of her. You hate this feeling of having no control over your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, where is everyone?\" you mutter as you slip your foot into one of the shoes and start to tie it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you wanna know so bad?\" Ella asks mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can kill them for leaving me alone with you,\" you grumble, putting on the other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla glares at you for a second, but quickly calms herself. \"And I suppose you'd wander off by yourself to do that? You're a kid. You don't get to decide where you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I hate you!\" you shout, throwing down your arms in a fit of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not the face we want to see,\" Ella says. She kneels down in front of you and readies her camera. \"Come on! Smile for the camera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your arms and grunt, making extra effort to look as disgruntled as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You know what, that's cute too!\" Ella declares, and snaps a few photos of you before standing back up. You sigh and start walking towards the clothes you had on before. You're far from proud of them, but they sure beat what you're wearing now. Before you can reach them, however, Ella suddenly swoops in front of you and takes one more picture. \"Ack!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! That's a good one!\" Ella says, looking appreciatively at the camera's screen. Then she holds it in front of your face. \"See that, Jazz? That's you. Aren't you adorable?\" You groan loudly at the image of the surprised-looking little girl dressed as a ballerina. You can hardly believe it's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla shrugs dismissively and puts the camera down beside her bed. \"Oh, I don't see what you're worried about. Why would a cute little thing like you be so upset to be seen all dressed up? Nobody'll think there's anything wrong with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you weakly object, not knowing what to say beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla suddenly gives you a serious look. \"But what? You're worried what your friends will think? Well, what they think is that you're in bed with the flu right now. But that can't last much longer, can it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has you there. You need to do something about your friends soon, and as much as you dread them finding out about this, you don't want to make them think you've just disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? You want me to tell them so you can show them that picture?\" you ask bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ella tilts her head and looks thoughtful. Crap, you've given her an idea. \"How about if you fess up to them <i>now</i>, I <i>won't</i> show them the picture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoil so hard you almost fall over backwards. \"B-but...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! They have a right to know. If you won't tell them, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I... you...\" You frantically search for a retort, but you don't have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla walks to the door and opens it. \"This is for your own good. Now get your clothes back on while I go grab your phone.\"</span></div></div>",

Now that you were a five year old, things you would have taken for granted, or could have done on your own, were no longer so clear cut. Just look how easily your younger sister, Ella, was able to strip you out of your clothes and force you into that silly ballerina outfit.  Nothing you could do to prevent that, you thought wryly. Back when you were the sixteen year old bigger brother, Ella would not have dared to treat you like this, in fact she looked up to you.  How quickly things have changed now that you were this vulnerable little girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then hit with a new realization about your current situation.  It hit so hard, you gasped.   When faced with a terrible or unfamiliar situation, such as the dreaded apology, you were literally a five year old!  Nothing of your sixteen year old self was at the surface to take control.  No wonder you behaved the way you did at school, you realized.  Your mind reached back to when you practically behaved like a five year old, and concluded that the other occasions were at the play date with Lilith, your first day at kindergarten, and when Harry told you of his investigation's dead end.  You realized that your behavior then was not like a rational teen and you wondered when will be the next time you will lose control again and how that will affect your behavior.  \"I'll need another dose of whatever treatment I got at that lab to control this\", you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla returned, saying \"Hey Jasmine, I have your girl friend Chelsea on the phone...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no!, you thought in dismay, Ella was serious when she went for the phone to call your friend.  The last person you really wanted to speak to in this condition was your girlfriend.  \"Please tell her I'm not up, .... still sick with the flu...\", you begged desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you won't get off that easily:\", Ella said, handing you the phone.  \"...take it, or I'll press send, and your picture will go to all your friends on Facebook...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Ella with the phone in her hand, her expression resolute to complete this humiliation and put you in your place.  You could feel the now familiar panic rising and the beads of cold sweat on your forehead.  Your breathing became rapid, as though you had ran flights of stairs, and you tried to speak, to tell Ella that now was not a good time to speak to anyone, but you only managed a squeak.  Ella had not noticed your discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Jazz, take the phone now!, Chelsea is still on the line!\", Ella hissed urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, and your hands shook as you took the phone and tentatively answered....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You figured that since you was able to successfully do it once, you could do it again. \"Hi Chelsea\" you said in as deep a voice as you could. Unfortuanately it didn't come out as deep as it did. You could sense that Chelsea was beginning to doubt it was you she was talking to. Definately not a good time to explain a story that would sound crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz? is that you?' Chelsea demanded. You winced, knowing for some reason you can't mimic your voice like you did last time.  Probably because Ella was hovering over a mouse, ready to show to the world what happened to you. 'Yeah, its me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your voice sounds high. if this is one of you twins...\" Chelsea said, suddenly showing a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not. Something happened... During that field trip that I went on\" you said, still trying to use a fake voice.\"Ask Nathan. He was on that trip.... Actually,  go get him and both of you can come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards Ella, since you knew she was inching closer to posting those pictures, but the fact you asked Chelsea to come over seemed to pacify her. She closed down the webpage without hitting the send page. Chelsea too seemed pacified. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't believe me if I told you\" you said. \"Just grab Nathan and come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you ended the call, Ella walked up to you and gently roughed up your hair. \"Trust me Jasmine. Its better they know. Want help getting ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from me\" you yelled. \"I don't need your help.\" Furiously, you stormed out of Ella's room, and headed downstairs. For a few seconds, you felt like hiding. but Ella would just torment you in a different way. Dejected, you waited outside the front door, looking out for them. It didn't take long. Twenty minutes later, Chelsea was walking towards you, clearly asking Nathan something, which you assumed was what happened during the field trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No way I going to let them see me dressed like that!\" you answered back. Nathan and Chelsea watched on. Both of them had seen arguements between Ella nad Zoe and it reminded them of one of those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Ella. Where is Jazz? i know that lab was messing with some high-tech stuff, but am I really going to expect she is Jazz?

A part of you wanted to say that it is a prank, and that you're a cousin, but with Ella around, it would be pointless. There is enough evidence to prove your story, thanks to Harry, plus it would mean Ella would rush back to her room and post those ballet pictures. \"She is telling the truth.

He nodded, his eyes going wide. \"And remember that biology class? the one that had the girls laughing at us guys? The one telling us that all vertebrates are inherantly female? You figure it out, and work out what happened to me\" you said, frowning slightly. \"It reduced me to a little girl, who has been dressed up, sent to play with little girls, and then sent back to kindergarten!</span></div></div>",

It's the truth!\" Ella protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you so damn smiley, huh?\" Chelsea counters. Good question, you think. Even Ella seems to fumble for an answer. Rather than wait for whatever crap she comes up with, you decide to speak up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really me, guys,\" you say. You lift your head and lock eyes with Chelsea, who studies you carefully. Ella taps her foot, wordlessly urging you to say something else, but you don't have to; Chelsea eventually melts under the puppy dog eyes you only faintly realise you're giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing,\" she says, kneeling down and putting a hand on your shoulder. \"I don't know about this story, but I know sadness when I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea...\" You gently throw yourself into her, turning her hold on you into a hug. It's an odd, conflicting experience. Last week you would have killed for an excuse to bury yourself in her cleavage like this, but now there's no attraction involved at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, isn't that sweet?\" Ella coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you murmur into Chelsea's chest. Ella probably didn't hear the words, but you're sure she got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shuffles his feet awkwardly before breaking back into the conversation. \"So what's gonna happen? Are you trying to get some sort of treatment for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no antidote,\" Ella is eager to inform him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, that's it?\" Nathan says. \"You're a kid now? You have to start your life over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you wearily breathe before pushing yourself off of Chelsea. \"Not everyone's as bad as her about it,\" you shoot a quick glare at Ella, \"But yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan mutters something to himself while Chelsea stares at the floor, deep in thought. \"What are we gonna do?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you say, not really knowing what the question means. \"You guys... you're still my friends, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea seems to hesitate for a moment, but then, to your relief, she smiles warmly. \"Of course, Jazz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can still hang out,\" Nathan says. \"Well, kind of. I guess. I mean, yeah, I can come over and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. While Nathan's fumbling sentiment reminds you that things will never be the same, a huge weight has been lifted from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Ella, who you had briefly forgotten was standing behind you, has to go and ruin the moment. \"Well then! Everything's fine!\" she beams. \"So, Jasmine, I know a few games you could play...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go away!\" you snap. Admittedly, you sort of owe her for pushing you to get this over with, but you really don't want to encourage her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla frowns at you, and looks back and forth between you and your friends. \"Oh, alright then,\" she sighs. She walks off to her room, grumbling to herself, \"I guess I'll just leave my kid sister with the pair of teenagers I hardly know...\"</span></div></div>",

That's why mom had sent me back to kinder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla frowned and after a few moments during which you could see that she was thinking about what you had said, replied, \"I guess you're right, mom would not forgive me if this were to go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Ella, if this goes out, no one will believe it.  And besides, we don't want the media to get all over this and mess up our family.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla walked over and sat on the bed and buried her head in her hands, \"Uuuuuuggggh!, I hate it when you're right!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to Ella and took her hand, \"Sis, listen....when I am ready, if the effect of this youth serum is still like this, I will tell my friends and anyone you like me to tell, but right now is not the best time.  Just supposed the serum wears off tomorrow, imagine the embarrassment if the story is already out there that I'm a little girl...\"  You smiled reassuringly at your sister and in a familiar tone you had always used as a sixteen year old bigger brother, said, \"You shouldn't act hastily and do anything you will regret.  Lets wait on mom to come home.  she'll know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK....\", Ella replied, her tone subdued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quiet for a few minutes as you both were thinking of the situation and what was said.  Suddenly Ella said, \"But I need my doll.  Please tell me where it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"I can do you one better.  I'll get it for you.\"  You skipped over to the closet and after rummaging among the clothes piled at the bottom, you pulled out Ella's doll  from where you had hidden it, and handed it back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla grabbed the doll and gave it a hug, \"oohhh, thanks Jazz!\", she squealed.  To your surprise, Ella reached over and gave you a big hug.  \"Thank you!\"  You felt a little awkward but did not attempt to wriggle from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard voices downstairs.  \"Who could that be?\", asked Ella, releasing you from the hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check and see...\", you said, hoping it was mom and the others returning home.  You both went downstairs and you were able to hear the voices from behind the closed front door.  You ran to the door and threw it open and saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But the three of them, especially James, seem taken aback at the sight of you, which confuses you until you realise... you're still wearing Ella's ballet outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" you cry with a jump, looking down at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe shakes her head in exasperation as she walks into the house, lifting her bags over your head to get past you. \"I'm not even gonna say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walks straight by you, biting her lip. Ella follows her, taking an interest in whatever the shopping bags contain, which worries you a little. As James closes the door, looking at you strangely, you briefly try to think of something to say, only for your embarrassment to overwhelm you and send you shooting back upstairs to the twins' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander over to Zoe's side of the room and stand holding all your muscles tense until you calm yourself down by returning your thoughts to the way you talked down Ella. It's comforting to think that just because you're little doesn't mean you can't still make yourself heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe hesitantly walks in and looks at you with sad eyes, fidgeting awkwardly for a few moments until she gets herself to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Jazz,\" she begins, walking closer to you. \"We couldn't convince Mom it was a bad idea to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" you interrupt as you begin to extract yourself from the leotard, \"It's okay. I think things are a little better between us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe is momentarily stunned by your words. \"What, 'cause you let her do what she wanted with you?\" she asks, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you toss the leotard into a corner and start on untying the pink shoes, \"Because I reasoned with her. I got her to back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After letting her dress you up in her old ballet stuff,\" Zoe points out, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" you say, stepping out of the shoes and approaching your clothes, \"But still. Embarrassed as I am right now, I feel a lot better knowing I can still get her to listen to me.\" You pause for a second to mull over what you just said. \"You know, I never quite realised how different I've been acting this whole time. Even aside from, you know, <i>that</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe cringes a little at the mention of \"that\" before replying, \"I guess you have been kind of a pushover lately...\" Her face shows immediate regret at her choice of words. \"I mean, uh... sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're pretty much right,\" you sigh while mentally berating yourself for how appealing the little blue dress in your hands now looks after what you just had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have the right to say it!\" Zoe says. \"I haven't been standing up to her either... I mean, she's been way more stubborn than usual, and I don't know how to deal with it...\" As you wriggle into your dress, Zoe turns away and sighs deeply. \"I feel so useless, Jazz. Your whole life is falling apart and all I can do is watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Zoe with concern. Well, at least this is another chance to work that big brother magic you thought you'd lost. \"Zoe... sis... it means a lot just to have you around. I mean, well...\" You can't believe you're about to say this, but... \"I want to be like you when I grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe spins around to face you again, revealing her thoroughly bemused smile. \"Jazz...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd rather it didn't come to that,\" you smile and shrug, \"But it made you feel better, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe chuckles quietly. \"Okay, sure. But I still want to do more for you than just exist... I'll find something for the two of us to go out and do later in the week, okay? I think you need to get away from... basically everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice,\" you say. \"So what were you guys doing, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\" Zoe glances at the door. \"We picked up some stuff for your room... yeah, there's a reason we didn't bring Ella. There's still a few girly things in there just to keep up appearances, though. God knows that Lily girl is gonna show up here someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, a little annoyed. \"Don't I get a say in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said,\" Zoe shrugs apologetically, \"But Mom said this was just to get you started. You might wanna talk to her right away if you want any input on the rest of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminds you, you need to talk to Mom about your friends as well. Ella was right about one thing: you can't claim to have the flu forever.</span></div></div>",

After seeing you pout slightly, she frowned, \"I guess you're not here  to complain about what your sister did to you. Is it about your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your room is a concern to you, it is not your most important thing on your mind. Ella was right, since you can't keep saying you're sick for too much longer. Eventually, someone will come around and discover what happened to you. You knew you had to be very careful. Your room can be changed; even if Ella got into it and filled it with all things girly and pink. your reputation can't. The last thing you want is everyone knowing what happened to you, and everyone treating you like a circus freak. \"No. Ella told me that I can't keep this from my friends forever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see\" mom said, sighing. \"I really don't know what to do. Do you have any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was surprised to hear mom ask you for ideas, especially with your lack of say in anything of late. \"No. Ella was going to just call one of them, but I convinced her it was a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can be a little too impulsive\" mom said, agreeing with you. \"As for your friends, maybe its best to try and gauge their opinion by spending time with them without them knowing its you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Having them babysit me?\" you scoffed. \"That won't work., and even if it did, what then? Hey Chelsea, remember that little girl you babysat? She is really your boyfriend..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"its only a suggestion, miss\" mom said. She paused and said mainly to herself, \"Those 'scientists' have a lot to answer for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think of something\" you said.

You rush into your room to find James and Zoe going at your walls with paintbrushes, painting over the green with a light yellow colour. \"Oh, come on!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, dude,\" James half-heartedly offers. You don't quite feel comfortable discussing this with him, so you move to get Zoe's attention instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be glad it's not pink,\" she says. \"I told you, we need to keep up appearances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and notice that your bed, which has been moved to the middle of the room, is currently home to a handful of stuffed animals and... is that a dollhouse? Blech. For some reason, you walk up to the bed and pull yourself onto your tiptoes to take a closer look. \"Can't I have the appearance of a girl who doesn't keep stuff like this around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that went out the window when you made friends with the girliest little brat since Ella,\" Zoe says, looking a little guilty. \"And I guess that wasn't really anyone's fault, in the end... but I'm sorry I couldn't keep you out of skirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull at the bottom of your dress, realising you haven't thought much of your clothes in a while, at least not while wearing them. \"You know, I'm kind of used to them already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stops painting to give a strange look that makes you regret your admission. \"Jazz... if I can ask, what do you do at kindergarten? Like, during breaks and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly decide to answer the question. \"Eh, I dunno... I just hang around, pretend to care about dolls and stuff. I don't try very hard, but they're just kids. They don't really notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Zoe glances away at nothing in particular before turning back to the wall. \"If you don't wanna be stuck with this image, you need to start changing it at some point. Just do it slowly, make it look realistic. Take an interest in playing tag or something and just go from there, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than give much thought to that now, you turn your attention back to the wall as Zoe resumes covering up its familiar colour. \"Okay, seriously, why repaint the walls? Isn't that overdoing it? What's wrong with green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looks at you hesitantly and sighs. \"Jazz, I... okay, I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but... It's because Mom wants you to move on. She wants your room to look different because she thinks it's best for you to accept you have to start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Zoe exchange a succession of sad looks. You notice James has stopped painting and seems like he's trying to think of something to say, but he stays quiet. Hanging your head, you wander over to the front of your bed and find a bunch of your possessions lying on the floor. You pick up a metallic baseball bat and discover that, even in two hands, it feels impossibly heavy. \"That better not mean you're throwing out all my stuff,\" you say less than assertively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no way,\" James finally speaks up. \"You'd hate us forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't keep it here, though,\" Zoe says. \"You can't even use your sports stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concede her point by allowing the bat to drop out of your hands and land on the floor with a thud, bringing relief to your meager arm muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll end up keeping most of it in the attic for now,\" James says. You realise there are probably a few things of yours James and Zoe would like to keep for themselves, so you appreciate their refraining from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you sigh, \"At least I'll know it's there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe walks over to the door way to look at the furniture sitting in the lobby. \"What are we going to do about the computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hey, what's that supposed to mean?\" you ask defensively, hurriedly walking out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying you can't have it, but... it's conspicuous, you know? And you can hardly reach it anymore, anyway. You should get a laptop or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess...\" you yield. \"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looks at your bookcase next. \"I guess the books can stay. We'll just say you... like to challenge yourself.\" She leans over to inspect your collection. \"And they were someone else's first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can remark on that, Ella emerges from her room and slowly weaves through your furniture to approach you. \"Hey, am I allowed here yet? How's it going?\" She grabs the door frame and leans sideways to look into your room. \"Not bad, not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't approve of it,\" you say. \"Or anything I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, c'mon, I thought you stopped hating me!\" Ella pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hate you. I just hate everything you stand for,\" you half-joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, be that way.\" Ella crosses her arms and turns her head away, closing her eyes. Then she opens one eye and asks, \"So what did Mom have to say about your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't much help,\" you say. \"The only idea she had was to spend time with them before telling them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that could be fun...\" Ella grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand now I know it's a bad idea,\" you deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we need to do something - got any better ideas?\" Ella asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't. You can only hope James or Zoe will.</span></div></div>",

You know Chelsea has served as a babysitter in the past - a couple times you were called on to keep her company while she watched some brat - so she can probably be convinced to look after \"Jasmine\" for a while. But that's the only part of this plan you feel confident about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we're doing this,\" you grumble, putting a hand to your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if this is a bad idea, what's a good one, huh?\" Ella inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there are any good ideas,\" James says. \"This is gonna suck however you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe starts talking into the phone. \"Hello, Chelsea? ... He's still sick. Actually, we were wondering if you could do us a favour. Our little cousin Jasmine is staying over, but we could use someone to watch her for a while... Yeah, see, I need to keep an eye on Jazz, he's in pretty bad shape. Don't want the kid getting in the way, and everyone else is gonna be busy... can we leave her with you for a few hours? ... Alright. Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine. Thanks.\" She hangs up. \"Okay, uh... she sounded kind of annoyed, but she'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, here's the plan,\" Zoe says. \"We're gonna ease her into the idea by letting her figure it out herself. So don't bother putting on too much of an act. Pretend you want to tell her, but you're not allowed to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, I should try to make her go 'hey, are you actually Jazz'?\" you ask disdainfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, she probably won't say anything,\" Zoe shrugs. \"Just put the idea in her head, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then! Just gimme a minute,\" Ella says, and heads up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's out of earshot you whine, \"Do I have to go with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that or she stays and helps with your room,\" James answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only walking you there,\" Zoe adds. \"There's no way she can mess things up... I think. She's surprised me before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the reassurance,\" you gripe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short wait, Ella comes back downstairs - as usual, moving in her cheerfully girly way like there's nothing wrong. \"Let's go, sis!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so happy about?\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla pats you on the head. \"Aw, you'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door and steps outside. You start to follow her, but turn back to say to James and Zoe, \"If you toss out any of my stuff, I'll strangle you both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" James chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find a stepladder!\" You barely resist the urge to punctuate your retort by sticking out your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for the door handle, but Ella grabs it first and closes the door for you. You want to complain, but you know it wouldn't make much sense. \"Thanks, I guess,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Ella beams as the two of you walk out into the street. \"Sooo... how's school been, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt, and try to think of a way to shut her up before realising you have an actual excuse not to talk: \"We shouldn't discuss that in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, alright,\" Ella pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in silence to Chelsea's house, where Ella knocks on the door and, as soon as Chelsea opens it, greets her with \"Hi there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hi...\" Chelsea unenthusiastically replies. \"Wait, are you the same one who called me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Ella falters, unsure if Zoe meant to impersonate her or not. You, however, are quite sure she didn't, and never would. Sometimes you wonder whether Zoe would be as boyish if she hadn't so hated being mistaken for Ella when the two of them were younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. So this is the kid?\" Chelsea kneels down to be at eye level with you. \"Oh, you are a cute little thing, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid eye contact, trying to hide your anguish at seeing her from this perspective and comprehending that you may never be with her the same way again. Still, the smile on her face is something. At least she still finds you cute... just a different kind of cute. \"What's the matter?\" she coos. \"I don't bite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Jasmine, say hi to Chelsea,\" Ella says, giving you a little push. But you can't quite bring yourself to speak, so you just walk inside and stand behind Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet kid, huh?\" Chelsea remarks. \"Guess I can't complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll warm up to you,\" Ella replies. \"Well, I gotta go! Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla starts to leave, but Chelsea calls after her, \"Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla turns her head back. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's just the flu Jazz has?\" Chelsea asks, concern rising in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea probably wouldn't notice, but Ella seems a bit taken aback by the question. \"Uhm, yeah, pretty sure... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard he got some concoction spilled on him during that field trip... could that be what made him sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, I'm sure that was nothing,\" Ella asserts with a nervous smile and a dismissive wave of her hand. \"I mean, those scientists wouldn't just leave anything dangerous lying around, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right...\" Chelsea says. \"Well, tell him I miss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's sweet. I will. See you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ella skips off you wonder... Chelsea knows you had something spilled on you, but does she know what it was?</span></div></div>",

This was an awkward moment in which  neither of you spoke.  As Chelsea continued her mundane and unnecessary task, you sat, a little uncomfortably, and not really thinking about it, tugged at the hem of your dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really did not know how to relate to this attractive girl whom, you realized with a little blush of embarrassment, you were still crazy for.  It was a little awkward for you to be in the same room with this girl and not actually pawing her.  As Jasper, you would have, by now,  be stealing kisses after only a brief conversation.  That was what you usually did alone together.  Now, as Jasmine, you had to fight hard to dismiss any amorous thoughts from your head.  \"This sucks\", you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea stopped fluffing cushions and sat down on the other end of the couch you were on.  \"So, Jasmine, where're you from?\" , she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idaho\", you said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idaho, ....really?  How long are you here for?\" , she asked, a little more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuummm, just for a short while.....not sure how long though\", you replied.  Actually, you had not thought of this before but you remembered that Zoe had asked you to pretend to want to tell her about what has happened but not allowed.  This question actually threw you off and having to lie like this was a little unsettling,  but you were prepared to wing it, if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did your mom say?\", Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", you sputtered, momentarily disoriented by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..About how long you will be staying by Jazz.\", Chelsea clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohh, that...well...uhmm, you know she kinda didn't say anything...\", you started but Chelsea interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I really can't believe that any mom would have left her little girl with anyone without saying for how long, especially when school is still on.  Don't you miss your school?  Is this an extended vacation?  Why would you be still there and not back home in Idaho?  You really don't strike me as someone from Idaho anyway.\", Chelsea rattled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback to her flurry of questions and remarks, to which she clearly did not give you a chance to respond.  It seemed that Chelsea was not really buying what you were telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea leaned closer and said, almost in a whisper, \"Tell me, what is really going on over there.  I can't seem to get to Jazz, and every time I called he's sick. Frankly I'm getting a little wary of that since from as long as I've known him, Jasper Storms has never been sick a day in his life, so what gives?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing for a few minutes as you reflected on the truth of her last statement, you have never been sick as far as you could remember so you couldn't really blame Chelsea now for suspecting your prolonged bout with the \"flu\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K. Chelsea, I really shouldn't tell you this, but...well....uuhhm, you see, it's a bit complicated...\", you faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just spit it out!\", Chelsea said, impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all, I'm not from Idaho...\", you said, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\", Chelsea said triumphantly, \"...So where are you really from?, and don't lie this time..\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not say quite yet.  But about Jazz....\", you started to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about Jazz?\", Chelsea asked, her curiosity properly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that field trip?\", you asked, hoping that this would be enough for Chelsea to make certain connections about what made you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...they said that something spilled on Jazz. ....Is that what's making him sick?\", Chelsea asked, realization in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes that's it....that's why I'm, ....uhm... he's sick!\", you said, a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's he sick, Jasmine?  Tell me, please...\", Chelsea pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,.. What did they say about the thing that spilled on Jazz?\", you asked, feigning interest.  You actually knew the answer but you wanted Chelsea to confirm to you what she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but according to Nathan and the other guys they were saying some nonsense about the liquid turning boys into girls...\", she said, and stopped suddenly.  She looked at you closely and you in turn looked her in the eyes with what you hoped was enough assurance for your girlfriend to finally realize who she was speaking with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh, Mmyyy God!\", Chelsea exclaimed, jumping backwards from her seat, realization finally hitting. \"Jasmine....Jasper.....Jasmine...Jazz.. not from Idaho, but here, not on vacation....,  You're Jazz????!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am Chelsea...you know how I wanted...\", you started, but Chelsea was already a little hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this can't be.  How could you be Jazz???, You 're so small!....No, it's impossible!  I can't believe this!\", she continued.  You were a little alarmed at her growing hysteria.  What if she passed out? What would you do?  What could you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea....\", you said, sliding closer and reaching for her but Chelsea was backing further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, please...hear me out...\", you tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I can't believe your mom and sisters would pull this on me!  What were they thinking, making me babysit.. Ohh God, I don't even want to say it!...\", Chelsea wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...babysit your boyfriend who is a girl!\", you finished.  You stood up as tall as you could and looked at Chelsea as she flopped down on the couch on the opposite side of where you were both sitting only moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look..., you think this is all fun and games for me??  How would you feel if you wake up the morning after that stupid field trip to find that you've changed so much?\", you said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea was quiet for a moment as she tried to come to grips with what she has just confirmed.  You sat down heavily on the couch, despondent that you may be losing the one girl you really cared about.  You wished that if a break up was to occur it would have been on account of some indiscretion on your part and not as a result of this freakish \"accident\" which was getting more and more difficult to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea sighed,  \"Jazz....I'd heard something from Nathan before but I didn't want to believe.  But now....what do we do?  What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, at least this was not a break-up, not just yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't know Chelsea, I don't know...\", you replied.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both were moving your book shelf from the room.  \"Hey guys, what are you doing to my room?\", you asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought we should go ahead and do some fixes to make it more comfortable for you, you know, you being a girl and all.\", James replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jazz, you could really use smaller furniture, since you're no longer over six feet..\", Zoe remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered the irony of her remark as you realized that indeed, you were now too small for the things that you used to take for granted, including the now too big book shelf that was perfect for your many books.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not my hoop!\", you yelled as Zoe reached up to tug at the basket ball hoop hanging from your door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jazz, you don't really think you can keep this in here do you?,\" Zoe responded with a laugh, \"Look how high it is from you, you'll just have to let us take it down since you may not need it all that much...\", she continued.  You interjected, \"But Zoe, don't you think its a little too much to take away some of the things that remind me of who I am, um, was?\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighed, \"Oh OK, I'll let this stay, for now..\", she relented.  You looked around your room for anything else that was already removed and any new item that your siblings have put in the room.  You noticed for the first time that they had put in a baby table and chair in one corner of the room, and your regular sized desk and chair were missing.  \"You gotta be kidding me guys!...\", you exclaimed.  \"Why not just put a crib in here while you are at it!\", you pouted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's a good idea Jazz.  In fact I can get that one from the attic right now..\", Zoe laughed and as James joined in laughter, you felt your face beginning to flush with embarrassment. \"Come on guys, quit playing around.  I'm serious, I don't want this baby stuff in here.  Get my chair and desk back in here!\", you practically screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oooohhh, Jazz is getting a twemper... \", James teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jazz, lighten up.  We're doing you a favor by re-arranging your room for you to be more comfortable.\", Zoe said.  \"Where should we put stuffed toys, James?...\", Zoe asked coyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could put it over there..\", James replied, pointing to the corner where you normally pile your basket balls, base ball bats, roller blades, and stuff.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stamped your foot in protest and yelled, \"Hell No! Don't you dare touch my stuff! ...And I don't want any stuffed toys in here!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better do as he says Zoe, lets leave those alone and just finish up with this book shelf\", James said as you marched over to the pile of sports stuff in an attempt to block any move by either sibling to touch them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see we're gonna have a problem here.\", Zoe agreed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\", you said, with some satisfaction with your apparent victory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla entered the room, her arms laden with stuffed toys,  \"Hey guys, where should I put these?\", she asked, her voice brimming with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, sis, we changed our minds, we don't need any stuffed toys in here..\", James replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla stopped, and looking at you said, a little crestfallen, \"Why don't you want any of these cute fuzzy toys in here Jazzy?...Is it about that thing I did to you earlier? I thought I said \"sorry\" for pulling the ballerina on you..\", she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna have stuffed toys here!\", you yelled, pushing Ella back through the door.  \"H-hey, watch it twerp!\", Ella yelled as Zoe and James laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted by mom who came to the landing on top of the stairs, a little breathless from climbing the stairs, \"Jazz, you have a visitor downstairs but I didn't say anything about your current, um, situation.  I'll leave it up to you how you will handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious to know who it was that has come to visit and was a little peeved that whoever it was did not think to call first.  You cautiously crept down the stairs, your mom and siblings close behind.  You stopped abruptly just before your visitor could see you at that section of the stairs where anyone sitting in the family room could have seen you.  You gasped in alarm as you saw that the person sitting on the sofa waiting a little impatiently was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was unsure just how much of a mental change had occured, but you seemed to be okay. For the moment. \"Okay, until I can get Jazz's new identity set up, she will be off school\" mom announced. A slight grin formed on your face, but it falls flat when mom said that you can't stay home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, you're five years old.

Finally, you get a break from Ella's whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" James asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiles knowingly. \"I'm the manager, honey. I could get away with worse. Besides,\" she directs her smile at you now, \"Who would complain? I'm sure my coworkers will love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" you groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom clears her throat. \"I should have time to make some calls during work, see what we're supposed to be doing. With any luck, by the end of today we should have a better idea of what's going to happen. The rest of you, get yourselves ready for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch your siblings' expressions as they funnel out of the room. Ella shoots you a glare, Zoe looks concerned, and James offers a supportive smile. You wait a few moments for them to get away before heading off to your room to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes later, Mom is taking you by the hand into the office building where she works. You've never been here before, so it's interesting to see. The place sure is nice looking, which makes sense, given that it's where Mom makes the kind of money she needs to comfortably raise four children on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Becca,\" the receptionist greets your mom. \"Oh! Who's this?\" Her eyes light up as she leans over her desk to get a good look at you. You can't help but stare up at her in a way she'll probably find endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jasmine,\" Mom says. \"I'm looking after her for a friend who couldn't find a babysitter.\" There's no hesitation in her voice; she must have gone over this in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, she's just the cutest thing!\" the receptionist gushes. You give her an unamused look, but she just giggles and pats you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom takes you upstairs via the elevator, and you try to ignore the curious looks of several employees as she leads you over to her office, which is separated from the cubicle area by glass panelling. You manage to get inside and retreat to a corner just as another of Mom's coworkers approaches her and prompts her to repeat her little cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Mom sits down at her desk and, after doing a few largely inscrutable things on the computer, picks up the phone and calls someone. \"Hello, this is Rebecca Storms,\" she says. \"I need to talk about making arrangements for Jasmine? ... Yes. ... That's not... look, never mind that. ... Okay. ... Okay, I'll do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs up. Well, that didn't tell you much. \"Mom?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jazz, I can't talk much,\" she says, typing away on her keyboard. \"Between doing my job and getting you sorted out, I'm going to be busy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you let out a little moan of reluctant agreement, you look outside the office and notice that people are frequently making glances at you. Unnerved, you move around trying unsuccessfully to escape everyone's sight, until you look for a hiding place and realise that being as small as you are, you could comfortably fit beneath Mom's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the floor and shuffle backwards into the space under the desk. Once you're in there you can't see Mom's face, but she makes a little half-laugh sound that suggests she finds your behaviour cute. You're not all that concerned about embarrassing yourself right now, though. You just want to be left alone, and it feels nice and safe down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom goes on to make several more calls. You can't tell who she's talking to, but she repeats herself a lot and seems to grow increasingly frustrated with the level of bureaucracy she's encountering. After a while you take out your phone (which you actually brought with you for once) and play some games to pass the time. By the third time Mom has to explain your situation from scratch to someone, you're not really paying attention anymore.</span></div></div>",

I've gotten in touch with... well, a lot of people, and I'm told the government are getting ready to set things up for you. But first we'll have to go back to the lab for tests...\" Your eyes widen a little. \"It's nothing scary, it's just... well, it's an IQ test, basically. They need to see how smart you still are before they'll know what to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel like you've gotten dumber, but the idea that your intelligence is being called into question has you concerned. You spend the rest of Mom's work hours, which feels like an eternity, worrying that these government people will find some reason to have you start school over from the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the end of the working day finally comes, Mom calls Zoe to say you won't be home for a while, which gets you thinking. It implies that Zoe has now inherited the title of \"most responsible child\"; you can only assume that even if you had stayed home and Mom was going to the lab by herself, she would still be calling Zoe instead of you. The thought stings, as you'd always taken a certain pride in being second-in-command of the household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the office with minimal harassment from workers, and Mom drives to the all-too-familiar laboratory building. To your displeasure, Dr. Hanson is waiting for you just inside. Next to him stands a professionally dressed woman you don't recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here you are,\" Dr. Hanson says. \"It's about time we got this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to say something snippy in response, but something about being a small child surrounded by adults inhibits that urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dr. Hanson,\" Mom says in the icy tone she keeps reserved for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman beside Dr. Hanson quickly moves to calm the conversation. \"It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Storms,\" she says, shaking Mom's hand. \"I'm Dr. Norris,  on-call psychologist for the rejuvenation project. So this is Jasmine, is it? I must say, Hanson, your research certainly has produced results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it has,\" Dr. Hanson smiles smugly. Ugh, don't encourage him, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come this way, please,\" Dr. Norris starts leading you through the corridors. \"This is going to be a fairly simple process, but it's very important to get done. We need to establish the extent of the accident's impact on Jasmine's thought processes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Dr. Hanson bitterly adds, \"We'd have more data to work with if you'd simply agreed to co-operate with us from the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could still sue you, you know,\" Mom pointedly remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hanson throws up his arms. \"Of course you could. It's not as if our funding goes towards revolutionary advances in medicine or anything important like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrive at what is apparently your destination, Dr. Norris gives Dr. Hanson an awkward \"calm down\" look, clearly not enjoying being associated with him. \"Now, Jasmine,\" she says, \"I'm going to need some one-on-one time with you; is that alright?\" You nod. \"Mrs. Storms, you can take a seat in the waiting area over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Jazz,\" Mom says as Dr. Norris opens the door and takes you into a small office, featuring a desk not unlike the one you just spent hours hiding underneath, with chairs on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go!\" Dr. Norris lifts you up and places you in the chair in front of the desk. It's high enough that you would have had trouble climbing into it yourself, but you still, somewhat illogically, resent the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Dr. Norris says as she sits down on the other side of the desk, \"Are you comfy? You'll have to excuse Dr. Hanson, he's -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A jerk?\" you interrupt. There you go, there's your snippy remark. But now you hate yourself for not having the courage to say it to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, that's not nice!\" Dr. Norris chides you, clearly treating you as the five-year-old you appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sixteen,\" you assert, as a reminder to yourself as well as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you sadly. \"I know, I know,\" she sighs. \"But whether you can still function as a sixteen-year-old is... well, it's what we're here to find out.\" You offer no response beyond a sullen look, so she continues, \"Okay, now, we'll start off with some simple reasoning tests. First of all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Norris produces from the desk drawer a series of wooden shapes and a board featuring matching holes. You frown disdainfully. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" she laughs. \"But we have to start from the beginning, you know. Just humour me now, and we'll work up to the more challenging activities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to yourself, you quickly dump the pegs into their respective holes (although you have to stretch uncomfortably to reach one of them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Dr. Norris says, putting the board away. \"I would've been really worried if you couldn't do that! Now, on to the next one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Norris proceeds to present you with a succession of tasks, including reading exercises and math problems, which soon become less insulting but still fail to challenge you at all. You begin to feel confident you haven't lost any brainpower...</span></div></div>",

What Dr. Norris did not know, how would she anyway, was that you were a straight A student as a sixteen year old, so what you were being exposed to now was literally child's play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Jasmine, you have done well so far.  That's good!  Maybe now I should really test your vocabulary and word association.\", Dr. Norris said.  \"All you need to do is to say the first thing that comes to your mind as I show you the picture stimuli.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, this should be simple enough, you thought.  \"OK Dr. Norris, I'm ready.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes you answered correctly when Dr. Norris presented each picture or shape to you.  Oh this is a snap! you thought, I can do this with my eyes closed you smiled, a little amused.  You smiled wider as the next graphic was shown and again you answered correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  That's enough of these tests don't you think?\", Dr. Norris said.  You nodded eagerly as you were feeling a little exhausted after your efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me all about you.  What is it like to be a girl now?\", Dr. Norris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not quite prepared for this question but you thought that this must be an important part of the test.  You told the doctor everything that had happened since the field trip and how you felt at various times.  You even mentioned the embarrassing episodes when you lost control of yourself and became the five year old.  You could see Dr. Norris perk up at the mention of these episodes and you noticed that she made notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your recount and Dr. Norris took a few minutes to make a few more notes before she ushered you out to your mom who was still in the waiting area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Jazz alright Doctor?\", mom asked anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter is perfectly fine Mrs. Storms\", Dr. Norris replied with a reassuring smile.  \"I will need just a few words with Dr. Hanson and then you will be free to go.\", she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Dr. Norris back to Dr. Hanson's office where both Dr. Hanson and Dr. Blake were in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the little one do?\", Dr. Hanson asked.  Dr. Norris did not answer immediately but looked at you  again, perhaps to read any signs in your face that she may have missed earlier.   You impulsively gave her a mischievous smile and a wink.  Dr. Norris returned her attention to the two doctors, \"I'll have to review my notes and let you have my assessment later, if that's all right with you.\", she asserted.  With that, she strode through the door, leaving the two doctors a little bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\", grunted Dr. Hanson, \"we'll just have to let you go now.  We'll get in touch with you as soon as possible with Dr. Norris' assessment and perhaps we can see what next we need to do...\", he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom interrupted, \"...If we could talk by phone, that is all I would need.  I'm not too keen on coming back to your lab.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself\", Dr. Hanson retorted.  \"Oh, by the way, I will need to see you again anyway so that we can deal with some paperwork, nothing serious, just us taking some precautions...\", he said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was three days later and you were anxious to hear about the test results.  You were in the kitchen with mom who was preparing breakfast when you asked her about the next visit to the lab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wished I didn't have to go back there\", mom replied, \"but you heard what Dr Hanson had said, that we needed to return for some \"paperwork\", as he puts it\".  You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not sure why they would want to do that though\", she continued, \"I just want everything to be over and done with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom placed your breakfast on the table and you took your seat to eat.  Ella and Zoe burst in, \"Morning Mom, Hi jazz\", they greeted. They were ready for school and were on their way out.  \"Have you eaten yet?\", mom called after them.  \"We had cereal already.  We gotta catch the bus!\", Ella replied, just as the sound of the approaching school bus became audible.  \"Hey guys hurry up!\", James called as he ran to the front door, \"we're late already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye mom, bye Jazz\", both sisters said as they rushed toward the door to join James.  You heard the bus stop and the sound of your siblings hustling to get on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the phone rang and mom picked up.  You did not hear the conversation.  Mom hung up and returned to you, \"that was a secretary from the doctor's office.  We are being asked to come in for your results.\"  You felt a mixture of relief and dread.  I wonder what the results really are, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both in the waiting area of the doctor's office as neither Dr Norris nor Dr Hanson was ready to see you just yet.  You idly picked up a magazine from the rack on which various magazines were neatly arranged, and flipped the pages.  Nothing really interested you but you did not know what else to do while you waited.  Mom herself was looking through a magazine, but you sensed that she was a little annoyed at having to wait after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctors are ready now Mrs Storms\", the secretary said, while motioning you toward the doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both entered and after exchanging greeting, sat in the seats in front of the large wooden desk.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, lets tell you what the test results have shown\", Dr Hanson started, looking over at Dr Norris.  The female doctor picked up a file that was lying on the edge of the desk and after a moment, started, \"Mrs Storms, we are happy to tell you that your daughter's, um, son's mental faculties are sharp as ever and you really do not have anything to worry about there.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", mom said.  You were relieved as you were secretly worried that there might have been some regression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a little concerned about those episodes of behavioral loss of control that Jasmine had experienced.\", Dr Norris continued.  You felt as though you have been kicked in the stomach and you let out an involuntary gasp.  Oh no!, what if there is something else wrong with me?, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean doctor?\", mom asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that we will have to monitor the frequency of these episodes when Jasmine behaves as a five year old.\", the doctor replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that this is one of the side effects of the serum that we would have to test for...\", Dr Hanson interjected.  Mom gave him a withering look before turning to Dr Norris, \"What are our options here then?\", she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have to opt for a series of treatment to suppress these episodes of relapse\", Dr Norris replied.  Somehow you did not feel reassured.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not reassuring at all doctor!\", mom retorted.  \"How long would we need to do this treatment if we were to accept this?\", she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Storms, please let us not dwell on the worst that could happen...\", Dr Hanson interrupted, \"let us see how best we can...\"  Before the doctor could finish, mom stood up and with as much venom as she could muster replied, \"You doctors at this genetics facility are to be blamed for this! You know what you have done to my child and here you are trying to minimize the effect that this will have on him for the rest of his life!  What the hell do you expect me to accept now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down, Mrs Storms...\", Dr Norris said, while Dr Hanson walked over to the other side of his desk to retrieve another batch of papers.  You were getting a little frightened, not about what the doctors have just said, but of your mom's reaction.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why should I be calm?!\", mom retorted, \"Why should I accept that my son will need treatment for behavioral mishaps caused by your experiments?  Who the hell will pay for these treatments?\", mom yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuumm, That's why we drew up these papers...\", Dr Hanson said as he walked over with papers in hand.  \"These documents were drawn up by our legal department to outline the arrangement the lab is prepared to honor in the case of your child's treatment.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at mom who looked as though she was about to explode even more.  She was that mad.  Dr Hanson continued, \"we think it is in our mutual best interest for you to sign these papers, accepting our offer to take care of your son's medical and perhaps psychological needs from now on as long as you do not proceed with any adverse action against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore\", Dr Hanson continued before mom could interrupt, \"we would need your cooperation to keep this matter strictly confidential.  No one else must know what has transpired.  You cannot go to the media with this.  Failure to adhere to these conditions will nullify this agreement and the lab would have no choice but to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was ballistic!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really expect me to sign that bullshit without legal advice?!\", mom blasted.  \"What kind of fool do you take me for?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Mrs Storms, what Dr Hanson meant was...\", Dr Norris started, but mom did not allow her to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me say this only once, I will absolutely not sign any of your papers even if you put a gun to my head!\" , mom said, her voice calmer now but still hard as steel.  \"You will hear from my lawyer!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, mom took you firmly by the hand and  strode to the door. As you both left, you thought you heard Dr Hanson \"We certainly have a problem on our hands.\"  But then this was said so low that you thought you might have been mistaken.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, now it's payback time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap.</i> I had completely forgotten about that. I tried to pull away, but though my mental will power was stronger than ever, my now 5-year-old body was no match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I wouldn't try anything funny.\" she said with the same evil grin. \"Now that you're a girl, I'm sure it wouldn't take much convincing for mom to get rid of all that junk in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't.\" I glared daggers at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, she simply smiled sweetly and picked up a brush. \"Now before we get started, we first have to put on a primer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone who appeard so sweet, she could be a demon sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, I emerged from her room with my hair in a long braid down my back, eye liner, blush marks, lashes, matching nails on both fingers and toes, blue shimmering clip-on earrings, and a much wider knowledge of facial makeup. If it wasn't for the current situation, I'd admit that it was actually somewhat interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to a mirror and was confused at first. Who was this? It was like someone had walked out of the Disney Channel sitcom. Even stranger was that somehow, Ella had managed to make me look... slightly older and more mature. Maybe around seven or so. Wow, make up really was magical. I guess she caught me gocking at myself because from behind me she said \"you're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply responded with \"... right, thanks. Don't post the pics you took anywhere.\" I added as an after thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"too laaaate!\" She sang excitedly as she went downstairs. \"going to get mom now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" I shouted when I turned around and nearly smacked right into James.... <i>Crap, again.</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" He looked at me, dumbstruck. \"Hi...?\" his face began turning red... no. This couldn't be what I think it was. \"I-... I'm James. Nice meeting you.\"<br>\r\nIt was. In any other case, I'd be proud of the kid. He found his first (as far as I know) crush... a shame it was on <i>ME!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slapped my hand on hi shoulder. \"James. \" I said in a flat voice. \"It's me.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n\"It's me, Jazz.\"<br>\r\n\"J... Jazz?\" now he was really confused.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're brother? That's me, Jazz.\"<br>\r\n\"N-no? Jazz is... a guy. You're... \" his eyes seem to cloud and his face went red again. \"Beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I facepalmed and sighed. I would <i>have</i> to give him a lesson on talking to girls. Now wasn't the time though. Having my little brother crushing on me was NOT something I wanted to deal with right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook him hard... well as hard as my small body could. \"James!\" I shouted. \"I'm your brother! Jasper? Helloo... I'm just trapped in...\" I looked down somewhat defeated. \"A little girl's body.\" I mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... MOOOOM!!\" James shouted. Part of me couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy. This was probably going to cause him some serious complexes as he got older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, hold on!\" I shouted, holding my hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe turned towards me. \"Um...\" I had to think fast.</span></div></div>",

You gave a half smile, though it disappears as you realized it still would be girls' clothes.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Relax ummm errr. arrr\" Zoe stumbled.

If i'm not normal tomorrow, will somebody take me to the genetics lab?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Jazz\" mom said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Ella said, despite Zoe elbowing her to try to quieten her. \"i don't want to sound like I'm being cruel or mean, or that I find this enjoyable because I'm not, but Jazz isn't exactly a girls' name. If we're taking Jazz out in public, people will think we're weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares about your reputation. I'm the one who lost a decade and had a gender switch.

Ella doesn't think at times. She doesn't realize that despite how I look, I'm very much me. Don't tell me otherwise. Both of them probably have accepted me as their little sister and are fighting about the 'correct' way for me to grow up. Mom, do you see me as a little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom wisely decided to let me rant, and my question took her by surprise. She decided to be direct. \"Yes. i do.\" It surprised me, and i said moodily, \"i don't want to talk anymore....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shrugged her shoulders. \"i know its hard but the facts are you're currently a little girl. i see that, but it doesn't mean I'm happy about it.\" She left me to sob, which I did. It was interrupted by the sounds of James coming home thirty minutes later. It was obvious one of the twins had told him, and he thought they had finally lost it. \"Jazz, you're not going to believe the stuff those two have come up with! They're saying you've been turned into a little girl due to a visit to that lab. Can you believe how insane that sounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni froze, since I didn't want him to see me like this.

Naturally, you couldn't see the rest of you, but if you could, you would had seen that you now had a normally adorable girlish face that was twisted with panic as you had began to realize the serum wasn't quite as inert and ineffective as you was told.

You would have had them, even if I saw a skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeans would stop me from flashing myself\" you argued. \"Why would I want to go outside anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There weren't any jeans, and you'd have to go outside unless you rather stay like this.

You closed your eyes; while your family wasn't poor, they weren't rich either. You knew mom needed every dollar she had. Hesitantly, you grabbed the tights and slid them onto your feet and pulled them up your legs. Mom then handed you the shoes, causing you to scowl. They were a clear symbol of girliness, and you didn't want them on your feet, clicking every time you took a step. And or course, the pink dress was worse. \"I can't do this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can, Jasmine.

You allow yourself to go on autopilot and cry onto his chest. James finds himself too stunned to act until he manages to move his arms and hold you under his embrace. \"It's okay, Jazz. It will be okay.\" As you continue crying, your heart warms up to this kind gesture. In the past, James would look up to you and you would go out of your way to protect him whenever he needed help.

James, Zoe, &amp; Ella had all got their clothes and went and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz had been sitting down on the bed waiting for them to leave but it was after sitting a bit that Jazz laid down and had fallen asleep.

She figured to let Jazz sleep a little longer until it's 7 a.m. when she normally wakes all her kids. She went and decided to make a quick run to get some other things for Jazz to be able to wear besides what was left behind. It was about 6:45 when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was walking into the spare room she noticed that Jazz was starting to wake up. She had shook Jazz and Jazz was now just about completely awake. Jazz says mom I head the weirdest dream saying that in it I became a little girl.

They go into the bathroom and Jazz gets undressed and then climbs in the tub. His mother asked if he wanted a bubble bath. Jazz says yes before even realizing what he just said. She has washed Jazz and then said she has a surprised and then goes and brings in some bags. She tells Jazz that until we find out what will be happening with you that I figured you would need so clothing to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz had got dressed in what he considered the least feminine. It was a child's romper. She then asked Jazz if he has any info from the tour. He says that there is a card.

You tentatively looked down on your front and was relieved that your manhood was still there, although you noticed on closer examination that it appeared slightly smaller.<i> Damn, this can't be good</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom called again, \"Jasper! I'm calling you for the last time!

Minutes later, a nurse entered. she was a large woman of African descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come this way\", she said, in an accent you did not recognize.  Your mom followed you as the nurse took you to an adjacent room. You grimaced as she pulled out the syringe to extract your blood.

Before, you was more or less unaltered, apart from the expected changes due to being two years younger. Now, you had a face that was a guy's, but there was a slight feminine hint to it. Plus, it looked even younger, maybe 13. You could see why Chelsea lost her composure; it was proof that the gender sapping, age reducing serum was real, and you was being affected.

You realized that the Secretary did not remark about your transformation although you were sure that she recognized you from the last visit.  Maybe it was because you were not wearing a dress but instead you were in a gray tracksuit and a blue cap your mom gave you to wear.  You did not ask her where she got these clothes from and you were only too happy to get out of Zoe's old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really did not expect to see you back so soon, Mrs. Storms\", Dr. Blake smiled, \"what seems to be so urgent that you couldn't wait until we called you with the test results.

Your voice sounds better. is this thing wearing off?\" you heard Chelsea's suddenly hopeful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you said, without trying to mask your voice. it sounded far higher than you anticipated. Chelsea heard it too, and voiced her disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coping?\" Chelsea asked. you knew that answer, and the only thing that has kept you from a total freak-out is the fact Chelsea hasn't abandoned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'its a nightmare. both Zoe and Ella are quarrelling -more than usual, mom spent 15 minutes last night telling me how to pee, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea interrupted. \"its important Jazz. until it wears off, you're going to be a 10 year old girl.

She locked the door shortly after about 2pm. I've asked both girls to stay away. Both Zoe and Ella are unhappy about it, and they're blaming me and each other\" mom said. Chelsea nodded and knocked on your door. After telling you it was her, you opened it, and Chelsea was shocked to see you was definitely looking like a girl around 8. You had shrunk out of the clothes that you had been given, and you was only wearing a loose pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm still getting younger\" you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.

While you was initially relieved to hear that you'd be spending all day with mom and not go to some childcare cr\u00e8che, it got bad quickly.  One of the first things people would ask mom was who 'the cute little girl' was; it got annoying after ten minutes to hear 'I didn't know you had another daughter, Becky.'. The even more annoying thing as that there was nothing to do. you offered to help mom with her office paperwork, but she declined almost immediately, saying it would look strange for a five year old to be doing paperwork. Them, when you got home, you was greeted by Ella, whom had a look on her face that reminded you of feeding time at the zoo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat, you wondered what to do. You knew you had to get out of the house, but the only person that knew about you was Chelsea, and you didn't want to call her every time. However, after ten minutes, you heard Zoe and Ella arguing, and the mentioning of 'Jasmine' was enough for you to make the call. Chelsea answered after two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea. Get me out of here! I don't care what we do, just get me out of here!\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? I'm a little girl with an evil sister\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has Ella done, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, but she's planning something. I know it. Chelsea, I'm sorry that I'm calling for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay. I would be totally freaked out if I found myself as a five year old, Jasmine\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't call me that' you said, pouting slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just teasing. Okay, i'll be over in five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'five minutes?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was coming over to see you anyway, Jazz\" Chelsea said. five minutes later, you heard a knock on the door, and your ex-girlfriend stood there, smiling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"your mom changed her mind?\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About me being at your house for a week? I haven't asked, though I doubt one long day at her work would change her mind. Can we get out of here? James. Chelsea and I are going somewhere\" you called out. Without waiting for a reply, Chelsea lead you out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" you asked.</span></div></div>",

Mom would want to make you look normal, and 'normal' meant things far too girly for your tastes. Ella would go for the girly girl look, and as for Zoe, while she would go for a tomboy look that is acceptable to you, it wouldn't occur without a massive fight, which you don't need. \"Fine, lets go, but no girly stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you can indulge me with one thing\" Chelsea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?

You had thought Ella would had chosen the most girly thing she could do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl's hair is much longer and we have to take care of it. Plus you'd want to keep it out of your eyes. I'm surprised that Chelsea didn't tell you that. So what do you want me to do?\" Ella said, repeating her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to cut it off\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to do that, sis\" Ella scolded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys my new age pull girls' hair\" you said, somewhat surprised that Ella was still being somewhat respectful towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's true, but girls do have longer hair. if I cut it, people will think you're weird or got cancer or something like that\" Ella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it loose\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What do you want next? Me putting it into pigtails, a ponytail or me putting a band to keep it out of your face?\" Ella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ponytail\" you said, not wanting pigtails, or one of Ella's old bows in your hair. Far too girly, and you wanted Ella to keep treating you with respect. She brushed out your hair and put it into a high ponytail. After handing you a mirror, she said, \"You look pretty, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to agree. It was nowhere near as bad as your feared. 'Have you finished, Ella?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. Hold out your hands\" Ella asked as she grabbed a bottle. You knew what that was and what she wanted to do. \"I'm not letting you paint my nails pink\" you yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm going to show you how to paint them, then I'm going to show you how to remove the paint\" Ella said, as started to paint your nails candy pink. Once done, you waited expectantly for her to grab the acetone, but she held back. \"Don't your nails look pretty?\" Ella cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit she did do a good job, but its still your nails. And you weren't entirely comfortable with her girlifying you. \"just remove it\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, Jasmine. You've got to let it dry. Since you're too young for cosmetics and I don't have the materials to pierce your ears, why don't you go and play some video games?\" Ella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieved that Ella wasn't going to do worse things to you, and that she intended to remove the polish soon.  </span></div></div>",

Pink, frilly dress, pink hair, and glowing pink nails. You might as well be butt naked as you stood there, the center of unwanted attention and shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz is a giiirrrlll.  Jazz is a giiirrrllll..\", the chants continued.  A strange thought hit you that it was unusual for teens to chant this childish playground taunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, come on...It's me, Jazz.  You know me...I'm the guy you always know.  Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pleas were falling on deaf ears as the relentless chant continued, \"Jazz is a guurrlll...Jazz is a guurrrlll\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around desperately for a place to hide but could not find one.

I belong here at my high school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of the high school principal loomed in front of you and you were suddenly scared of his ominous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine Storms you are no longer welcome in this school.  Leave now...\", it leered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No! I want to stay here.  Guys, help me! Nathan! Bart! Joe?\" you appealed to your friends but to your horror they were laughing and pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't belong here.  Leave now...\", they chanted in eerie unison.  Other voices joined this new chant and as you looked at the faces around you you recognized your old friends as well as a few who were not really your friends all chanting for you to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't belong here.  Go back to kindergarten!\", Nathan yelled and the others laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, please guys...Don't do this because I am a girl.  Please, it's me Jazz.  It's me Jazz....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girls don't belong here.  Leave now.\" the principal said as the others laughed louder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing continued and as you ran as fast as you could from the mocking laughter, you panic as you felt your feet slowing down  and you could not move as fast as you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!... Help!\", you gasped as you ran but the mocking laughter grew louder, and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream but no sound came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine!

It's just a nightmare\" mom soothed as she stoked your hair. You would have protested, but your nightmare really had shaken you. Apart from Chelsea, no one, not even Nathan, knew about your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going to happen to me, mom?\" you asked, shuddering. You didn't like her increased use of words like sweetie, as it made you feel there was some truth to your nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards at the genetics lab have been in contact with me, and they seem to be more interested in keeping this quiet than in getting you a cure\" mom spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, alarmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Jazz, but you needed to know. They keep telling me their treatment will eventfully revolutionize healthcare, and that it isn't currently possible to change you back. They've offered to give you a massive bribe to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do, mommy?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're partially right in saying you need a physical\" mom said, avoiding your question. \"Get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you were sitting in a hospital bed, only wearing a gown and your panties. You still had difficulty thinking of them as your own, and vainly tried to hide them as a doctor came in. She had a notepad that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatient: #110645/Storms, Jasmine<br>\r\n Preferred Name: Jazz<br>\r\n Gender: F<br>\r\n Age: 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine has been exposed to nanotech that has resulted in both age and gender changes.

She returned with several outfits. The first was a pink dress, something that Ella would be delighted to see you in. You had to admit it would look cute. The second was a pink t shirt and overall combination that would be more in line with Zoe. Again you could see you wearing it. The third choice was the only non pink item; a white t shirt saying princess with a yellow skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked...</span></div></div>",

As you saw your reflection, you bit your lip again. Your were right in believing it would make you look cute, and worse, you liked that it did.

I appreciate your concern for your daughter under these unusual circumstances, but I assure you I'm not doing anything to deliberately torture her. I just want to....\" the doctor said, before she started to whisper something into mom's ear. It lasted for over two minutes, and mom's expression slowly went from icy and annoyed, to steeled yet reluctant. \"So, may I proceed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Jazz will have the mary janes and tights\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, shocked that mom had given in, and had chosen the most girlish option. It took both mom and Dr Summers to force you into the white tights and to buckle the mary janes onto your feet. You ended up glaring at them both, especially after the doctor produced a mirror and asked if you thought that you looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you said sourly, even though you secretly agreed you did look cute. You felt you could easily manipulate your sisters, Chelsea, or Nathan. Assuming they don't all die laughing at you first. The other thing was that the tights eliminated the daft you felt, though it also made you angrier. Jeans could do that job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Her hair is next. What would you like, Jasmine?\" Dr Summers said to your pouting figure. You glared as she produced a pink decorated hairband which looked girlier (which got a distasteful look from you) and some pink ties, which was obviously intended for pigtails (which earned another disgusted face).</span></div></div>",

You called Nathan, \"Hey dude, want to come over for a while and just hang out?\", you asked casually.  You were glad when he answered in the affirmative.  \"I'll be right over\", he said.  You hang up and went to the bathroom to brush your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examined your face in the mirror and saw nothing amiss.  \"Good, no change.  I hope that serum does not affect me..\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Nathan arrived and as soon as he entered he gave you the usual greeting, which was really a combination of high and low fives ending with a fist bump that you two have always used from as far as you could remember.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you have in mind for today Jazz?, Nathan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go for a spin and then take in a movie.\", you announced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom came into the living room and asked, \"Jazz, are you sure you want to go out today?  Why not stay here with your friend Nathan and do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew mom was concerned about the possible changes the serum might have on you but you felt fine and you told her so.  \"Oh OK then, just make sure you come straight home the moment you feel anything.\", she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nathan left in Nathan's car.  Nathan drove to the City Sports Center and you talked about a lot of things on the way until the conversation turned to the field trip.  \"You think anything might happen to you because of the serum that spilled on you?\", Nathan asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\", you replied with a chuckle, \"As you can see, nothing happened, I'm the same old Jazz.  I'll be fine..\", <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan nodded, satisfied and pulled up in the parking lot at the Sports Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over to a group of guys shooting hoops.  You recognized a few of them as members of your school's basketball team.  Sometimes on a Saturday, you would come to the Center and join the players shooting hoops.  At nearly six foot one, you have the height for basketball and you were a good player.  You were also the captain of your school's basketball team.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Room for two more?\", you asked cheerily.  \"Sure, come on in!\", one of the guys answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were fully engaged in a sweaty and rough game of basketball and you actually scored some points. Midway through the game however, you suddenly felt weak and almost fell.  <i>Whoa, what's this?</i> you thought. The ball rolled away from you in mid dribble and you felt too weak to go after it.  Nathan noticed and came over to you, concern etched on his face.  \"Hey man, you lost the ball.  What's that about...\", he asked and stopped suddenly as he saw your ashen face.  The game stopped as the others came over.  \"Hey Jazz, what's wrong?\", one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - I'm fine....\", you barely muttered before falling to the ground.  </span></div></div>",

All of this makes you feel insecure in front of your mother to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that your mother has been leering at your face and chest. While her own face is still displaying horror and concern, you see that she is also starting to show signs of morbid curiosity. \"Can it be?\" Before you can ask what she meant, she tugs down your boxers, which easily fall to the ground, and lifts up your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" You squeal with intense embarrassment. However, you see that your mother starts feeling the same way. You wait for her to talk again, but nothing escapes her mouth. After summoning enough courage to look for yourself, you do so... and immediately regret it afterward. \"Mom! Where did my dick go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother finally snaps out of it and responds. \"...honey...\" she stutters. \"It's gone. You're a girl now.\" The truth of the situation hits you hard. When it comes to your sudden developing breasts and loss of any semblance of manhood, which only now you can recognize from retrospect, you cannot to deny it as much as you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You're mistaken! I'm not a girl! I'm not!\" you scream as tears run down your face. Your mother hugs onto you, which is all she can do at the moment to help you in this situation. What follows next is that ___.</span></div></div>",

We predict that the patients mind will be 100% female, with no reminiscence of being male in app. 2 1/2 weeks, we predict the patient is currently 10% female, and we expect a steady rise of femininity, the mother has been advised that we are trying to create a cure for this, but for the time being to buy feminine clothes for the patient as masculine ones may cause mental issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn black, what seems to have been scratched in by some sort of ash, it says \"Soon you will be my BEST BUDDY!\" Then a few drawings of rainbows, unicorns and stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this note didn't scare the pants off you, you didn't know what could!
