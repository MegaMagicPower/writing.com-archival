Scared about what they said, you try to leave, but you trip on a rock and hit a trash can. \"Well, well, well boys, look what we have here.\" the first one says. \"He's heard what we said, we're gonna have to kill him now that he knows our plans!\" the second one says \"Hey wait guys, i think this guy might be our special candidate.\"the third says. \"i think youre right. now all we have to do is use the device and we'll rule the kingdom.\" says the last. The first one points a light at you and you faint.</span></div></div>",

You grip them, you like the sensation. You start to play with them, then you look where your penis used to be. <b>You scream</b>, and a guard runs to your room. You redress quickly as the guard runs in. \"What's wrong princess?!\" You say, in a feminine voice, \"No, I'm fine, I just saw a spider\". You laugh nervously as the guard walks out. You sigh. \"How am I gonna fix this you say slowly\" You then realize that you are a princess. \"I probably have a lot of work to do in this body\" You sigh again. \"I have to fix this quickly\". \"I have to find those thugs, and force them to fix me.\" \"But how in this body, I'm weak..\"</span></div></div>",

You grab the part that you are standing on. You crawl down to the grass. You look around to see guards at the side entrance. You sneak out of the area. You crawl over the fence and stumble to the ground. You run away without anyone noticing. \"Good, I got away\" you say quietly to yourself. You then bump into a stranger. \"Sorry!\" You exclaim. You then look up at the stranger, you see that it was one of the thugs. \"...It's you...\" You say. \"Hah, I guess it worked, good, now time to use you!\" The thug says, grinning in an evil way. You back away. \"What are you going to make me do..\" You say in a scared way. \"You are going to bring us into power, you will make this place a living hell\" The thug says to you. You don't respond. You just stand there, scared and confused. \"Will you...change me back?..\" You say slowly to the thug. \"In time, once you do what we want\" The thug says. \"Now, go back to where you were, gather around everybody in the city, conduct a town meeting, and place down the new laws\" The thug says menacingly. You gulp and nod your head. \"Good, now scram!\" The thug yells.</span></div></div>",
