But that\u2019s not the shocking part. What is the shocking part is that you seemed to be way smaller than you were before. Possibly about three inches or so. Are you dreaming this or something?

The sounds of waves crashing down on a shore and people laughing and talking reach your ears, meaning that you're not alone wherever you are. You sit upwards and wipe the sleep out of your eyes, and blearily look around you. Surrounding you on all sides is sand forming into a kind of dip at the bottom of which you rested. You got up and yawned, stretching yourself out in the warm sunlight before looking around inquisitively, Where were you, and how did you get there? You walked up to the sandy slope and jabbed your foot into it, testing to see if it would hold your weight and allow you to climb out of here. When you're satisfied that you won't immediately slide back into the hole, you begin the arduous task of scaling the shallow wall to get to the top and find out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath, but victorious, you pull yourself up from the hole and observe your surroundings. You're clearly on a beach: you can see the roaring waves breaking on the sandy shore and leaving debris int its wake. All around you are people resting on beach towels, playing volleyball, splashing around in the water and chatting with one another. This fact wouldn't be so weird if<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. Most of them weren't in shades of color that regular humans should definitely NOT be in.<br>\r\nB. Everything wasn't GIGANTIC<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pinch yourself to make sure you're not in a dream and slap yourself for good measure.<br>\r\nThe sting of pain assures that, yep, you're awake, and nope, you're not dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever you are, you are most definitely not in Kansas anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're standing there trying to digest all this</span></div></div>",

What looked to be a girl toddler was staring directly at you with a curious expression, like she wasn't quite sure what to make of you. You hastily back up as she takes a single step towards you prompting a confused look from your giant ( though obviously not nearly as giant as one of the adults) observer.<br>\r\n&lt;Buggy?&gt; She asks again, this time reaching out a hand. You honestly don't know how to respond. Surely this child means you no harm, and if you're lucky she might just lead you to someone who can help you. Still... your tiny body is quite fragile, and you weren't so sure about committing to being cared for by a little girl. Once again you step back and shake your head, trying to get your point across to the toddler.<br>\r\nShe seems persistent though as most toddlers would be, and coniues to reach for you while saying that same phrase again.<br>\r\n&lt;Buggy!&gt;<br>\r\nYou sigh and offer up no resistance as she pick you up fully in her palm. The toddler holds you up to her face with a look of glee, ecstatic that she found herself a tiny new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens after that?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All you can do is stare in horror as the dark shape descends upon you. You feel the breath get knocked out of you as it finally makes impact, sending sand flying everywhere and crushing you underneath  <br>\r\nDistantly you hear a woman's voice call out something, but you can't quite make out what she is saying.<br>\r\n&lt;Water Lily honey, don't wander off too far, ok? This beach is packed and I don't want to lose you in the crowd.&gt;<br>\r\nYou can barely breathe, it's quite dark and stifling underneath here and you're surprised that you haven't swallowed any sand, yet.
