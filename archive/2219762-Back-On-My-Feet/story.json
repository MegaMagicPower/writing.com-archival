            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Marcus Scott, I\u2019m 18 years old; I live with my parents and my younger brother, Glenn.  My two closest friends are Eric Williams and Kat Maddox; Eric being a friend from childhood and Kat being my 13-year-old next-door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know what you\u2019re probably thinking; why is an 18-year-old guy best friends with a 13-year-old girl.  It\u2019s nothing sexual, I assure you; I\u2019ve known Kat since her family moved in six years ago.  I don\u2019t know why, but the two of us just clicked; our relationship becoming something akin to siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, onto the story \u2013 I\u2019ve been in a wheelchair since I was 14 years old; paralyzed from the waist down after being struck by a drunk driver while crossing the street.  It took some time before I was able to come to terms with being paralyzed; but with help from my friends and family, I was able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going normally until about 3 years after the accident; when out of the blue, a medical researcher came to the house.  Dr. Kevin Sheppard was developing a potentially groundbreaking cure for paralysis, and he wanted to test it on me.  If it worked, I would regain the use of my legs.  There was, however, a small catch; in addition to potentially curing my paralysis, the procedure would revert me back to the age I\u2019d been at the time of the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled by the thought of being 13 years old again, I knew it was something I could learn to deal with; especially if it meant getting my legs back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know, however, there was going to be an unforeseen side effect; one that would change my life forever...</span></div></div>",

It was just after 8:00 in the morning when we got to the hospital.  As Dad parked the car in one of the handicapped spots, I realized this was the last time I\u2019d have to use one of them \u2013 I mean, if everything went the way it was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was out of the car, Glenn started wheeling me towards the hospital entrance.  Leaning forward to talk in my ear, Glenn said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you; I\u2019m looking forward to no longer pushing you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here, brother.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be rid of this wheelchair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re excited, Marcus; but don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cAfter all, this is an experimental treatment; there\u2019s no guarantee that it will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he goes again; Dad ever so subtly saying he didn\u2019t think I should go through with the procedure.  As always, Mom was right there trying to bring him around.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a little optimism, Kent.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cThe worst that could happen is that it doesn\u2019t work.  But if it does, our son will get his life back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gloria; you\u2019re right.\u201d As we walked into the hospital lobby, Dad looked at me and said, \u201cI truly hope this works out for you, son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here, Dad.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cHas anyone heard from Eric or Kat this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric called why you were in the shower; he\u2019s got college orientation today but wishes you luck.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cKat texted your brother and said that she\u2019d stop by before the procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took another 15 minutes before we were in my hospital room.  Glenn effortlessly lifted me from the wheelchair onto the bed.  Once he was finished, I looked at him and said, \u201cI bet you\u2019ll be glad to never have to do that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn had the misfortune of being the one who, more often than not, had to help me with my everyday tasks \u2013 like getting dressed, showering, or using the bathroom.  \u201cIt may not be the most glamorous job, but I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d Looking at me, a goofy grin on his face, Glenn said, \u201cYou\u2019re my little brother after all; it\u2019s my job to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not your little brother yet.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve still got a few more hours to enjoy being the oldest child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it while you can, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Sheppard walked in a few minutes later; a clipboard in his hands.  \u201cIs everyone ready for the big day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than you can possibly know, Doc.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have my legs back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, Marcus, your sunny optimism is quite infectious.\u201d Looking at the clipboard, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a nurse come in shortly to check your vitals.  Once I\u2019m certain that you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll have you brought to the procedure room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cNot to be rude or anything; but would it be alright if I had some time to myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sweetie; I have to update the family anyway.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be outside if you need us.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been an hour or so since the nurse came to check my vitals.  My folks were somewhere in the hospital, most likely at the cafeteria having a quick breakfast.  I, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t eat anything prior to the procedure.  So I was passing the time by watching <i>Manifest</i> on my tablet; trying to imagine how strange it would be to discover years had gone by for everyone else but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of watching an episode when I heard a knock on the door. I quickly paused the episode before turning to face the door. \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a smile on my face when I saw Kat standing in the doorway; an equally big smile on her face. Running into the room, she hugged me and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to see you before they took you in for the operation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an operation, Kat; I won\u2019t even be giving anesthesia.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cBut, I am glad you got here before they brought me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d pulling a chair up to my bedside, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019d be pretty nervous if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous; mostly out of fear that it won\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to work.\u201d With a goofy grin, Kat said, \u201cIn a few days, once you\u2019re out of the hospital, we\u2019ll be able to hang out without you being in a wheelchair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d Looking at Kat, I couldn\u2019t help but notice she was nervous about something.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m nervous; while you look worse than you did before your ballet recital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seem to recall breaking my leg at that recital; so I guess I had good reason to be nervous.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cBut, you\u2019re right, I am nervous; because there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel hurt that Kat seemed to be keeping something from me. We never kept any secrets from each other; after all, she was the first one outside the family that I told about the procedure. \u201cAre you keeping something from me, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s only because I\u2019m afraid of how you\u2019ll react to it.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you since 7th Grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I\u2019d had any liquid in my mouth, I probably would have done a spit take at that news. Looking at Kat, dumbfounded, I said, \u201cY-You have a crush on me? Why\u2019d you never tell me before this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said told you because it felt wrong to think of you that way; you\u2019ve been like my big brother since I moved in next door.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cPlus there was the fact that you were 5 years older than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s not going to be an issue for much longer.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cOnce we\u2019re the same age; perhaps we could see where things go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!?\u201d louder than she probably intended, Kat looked at me and said, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not joking right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t think Kat was attractive; because she is. I just felt weird thinking about her that way; because, as she said, I thought of her as my little sister. We\u2019re talking about a girl who I taught how to ride a bike. The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized there wouldn\u2019t be any issues once we were the same age. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, Kat; I\u2019d like to go out with you sometime.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cJust promise me one thing; you won\u2019t get mad if, for one reason or another, one of us decides that the two of us dating is weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could agree to that.\u201d Leaning over, Kat kissed me on the cheek and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat left a few minutes later; walking past Mom and a nurse as they came into the room. Once Kat was out of earshot, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cKat seemed pretty happy; is there something I should know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now, Mom.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Gesturing to the nurse, Mom said, \u201cAre you ready for the procedure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse helped me into the wheelchair, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for the last four years, Mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I briefly wondered what if was all for, but then I remembered this was an experimental procedure; Dr. Sheppard probably wanted everything recorded to look over later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse, an attractive woman in her early 30s, lifted me from the wheelchair onto the exam table.  After turning me over onto my back, she started strapping me down.  As she worked, she said, \u201cThese are only in case you have a reaction to the medicine; it wouldn\u2019t do for you to injure yourself because of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stood by in the corner as Dr. Sheppard walked into the room; holding a clear box with what looked to be four syringes filled with a reddish-orange liquid.  While the nurse finished strapping me to the table, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cNow Marcus, the procedure is going to be quite simple; I\u2019m going to inject the serum into four locations on your spine.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cIf all goes well, they should go about repairing the damage done by the accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to hurt, will it?\u201d wincing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly the biggest fan of needles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t feel a thing, my boy.\u201d Grabbing the first syringe, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cNow, if you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m going to inject the first needle just below your neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready, Doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure itself only took about 20 minutes; thankfully there were no complications.  Once he was finished, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cThe injections are all finished, Marcus.\u201d Coming around the table, he knelt down to where I could see him.  \u201cI included a mild sedative in there as well, so don\u2019t be surprised if you start to feel a little drowsy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Dr. Sheppard.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI really hope this works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse waited a few minutes before removing the straps holding me to the table.  Once that was finished, I was brought out of the room; to find Dad, Mom, and Glenn standing there. Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything went off without a hitch, Kent.\u201d Walking out of the room, behind me, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cWith any luck, he\u2019ll start to regain sensation in his legs later this afternoon.  If all goes according to plan, he\u2019ll be taking his first steps tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for everything, Kevin.\u201d Tearing up, Mom hugged Dr. Sheppard and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve given my baby his life back.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The sensation slowly started to travel up my legs; reminding me of what it felt like to have my arm fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to keep my mind off the sensations; watching more shows on my tablet.  I made until just before 5:00 before the sensations started to feel a little painful.  I started to panic a little, so I reached over and pushed the call button on the side of my bed.  It wasn\u2019t long before a nurse, the one that brought me to the procedure room, came running into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like my legs are being stabbed with needles.\u201d Wincing, I said, \u201cIs that normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing you need to worry about, Marcus.\u201d  A vague smile started to form on the nurse\u2019s face.  \u201cThat\u2019s just your legs starting to repair themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been so caught up with the alien sensations I\u2019d been feeling, that I hadn\u2019t stopped to consider what they meant.  \u201cAre you serious?\u201d tearing up, I looked at the nurse and said, \u201cTh-The procedure worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly looks that way.\u201d Her smile growing bigger, the nurse said, \u201cI\u2019ll page Dr. Sheppard; then I\u2019ll go find your folks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse ran out of the room, I started crying.

Having not eaten anything since last night, I wasn\u2019t surprised at all when I ate an entire 12-ounce steak in 5 minutes.  That got me a look from Glenn, who said, \u201cGlad to see your appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sheppard said I have to eat a lot of protein to regain my muscle mass.\u201d With a grin, I said, \u201cSo enjoy being able to outrun me while you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Chuckling, Glenn said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you just because you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop calling me your little brother; you make it sound like I\u2019m way younger than you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAt most, I\u2019m only 5 or 6 months younger than you now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well you\u2019re still younger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say something in response, but I was suddenly interrupted by the ringing of my cell phone.  Putting my fork down, I reached over and grabbed it off the table.  A smile appeared on my face the instant I saw it was Kat calling.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey Kat, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of Kat\u2019s name, I noticed Mom starting to usher Dad and Glenn out of the room.  Mom followed suit just as Kat said, <br>\r\n\u201cNot much, I just wanted to see how the procedure went.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe procedure went fine; didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cAfter a while though, I did start to feel a tingling sensation in my legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d sounding concerned, Kat said, \u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tempted to string Kat along for a few moments, but I quickly figured she wouldn\u2019t like that very much.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cThe procedure worked; I was able to wiggle toes about an hour ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to pull the phone away from my ear as Kat\u2019s scream was almost deafening.  After a moment, she calmed down and said, \u201cIt worked?  I-It really worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it worked.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI have the use of my legs again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, Kat said, \u201cI was so worried that it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sheppard wants me to take my first steps tomorrow morning.\u201d Pausing, thinking about what I was about to say, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like it if you were there to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?  I wouldn\u2019t miss this for the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt some butterflies in my stomach when I heard that.  With a smile, I said, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll text you the details tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good to me.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ll really happy for you, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Kat.\u201d Grinning from ear to ear, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung the phone just as Mom walked back into the room.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI take Kat was excited?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are still ringing she screamed so much.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be here tomorrow to watch my first steps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, honey.\u201d Coming next to the bed, Mom said, \u201cDo you have a problem with your father, Glenn and I going home for the evening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, go right ahead.\u201d Yawning, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With everyone watching, and Kat even recording on her phone, the physical therapist brought me over to a set of horizontal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she helped me to my feet, she said, \u201cOkay Marcus, now hold on tightly to those bars.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let go of you, and I want you to try putting your weight on your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as I was told; although my legs wobbled a little, and wouldn\u2019t straighten out; I was standing on my own.  That got me applause from everyone in the room, even from another patient nearby.  \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just jump right in, don\u2019t you.\u201d Smiling, the therapist said, \u201cNow I\u2019d like to see how far you can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath, and put my right foot in front of my left. Then, I put my left in front of my right. I did it again before my legs gave out under me.  I wanted to cry as the therapist helped me back into the wheelchair. \"Three steps,\" I said. \"Three lousy steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s three more steps than you\u2019ve been able to do for years.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to climb Mount Everest on your first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group came over and hugged me.  With tears in her eyes, and her voice cracking, Mom said, \u201cMy baby is walking again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say that I\u2019d only gone three steps, but I realized that she and the therapist were right.  I may have stumbled, but I had been walking before that.  My tears of humiliation were replaced by tears of triumph.  The last person to congratulate me was Kat.  She hugged me tightly and gave me a kiss on the cheek, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you, Marcus.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That left only Glenn in the room with Kat and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, I noticed Kat giving Glenn a weird look.  I was about to ask what was going on, when she said, \u201cGlenn, do you think you could give Marcus and me some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn turned and left without saying a word; leaving me alone in the room with Kat.  Sitting up in the bed, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a terrible mistake yesterday; I never should have said I had feelings for you.\u201d  Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t think of me that way; so I\u2019d like it if you just forget I said anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to yesterday after Kat came clean about her feelings for me.  I was still shocked to learn that she felt that way about me.  \u201cLook, Kat, I meant what I said yesterday.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to go on a date with you; so long as our parents are okay with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be okay with it?\u201d chuckling, Kat said, \u201cMy mom\u2019s known for months that I had feelings for you.  I even talked to her about it last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Really?\u201d shocked, I said, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wants me to be happy; and if being with you will make me happy, then she\u2019s all for it.\u201d Blushing, Kat said, \u201cIt\u2019s just my dad we\u2019ll have to convince.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing concerned, I said, \u201cIs that going to be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not; it\u2019s just that he\u2019ll probably ask if we ever did...anything before this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe <i>haven\u2019t</i> done anything before this.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHell, the closest I\u2019ve ever been to seeing you naked was seeing you in a bikini at the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d raising an eyebrow, Kat said, \u201cDid you like what you saw?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019d be lying if I said no.</i> \u201cI\u2019ll just say it became clear you were no longer that little girl who used to make me check her closet for monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil that point Kat had been sitting rather close to me; after my response, she leaned back in the chair.  \u201cThe two of dating is going to be weird, isn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just...you and I have that brother/sister dynamic.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cThe idea of us dating just seems weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really don\u2019t know what came over me at that point.  Leaning forward, I pulled Kat towards me and kissed her on the lips.

Placing it on the counter, Allison looked at me and said, \u201cI thought you might be hungry, so I had one of the swing shift nurses pick up a pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I\u2019m getting tired of hospital food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took some scissors from her purse, Allison said, \u201cLet\u2019s get that hair cut before we start eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Allison into the bathroom as she put a chair in front of the mirror.  As I sat down in the chair, I looked at her and said, \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea; I wouldn\u2019t want hair in the pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked while Allison went to work cutting my hair; mostly about Jamie\u2019s proposal, but we did discuss changes in my life.  I was surprised when she didn\u2019t seem all that shocked about Kat.  \u201cI\u2019ve seen how you two are together, I\u2019m not entirely surprised to learn she had feelings for you.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cAlthough, I would highly recommend the two of you talk to your folks before you do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe already agreed to do that.\u201d Looking at Allison\u2019s progress in the mirror, I said, \u201cAfter I get out of the hospital, I\u2019m going to talk to her dad; explain everything to him and ask if he\u2019ll let me date her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be any reservations about you guys.\u201d Brushing some hair off my shoulders, Allison said, \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re both the same age now and it\u2019s not like you ever did anything before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we make out a little this morning; but beyond that, we\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d with a grin, Allison said, \u201cHow\u2019d that go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it would be weird kissing her, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d blushing a little bit, I said, \u201cKat even said it was more enjoyable then she imagined it would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like this procedure definitely changed your life, Marcus.\u201d Smiling, as she looked at something in the mirror, Allison said, <br>\r\n\u201cNot only did you get the use of your legs back, but you\u2019ve also gotten yourself a girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few more minutes before Allison finished cutting my hair.  After she cleaned me up a bit, I looked at her handiwork in the mirror.  It actually looked better than it had after my last haircut.  \u201cThanks for the trim, Ally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for you, Marcus.\u201d Heading towards the door, she said, \u201cNow come on, let's go watch a movie and have some pizza.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was now no taller than a 10-year-old.  Everyone was understandably shocked when they walked into the room; seeing me sitting at the foot of the bed in a hospital gown that was now too big for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me, Dr. Sheppard?\u201d worried, I said, \u201cYou never said anything about me getting shorter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as confused as you are, Marcus; this never happened in any of the tests.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to run some tests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right ahead; the sooner you can undo the better.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cStarting high school again is going to be awkward enough, I\u2019d rather not be the shortest member of the freshman class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving a syringe from a drawer, Dr. Sheppard prepared to take some blood.  \u201cI assure you that won\u2019t happen, Marcus.  I\u2019ll send this to the lab; we should know more in an hour or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour seemed to drag by; as everyone, including me, patiently awaited the results of the test.  Allison and Mom were in the corner, talking about the proposal, while Dad was using the bathroom.  Glenn walked back into the room with a glass of water; as he handed it to me, he said, \u201cHow are you doing, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think I\u2019m doing, Glenn?\u201d taking the water, I said, \u201cI get the use of my legs back, but I\u2019ve shrunk to the size of a 10-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how Kat is going to feel; dating someone that\u2019s practically the same height as her.\u201d Seeing the dumbfounded look on my face, Glenn said, \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised, I overheard you telling her you\u2019d like to go out with her at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make fun of me, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cKat\u2019s a good looking girl; who am I to say you can\u2019t date her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPhew.  I was worried you\u2019d say it was weird\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a <i>little</i> weird; I mean, she\u2019s practically our little sister.\u201d  Pausing, Glenn said, \u201cBut if neither of you has a problem with that, then I\u2019d say go for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few minutes went by before Dr. Sheppard entered the room again.  He was holding a tablet in his hands and had a grim look on his face.  The look told me that he didn\u2019t have good news. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the series of injections had an unintended side effect.\u201d Looking at me and my family, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cIt did repair Marcus\u2019 spine as planned; but instead of making him a 13-year-old again, it\u2019s making him even younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room made an audible gasp. Looking at Dr. Sheppard, worried, I said, \u201cHow much younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf my tests are correct; by this time tomorrow, you\u2019ll be _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I must\u2019ve fallen asleep at some point after getting that unwanted news; because when I woke up, I quickly realized I was no longer in my hospital room.  I tried to look around at my surroundings but found that my body wasn\u2019t responding the way it should.  <i>Oh no; please don\u2019t let me be paralyzed again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort but I managed to turn my head enough to see a baby lying in a crib next to me.  I soon realized where I was, when I discovered that I was in a similar crib \u2013 I was in the hospital\u2019s nursery.  <i>Oh god, I\u2019m a baby again.</i>  I tried to speak in a desperate attempt to get some attention, but found the only noise I could make was a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly grew frustrated and did the only thing I could do \u2013 I started crying.  I don\u2019t know how long I cried for, but soon enough a nurse appeared above me.  \u201cHello little one.\u201d Lifting me up, she said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I\u2019m not hungry! I\u2019m a teenager, not a baby!</i>  But the only thing I could do was keep crying.  After a few minutes of this, the nurse placed me back in the crib and wheeled me out of the room.  <i>Where is she taking me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon had my answer when I was wheeled into a hospital room.  I could hear voices but had trouble determining who they were.  After a moment, I heard a voice I could identify \u2013 my mom\u2019s.  \u201cIs he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason her voice had a calming effect on me, and I slowly stopped crying.  As the nurse picked me up, she said, \u201cI think he\u2019s probably a little hungry; after all, he\u2019s been through quite an ordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can say that again.</i>  I figured the nurse would hand me off to mom so she could give me a bottle.  So imagine my reaction when I saw Mom lying in a hospital bed.  She looked different; like she\u2019d gained weight since I last saw her.  As the nurse handed me off to her, Mom said, \u201cIts okay sweetie, Mommy\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy confusion turned to horror when, instead of reaching for a bottle, Mom took out one of her breasts.  <i>Oh god no.</i>  I was powerless to stop her as she slowly guided me towards the exposed nipple.  The memory of me latching on and breast feeding was one I\u2019d give anything to forget.  The fact that I was doing so without even thinking was very disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there I was, being breastfed by my mom, when Glenn appeared in my line of sight.  I focused on him as he looked at me and said, \u201cI bet that wheelchairs looking pretty good right about now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything went dark.  When I could finally see again, I was relieved to find that I was back in my hospital room.  I did get a little worried, however, when I saw Mom standing over me.  Much to my relief, she simply looked down on me and said, \u201cMarcus, sweetie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quite relieved when I found I was able to talk.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhy does my body feel weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid your...regression is complete; you\u2019re now approximately 14 months old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom reached down to pick me up, I wanted nothing more than for her to be wrong.  Alas, that wasn\u2019t meant to be; while holding me in her arms, she turned to face the mirror.  Staring back at me, clear as day, was the reflection of a horrified looking 14-month-old baby.  Before I knew what was happening, I started crying.</span></div></div>",

As I stood there, staring at the mirror, I tried to explain what I was seeing.  The only logical explanation I could think of was that the serum was returning me to my original 13-year-old height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat on the toilet, relishing the fact that I was doing it on my own, I wondered whether or not I should tell someone about this.  Dr. Sheppard had mentioned there would likely be some unknown side effects from the serum, perhaps this was one of them.  If Dr. Sheppard was hoping to make this procedure readily available, he deserved to know if there was something happening to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after using the toilet, I made my way back to bed.  Once I was sitting in bed, I reached over and grabbed the call button.  An unfamiliar nurse walked into the room a few minutes later.  \u201cIs something wrong, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you have Dr. Sheppard called to my room?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m experiencing a side effect from his serum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, calling Dr. Sheppard turned out to be a good thing.  He was as baffled as I was about what was happening.  He called my folks back to the hospital; by which time I\u2019d shrunk another three inches, making me the same height as a typical 11-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was understandably upset that something like this was happening; after all, Dr. Sheppard assured us there\u2019d be no complications.  Glenn was worried as well; afraid of what else might happen to me.  To her credit, Mom was doing a great job of keeping it together; although I could tell she was an emotional wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Dr. Sheppard will be able to fix this?\u201d a worried look on my face, I said, \u201cIf I get any shorter people will think I\u2019m a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think like that, Marcus; I\u2019m sure Dr. Sheppard will be able to fix this.\u201d Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cIn the meantime, just be grateful that the procedure had its intended effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Sheppard walked into the room a few minutes later; a tablet in his hand and a grim look on his face.  The look told me that he didn\u2019t have good news.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the series of injections had an unintended side effect.\u201d Looking at me and my family, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cIt did repair Marcus\u2019 spine as planned; but instead of making him a 13-year-old again, it\u2019s making him even younger.\u201d<br>\r\nEveryone in the room made an audible gasp.  Looking at Dr. Sheppard, worried, I said, \u201cHow much younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf my tests are correct; by this time tomorrow, you\u2019ll be _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",
