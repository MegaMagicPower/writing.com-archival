            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Marcus Scott, I\u2019m 18 years old; I live with my parents and my younger brother, Glenn.  My two closest friends are Eric Williams and Kat Maddox; Eric being a friend from childhood and Kat being my 13-year-old next-door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know what you\u2019re probably thinking; why is an 18-year-old guy best friends with a 13-year-old girl.  It\u2019s nothing sexual, I assure you; I\u2019ve known Kat since her family moved in six years ago.  I don\u2019t know why, but the two of us just clicked; our relationship becoming something akin to siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, onto the story \u2013 I\u2019ve been in a wheelchair since I was 14 years old; paralyzed from the waist down after being struck by a drunk driver while crossing the street.  It took some time before I was able to come to terms with being paralyzed; but with help from my friends and family, I was able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going normally until about 3 years after the accident; when out of the blue, a medical researcher came to the house.  Dr. Kevin Sheppard was developing a potentially groundbreaking cure for paralysis, and he wanted to test it on me.  If it worked, I would regain the use of my legs.  There was, however, a small catch; in addition to potentially curing my paralysis, the procedure would revert me back to the age I\u2019d been at the time of the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled by the thought of being 13 years old again, I knew it was something I could learn to deal with; especially if it meant getting my legs back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know, however, there was going to be an unforeseen side effect; one that would change my life forever...</span></div></div>",

It was just after 8:00 in the morning when we got to the hospital.  As Dad parked the car in one of the handicapped spots, I realized this was the last time I\u2019d have to use one of them \u2013 I mean, if everything went the way it was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was out of the car, Glenn started wheeling me towards the hospital entrance.  Leaning forward to talk in my ear, Glenn said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you; I\u2019m looking forward to no longer pushing you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here, brother.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be rid of this wheelchair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re excited, Marcus; but don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cAfter all, this is an experimental treatment; there\u2019s no guarantee that it will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he goes again; Dad ever so subtly saying he didn\u2019t think I should go through with the procedure.  As always, Mom was right there trying to bring him around.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a little optimism, Kent.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cThe worst that could happen is that it doesn\u2019t work.  But if it does, our son will get his life back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gloria; you\u2019re right.\u201d As we walked into the hospital lobby, Dad looked at me and said, \u201cI truly hope this works out for you, son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here, Dad.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cHas anyone heard from Eric or Kat this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric called why you were in the shower; he\u2019s got college orientation today but wishes you luck.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cKat texted your brother and said that she\u2019d stop by before the procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took another 15 minutes before we were in my hospital room.  Glenn effortlessly lifted me from the wheelchair onto the bed.  Once he was finished, I looked at him and said, \u201cI bet you\u2019ll be glad to never have to do that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn had the misfortune of being the one who, more often than not, had to help me with my everyday tasks \u2013 like getting dressed, showering, or using the bathroom.  \u201cIt may not be the most glamorous job, but I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d Looking at me, a goofy grin on his face, Glenn said, \u201cYou\u2019re my little brother after all; it\u2019s my job to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not your little brother yet.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve still got a few more hours to enjoy being the oldest child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it while you can, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Sheppard walked in a few minutes later; a clipboard in his hands.  \u201cIs everyone ready for the big day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than you can possibly know, Doc.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have my legs back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, Marcus, your sunny optimism is quite infectious.\u201d Looking at the clipboard, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a nurse come in shortly to check your vitals.  Once I\u2019m certain that you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll have you brought to the procedure room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cNot to be rude or anything; but would it be alright if I had some time to myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, sweetie; I have to update the family anyway.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be outside if you need us.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been an hour or so since the nurse came to check my vitals.  My folks were somewhere in the hospital, most likely at the cafeteria having a quick breakfast.  I, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t eat anything prior to the procedure.  So I was passing the time by watching <i>Manifest</i> on my tablet; trying to imagine how strange it would be to discover years had gone by for everyone else but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of watching an episode when I heard a knock on the door. I quickly paused the episode before turning to face the door. \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a smile on my face when I saw Kat standing in the doorway; an equally big smile on her face. Running into the room, she hugged me and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to see you before they took you in for the operation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an operation, Kat; I won\u2019t even be giving anesthesia.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cBut, I am glad you got here before they brought me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d pulling a chair up to my bedside, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019d be pretty nervous if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous; mostly out of fear that it won\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to work.\u201d With a goofy grin, Kat said, \u201cIn a few days, once you\u2019re out of the hospital, we\u2019ll be able to hang out without you being in a wheelchair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d Looking at Kat, I couldn\u2019t help but notice she was nervous about something.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m nervous; while you look worse than you did before your ballet recital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seem to recall breaking my leg at that recital; so I guess I had good reason to be nervous.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cBut, you\u2019re right, I am nervous; because there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel hurt that Kat seemed to be keeping something from me. We never kept any secrets from each other; after all, she was the first one outside the family that I told about the procedure. \u201cAre you keeping something from me, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s only because I\u2019m afraid of how you\u2019ll react to it.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you since 7th Grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I\u2019d had any liquid in my mouth, I probably would have done a spit take at that news. Looking at Kat, dumbfounded, I said, \u201cY-You have a crush on me? Why\u2019d you never tell me before this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said told you because it felt wrong to think of you that way; you\u2019ve been like my big brother since I moved in next door.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cPlus there was the fact that you were 5 years older than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s not going to be an issue for much longer.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cOnce we\u2019re the same age; perhaps we could see where things go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!?\u201d louder than she probably intended, Kat looked at me and said, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not joking right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t think Kat was attractive; because she is. I just felt weird thinking about her that way; because, as she said, I thought of her as my little sister. We\u2019re talking about a girl who I taught how to ride a bike. The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized there wouldn\u2019t be any issues once we were the same age. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, Kat; I\u2019d like to go out with you sometime.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cJust promise me one thing; you won\u2019t get mad if, for one reason or another, one of us decides that the two of us dating is weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could agree to that.\u201d Leaning over, Kat kissed me on the cheek and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat left a few minutes later; walking past Mom and a nurse as they came into the room. Once Kat was out of earshot, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cKat seemed pretty happy; is there something I should know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now, Mom.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Gesturing to the nurse, Mom said, \u201cAre you ready for the procedure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse helped me into the wheelchair, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for the last four years, Mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I briefly wondered what if was all for, but then I remembered this was an experimental procedure; Dr. Sheppard probably wanted everything recorded to look over later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse, an attractive woman in her early 30s, lifted me from the wheelchair onto the exam table.  After turning me over onto my back, she started strapping me down.  As she worked, she said, \u201cThese are only in case you have a reaction to the medicine; it wouldn\u2019t do for you to injure yourself because of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stood by in the corner as Dr. Sheppard walked into the room; holding a clear box with what looked to be four syringes filled with a reddish-orange liquid.  While the nurse finished strapping me to the table, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cNow Marcus, the procedure is going to be quite simple; I\u2019m going to inject the serum into four locations on your spine.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cIf all goes well, they should go about repairing the damage done by the accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to hurt, will it?\u201d wincing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly the biggest fan of needles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t feel a thing, my boy.\u201d Grabbing the first syringe, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cNow, if you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m going to inject the first needle just below your neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready, Doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure itself only took about 20 minutes; thankfully there were no complications.  Once he was finished, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cThe injections are all finished, Marcus.\u201d Coming around the table, he knelt down to where I could see him.  \u201cI included a mild sedative in there as well, so don\u2019t be surprised if you start to feel a little drowsy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Dr. Sheppard.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI really hope this works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse waited a few minutes before removing the straps holding me to the table.  Once that was finished, I was brought out of the room; to find Dad, Mom, and Glenn standing there. Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything went off without a hitch, Kent.\u201d Walking out of the room, behind me, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cWith any luck, he\u2019ll start to regain sensation in his legs later this afternoon.  If all goes according to plan, he\u2019ll be taking his first steps tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for everything, Kevin.\u201d Tearing up, Mom hugged Dr. Sheppard and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve given my baby his life back.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The sensation slowly started to travel up my legs; reminding me of what it felt like to have my arm fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to keep my mind off the sensations; watching more shows on my tablet.  I made until just before 5:00 before the sensations started to feel a little painful.  I started to panic a little, so I reached over and pushed the call button on the side of my bed.  It wasn\u2019t long before a nurse, the one that brought me to the procedure room, came running into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like my legs are being stabbed with needles.\u201d Wincing, I said, \u201cIs that normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing you need to worry about, Marcus.\u201d  A vague smile started to form on the nurse\u2019s face.  \u201cThat\u2019s just your legs starting to repair themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been so caught up with the alien sensations I\u2019d been feeling, that I hadn\u2019t stopped to consider what they meant.  \u201cAre you serious?\u201d tearing up, I looked at the nurse and said, \u201cTh-The procedure worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly looks that way.\u201d Her smile growing bigger, the nurse said, \u201cI\u2019ll page Dr. Sheppard; then I\u2019ll go find your folks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse ran out of the room, I started crying.

Having not eaten anything since last night, I wasn\u2019t surprised at all when I ate an entire 12-ounce steak in 5 minutes.  That got me a look from Glenn, who said, \u201cGlad to see your appetite hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sheppard said I have to eat a lot of protein to regain my muscle mass.\u201d With a grin, I said, \u201cSo enjoy being able to outrun me while you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Chuckling, Glenn said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you just because you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop calling me your little brother; you make it sound like I\u2019m way younger than you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAt most, I\u2019m only 5 or 6 months younger than you now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well you\u2019re still younger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say something in response, but I was suddenly interrupted by the ringing of my cell phone.  Putting my fork down, I reached over and grabbed it off the table.  A smile appeared on my face the instant I saw it was Kat calling.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey Kat, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of Kat\u2019s name, I noticed Mom starting to usher Dad and Glenn out of the room.  Mom followed suit just as Kat said, <br>\r\n\u201cNot much, I just wanted to see how the procedure went.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe procedure went fine; didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cAfter a while though, I did start to feel a tingling sensation in my legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d sounding concerned, Kat said, \u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tempted to string Kat along for a few moments, but I quickly figured she wouldn\u2019t like that very much.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cThe procedure worked; I was able to wiggle toes about an hour ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to pull the phone away from my ear as Kat\u2019s scream was almost deafening.  After a moment, she calmed down and said, \u201cIt worked?  I-It really worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it worked.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI have the use of my legs again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, Kat said, \u201cI was so worried that it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sheppard wants me to take my first steps tomorrow morning.\u201d Pausing, thinking about what I was about to say, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like it if you were there to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?  I wouldn\u2019t miss this for the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt some butterflies in my stomach when I heard that.  With a smile, I said, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll text you the details tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good to me.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ll really happy for you, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Kat.\u201d Grinning from ear to ear, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung the phone just as Mom walked back into the room.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI take Kat was excited?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are still ringing she screamed so much.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be here tomorrow to watch my first steps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, honey.\u201d Coming next to the bed, Mom said, \u201cDo you have a problem with your father, Glenn and I going home for the evening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, go right ahead.\u201d Yawning, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With everyone watching, and Kat even recording on her phone, the physical therapist brought me over to a set of horizontal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she helped me to my feet, she said, \u201cOkay Marcus, now hold on tightly to those bars.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to let go of you, and I want you to try putting your weight on your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as I was told; although my legs wobbled a little, and wouldn\u2019t straighten out; I was standing on my own.  That got me applause from everyone in the room, even from another patient nearby.  \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just jump right in, don\u2019t you.\u201d Smiling, the therapist said, \u201cNow I\u2019d like to see how far you can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath, and put my right foot in front of my left. Then, I put my left in front of my right. I did it again before my legs gave out under me.  I wanted to cry as the therapist helped me back into the wheelchair. \"Three steps,\" I said. \"Three lousy steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s three more steps than you\u2019ve been able to do for years.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to climb Mount Everest on your first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group came over and hugged me.  With tears in her eyes, and her voice cracking, Mom said, \u201cMy baby is walking again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say that I\u2019d only gone three steps, but I realized that she and the therapist were right.  I may have stumbled, but I had been walking before that.  My tears of humiliation were replaced by tears of triumph.  The last person to congratulate me was Kat.  She hugged me tightly and gave me a kiss on the cheek, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you, Marcus.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That left only Glenn in the room with Kat and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, I noticed Kat giving Glenn a weird look.  I was about to ask what was going on, when she said, \u201cGlenn, do you think you could give Marcus and me some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn turned and left without saying a word; leaving me alone in the room with Kat.  Sitting up in the bed, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a terrible mistake yesterday; I never should have said I had feelings for you.\u201d  Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t think of me that way; so I\u2019d like it if you just forget I said anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to yesterday after Kat came clean about her feelings for me.  I was still shocked to learn that she felt that way about me.  \u201cLook, Kat, I meant what I said yesterday.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to go on a date with you; so long as our parents are okay with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they be okay with it?\u201d chuckling, Kat said, \u201cMy mom\u2019s known for months that I had feelings for you.  I even talked to her about it last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Really?\u201d shocked, I said, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wants me to be happy; and if being with you will make me happy, then she\u2019s all for it.\u201d Blushing, Kat said, \u201cIt\u2019s just my dad we\u2019ll have to convince.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing concerned, I said, \u201cIs that going to be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not; it\u2019s just that he\u2019ll probably ask if we ever did...anything before this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe <i>haven\u2019t</i> done anything before this.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHell, the closest I\u2019ve ever been to seeing you naked was seeing you in a bikini at the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d raising an eyebrow, Kat said, \u201cDid you like what you saw?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019d be lying if I said no.</i> \u201cI\u2019ll just say it became clear you were no longer that little girl who used to make me check her closet for monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil that point Kat had been sitting rather close to me; after my response, she leaned back in the chair.  \u201cThe two of dating is going to be weird, isn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just...you and I have that brother/sister dynamic.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cThe idea of us dating just seems weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really don\u2019t know what came over me at that point.  Leaning forward, I pulled Kat towards me and kissed her on the lips.

With a smile on my face, I drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning feeling fantastic.

After rinsing off, I stepped out of the shower and grabbed a nearby towel.  It was then that Glenn knocked on the door.  \u201cAre you about done in there?  My back teeth are floating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned in annoyance; only Glenn could find a way to ruin my first shower in years.  \u201cI\u2019ll just be a few more minutes.\u201d  At least, that\u2019s what I <i>thought</i> I said; because, to my confusion, the voice coming out of my mouth wasn\u2019t mine.  Clearing my throat, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to use the downstairs bathroom, Glenn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, that definitely wasn\u2019t my voice; in fact, it sounded almost like a girl\u2019s voice.  I quickly realized how right I was when, after wiping the condensation off the mirror, I came face to face with the reflection of a naked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately opened my eyes and found that I was back in bed, and judging from the darkness outside, it was still early morning.

Climbing out of bed, I went to lie down on the floor in front of my TV; lying on my stomach and crossing my legs as I did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the episode progressed, I found myself fixating more on one of the male leads than anything else.  Watching him kissing one of the female characters, I found myself imagining it was me he was kissing.  <i>I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind a guy with a little facial hair.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even realize what just went through my mind, the door opened and Glenn walked into the room.  \u201cCome on, Marcus; we\u2019ve been calling you for the last 5 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d snapping back to reality, I realized what time it was.

Glenn was texting someone on his phone, while I was looking out the window.  I was deep in thought; thinking about some of the strange things that had happened since I\u2019d been home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was the dream where I saw myself as a girl; followed by the two instances where I found myself interested in a guy on TV.  I knew that going through puberty caused all sorts of changes, but I\u2019d assumed I would experience the same puberty I had the last time.  I\u2019d never dreamt I was a girl and certainly never found myself interested in guys; so I was at a loss to explain why that was the case this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it didn\u2019t appear to be something I should worry about, I decided not to worry about it.  As the car came to a stop at the light, I felt a tap on my shoulder.  Turning around, I saw Glenn looking at me.  \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking your hair looks longer.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cAre you growing it out or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t put much thought into my hair since I came home; but, after Glenn mentioned it, I had to admit I was curious why it was growing so quickly.  It was now down to just below my ears; to the point where even Kat mentioned it while we were making out on the couch.  \u201cSo what if I am growing it out?  Boys are allowed to have long hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, I was just asking a question.\u201d Taken aback, Glenn said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bite my head off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back from the front seat, Mom said, \u201cMarcus, sweetie, if you\u2019d like I can help you manage that hair.  There\u2019s more to it than you might think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we walked through the dining room, I was surprised to see that it wasn\u2019t that busy.  The hostess left after giving us our menus; we were discussing what we wanted when the waiter, a boy a few years older than me, came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the other side of the table, between Mom and Dad, he smiled and said, \u201cGood evening, folks; my name is Jeremy and I\u2019ll be your waiter this evening.\u201d  Looking around the table, he said, \u201cCan I start you off with some drinks and appetizers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was the last to give Jeremy my drink order.  When he got to me, he smiled as he looked at me.  I swear I felt my heart starting to beat faster.  I found myself unable to say or do anything for a few seconds; as I just stared at him.  It was only after Glenn smacked my shoulder did I snap out of it.  \u201cSorry, can I have a diet coke please?\u201d blushing a bit, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to look after my figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy let out an awkward chuckle as he wrote down my order.  Once he left, Glenn looked at me and said, \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way you were just staring at Jeremy, it was disturbing.\u201d Pausing, Glenn said, \u201cIt\u2019s the same way Kat was staring at you on the couch today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Clearing my throat, I said, \u201cI-I wasn\u2019t staring at him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlenn\u2019s right, sweetie; you were staring at him.\u201d Leaning closer, Mom said, \u201cNow isn\u2019t an appropriate time; but if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to discuss, we\u2019ll listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized what Mom was referring to.  In shock, I looked at her and said, \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Mom; I\u2019m not gay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright if you are, Marcus; we won\u2019t love you any less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting annoyed at this point, so my emotions got the better of me.  \u201cI\u2019m dating Kat, Mom; I\u2019m not gay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few patrons were starting to look at us, so Dad chimed in.  \u201cCan we discuss this later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to calm down before Jeremy came back; as I didn\u2019t want to ruin dinner.  When Jeremy came back, he served everyone their drinks.  Once that was finished, he said, \u201cWould you folks like some appetizers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mom and Dad looked over the appetizer menu, Jeremy inadvertently placed his hand on my shoulder.  I have absolutely no idea why I did it, but I suddenly leaned over and rested my head on his hand.  \u201cMarcus!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately jumped up, startled by Mom raising her voice.  Looking at me, Jeremy said, \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel a little uncomfortable here; I-I don\u2019t think I can be your waiter anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy walked off while everyone in the room just stared at me; making me feel six inches tall.  Dad got to his feet and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can apologize to Jeremy.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, Marcus; but I think you need to go splash some water on your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently got up and made my way to the bathroom; ignoring the stares from the other patrons as I went by.  Walking into the bathroom, I went to the sink and splashed some water on my face.  As much as I hated to admit it, there was definitely something wrong with me.  <i>Why am I so interested in guys all of a sudden?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplashing myself with water again, I looked at the mirror and said, \u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to ask you the same question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the sudden noise, I jumped a little bit.  Turning around, I saw a woman in her late 30s standing outside one of the bathroom stalls.</span></div></div>",

I ran to catch up with him, saying, \u201cDad, I can...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Marcus; we\u2019ll discuss this when we get home.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A worrisome thought entered my mind; what if the changes continued, would I turn <i>into</i> a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so deep in thought that I barely heard a knocking at my door; followed by mom\u2019s voice, \u201cMarcus, sweetie, we\u2019re going out for breakfast; do you want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s the last thing I need right now, to go outside looking like this.</i>  \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well, Mom; I think I\u2019ll stay here and rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d trying the door, and finding it locked, Mom said, \u201cDo you want me to check your temperature?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d realizing how loud I\u2019d responded, I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine; I\u2019m just going to go back to bed for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be back in an hour or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was sure the house was empty, I went back to the bathroom to get another look at myself.  <i>Yup, they\u2019re getting bigger.</i>  As I stood in front of the mirror, I came up with a way to hide my breasts.  I had a classmate back in my sophomore year; one who was transitioning to male.  He\u2019d used an elastic wrap to hide his breasts; I quickly decided that was what I was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that there was nothing at the house I could use to bind my chest.  That meant I would have to venture outside, and I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about that prospect.  Walking back to my room I got dressed in a pair of baggy shorts and a t-shirt; which I tucked inside the shorts in the hopes of hiding how wide my hips had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tucking my hair, which was now just above my shoulders, under a baseball cap; I went downstairs.  The pharmacy was a good 2 miles away and the quickest way for me to get there would be to ride my bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the garage, I hoped that I wouldn\u2019t run into anyone I knew on the way there.  Suddenly having breasts wasn\u2019t something I wanted to explain.</span></div></div>",

After four years, and a few blocks to refresh my memory, it was as if I\u2019d never stopped riding.  <i>I guess that\u2019s three things that have worked out for me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to the pharmacy a short time after they opened and, after parking my bike, I walked inside.  It was then I realized that while I knew what I was looking for. I had no clue where to find it.  That meant I\u2019d need to ask someone for help. <i>I hope nobody I know needs a prescription.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck must\u2019ve been on my side; because thankfully there was no one at the pharmacy.  I walked up to the counter where the pharmacy rep, a man in his late 40s, came over.  I noticed the first thing he looked at was my chest, which I not so subtly tried to cover up.  \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d In a hushed tone, I said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a chest binding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured he must deal with this request often, because he gave me a sympathetic nod.  He walked out from behind the counter and led me to an aisle for speciality items.  It was there I found several different types of binders hanging on the wall.  I looked at the various options and settled on one that resembled a sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I grabbed the package from the wall, impressed that such a thing could possibly help me, the pharmacy rep looked at me and said, \u201cMy son transitioned when he was your age; I hope it goes well for you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking him, I quickly paid for the binder and left.  The entire ride home I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I, too, was transitioning; only in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home took a little longer than I would have liked, due to an accident, but I managed to get home safely; secure in the knowledge that my family wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019d gone anywhere, or even know why.  After making sure the garage looked just as it had before I left, I went upstairs to my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off my shirt, I immediately saw that my breasts had grown even larger in the interim.  \u201cI look like a dresser with the top drawer pulled out.\u201d Opening the package, I said, \u201cThankfully, that\u2019s why I bought this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad I not been so focused on getting the binder over my head, I would\u2019ve heard the front door opening.  But I wasn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t; which was the exact moment Mom walked into my room.  \u201cMarcus, let you take a quick look at...Oh my God!\u201d</span></div></div>",

As I sat in the backseat with Glenn, I was annoyed that Mom didn\u2019t give me the chance to bind my chest.  Even while wearing one my loosest shirts it was obvious that I had breasts, and they bounced uncomfortably with each bump my dad drove over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only option I had to keep them from bouncing around was to cross my arms across my chest.  \u201cDad, can you not drive over every bump you see?\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cMy chest is unsupported and they\u2019re bouncing all over the place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t make any promises, Marcus; but I\u2019ll try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad did what he could to lessen the bumps; it helped but it didn\u2019t make the problem go away.  As we turned onto the main road through town, I looked over and saw Glenn...well, just staring at me.  It was bad enough having breasts, I didn\u2019t want my brother looking at me like he was.  \u201cWould you stop looking at my breasts, Glenn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I-I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Blushing, Glenn looked me in the eyes and said, \u201cWha-What does it feel like when they, y\u2019know, bounce around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d feeling incredulous, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s like having two grapefruits attached to my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow sensitive are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to lose my cool, but Mom beat me to it.  \u201cGlenn Anthony Scott, don\u2019t ever let me hear you speak that way again.\u201d  <br>\r\nTurning around, Mom said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s going through enough right now; he doesn\u2019t need your inappropriate comments!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d Looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cSorry Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted an acknowledgment before turning to Mom.  \u201cHow exactly are we going to explain this, Mom?\u201d looking at her, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t exactly walk into the ER and say I\u2019m turning into a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got that figured out, sweetie.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019ll just explain to whoever\u2019s at the counter that my daughter\u2019s experiencing girl troubles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t need to be a genius to know what Mom was referring to \u2013 she was going to tell the ER nurse I was having a bad period.

We were brought to a private room, where I was given a hospital gown to change into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gown did a better job at hiding my waist then anything I had at home; I just wish it did a better job with my breasts.  But, in the end, there\u2019s only so much a hospital gown could do.

While I wasn\u2019t thrilled with the idea, I knew Allison wasn\u2019t going to leave.

By far the worst part was when he gave me a physical exam.  While I trusted Dr. Sheppard not to do anything, I was glad mom was there to support me; even though I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled that she was seeing me naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discovered another change while getting some urine and stool samples for Dr. Sheppard to test; my genitals were smaller.  Once all that was finished, he took a series of x-rays; mostly focusing on my pelvic area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tests were complete, Mom and I were sent back to the room to wait with Dad, Glenn, and Allison.  \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be alright, Marcus.\u201d Trying to sound upbeat, Mom said, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded great, but it was hard not to worry.  What was going to change next?  I looked down at my hands; I could\u2019ve sworn they were more slender, and that my nails were longer.  Am I just being paranoid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like hours passed before Dr. Sheppard came back; although it had only been about 30 minutes.  Closing the door behind him, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cThe tests confirmed what I suspected; Marcus is becoming a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that was coming, but I was still shocked to hear it.  Looking at Dr. Sheppard, I said, \u201cHow is that even possible, Doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to run some more tests to figure that out, but your XY chromosomes have all become XX.  The x-rays I took of your pelvis show what appears to be a uterus and ovaries beginning to develop.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cNo doubt those will develop as your breasts have; I suspect you\u2019ll be completely female within two days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started talking a mile a minute; trying to comprehend what Dr. Sheppard just told us.  During a lull in the shouting, I said, \u201cIs there anything you can do to reverse this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s causing this, Marcus.\u201d Looking at his paperwork, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cThe only thing I can tell you with any certainty is this; based on your age and your level of breast development, I suspect that you won\u2019t grow much taller than you are right now.

No one said a word for almost 10 minutes, and I guess I couldn\u2019t blame them.  I\u2019d gone in for a procedure to get my legs back, and I end up turning into a girl.  My folks insisted they didn\u2019t blame Dr. Sheppard for this but I think they did on some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make up for it, Dr. Sheppard said he would reimburse us for any purchases I needed to make.  On top of that, Allison promised that she and Jamie would provide whatever help they could.  We had just passed the high school when Mom said, \u201cNow that I have your measurements, sweetie, I\u2019ll go buy you some bras and undies.\u201d Looking back at me, she said, \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll want to have a say in what kind of clothes to buy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t given that much thought, but Mom was right; I had to figure out what kind of girl I was going to be.  I was already certain that I wasn\u2019t going to be one of those girly, fashion-obsessed girls; but I doubt I\u2019d get away without having at least some dresses or skirts.  \u201cPerhaps we can go shopping this weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, sweetie.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cPerhaps Kat can come along as well; I\u2019m sure she\u2019d want to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Mom mentioned her name, I hadn\u2019t thought about Kat at all.  How would I possibly tell her about this? We were supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but now I was going to be a girl like her.  \u201cCan I be the one to tell Kat about <i>this</i>?\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be better coming from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Marcus; we\u2019ll let you tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, I was standing in front of my bedroom mirror; naked from the waist up.  Even after the tests confirmed it, I still couldn\u2019t believe that I was going to be a girl.  Seeing the breast binder on my bed, where I\u2019d left it, I went over to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slipped it on over my head, I quipped to myself \u2013 <i>I suppose I\u2019ll have to get used to this.</i>  After putting it on, I looked back at my reflection and was impressed by what I saw.  It didn\u2019t completely hide my breasts, but it certainly did enough to make them less obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was reaching for my shirt when there was a knock at the door.  \u201cMarcus, its Glenn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the shirt on, I walked over and opened the door.  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to see how you were doing.\u201d Looking at my chest, Glenn said, \u201cWow, that binding does a good job hiding your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing well, Glenn; but I\u2019d probably be a little better if you stopped staring at my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d With a nervous smile, Glenn said, \u201cKat\u2019s at the door, she wants to know if you\u2019d like to go to the park.  They\u2019re having a boat race in the lake; she thought it would be fun to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Glenn.\u201d Sitting on the bed, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure seeing Kat is the best idea right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say you ghost her for the next few days.\u201d Sitting next to me, Glenn said, \u201cHow\u2019s she going to feel when you\u2019re suddenly a girl the next time you see her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn did have a point; as much I was wanted to avoid Kat right now, seeing her wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bad as surprising her with this.  \u201cWhat do you think I should do, Glenn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to the park; enjoy your time with her while you figure out how to tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, bro.\u201d hugging Glenn, I said, \u201cThat helps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was an incredibly awkward hug; as, although they were bound, you could still feel my breasts if you pressed against them.  After a moment, Glenn said, \u201cGo have fun with your girlfriend, Marcus.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was glad we were alone; since sitting down would hide the fact the I wasn\u2019t as tall I\u2019d been, just like the binder hid the size of my breasts and my t-shirt hid my narrow waist and child-bearing hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kat laid out the blanket, as we waited for the race to start, I found myself doing a little people watching.  I couldn\u2019t help but picture myself, specifically my new self, in their place.  I saw a woman nearby breastfeeding her baby; the first time I was 13, and still a boy, I would have chuckled at the sight of a bare breast.  The allure of seeing breasts was lessened by the fact that I could now see them whenever I wanted; instead, I found myself wondering if I\u2019d be nursing my own child at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, I found myself looking at a couple of college-aged students; a man and a woman, getting romantic.  I started imagining myself in her place; with those strong arms wrapped around me, those hands on my breasts.  <i>Okay, I guess I have a thing for big muscular guys.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to pull myself out of my fantasies; as I leaned over and kissed Kat.  She was enjoying it more than I was; I was just going through the motions at that point.  I was becoming a girl, and kissing a girl had about as much appeal now as kissing a boy did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I\u2019d been thinking to myself, Kat explored my body with her hands.  It didn\u2019t take long for her to find my binder.  \u201cMarc, what in the world are you wearing?\u201d before I could stop her, she\u2019d lifted my t-shirt.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Marc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed hard; it was the moment of truth.  \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything back at my house.\u201d Standing up, I pulled my shirt back down. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I need to tell you.</span></div></div>",

She was sitting on my bed when I walked into my room topless.  She looked about as shocked as I\u2019d been when I found out.  When she finally found her voice again, all she could say was, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m turning into a girl, Kat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has got to be a joke, right?\u201d looking from my face to my chest, Kat said, \u201cThose have to be fake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me I wish they were, but they\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat reached out to touch my chest in an attempt to prove that the breasts were fake.  While she wasn\u2019t able to prove it I experienced some new and, quite honestly, enjoyable sensations.  I made a mental note to try this out for myself.  After pulling her hands away, Kat looked at me and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have these in the hospital; how could they get <i>this</i> big in only a few days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sheppard thinks my body is experiencing an accelerated female puberty; which explains my figure and my breasts.\u201d Putting my shirt back on, I said, \u201cHe says I\u2019ll be fully female within a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow when you say fully female...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA uterus and ovaries are growing inside me, and my genitals are starting to wither away.\u201d Sitting next to Kat, I said, \u201cOnce it\u2019s done, I\u2019ll be as much a girl as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem surprisingly calm about this; I\u2019d be freaking out if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly I think I\u2019m just in shock; I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll start freaking out at some point.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate any help you can give me; I know absolutely nothing about being a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of person would I be if I said no.\u201d placing a hand on my shoulder, Kat said, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help you, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom and I are planning to go shopping this weekend; perhaps you\u2019d like to come along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSu-Sure, I\u2019d love to come along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly picked up on Kat\u2019s hesitation.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cAre you alright, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was silent for a moment until she got to her feet.  \u201cNo Marcus, I\u2019m not alright!\u201d pacing around the room, she said, \u201cMy boyfriend is turning into a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to my feet as soon as I saw Kat start crying.  I immediately embraced her; an awkward experience for both of us, if only because my breasts were noticeably bigger than hers.  Maybe it was the shock wearing off, or maybe my hormones were out of whack; before I knew it, Kat and I were sharing a tearful embrace.</span></div></div>",

Once she was finished, I looked at my reflection in the mirror.  I had to admit my breasts looked nice in the bra; I just had a problem with the discomfort.  \u201cWill these get more comfortable the longer I wear it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t been my experience; let me tell you, I look forward to letting the girls out at the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little embarrassed about trying the panties next; mostly because Kat was in the room while I did so.  Once I put them on, I was immediately disappointed.  Looking at Kat, I said, \u201cI have less of a bulge than I would\u2019ve liked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well your rear end more than makes up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, I said, \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a nice badonkadonk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my rear in the mirror and realized Kat was right; my butt was much larger than it had been.

They wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice since they were on the pink side, but they fit me.  My boyish looked funny coming out of them, but I knew would change soon enough.</span></div></div>",

Like my hands, they had become dainty and feminine. <i>Not much of Marcus left anymore,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was verified when I took off my pajamas in the bathroom. Between my legs, I was equipped like a 5-year-old. I wasn't confident, either in my aiming skills or in my ability to avoid wetting my fingers, so I sat down, pointing my little man down with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of, I took a shower. I saw that Mom had picked up some body wash, shampoo, and conditioner for me, so I gave them a try. My skin seemed more sensitive, tingling pleasurably with the body wash. My shoulder-length hair felt good with the shampoo and conditioner, too. The drawback was, it took <i>forever</i> to dry my hair, even with a hair dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I was done. I wrapped a towel around my waist, and headed for my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked right into Mom, who pushed me back into the bathroom. \"You are not traipsing around with your breasts hanging out, young lady,\" she said. \"What if your brother had been out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought scared me. \"Sorry, Mom,\" I said. \"I guess I wasn't thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom showed me the ladylike way to tie a towel around myself, and I went to my room.</span></div></div>",

She and Dad were going to set up my new identity with the school board, while Glenn was spending the day with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, Mom,\" I replied. And I would be: I could leave the house in the event of an emergency. I could fend for myself. I wasn't an infant or an invalid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just turning into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just made myself a sandwich when the doorbell rang. It was Kat. \"Wow,\" she said, \"you really <i>are</i> turning into a girl, aren't you, Marc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you doubt me?\" I asked. \"By the way, my name's Cassidy now. It was Mom's maiden name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassidy. It suits you. I knew you were turning into a girl, but you still had Marcus's face yesterday. You hadn't noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed me my face on her phone. It was true: in the hours since this morning, my face had become more feminine. \"Wow. Nobody who saw this face would think I was once a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came over for two reasons, Cassidy. The first is, I thought I'd invite you to have a sleepover at my house. Sort of give you a crash course in being a girl. Besides, when we're in high school, nobody would believe you'd never been to a sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. I'll be there. What's the second reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom wants to take you shopping tomorrow. I know your mom was going to, but my mom might be willing to pick up some things that your mom might not think of for you. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it saves us money, I'm sure Mom will go for it. Four years of customizing everything for someone in a wheelchair, the costs really add up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you tonight.\" She hugged me. \"Are you shorter? We're practically the same height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Sheppard said I might not get above five-six. I guess I'm going under that for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat left, and I went back to my lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just finished my sandwich when the doorbell rang again. Thinking it was Kat again, I didn't look before opening the door. That was how I wound up face to chest with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little lady,\" he said. \"I'm looking for Marcus. Is he home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to explain what happened to me to Eric, so I thought quickly. Luckily, I was always able to think faster than he did. \"I'm afraid he's still in the hospital,\" I said. \"I'm his cousin, Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the next time you see him, let him know his old buddy Eric is looking to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to tell him,\" I said, but I was thinking, <i>Why didn't you come visit me in the hospital, like Kat did?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left,and I breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe it was the height difference between us, but I wasn't 100% sure whether he was looking at my face or my breasts.</span></div></div>",

Allison and Mom were in the corner, talking about the proposal, while Dad was using the bathroom.  Glenn walked back into the room with a glass of water; as he handed it to me, he said, \u201cHow are you doing, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think I\u2019m doing, Glenn?\u201d taking the water, I said, \u201cI get the use of my legs back, but I\u2019ve shrunk to the size of a 10-year-old boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how Kat is going to feel; dating someone that\u2019s practically the same height as her.\u201d Seeing the dumbfounded look on my face, Glenn said, \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised, I overheard you telling her you\u2019d like to go out with her at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make fun of me, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cKat\u2019s a good looking girl; who am I to say you can\u2019t date her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPhew.  I was worried you\u2019d say it was weird\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a <i>little</i> weird; I mean, she\u2019s practically our little sister.\u201d  Pausing, Glenn said, \u201cBut if neither of you has a problem with that, then I\u2019d say go for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few minutes went by before Dr. Sheppard entered the room again.  He was holding a tablet in his hands and had a grim look on his face.  The look told me that he didn\u2019t have good news. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the series of injections had an unintended side effect.\u201d Looking at me and my family, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cIt did repair Marcus\u2019 spine as planned; but instead of making him a 13-year-old again, it\u2019s making him even younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room made an audible gasp. Looking at Dr. Sheppard, worried, I said, \u201cHow much younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf my tests are correct; by this time tomorrow, you\u2019ll be _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I must\u2019ve fallen asleep at some point after getting that unwanted news; because when I woke up, I quickly realized I was no longer in my hospital room.  I tried to look around at my surroundings but found that my body wasn\u2019t responding the way it should.  <i>Oh no; please don\u2019t let me be paralyzed again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort but I managed to turn my head enough to see a baby lying in a crib next to me.  I soon realized where I was, when I discovered that I was in a similar crib \u2013 I was in the hospital\u2019s nursery.  <i>Oh god, I\u2019m a baby again.</i>  I tried to speak in a desperate attempt to get some attention, but found the only noise I could make was a whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly grew frustrated and did the only thing I could do \u2013 I started crying.  I don\u2019t know how long I cried for, but soon enough a nurse appeared above me.  \u201cHello little one.\u201d Lifting me up, she said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I\u2019m not hungry! I\u2019m a teenager, not a baby!</i>  But the only thing I could do was keep crying.  After a few minutes of this, the nurse placed me back in the crib and wheeled me out of the room.  <i>Where is she taking me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon had my answer when I was wheeled into a hospital room.  I could hear voices but had trouble determining who they were.  After a moment, I heard a voice I could identify \u2013 my mom\u2019s.  \u201cIs he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason her voice had a calming effect on me, and I slowly stopped crying.  As the nurse picked me up, she said, \u201cI think he\u2019s probably a little hungry; after all, he\u2019s been through quite an ordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You can say that again.</i>  I figured the nurse would hand me off to mom so she could give me a bottle.  So imagine my reaction when I saw Mom lying in a hospital bed.  She looked different; like she\u2019d gained weight since I last saw her.  As the nurse handed me off to her, Mom said, \u201cIts okay sweetie, Mommy\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy confusion turned to horror when, instead of reaching for a bottle, Mom took out one of her breasts.  <i>Oh god no.</i>  I was powerless to stop her as she slowly guided me towards the exposed nipple.  The memory of me latching on and breast feeding was one I\u2019d give anything to forget.  The fact that I was doing so without even thinking was very disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there I was, being breastfed by my mom, when Glenn appeared in my line of sight.  I focused on him as he looked at me and said, \u201cI bet that wheelchairs looking pretty good right about now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything went dark.  When I could finally see again, I was relieved to find that I was back in my hospital room.  I did get a little worried, however, when I saw Mom standing over me.  Much to my relief, she simply looked down on me and said, \u201cMarcus, sweetie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was quite relieved when I found I was able to talk.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhy does my body feel weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid your...regression is complete; you\u2019re now approximately 14 months old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom reached down to pick me up, I wanted nothing more than for her to be wrong.  Alas, that wasn\u2019t meant to be; while holding me in her arms, she turned to face the mirror.  Staring back at me, clear as day, was the reflection of a horrified looking 14-month-old baby.  Before I knew what was happening, I started crying.</span></div></div>",

Now, not only can't I walk, I've lost control of my bladder and bowels. Forgive me for having a few things to say about it, and be glad I've got control over my tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let what I said slide, and turned back to Mom and Dad. \"Since he's healthy, we can release him into your custody, assuming you have an appropriate seat for your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do,\" Dr. Sheppard said, and handed Dad a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pediatrician nodded. \"Alright, then.

It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize what was in the boxes; sure Mom told me what they\u2019d bought, but seeing the boxes in person just served as a painful reminder that I was now a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of 10 minutes to get everything into the back of the car; Glenn got in the back seat next to me.  Looking at me, he said, <br>\r\n\u201cHey bro, how was your nap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that bad, considering I\u2019m a toddler.\u201d Looking at him, seeing a bottle of soda in his hands, I said, \u201cCould I have a drink of that soda, I\u2019m kind of thirsty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Marcus; you can\u2019t have soda at your age.\u201d Peaking over from the trunk, Mom looked at Glenn and said, \u201cGlenn, there\u2019s some pre-made bottles of formula in the bag behind Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glenn reached for the bag, I said, \u201cHell no, I\u2019m not drinking from a bottle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re 13 months old, Marcus; it comes with the territory.\u201d With a stern look on her face, Mom said, \u201cAlso please watch your language; I don\u2019t want to explain why my 13-month-old is talking, let alone swearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn had retrieved one of the bottles by that point.  Handing it to me, he said, \u201cHere you go, bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the bottle in disgust; there was no way I was going to drink from that.  After a moment, however, my resolve started to dissipate; soon enough, to my embarrassment, I was drinking from the bottle.

After they\u2019d finished baby-proofing the bathroom, they moved on to my bedroom; where they would change it from a teenager\u2019s room to that of a toddler\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all that was going on, I was strapped into a baby walker downstairs.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel like fate was playing a cruel joke on me; the whole reason I\u2019d gone through with the treatments was to get the use of my legs back, only now I\u2019d been regressed to an age where I couldn\u2019t walk even if I wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had just put me in a fresh diaper, so I was set loose once again.  I was rolling around downstairs, checking out the work Dad and Glenn had done.  They\u2019d put corner protectors on everything I could possibly reach, baby proof locks on the cabinets, and a retractable gate across the basement door.  Okay, maybe that last one was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise in the kitchen attracted my attention, so I decided to see what it was.  Thanks in large part to my short baby legs; it took me a few moments to traverse the eight feet from the basement door to the kitchen.  But once I was there, I saw Mom moving some cans from a bag to a shelf in the pantry.  I caught a look at one of the cans as she stacked it on the shelf; it was baby food.  <br>\r\n\u201cMom, do I really have to eat that stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, Marcus.\u201d Continuing to work, she said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve only got four teeth you're not able to eat the same food that you used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that stuff tastes disgusting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re able to eat at your age, sweetie,\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a period of adjustment for all of us; I just ask that you remain patient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there for you to adjust to?\u201d getting at annoyed, I said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who got turned into a damn toddler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your mouth, Marcus.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cEveryone will have to adjust to your new condition, just like we did after your accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the all the baby proofing Dad and Glenn have been doing?\u201d looking up at her, trying my best to sound serious, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize I\u2019m only a toddler physically, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we have people over, and they see you roaming around, they'll expect to see precautions against you getting into anything you shouldn't.

My first clue that something was amiss was when Mom carried me upstairs; I saw several boxes of my things lining the hallway.  <i>Please don\u2019t give that stuff away. </i> Then I saw my bed frame, and mattress, leaning against the wall just outside my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI prepared myself for what was sure to come, but even that wasn\u2019t going to be enough.  Glenn led us into my room, where I saw what they had done.  Now my room wasn\u2019t all that big, it was slightly smaller than Glenn\u2019s, but seeing how empty it was without my bed, my desk, and my TV was just shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated against the wall where my bed had been was a brand new crib, with one of those spinning mobiles attached to it.  <i>Oh god, it\u2019s like they forgot I\u2019m still mentally me.</i>  Next, I saw a motorized swing in the corner, along with what looked like every stuffed animal Glenn and I ever had growing up.  <i>Okay, that\u2019s a nice touch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, in the process of lifting a changing table onto my dresser, said, \u201cWhat do you think, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to come off as being incredulous, but I couldn\u2019t pull it off in my current condition.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this room never belonged to a teenager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had considered setting up your crib in our room, but we thought you wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d getting annoyed, I said, \u201cYou guys did all this without even asking me what I wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Marcus.\u201d Looking at me, worried about my increasingly poor attitude, Glenn said, \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to take care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 18 years old; I don\u2019t need you to take care of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, my emotions grew beyond what I could control, and I started not only crying but kicking as well.  As far as anyone was concerned, I was just a 14 month old having a tantrum; which only served to get me even more riled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cries echoed through the nearly empty room; until Mom managed to get Glenn\u2019s attention.  \u201cGlenn, there\u2019s an unopened package of pacifiers in the bathroom; go get one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn quickly ran out of the room while I continued crying, at one point I even kicked Mom in the mouth.  Glenn returned about a minute later, pacifier in hand.  \u201cHere you go, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the pacifier, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this, Marcus; but you aren\u2019t giving me much choice.\u201d Placing the pacifier in my mouth, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to act like a toddler, then we\u2019re going to treat you like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the pacifier in my mouth was disturbing, but it did have a surprising effect on me.  I slowly calmed down and stopped crying; until I was quietly sucking on the pacifier.  <i>This is so embarrassing, but it does feel right.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was content to suck on the pacifier as Dad appeared in my field of vision.  Looking at Mom, he said, \u201cPerhaps we should let him lie down; he\u2019s had a rough day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Looking down at me, Mom said, \u201cHopefully when you wake up, you\u2019ll be in a better mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyelids had started to droop at that point; as Mom gently lowered me into the crib, tucked me in under a blanket, and put a stuffed giraffe in my hands.  The last thing I remembered before falling asleep was seeing Glenn and my parents looking down at me.</span></div></div>",

Even though I was on my back, I knew that I was alone in the room.  Memories from earlier came back as I lay there; from what had been done to my room, to the subsequent temper tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but I managed to roll over onto my stomach.  After a moment on my stomach, using the sides of the crib, I managed to pull myself up to a standing position.  My legs wobbled a little bit, but I was confident that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught a glimpse of myself in a nearby mirror, and I was taken aback by what I saw.  Wearing nothing but a diaper, and with a pacifier in my mouth, there was no way I\u2019d be mistaken for anything but a toddler.  <i>This is so humiliating; I\u2019m supposed to be in High School, not diapers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bedroom door opened and Mom walked into the room.  She must\u2019ve been watching me through a camera because she wasn\u2019t surprised to see that I was awake.  \u201cThat was quite a tantrum you had earlier, Marcus.\u201d Walking over to the crib, Mom said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t doing yourself any favors, acting like that.  If you act like a baby, we\u2019re going to treat you like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting the pacifier out, I said, \u201cSorry Mom, I-I guess I kind of lost it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a bruised lip that would agree with you.\u201d Picking me up from the crib, Mom said, \u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to get excited about that, as Mom carried me downstairs, but I quickly remembered what that meant \u2013 canned baby food for me, while they got to eat regular food.</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t believe my life\u2019s come to this.  Dipping the spoon into the jar, she was about to feed it to me when the phone suddenly started ringing.  As she got up from the table, Mom called out, \u201cGlenn, could you come in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, please no!</i>  Before I could protest, Glenn came running into the kitchen.  \u201cYeah, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom went to answer the phone, she said, \u201cCould you do me a favor, and feed your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn quickly obliged and sat down across from me.  Grabbing the jar, and spoon, he looked at me and said, \u201cIs widdle baby hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bad enough that I was in this situation; I didn\u2019t need Glenn teasing me about it.  But, as he looked at me with a goofy smile, I decided to have a little fun with him.  I thought back to the few times I had to help feed him, back when he was a baby.  He was one of the fussiest babies that I\u2019d ever seen; more than a few times I had to sample the food just to get him to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I got an idea; I would pretend to be fussy and refuse to eat, in the hopes that he would eat some of the food.  The plan started perfectly; every time he would bring the spoon near my mouth, I would do my best to avoid it.  After a few failed attempts, Glenn was starting to get frustrated.  \u201cMom!  Marcus won\u2019t eat his dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to be patient, Glenn; he\u2019s still getting used to this.\u201d Sighing, covering the phone\u2019s mouthpiece, Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try eating some it yourself; that always worked when you were a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bingo.</i>  A smile formed on my mouth as Glenn slowly, but surely, brought the spoon up to his mouth.  I started to giggle as he ate a spoonful of food; only to stop when he immediately spat it out in disgust \u2013 all over my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know why it happened; maybe I was tired or maybe I was just surprised.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wish I could say that I was ready to face this new challenge: explaining to Kat about are new circumstances. Afterall, I was technically a man at this point. But I wasn't ready by a long shot. I pulled Dad back into the bathroom and had a bit of a breakdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay son?\" My dad asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is just too much going on. I'm not ready to face Kat yet. I haven't processed it myself, nevermind trying to explain it to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad gave me a stern, yet understanding look. \"I know this is a lot son, but you are going to have to face it. You can't hide this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran my hands through my hair frantically and took a deep breathe. \"I know Dad. I will face it. I will have a serious face-to-face conversation with Kat. But I literally found out all this today. I just need some time alone to really come to terms with is all. Just tell her that I will catch up with her tomorrow. Please Dad, I just need some time to adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad studied me for a while. \"If you are sure I can take care of it. But are you okay son? Really ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to immediately answer yes. But I paused and really thought about it. Was I ok? I was fully prepared to spend the next few years re-doing my high school years. Now I was old enough to be past college. Once again my would was being  turned upside down. Just like all those years ago when I woke in a hospital room to find out I was paralyzed. At least this time, the changes were a consequence of my choices. I have made it through a lot. I could walk now at least. I would be ok. I had made it through worse. I looked him in the eyes (which were on my level now), and replied shakily, \"Yes I am...or rather will be ok. I just need..\" My voice trailed off. I didn't know what I needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Dad left to break the break the news to Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned against the bathroom door and slumped down to the floor. Through the door I could hear my dad talking to Kat. I heard him tell her that there were some complications. Yes I was ok but I needed some time. While Kat's voice was too soft for me to make out her words. I could tell that she was upset. I hated the fact that she was upset. A part of me wanted to go to her. To comfort her like I have done so many times before. Times when she got in trouble or was having problems with friends. What was I going to say to her. No I couldn't think about that right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the door open and close. Then I heard my dad's voice \"Son she's gone now. She said she would wait on your call and to let you know she was here for you.  Do you want me to hang around or leave you alone?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at my reflection in the mirror, I instantly noticed that I had shrunk almost two inches since yesterday.  Okay, that\u2019s weird.  As I stood there, staring at the mirror, I tried to explain what I was seeing.  The only logical explanation I could think of was that the serum was returning me to my original 13-year-old height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat on the toilet, relishing the fact that I was doing it on my own, I wondered whether or not I should tell someone about this.  Dr. Sheppard had mentioned there would likely be some unknown side effects from the serum, perhaps this was one of them.  If Dr. Sheppard was hoping to make this procedure readily available, he deserved to know if there was something happening to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after using the toilet, I made my way back to bed.  Once I was sitting in bed, I reached over and grabbed the call button.  An unfamiliar nurse walked into the room a few minutes later.  \u201cIs something wrong, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you have Dr. Sheppard called to my room?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m experiencing a side effect from his serum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, calling Dr. Sheppard turned out to be a good thing.  He was as baffled as I was about what was happening.  He called my folks back to the hospital; by which time I\u2019d shrunk another three inches, making me the same height as a typical 11-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was understandably upset that something like this was happening; after all, Dr. Sheppard assured us there\u2019d be no complications.  Glenn was worried as well; afraid of what else might happen to me.  To her credit, Mom was doing a great job of keeping it together; although I could tell she was an emotional wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Dr. Sheppard will be able to fix this?\u201d a worried look on my face, I said, \u201cIf I get any shorter people will think I\u2019m a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think like that, Marcus; I\u2019m sure Dr. Sheppard will be able to fix this.\u201d Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cIn the meantime, just be grateful that the procedure had its intended effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Sheppard walked into the room a few minutes later; a tablet in his hand and a grim look on his face.  The look told me that he didn\u2019t have good news.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Doc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the series of injections had an unintended side effect.\u201d Looking at me and my family, Dr. Sheppard said, \u201cIt did repair Marcus\u2019 spine as planned; but instead of making him a 13-year-old again, it\u2019s making him even younger.\u201d<br>\r\nEveryone in the room made an audible gasp.  Looking at Dr. Sheppard, worried, I said, \u201cHow much younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf my tests are correct; by this time tomorrow, you\u2019ll be _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",
