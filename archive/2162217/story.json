He is confident and has always had the gift of the silver tongue. Unfortunately, roguish good looks and charm can only get you so far. His business is going under, but who wouldn't want to visist the merchant who has view the Goddesses themselves. What could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay - A bubbley young woman from the Western Islands. She is chubby with a curvy figure. Unlike he many friends and family she is not content with simply enjoying island life. May loves to stay active as much as she likes to eat. But there is something missing in her life. She wants adventure, she wants to explore, she wants to do things that few dream of. So it is only natural that she should perform a pilgramage to see the Goddesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlfric - A small 5ft tall young man from the Frozen North. He is in fair shape and has golden blond hair, but he is short in both stature and stamina. His fellow villagers often belittle him for not representing the typical strong northerner. His parents named him Ulfric expecting a tall warrior, rather than a short potato farmer. His family has arranged for him to marry a young woman named Helga. A bulging, bulk of a woman who pushes little ulfric around regularly. He hopes a Pilgramage will not only take him away from Helga and his village (before the wedding), but maybe when he returns he will have earned some respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade - The daughter of a lesser noble family. Her plump overwieght frame is sculpted from a sedetary life. She loves to sleep all day, then feast and party all night. She is used to the finer things in life. However that life is tied to her family name, \"Boing\". They require a boost to their social status, by sending their youngest daughter on a Pilgrimage to see the Goddesses. Reluctantly she accepts this \"honour\", though not without taking a carriage and servent with her. If all goes well this should be an easy trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was born and had lived the entirety of his young life in the southern merchant kingdoms, where he learned of his gift of speech and barter while on the travels with his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, Vauxhall Caravans was one of the most profitable trading companies in the southern kingdoms. However, after the tragic death of Richard\u2019s parents a number of years ago during a highway raid by criminals, the company had fallen on hard times under his administration. People stopped coming to them for trade, mainly because they saw the attack as a bad omen from the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, eager to rebuild the reputation of the family business and not fall into financial destitution, Richard used the last reserves of funds to buy an three wagons full of food. One last make or break trip. Destination: Mt. Obessa. A pilgrimage to the patron Goddess Plumb will negate the negative aura surrounding the name Vauxhall, and an offering will ensure he would be stable and comfortable for the rest of his days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the journey will be easier said than done. Many people make the pilgrimage to Mt. Obessa each year. Not everyone makes it to the destination, and fewer still ever come back home. Their are many paths from the southern kingdoms to the home of the pantheon, each one with their own individual perils and pitfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first path may be the least detrimental to Richard\u2019s health, but one of the most dangerous to his stores of food. The path takes those who travel it through a series of towns and villages populated with Centaurs. In Richard\u2019s experience, the nomadic tribes are nice enough, never ruffling any feathers so to say, but they are known for their gluttony. His food may not be safe from their clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second path will take Richard through the lands of the Orcs, the savage people of the south. They take their worship of Plumb seriously, and many caravans coming this way have been attacked to sate their gluttony further and offer to the Goddess instead. Richard will not let his pilgrimage be derailed by a fantastic tribe, no matter how persistent they follow him or how sharp their weapons of choice may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third path has been rumored to be infested with Oozes, gelatinous blobs of pure gluttony that get bigger and fatter the more they eat. They can shape shift their bodies to lure wary travellers into their graves. They can digest any bio-matter, making them deadly predators. Fortunately, they are slow moving and easily outdistanced. As well, if one willing shares their food with them, they can be rather friendly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth and final path is the most perilous. It\u2019s the fastest to Mt. Obessa, by frequently ravaged by the giants, humanoids of gargantuan proportions. Some ate nice, some are mean, but they are almost always hungry. Many foolish men and women take this path, boasting of their brawn and intellect before leaving, only to become another layer of fat on some giant\u2019s frame. Will Richard be one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices, so little time. Which path will put silver tongued friend travel?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe get a hired hand or two.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The old village of Hoov was built at the far end of a grove that bordered on a dense and wild woodland, with a populace comprised of mainly Centaurs, but also some humans. It was built around a tall and imposing stone library, apparently a structure of great importance to the Centaur Race and the history of the silent hamlet. The settlement itself, while regular and unremarkable from far away, is actually quite imposing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spruce wood rooftops, the pinewood walls, and the dominating presence of so much untamed forest put visitors on edge. Richard remembered the first time he had made a stop in Hoov, back when he was still an apprentice to his parent\u2019s trading company. He thought the place so menacing at the time, but now he knew better. Despite its aggressive appearance, the Centaurs and Humans living there were jovial and friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fat. The people of Hoov, mainly the Centaurs, were all incredibly fat, along with jovial and friendly. They were a nomadic people, traditionally speaking, wandering from place to place in search of more food to eat. However, Hoov was different. From what history tells, the whole place was founded only more than half of a century ago when a number of humans shared their experience with farming. Since then, they set up a farm in the area and settled down. Then they began to gather herbs from the neighboring forest than they began to hunt animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while they ate, and ate, and ate. Richard would have to keep his stores of food on heavy watch while he was in the village. Almost all of them were perfectly well fed, but some wanted to be more than others. After crossing the river bridge and past through the town gates, he spurred his wagon to a stop along the village square in the center. Now he had to decide his next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the Town Square, a market had been set up around the great, old Library, with people selling various items, mainly foodstuffs, to others. Perhaps it would be best for him to peruse the locale, see if anyone else was willing to join him on his pilgrimage to Mt. Obessa. Plus, while his coffers were limited, it wouldn't be unwise to see if any merchant had something he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, then again, leaving his caravan unattended was a recipe for mischief. A more sensible option would to just check in to the local inn and rest for the night, preferably with a window of the street. Boring, but practical, and perhaps he could still have his amusements with a point of beer at the tavern below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, perhaps he should just leave the small village of Hoov. He had made good time getting here, and he was sure that the next town was close enough. If he left now, he would get there by sunset. The forest had a share of danger as well, although. What to do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Richards decision to venture through the land of giants was one based on time. If he was going to save his reputation and his make his fortune he would need to take risks and live with the outcomes. With his decision made and his course set Richard set off for the Mt. Obessa early the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey from his manor to the edge of his village was simple and quick, while the adventure from the village gate and into the night was more or less boring. The next few days would remain boring, until he reached the border of his kingdom and entered the realm of giants. The terrain of the Giants Realm was both rocky and filled with tall timbers, and due to this terrain the path Richard was forced to get off his horse and guide the beast through the tall trees and over large rocks. The journey through the giant pines lead Richard and his beast into a shadowy world, where light barely shined, and terror appeared in every corner and bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually day gave away to twilight and Richard knew he should stop and set up camp. Minutes into making his fire the sun had complete set on the horizon, leaving Richard alone in a mysterious forest, but  as the young merchant sat by his fire he thought he heard a sound. A low thumb that grew louder and louder with each passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Richard thought the sound was all in his head, but then he noticed how nervous his horse was becoming, and the earth seemed to tremble with each step. Moving as fast as he could, Richard reached for his water-skin and immediately dumped water on his fire, snuffing out the flame and sparks. Richard then moved over to his horse and tried to calm her down, wondering what direction the giant was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy\" Richard whispered running his hand down the length of the horses mane. As his horse began to calm down, Richard struggled to pierce the darkness with his wondering where the giant might come from, and it was during that moment of searching that Richard saw it...or rather her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right, Richard heard a loud thump and when looked to the sound source he saw a light in the distance. The light was coming from a torch, a torch made from the remains of a branch as thick as Richards leg, and it was being held by a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard felt a twist in his stomach as he watched the mighty creature walk past him. The torch light gave an outline to the giant's features and face. From where Richard stood, he figured the giant was somewhere between 18 to 20 feet tall, with long meaty legs, thick arms, and stomach that was bulging over what appeared to be a loincloth. Richard stared at the giant a while longer and saw that it was a woman, and she had the largest breasts he had ever seen. The giants face appeared human enough, with long hair hanging down her back, but her facial features remained hidden in the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard thought about sneaking over to the giant and get a better look at her face, but fear and doubt kept Richard from doing foolish, and it was probably for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of still breathing and living terror, the giant had passed. Richard let a deep breath of relief believing he was safe, but that belief was shattered when felt something large wrap around his body and hoist him into the air. Whatever had taken hold of Richard was strong and had a tight grip around Richards arms and torso. Richard felt himself being hauled upwards until he found himself being held up to face of a giant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ahead of Richard shared a striking resemblance to a human, no horns or fangs, just to large green eyes and long flowing golden hair. The giant looked at Richard for a moment, staring into his eyes, and as she stared Richard sized the woman up. She was over 20 feet tall and had a pair shape body that reminded Richard of a maiden he was sweet on back in his village. The maiden from his village weight well over 400 pounds and had an ass that men adored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard could only imagine how much this woman weight and he could pray he would not end up in her stomach. Richards prayers were answered when he found himself being shoved in between the giants massive breasts. Richard was shoved face-first into the giants chest and held in place by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant began to move and when she did Andrew heard his horse call out in retaliation to being picked up, along with his wagon of goods being hoisted into the air. The giant began to move and with step Richard could only pray to the Goddess that he would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Obessa is a man. It\u2019s certainly been a very long time since one came up these parts, the others are in for a surprise when they see you.\u201d Richard began to shake and quiver in fear against the supple molding of the giant\u2019s cleavage. It was warm and plusher than any pillow or mattress, yet he still felt chilled to the bone and wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled his body around the breast fat so that he could at least face his captor. \u201cWh-where are you going to take me?\u201d Richard finally mustered up enough courage to speak up with a stutter, fearful for his life and eager to escape the situation he found himself in. \u201cI-I have to get to Mt. Obessa to o-o-offed tribute to the Goddess Plumb!\u201d The giantess took the time to shoot him an incredulous gaze before she realized he was being serious and began to laugh. He swore he saw the clouds he dispersed from her guffawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis tiny little thing?\u201d The Giantess hoisted up his wagon of goods along with his trusted horse up into the air with an open palm. To Richard, it was the accumulation of the last remaining material wealth in his entire world, but to her...it barely registered as a snack. \u201cYou poor soul, did you honestly think this meager little push cart would get you a divine blessing? You must be very, very stupid indeed.\u201d She gave her latest catch a cruel wink before, to his horror, she lifted the wagon and horse above her gaping maw and dropped it onto her fat tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Was all Richard could say to what he was seeing as the Giantess effortlessly began to chew and munch on his only hope to live a decent business. That was it, he was finished. His eyes move down as noticed the remnant pulp travel down her throat in a bulge, before disappearing beyond the canyon of her breasts. \u201cI\u2019m...oh Plumb I\u2019m ruined\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come, now, don\u2019t be so dramatic!\u201d The Giantess began her trek once again, waving off the misery her man was feeling at the moment. \u201cI mean, you still got me, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m not as big and fat as Goddess Plumb, but still being enough to keep someone as small as you trapped in my boobs.\u201d She let out a smirk and smacked the surface of her tits to jostle her tiny into submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard wanted to scream. His make or break pilgrimage to Mt. Obessa was ruined, his wagon was obliterated, his horse was dead, he was being kidnapped against his will to who knows where, and to top it off, he was being chastised for complaining about it. He wanted to scream, but by the time the jiggling of the Giantesses boobs went still, all he could peep out was a low sentence. \u201c...please be gentle with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde Giantess had stopped in front of a large boulder that was blocking the entrance to her cavern home. She hip-checked the massive rock on its side, making it tumble out of her way. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have all that much experience with you men, so I can\u2019t promise you much.\u201d She gave her massive mammaries another swat with a feminine giggle to silence him. Awfully needy, these tiny things are she thought to herself. Might not even be worth the trouble. \u201cOh yeah, my name\u2019s Stella, by the way. Make sure not to forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked up into Stella\u2019s eyes, wanting to hope that she would be a gentle giant, one that would take pity on him and help him complete his Pilgrimage and get back home. But the look in her eyes squashed out any hope left in his heart. She looked at him like he wasn\u2019t even a person, just a minuscule thing that happened to catch her attention. She subconsciously ran her tongue over her lips at the sight of the poor little man she had in her grasp. He did not think that was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you to my friends in the morning, for now, it\u2019s just gonna be you and me.\u201d Richard craned his head to investigate Stella\u2019s cavern home. Strangely, it looked warn and rather cozy, with little touches here and there to make the grey stone the color of golden wheat. There were other, smaller caves that served as rooms connected by tunnels, but the biggest room and the one they were in was obviously the kitchen. He had to give her credit, her decorating style was superb. \u201cLet\u2019s get you settled in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard gave out a yelp as Stella\u2019s fat fingers fished him out from his perch along her bosom and placed him down on the countertop of the kitchen Island. \u201cGah, give me more warning next time you do that!\u201d He exclaimed as he cracked his neck. Her grip was strong on his small frame, leaving the place where she had grabbed him sore as hell. \u201cSo, this is where you live? It\u2019s...nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Stella placed her chubby hands upon her hips in a sort of amused tone of voice. \u201cAnd what would a tiny man like you know about interior decoration? I just assumed you all lived in wooden boxes on the dirt.\u201d Richard glared at her. She was trying to get on his nerves, see how far she could push him before he would need to be punished for outlandish behavior. Well, too bad for her. He was determined to be as cool as a cucumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...I suppose now is the time to get to know one another.\u201d Stella mused, pulling up a chair presumably made from the same impossible timber just outside to sit her fat ass down on it. She placed her elbows on the same countertop Richard was on and clasped her hands against her cheeks. \u201cYou already know my name. Tell me yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...a-alright.\u201d Richard stammered in agreement. The next half an hour went by with Stella and Richard exchanging information about each other. Stella learned his name, now she could stop calling him a little man. She learned about his parent\u2019s caravan company, about how he had the biggest wooden box on the ground...and how his parents had left. Of how the Pilgrimage was supposed to bring good fortune to the family name again. \u201c...I guess life just had other plans.\u201d He lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard learned about Stella, about her own family that she had lost, although she wasn\u2019t as despondent as her man about it. They weren\u2019t the best people, always paying more attention to their food than to their daughter. She didn\u2019t say how they died, but it was clear she was happy that they did. She talked about her friends a great deal. Some of them sounded like sweet angels while others were described as absolute monsters. He assumed that Stella was somewhere in between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a damn shame that you didn't rope any other of your kind on that silly pilgrimage of yours.\" Stella rose from her face platter after she decided she had enough information about Richard for now. \"Truly a pity. I would've liked a few more tinies, but I guess I shouldn't be greedy. Some poor women here have gone their entire lives without bagging a man. I should count myself lucky to have found one. And you should consider yourself lucky that you have the great privilege of meeting a goddess such as myself... You do consider it an honor, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes--tremendous honor!\" Richard said, not wanting to upset her. \"But...like I was saying...you're not the Goddess I was looking for.\" Stella glared at him with a brief stint of anger before letting out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, just maybe mind you, I don't want you to get all hopeful...I'll let you go.\" Richard blinked. Was she being serious? \"If, and only if, however, you do a good enough job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...A good enough job of what?\" Richard echoed, confused. </span></div></div>",

Despite the two before him being his birth parents you would be hard pressed to see the relation between them and their offspring. His father, a stoky muscular, man and his mother, a tall amazon of a woman had frozen mid meal. Loaves of bread and hunks of meat inches away from their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken but the thunderous laughter. Chewed food sprayed out accross the table as the two forgot themselves. Ulfic sat awkwardly, unsure what to do during this situation.

You want to be a Pilgrim?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlfrice nodded sternly, afraid that his voice would crack if he spoke his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this might be a problem with Helga and her kin right?\", his father questioned. Ulfric once again nodded. \"It's up to you to tell her son, that's your duty seeing as you cannot marry on a Pilgrimage. But you have our approval\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlfric's mother stood towering above both him and his father. She strode around the table and lifted her son into a bear hug. \"I am so proud of you son. You can sort it out with Helga tomorrow but for now we feast\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did. Ulfric ate with unusual gusto and slept well. The next morning he pack his supplies and stepped out to see Helga. How will she react to the news?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ulfric gulped as the titanic woman before him struck an imposing figure in the doorway of her cottage. She glared down at the short man. Her bulging arm lent against the door frame taking no interest in hiding her fury at being disturbed early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\", she sighed causing her breasts to bulge out before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUflic managed to stammer, looking past her mountainous breasts and attempting to look her in the eyes. \"I-I have t-to tell you something\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga did not answer, she merely shifted her weight and thumped her hands down onto her hips. The impact bithed a ripple through her bodies layer of fat. Ulfric knows full well that beneath that layer is thick muscle. She struck a stiking figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going on the Pilgrimage!\", he blurted out, not wanted to find out what she would do if she thought he was wasting time. As soon as the words left his lips, he flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga's hug arms wrapped around him, lifting him off the ground with no effort at all. Her grip was crushing. He had been hugged by her before, but this time it was different. It was warmer. Although you could feel her strong muscles, they are not the focus of this act. Instead she pressed yoiu lightly into her soft body. Loosing her grip you realise that she is smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\", you quiz, you have never seen her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. I am so proud of you\". She beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\", honestly shocked at the whole situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were just a weak, spineless little man. Too shy to stand up for himself. I mean you can be cute, kind of like a bunny. But I have never saw you as a man\". Her honesty stuck you, you had always suspected as much. But hearing it was a different thing altogether. \"But going on a Pilgrimage to the Goddesses must mean that there is a spine in there somewhere, most people fail after all. By Gol's Britches even my father refused to go on a Pilgrimage is can be that dangerous. But if you make it back you will be a real man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you mad?\", Ulfric queried hesitantly, \"We won't be able to get married if I am a Pilgrim\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put him down and smiled. \"If I am to be honest I did not want to marry you anyway. I mean that would make me a bit of a laughing stock around here. Even though you are, as I said kinda cute. Like a bunny. But a woman like me needs a man. I just did not have the heart to tell my parents seeing as my father is so close to yours\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" was all Ulfric could mutter. Once again a little hurt to hear his suspiscions out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not why you came here to tell me that in person. Is it?\" her smile changed from joyous pride to something a bit more wry. \"You wanted a little bit of love before your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlfric opened his mouth to speak up, only to be silenced by a thick finger pressed against his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, don't deny it, Helga will look after you\", she cooed before plucking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she take you?</span></div></div>",

Her tongue extended outwards giving the pouch of meat and spices a long, savoring lick, before finally popping it past her lip. She moans in joyous elation as she chewed the the meat bun, rolling its flavors between her cheeks as she rubs her soft, round stomach to ease digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a normal evening Jade would stuff herself silly, taking little care in such things like flavor and preferring volume. Stuffing herself until she was stuffed, before sleeping and resting some more. However, this is not a normal night, for in the morning she will begin a Pilgrimage to see the Goddesses. The journey itself was considered an honor to her and her family. But the Pilgrimage is also an inconvenience, she won't be able to stuff herself silly during the journey ahead and there may be nights were she will only be able to eat one course meals. So tonight she intends to enjoy every mouthful of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump, young noble woman had been enjoying her feast since sunrise. Lounging on a reclined chair she had her servants bring her meal after meal which she was enjoying every bite. After a whole day of lavished, languished feasting her eyes began to grow heavy, falling asleep with a mouth full of mango pastry buns. Her stomach, bloated and exposed to the world still being caressed subconsciously by her manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade awoke to find her personal servants bringing her breakfast. A platter of exotic fruits and small finger pastries, beautifully displayed in the shape of song birds. This platter was being carried by a muscular man, lean and thick. The man's name is Mathis, he came from the Frozen North, as a boy her stowed away in one of her families trade caravan. Jade's father noticed the boy and took him in as a servant. His northern breeding and rationed food had given him a burly body of rippling muscles. One that was not popular here, but Jade found the sight quite alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathis had been followed by her second servant, Mei. A slender, waif of a woman, roughly Jade's age. She had grown up along side Jade as a servant and her best friend. Jade had often thought that is Mei would just eat properly she would have ample beauty, maybe even enough to rival her own. Her slanted eyes, long silky hair and soft voice all would lend themselves to a plump round figure. But alas Mei refused to eat more than her meager fill and remained skinny. The servant girl carried tray holding a glass and a jug of milk for her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the food had been placed before her Jade began to eat once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lady\", began Mei, \"You father has prepared your carriage and says you may leave when ready\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's eye's rolled, \"It's like they can't wait to get rid of me\", she thought, mouth filled with sweet fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He also said that you must only bring one us with you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade gulped, \"I know Jade I have already chosen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Jade choose?</span></div></div>",
