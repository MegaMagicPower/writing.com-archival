            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Mishima Zaibatsu started a war against the world. The rise of the G Corporation opposition resulted in a global trail of carnage. In the fray, a large portion of the Zaibatsu's special military unit, the Tekken Force, defected from the organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amongst those soldiers who defected from the Mishima Zaibatsu. An experienced fighter who once competed in the Iron Fist Tournament over two years ago only to be defeated by Jin Kazama caused by the distraction of Heihachi Mishima. Since the defeat, you returned under the service of the Tekken Force, although you will always be remembered among the ranks as the man that should have defeated the current leader of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Another one of your features that makes you unique is the fact that you carry a rare blood type, one of which has only been carried by very little people throughout the ages. It has been suspected throughout the ranks that you are the only man alive that carries the blood type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the ranks of the Tekken Force, you begun a rebellion to slowly dismantle the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation in order to put an end to the war. However upon hearing about your presence amongst the ranks, Jin Kazama has issued a manhunt specifically for you, just in case you manage to slip past his security and attack him. By Jin's order, you have become one of the most wanted men in all of Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to lose such a loyal soldier, Hiro Kenshin, a ranking officer in the Tekken Force, has organized an operation to transplant your brain into another human's body in order to protect one of his most powerful subordinates. To disguise you completely, you have been chosen to have your brain transplanted into the body of a young woman, around the age of 18, who has been matched with the same blood type as you, which is needed in order to carry out the operation. You are assured that you will be retaught the skills of which you have mastered and that you will be trained to match your current strengths. Willing to make any sacrifice, as long as it meant that it would help put an end to the war, you accept this offer and prepare to undergo the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days later, you have been prepared for the experiment. As you enter the secret Tekken Force laboratory in the South Woodlands, you notice the young girl lying on a platform with a heavy device over her skull. You are led by Hiro Kenshin to the table next to her, where you lay uncomfortably. A similar device is then attached to your head. It felt like having a clamp over your skull. You then feel your wrists and ankles being strapped onto the table tightly as you hear the CPU heat up. You knew that the transformation has begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever in your last moments in your original body, you overhear the sounds of gunfire and bullets smashing against steel. You then hear the sound of engines, similar to that of the deadly Jack units controlled by G Corporation. The screams and cries for help from your partners make your heart race. You begin to struggle as you suddenly hear a ticking sound, but suddenly you feel a sharp, drilling spike slide into the back of your head, and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you wake up, although not the same. Still dazed by the spike in the back of your head you notice the device automatically lift from your head. You open your eyes and you notice that the bright, white walls that was blinded you have all crumbled into pieces, revealing the night sky and the tall trees outside. You look around and see a bunch of soldiers lying in pools of their own blood and the debris of Jack units shattered across the floor. It was as if a bomb exploded in the area. And yet as you see these broken bodies lying on the floor, for some odd reason, you are not distressed. In fact, you are more confused than distressed. Your mind was blank. You couldn't remember a thing from what happened earlier, or who are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look down upon your body and notice an unfamiliar sight. Your muscles have gone. Your uniform has disappeared. They have been replaced by a cute little outfit and the body of a young girl. It felt strange. Your chest has been rapidly enlarged, and all of the hair on your body has vanished, revealing very smooth skin. Upon this sight you panic. You struggle to free yourself from being strapped on the table until you notice a table to your left, which has been completely destroyed. Lying next to the debris is a far more familiar body, but it has been completely ravaged in a similar manner to the other corpses spread across the area. However as much as you recognized it, you could not remember it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear another engine roar. You turn back to your right and you gaze into the red, shining eyes of an injured Jack unit. To you it looked more like a monster because you are very sure that you have never seen such a creation before. Overwhelmed by the mist that shrouds your mind, a tear drips from your eye as the giant robot raises its massive hands into the air, preparing to smash down upon your fragile form. You close your eyes quickly before the impact, but instead you hear the engine collapsing. You open your eyes to see the robot crumble into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously you look around the area until you notice a mysterious figure looming over you. The chaos that was ensuing around you was too overwhelming. You could feel yourself growing weaker as the figure begins to untie you from the table. But wanting to know the name of your savior, you speak your first words in the female's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Don't you worry about me. Let's just get you out of here!\" The figure looms out of the shadow and reveals a beautiful woman of Brazilian origin. You are mesmerized by her beauty as she unstraps you from the table. But as she releases you from your imprisonment, you begin to lose your consciousness. You have become too weak to move yourself, and you once again pass out. The lack of strength was overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regain consciousness, you find yourself in a completely different environment. Inside a small tent, you feel the freedom to move your body around under your own fruition. You ascend to a vertical base, but still you gather no memories from your past, or how you ended up trapped in that destroyed laboratory in the first place. As you let out a big yawn and stretch your arms, with no regard of your new feminine body, you hear the sound of footsteps from outside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear the zip of the tent down until you see the same tall and beautiful woman that rescued you from that giant robot packing a number of items into a small bag. She was wearing silver pants and a glittery and revealing top. You watch as she packs up the items, seemingly preparing for a lengthily journey through the woodland that surrounds her. After incidentally squashing a leaf upon the palm of your hand as you crawl towards the exit of the tent, the woman turns her head and looks down upon you. The smile on her face carried the feeling of pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning babe! Hope you're feeling better!\" Her voice was very comforting as you crawl out of the tent and ascend onto your feet for the first time. You look around, only to see that you are surrounded by trees and fallen leafs. Suddenly the woman hands over a sandwich to you. Confused, you take the sandwich from her and take a bite. \"Don't worry,\" the woman says in a jolly manner, \"There's plenty more where that came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill confused about her presence, you begin to speak to her. \"Thanks. But who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" the woman giggles with slight embarrassment, \"I'm sorry I forgot to say. I'm Christie. Christie Monteiro.\" The name was obviously of Brazilian origin. \"And if you don't mind me asking,\" the woman continues, \"Who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly you do not remember your own name. With nothing else to do, you stare at her blankly and shrug your shoulders. Christie is slightly surprised that you cannot remember your own name, but then she concludes that you must be suffering from amnesia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just traveling through these woods until I was attacked by a bunch of these robots,\" Christie explains, \"They were strong, but they were no match for me! But then I heard an explosion close by. I went to investigate and I saw that everyone was dead. Everyone, apart from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange that you managed to survive a large and effective explosion despite your status at that point, but what was more confusing was why you was in that laboratory in the first place, and why those robots attacked you. But then you begin to wonder why Christie was in the woods in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her why she was in the woods, and she answers. \"I've come here to Japan to look for my grandfather. He was supposed to be in hospital, but he disappeared. I've heard rumors that Eddy had taken him to the Mishima Zaibatsu for treatment, but I think that it's something much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Eddy?\" you ask. \"What's the Mishima Zaibatsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddy taught me everything he knew about fighting. He has a lot of personal issues with the Mishima Zaibatsu, an organization that has declared war against the entire world. But what I can't understand is how he would just disappear and not even contact me! I've come here to investigate this whole situation. I'm taking the route through these woods because it was supposed to be the safest way to the Central Tower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was clearly distraught by the situation, but feeling as if you had a duty to repay her for rescuing you, you offered to join her on her journey. She was highly thankful, and after quickly packing up her things you followed her further into the woods. You had no idea where she was taking you, but strangely enough you felt very comfortable being with Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens during your journey?</span></div></div>",

You step from the grass and onto the concrete of a small arena parking lot. Curiously, Christie enters the building through the front door. As you follow, you notice that the arena was completely empty, or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the center of the dirty arena, Christie begins yelling. \"Eddy!?\" Christie cries, only to receive an echo of her voice by the emptiness of the arena. You steadily creep behind her until a dark figure suddenly emerges from the stands. Slightly fearful for your life, you hide behind Christie, who crouches into a defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure emerges. He was an African-American, wearing a white tank-top and ripped jeans. The muscles that he possessed made you shudder as Christie stood firm in her defensive position. It came to mind that Christie has encountered this threatening man before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie?\" the man says with a deep voice, \"Come for a rematch have we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie relieves herself from her position and stands back straight. She then replies. \"I'm not here for a fight, Bruce, I'm looking for someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man interrupts her. \"That's Bruce Irvin to you, little Missy! And I'd say that you're too afraid to face me again, because you know that I'll beat you. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Christie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce replies. \"Haven't you heard? The Mishima Zaibatsu has issued another Iron Fist Tournament, and this time I'm going to become the King!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says that I'm entering?\" Christie asks in disgust, but then she notices that Bruce has taken his eyes of her and now has you in his sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who might you be?\" Bruce asks, as you carefully reveal yourself to the combatant. \"Come on, little lady. You looking for a good time!?\" His arrogance was disturbing, but before he could make a move, Christie shields you from any offense from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave her out of this!\" Christie screams in anger, \"You want her, you'll have to go through me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce chuckles to himself and says \"About time, woman! Let's dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce Irvin then moves into a Muay Thai fighting stance. Christie similarly moved into a combat position which appeared to you as Capoeira. The hatred between these two was evident, but before the tension grew more intense, you stepped back and awaited the upcoming action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight between the two was long and hard, but who emerged from the fight victoriously?</span></div></div>",

Bruce Irvin was victorious. He stood still, dripping with sweat, looking down on his defeated opponent as you rush in to tend to Christie. You plead for her to wake up, but to no prevail, as you notice Bruce looking down at you with a wicked grin on his battered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the seriousness of the situation, you fall back onto your rear end and you attempt to crawl away, begging for mercy, as Bruce slowly follows you as if he was toying with you. He came closer towards you. You hold your hands up in protection, only to notice that Bruce has extended his hand out, as if he wanted to help you back onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously you grab his hand, and you are swept back onto your feet. You underestimated the strength of the Muay Thai fighter, who pulled you back onto your feet without breaking another sweat. But you were curious as to why he is offering such a gesture to you. So you ask him about his motives, and he answers you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about your friend, but she would have only got in the way.\" The tone of Bruce's voice became far more understanding, which you did not expect, especially after the attitude that he demonstrated to Christie before their fight. \"I've heard about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You are shocked by this claim. \"Do you know who I am? And what am I doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce shook his head in disagreement. \"I'm sorry.

What's the Mishima Zaibatsu!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" Bruce grabs your shoulders and attempts to calm you down, \"I can protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a member of G Corporation. If you can help us, we'll be able to protect you, and we will destroy the Mishima Zaibatsu once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was too confusing for you to contemplate. What's the Mishima Zaibatsu? What's G Corporation? Why are you being hunted? However you knew that the only way to discover the truth of your mysterious past is to join Bruce Irvin and the G Corporation, whatever it may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaiting an answer, Bruce asks you. \"So will you join us?\"</span></div></div>",

You plead for her to wake up, only to be clouded by a shadow.

If I have to take you to Kazuya on a stretcher, then so be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya? Who is Kazuya? There was no time for you to ponder on this, because you was staring into the eyes of a soldier who was about to rage war against you. But what can you do?

As you spin in your air, you lift your right leg high. The pendulum of momentum swung your way as your right leg crashes into the side of Bruce's head.

He had a silver necklace tucked around his neck that possibly carried some sort of significance to this illustrious character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter incidentally squashing a leaf upon the palm of your hand as you crawled out of the tent, the man turned his attention towards you.

I don't know how I woke up in that awful place. I can't remember anything. I can't even remember my own name!\" You were clearly distraught by your lack of memory, but your worries were suddenly lowered as the man dropped down to your eye level. \"Well,\" he chuckled, \"You must have had quite a bump on the head in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slightly embraced you, comforting you for the moment. As he ascended back to his feet, and you echoed his actions and also ascended to your feet, he returned to packing his bag. \"My name's Miguel by the way,\" he suddenly blurted as you got to grips of the viewpoint of your new feminine body, \"Miguel Caballero Rojo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to take advantage of this confession, you asked him why he was out in the middle of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just traveling through these woods until I was attacked by a bunch of these robots,\" he explained, \"They were strong, but alas, they were no match for me.

They took something close to me, and I aim to gain something in return.\" The enigma of this character was infuriating, but you continued to take interest in this mysterious figure. You asked who were the Mishima Zaibatsu. \"That was some serious knock on the head wasn't it?\" Miguel remarked, \"The Mishima Zaibatsu are an organization that has declared war against the entire world. They are led by the most sinister human being alive, Jin Kazama. He owes me for what he has taken from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what did he take from you?\" Your question was immediately discarded as Miguel turned away, clearly unwilling to answer your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get going,\" Miguel said as he grabbed his bag, \"Perhaps you should do the same.\" Before he could make his exit however, you grabbed his attention. You wanted to go with him, but he was uneasy in agreeing to do so. You had absolutely no idea where you were, or where you need to go, and perhaps this Spaniard could enlighten you in some way. Besides, he was too charming to leave alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happened next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a fictional take on the fighting game series of 'Tekken'. In this story, you take the role of a former fighter who has his brain transplanted into the body of a woman to take part in the next Iron Fist Tournament. Anything goes in the story, as long as it is presentable and follows the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his victory in the previous tournament, Jin Kazama has taken charge of the Mishima Zaibatsu and now possesses tyrannical ambitions. Using his resources within the organization to become a global superpower, he severs the Mishima Zaibatsu's national ties and openly declares war against all nations. This action plunges the world into a chaotic spiral, with war erupting around the globe and even amidst the space colonies orbiting the planet. His biological father, Kazuya Mishima, is aware of this and finds Jin's interference in his own plans for global domination to be a nuisance. Now in charge of G Corporation, Kazuya is seen as the only force who could oppose Jin and places a bounty on Jin's head for anyone who can capture him. Jin's response is to announce The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 in order to battle Kazuya and crush G Corporation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, among the ranks of the Tekken Force, a young soldier has begun a rebellion to slowly dismantle the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation in order to put an end to the war. After learning about this, Jin, along with his top subordinates, Nina Williams and Eddy Gordo, issues a manhunt for the young soldier. Resorting to desperate measures, the young soldier undergoes an operation to transplant his mind into the body of a young female in order to cover his identity. However during the operation, G Corporation forces attack, starting a fight and causing an explosion that kills almost everyone present at the scene and leaves the young soldier in the female body with amnesia. He manages to escape alongside another fighter who was present during the operation and survived the explosion. The young soldier then embarks on a journey that takes them across the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: The background of the main protagonist can be made up as you go along, and can differ from each available choice, but please keep up the continuity if you wish to contribute. Also, the character can be given a name of your choice, but the birth name of the character must remain unknown throughout the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis page will be updated further later, so keep an eye open for any changes.</td>",
