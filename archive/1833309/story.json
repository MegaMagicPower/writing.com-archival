            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two ladies trek their way through the forest in hopes of finding a suitable spot to camp under the shining stars. The campers were two friends in their early twenties named Carmen and Abby. Carmen, far more energetic than her companion, was a bit of an fitness junkie. From daily habits such as nutritious eating and exercise to outdoor activities, Carmen embodied health. Abby on the other hand was much more mellow. Though still slim and healthy, she simply did not possess the same affinity Carmen had for fitness and such found herself getting dragged into activities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little further...\" promised the toned Carmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh you keep saying that.\" whined Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha here we are.\" announced Carmen swinging her arms open. \"Take a gander at the great outdoors Abby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby lacked the enthusiaism of her friend which clearly manifested in her lethargic response \"Yeah... it sure is breathtaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sarcastic.\" Carmen snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began to set up camp. Taking far longer then expected, the girls were relieved that they finished before the sun set. Despite having an athletic body, Carmen lacked the experience of a typical camper which made the venture somewhat bumpy. Carmen had intended to gather food from the wild but completely failed. Luckily Abby planned ahead and brought tons of snacks which Carmen found underwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck you eat that garbage?\" Carmen gagged digging through Abby's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on they're just nutri-bars.\" Abby reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Carmen held out a bag of marshmellows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we'd make s'mores.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's words were met with an unamused glare. \"You know that's how girls like you get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Abby pouted. \"But what will we eat? You couldn't catch any animals or even find any berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go without dinner, we did eat a large lunch before setting out.\" Carmen suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Carmen capitulated after Abby's endless complaints and indulged in the nutri-bars with Abby though to Abby's dismay they did not have s'mores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it darkness had crept over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess it's time to sleep.\" Carmen said as the two of them crawled into their sleeping bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they fell asleep they gazed upon the star-light sky finding all of the stars impressive. There were so many more lights in the sky when one leaves the city. The girls delighted as they found all of the pretty constellations and big glowing stars. One in particular was rather bright, and seemed to get brighter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey is it me or is that star getting bigger?\" Carmen asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my it is getting bigger. And brighter!\" Abby's voice spoke with alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's coming at us!\" Carmen loudly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the two ladies were engulfed in a blinding light. Little did they know that they had just been abducted by a spacecraft under the control of the Chubby Primary.</span></div></div>",

Carmen?\" Abby darted her head back and forth in search of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen where are you?!\" Abby yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby ran through the trees desperate to find her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen! Carmen!\" Abby cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find Carmen, Abby grew frightened and oddly.. hungry. Clutching her adamant stomach, Abby pressed on calling out for her missing friend.  Making matters worse, Abby was quickly becoming exhausted. Running was putting an immense strain on the scared girl. Concern for her friend was suddenly accompanied by thoughts of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh this isn't the time to think about food!\" Abby said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carmen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'GROWLLLL.' Abby's shouts were followed by her roaring stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby fell to the ground, far too tired and too famished to run. It was then that Abby heard an odd noise close by. Heaving her worn out body up, Abby forced her way to the rustle. As Abby walked closer the noise became more recognizable, like loud eating. Approaching the noise Abby thought it was a large animal greedily eating a huge meal. Abby was shocked to see the source of the loud chewing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Carmen?\" Abby uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting before Abby was her friend, Carmen. However Carmen looked far different than her usual fit toned self. Here was the previously restrained Carmen wildly stuffing her face with desserts. Dumbfounded as to how those sweets got there in the first place, Abby was even more freaked out by Carmen's body. No longer thin and athletic, Carmen was now ....</span></div></div>",

Another day, another conference, another 3 hours of telling college students her age to sign up for a program that she spokes-personed for. She sighed as it was slow as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, they seemed more interested in businesses that helped out with parties, making money doing odd jobs, and new apartments. It showed how little they cared about their finances, \"This is the job I took though...\" Caressa huffed adjusting her designer beanie and smoothing her pitch black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed by and very few people passed. None payed any attention or seemed to care. It was just another one of those conferences. At the sight of the clock striking three, she began to pack up her things. The untouched pamphlets, stickers, pens, and notes. All scooped into a bag and ready to be displayed out next conference. Which happened to be in just a few days, \"Goodie...\" Caressa muttered entering her car and getting the hell off of the college campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole drive she muttered to herself. Why did she ever settle for such a boring job? Clearly she could do better. Caressa hated the person who talked her into taking this job. Even worse, she hated to be the person that would talk other people into taking this job. She was just growing more and more furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a flash of blinding light came from above. She partially covered her eyes to keep her sight on the road, but to her amazement the road seemed to get further and further away from her. She screamed and cried in panic as the car was lifted closer and closer to the spaceship. Caressa thought about jumping out of the car, only if it weren't to result in immediate death.

Huge breasts, round bellies, wobbly thighs, and swollen buttocks surpassed all other qualities in femininity. If these immaculate traits were to ever fall in danger, beauty itself would perish.

Human women are foolishly shedding beautiful pounds. Humanity had lost its way and women ignore their instincts of plump ravenous bodies in favor of shriveled, unhealthy bodies.

To the spaceship's concern, the female population was becoming slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparations were made. Inhabitable bases were set up throughout the solar system to house rescued women.
