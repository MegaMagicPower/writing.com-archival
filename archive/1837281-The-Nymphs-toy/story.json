            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last thing you remember was receiving an email that asked you if you wanted to have a fun time, you didn't even respond to it, you just sarcastically said \"Sure\" out loud before a flash of light blinded you. Now you feel horrible, like you were spun around in a washing machine or something. The only thing you can hear is what sounds like an insects fluttering wings, followed by someone poking you, although you could have swore it was more like a punch. You swat at whatever hit you, only to hit thin air. Doing that must have been funny, because you then heard a girlish giggle coming from all around you as you slowly opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He's waking up now! I think you poked him too hard Anny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you opened your eyes and sat up, all you could say to yourself was \"Wow\" (Not that anyone heard you at your size)<br>\r\nAll you could see were the curvy bodies of the Nymph sisters from Rayman Origins, but they were giant sized!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who gets him when though?\" \"I think I should get him first!\" \"He does look pretty cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Betilla pushed her way through her sisters and gently offered to pick you up. You kindly accepted her offer and stepped into the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n\"I think I should explain his situation first though\" Betilla said as she stared down at you. \"That'd be nice, like how and why I'm here!\" You said, talking loudly so you could be heard.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain everything little one, me aand my sisters have grown bored lately, and decided that maybe a small human would be able to provide some entertainment.\" This answer bewildered you. \"So you kidnapped me and shrunk me down?\" Betilla however, shook her head. \"No of course not, we sent an offer to whoever would accept it, and you accepted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last time I think out loud.\" You thought to yourself as you sat down in Betillas hand. \"So what, are you all going to play with me like a toy?\" you asked rather grumpily.<br>\r\n\"Well, yes that was the idea in the first place. But not to worry though, we put a spell on you that makes you.. what do humans call it? Like putty?\"<br>\r\nYou groaned. \"Great. Now I'm a plaything for these girls.\" You thought to yourself as you looked out of the corner of your eye, seeing Betilla's sisters huddled around her hand. \"Well, maybe it's not all bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, once we have our fun, you're free to go home if you choose. And we'll take good care of you.\" Betilla finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So let's get started!\" One of the sisters shouted as she attempted to grab you, which resulted in a big scrap between the sisters. You flopped onto the floor and rubber the back of your head. It really didn't hurt as much as you thought it would. As you stood up and turned around, you attempted to calm the sisters down. \"Ladies please! Stop all the fighting, you're giving me a headache!\" you yelled, however your yelling fell on deaf ears. Finally, Helena, the Nymph dressed in what looked like a snow dress, shoved Edith to the ground.<br>\r\nIt's too bad she shoved Edith in your direction, which resulted in you getting flattened by her plump rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Edith dusted herself off, the girls looked around realizing you were gone. \"Uh, where did he go?\" Edith asked as she turned around to look for you. The rest of the sisters giggled as Edith turned her head. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnetta was the first to point straight at Ediths rear, revealing you plastered over it, just like someone had sat in putty. \"I guess he's already having fun.\" Edith said as she peeled you off her skirt, which resulted in you reflating fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that all of the fighting is over, let's discuss who gets our toy first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long talk, it's decided that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your casual clothes were definitely not enough to withstand the cold weather, you felt like you were turning into an ice cube! You can only suspect that since Helena is the mountain nymph, she must have natural resistance to cold weather. As Helena fluttered into her house, she sat down on her couch and lifted you up to her face. At this point, you were shaking like a leaf in a hurricane. Helena looked at you for a moment and frowned. \"I'm so sorry! I forgot that you're a human, not a nymph like me! You must be close to becoming an ice cube!\" Helena said as she continued to watch you shiver. An idea popped into her head as she smirked at you. \"I know how to warm you up, and I bet you'll love this idea!\" Helena said as she cupped you in both her hands and hugged you against her ample chest.<br>\r\nHelena's body heat slowly began warming you up, you were so comfy that you couldn't help cuddle into her. You heard her giggling as you did this, and looked up at her face.<br>\r\n\"You really like it down there huh?  I suppose I could let you stay there for a bit longer.\" Helena said as she sat back a bit and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did the same as you made yourself comfortable between Helena's endowments, finally feeling totally warmed up again. Enduring the cold weather was really worth it. Your world shifted a ton as you noticed Helena cupping her breasts, another smirk on her face. You were about to ask her what she was doing, but then both of her breasts crashed into you and crushed you between them. Helena laughed as you crawled out from in between them, and apologized. \"I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist!\" Helena laughed out as she pet you on your head with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen little guy, how about we...\"</span></div></div>",

They've got quite a bond already as it seems.\" Annetta giggled as the other sisters finally agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith squealed with delight and hugged you like you were her newest toy. (Which in a sense, you are.) Being hugged by a bubbly girl like Edith has it's perks. Especially being in between her warm mounds. But, there are also downsides. Like suffocating. You violently struggled to get out of Ediths cleavage, grabbing her by instinct and trying to pull yourself out. It was a nice spot sure, but not when you can die while enjoying it. \"Hey! You're grabby!\" Edith said as she continued to hug you, seeming to not really care. \"Edith, I think that's because you're suffocating him!\" Betilla said as she pulled Edith's arms away from her chest, leaving you imprinted once again on her. \"Oops! Sorry!\" Edith said as she peeled you off of her right breast.<br>\r\n\"If you're going to do that again, please make sure you give me some air!\" You shouted. \"Sorry! Don't worry, I'll take care of you while you're with me!\" Edith reassured, as she began to fly off. \"Cya later girls!\" Edith said as she flew back to her home. \"Just be sure to give her to Holly tomorrow!\" Betilla shouted as Edith flew away with you in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edith settled into her home, she set you down on the floor, leaving the room for a minute and coming back with a sandwich. She settled down on her chair and began eating it, when your stomach growled. \"Wow, you must be hungry if I heard that from up here!\" Edith said in between mouthfuls of food. \"Tell you what, I'll let you have some of my lunch if you can do a task. If not, you'll have to wait for your meal.\" You reluctantly agreed, not like you had a choice. You were hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, I want you to..\"</span></div></div>",

That sound good?\" Annetta asked, and everyone agreed on the schedule. Annetta soon left and brought you to the pier. You looked down from her hand and saw the blue water rippling below. \"Uhh, what are we doing here, Miss Annetta?\" You asked Annetta as you looked up at her, you had to admit something about the sea air made her sparkle with even more beauty. \"Well, I am the ocean nymph. My house is at the bottom of the sea, so you might want to hold on!\" Annetta said as she dove into the ocean, you in her hand. The rush of water felt a bit painful at your size, but you managed to hold on to her index finger as you both drifted down to the bottom of the ocean floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnetta might be the ocean nymph, but you can't breathe under water. Soon, you let out all your breath and began gasping for air halfway down to the ocean floor, waving your arms around trying to get Annetta's attention. Your attempts are successful, as Annetta looks at you with a questioning look on her face. You point to your head and make a breathing motion as you also point to go up. Annetta simple shakes her head and hoists you up to her face. You're curious as to what she's trying to do, but now you're really starting to suffocate. That's when Annetta places you near her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnetta wraps her lips around your face and blows air into your lungs in order to keep you alive as you finish your descent to the ocean floor. She enters her house, which seems to be inside a bubble and opens the door and steps inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was fun...\" you gasp as you cough up a bit of water. \"I dunno, you seemed to enjoy the last part.\" Annetta giggled as you blushed in embarrassment \"Maybe if you're lucky, you'll get another kiss early.\" Annetta said as she made a kissy face at you, making you blush even more. These nymphs were really flirty when they were alone with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's time we had some fun. How about we play a game of...\"</span></div></div>",
