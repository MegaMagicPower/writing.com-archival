After spending the past few weeks mostly indoors due to lousy weather and some work you needed to do you were more than eager to get out and stretch your legs. Gathering some things for the short trip, you locked your door and headed out for a trail in the nearby woods. Little did you know, this short walk would end up turning into a grand life changing adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked along the trail, you looked around taking in the beautiful sights around you. After about a half hour you stopped to rest a little, taking your camera out of your bag to take a few pictures. Then a strange whistle echoed nearby. You tried to look around for the source but couldn't see anything around you. Then a bright light engulfed you causing you to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally woke up, it was dark. You must have been out for a while. As you stumbled around trying to find your things you bumped against something large. As you looked up you noticed this gigantic structure was actually a log. The same log you could have sit on earlier only now it was HUGE. You weren't going to spend too long questioning it. You were shrunk. And in the middle of nowhere. At night. You needed to find shelter or help fast. As fate would have it, you heard a voice nearby. As you moved towards it cautiously, you spotted a tent with a small campfire nearby. Wasting no time you headed towards the campsite being occupied by...</span></div></div>",

What happened to you? How were you knocked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly, the only thing you seem to remember is a blinding light shining out of nowhere, just before you lost your consciousness and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly - very slowly - you get back on your feet. After a few moments of disease, you manage to stand properly on your legs as you proceed to examine your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you guessed, you are still in the forest, surrounded by tall trees... too tall trees. You've never seen so high ones before! Your gaze casually shifts to the side. And you notice something green, roughly your size, standing there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, you look down. And you pale as you notice that this thing is coming out of the ground, which seems way closer than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hits you like a punch in your stomach. You stumble back and, lacking any surface to hold onto, you fall on your behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've... I've shrunk...\" you mutter, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and take a better look around, noticing that you're currently in a small, enlightened clearing. You also notice a stump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards it. It's huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... you aren't dreaming... you've really shrunk...<br>\r\n\"Holy-\" you are unceremoniously cut off as a loud noise echoes, and the ground beneath you quakes softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot enough to make you fall, but still pretty enough to scare you. You take a few steps back as the sound - and the quakes - grow stronger and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStronger and louder, until you notice a huge shadow approaching. You cower in fear, dreading the chance that it could be some wild pokemon ready to make a decent snack out of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, much to your luck, it is not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human boy suddenly walks into the clearing. You gaze up to fully look at his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight brown hair, hazel eyes, slim form and a neutral look on his face. Your gaze shifts from his body to his clothes; red and white shirt, jeans and red and black shoes. A red hat and a yellow backpack complete everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden voice talks from the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've already seen this guy, you're sure of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you realize who he is: it's Red, a living legend as a pokemon trainer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stare at him in awe as he stops.<br>\r\n\"...\" he inspects his surroundings, remaining though unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives a shrug, before moving towards the stump you are standing close to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recover from your surprise as a giant shoe steps at a few inches before you, before rising again, crafting a huge shadow above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you dive out of the way, avoiding getting stepped on by Red. That wouldn't have left you so alive afterwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the trainer, noticing him sitting down on the stump, removing his yellow backpack, gently putting it on the ground. You discard the idea of him setting up camp - it's still, like, 3 PM - and you decide that he is simply resting before resuming his walk towards wherever he is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stand there, perplexed of what you should do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you unhappily remember what situation you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality hits you like a slap across your face. It's your chance to get help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you make your way to the giant's shoes, unsure of how to approach him.<br>\r\n\"Uh... Hey?\" you call out, feeling tremendously awkward, being at the mercy of such famous person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same one person who just didn't hear you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help...!\" you try for a more practical approach. Which still doesn't seem to work.<br>\r\n\"...\" Red keeps gazing around in a lazy fashion, still unaware of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try several other times to get his attention, but every call you make sadly ends up as the others: totally unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you lean forward, placing one hand on his red shoe, thinking of a way to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon feel the shoe starting to move. You look up to see the legendary trainer...</span></div></div>",

His appearance is the same anyway, (supposedly), so let's just say this is B2W2 Red.</b>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sudden reflex and desperation, you ran to the teen's shoelace as the shoe you were standing on kept rising, nearly making you lose your balance. You lunged towards the lace and cling on the very tip with your arms and legs, as it waved with the motion, making you feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed meanwhile decided he was done resting and to continue his trek through the forest clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great...\" You muttered to yourself as the lace kept waving back and forth with every step, desperately trying not to get flung off. \"I'm suddenly shrunk to the size of a Joltik, with no clue where I am, and the only person that can help is a legendary trainer that can't even notice me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you figured, it could be a lot worse. If it wasn't for your quick thinking and reflexes, you'd still be stuck near that stump, with no clue what might find you next. Hell, you'd be nothing more than a tiny red stain on Red's sole if you didn't dive out of harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trainer's trek continued, you kept trying to get him to notice you, constantly calling out his name. Like before, Red didn't even look like he noticed your shouts, the responses always ending up as,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...much to your dismay and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was honestly surprising that he didn't encounter any wild Pokemon yet. You'd at least like to know what region you could possibly be in and see if you left your home region or not before shrinking, (the details were still fuzzy in your mind about what exactly happened). Even at this time of night, there were usually some Pokemon out and about. You should know as a night owl yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, does Red even sleep to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit dumb for asking that. Of course he does, everyone needs sleep, yet you couldn't imagine such a stoic trainer sleeping for long. Red looks like the type of person that wouldn't stay in one place for long, (you still think those rumors of him being on Mt. Silver for 3 years straight was absurd. He was most likely training a bit and Ethan was lucky enough to spot him before he left.) Given how short he stayed at that stump, you seemed to be correct on that assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you also wished he was resting a bit longer at that stump because the constant motion of the lace moving back and forth a lot was starting to give you motion sickness, severely regretting your method of travel on this titan of a teenage boy. You might not be able to hold on much longer. Thankfully, Red decided to stop for a moment, giving you some time to catch your breathe and stop your eyes from spinning. You briefly wondered why he stopped and soon found out it was because...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were staring in astonishment, as the silent teen covered his mouth, his eyes shut. The most silent yawn you ever heard left his mouth for a second. Again, everyone needs sleep, but it was still surreal to see such a stoic trainer showing any sign of weakness, (not that you dared to think of Red as weak).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Red glanced around the area for a bit, you guessing to make sure there was no Pokemon in the area. You doubt it was a safety concern, because you were 100% sure his team would demolish any attacker. If anything, it must have been concern for Pokemon sleeping in the area. It was actually really heartwarming to think that Red cares about Pokemon like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you were now a lot more convinced that Red would be the type to help you if he noticed you. Now if only you could think of a way to get his attention without being accidentally put in harms way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Red deemed the clearing to be Pokemon-free, he nodded to himself and started walking over to a wide flat area to place down his stuff, you desperately clinging once more to the lace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hold on anymore! Ngh...\" Your hands were too sweaty by this point. As he finally lost your grip and fell, a stroke of good luck hit you, as Red stopped moving the moment you let go, you landing onto his shoe. It wasn't exactly a soft landing, but much better than being flung off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and expected Red to start undressing and changing into pajamas, which would have been an...interesting sight. Instead, the brunet took out a tent from his bag. That's right, a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole entire tent, curled up nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How the?--I don't...\" You were at a loss for words. How did that backpack carry an tent inside of it!? He has to other items inside of it for Pokemon battles or even catching new Pokemon, right? So that made it even more astonishing that his backpack had space for it. That backpack is not big enough to carry a curled up tent, and there's no space to attach it to the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head hurts...\" Deciding to not think about this blemish on the laws of physics any longer, you quickly ran towards his leg to start climbing, hoping to get his attention before he finishes setting up and you'd have to wait until he woke up. As you latched on and started to climb, the leg moved and you fell down in between the crevice of Red's sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed meanwhile, starting set up the tent. Evidently, he was an expert on setting up tents since he set up rather quickly, even putting the stakes using only his fingers and then his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile, had another stroke of luck, as you were trapped between the fabric and just above Red's heel. While you certainly didn't think of this as stroke of luck, the smell already making you a bit nauseous, this was also the foot Red used to push the stakes into the ground. Better this than being painfully pressed against metal right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to get out of here!\" Struggling with all you had though proved to be in vain. Red's foot was constantly moving and this made moving very difficult. After what seemed like half an hour, but was actually only 5 minutes, the motions stopped and you wonder if this meant he was finished so he can finally start changing and maybe noticed you during it. After another 3 minutes went by, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me!\" You couldn't believe it. Red was already sleeping by the looks of it. So much for that hope of him wearing pajamas. Better than being the type that sleeps in only underwear though. You couldn't even understand those types, especially on cold nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I can finally move now...\" With a heavy sigh, you began climbing on Red's foot, out of the smelly sock that imprisoned you. When you got out, you found yourself inside the red and blue tent. You had a few words about the color scheme, but now was not the time for them. It might be too late to get his attention for the rest of the night, but you could at least put yourself in a better position for him to notice you when he wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed on top of the trainer's leg, you were a bit intimidated by how far away his face was from you're current position. Traveling all the the way up to his face was going to take the rest of the night if the distance was anything to go by, but it was the best place to get his attention. With a resigned sigh, you began your long expedition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what had to have been an hour of traveling, you were now currently resting a bit at Red's thigh, blushing slightly at the bulge just up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(What happens next decides your preference in gender and a bit of your personality from this point onward)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1) You are homosexual, and the temptation of exploring inside a famous male trainer's underwear was too much for you to resist, especially with that trainer being your idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2) You are straight and wanted nothing to do it. Slight adoration for Red or not. Onward we go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3) You are bi and have a bit of a crush on Red, so you were admittedly curious to see what he was packing before you continued onward. Just a peek though.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured it was just a peek. You kinda had a crush on Red. Who wouldn't? He's famous and a bit of a hottie. You were sure anyone else would kill to even be this close to him. Maybe not at your current size, (unless they were real desperate or something), but your point stands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Red. I'm just taking a quick look.\" With that, you head straight towards the bulge in front of you, going to the massive brunet's fly and using all of your strength to push the zipper open just slightly enough for you to fit through the small opening. The musky smell immediately was driving your senses wild and with blushes that got more red by the second, you made you way into his underwear's fly and were now next to the very thing you were wanting to peek at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight between the pubic forest you resided in was the boy's soften member. At your size, even flaccid, the pillar of flesh looked quite long and enormous, more than 5 times your size. Unfortunately, you couldn't even see that. One thing you forgot, was that the zipper wasn't opened wide enough for light to come in and you didn't have any source of light on your person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on!\" You suppose it's for the better like this, as this was an invasion of privacy, but it's very frustrating to not even get to see it after going this far. With a sigh, you were about to turn and head back, until you heard a soft grunt escape from the colossal teen's mouth and your landscape shook. You were helplessly thrown sideways as Red turned in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you tried to find the exit, only to see nothing but darkness all around you, constantly running into strands of pubic hair. After a few minutes, you had to accept the fact that you're now lost inside the pubic jungle with no way of knowing how to get out. You cursed your curiosity and yourself for not thinking this through a bit more. Not every rushed action leads to a positive outcome it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... ...\" Red meanwhile was slightly feeling something in his lower region through his sleep. Half-aware, he brought his hand down to scratch the itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much of warning for you, Red's hand came into his underwear and for a brief moment, you saw that you were actually right above his huge penis. You couldn't get a good enough glimpse to measure as you decided to move from the incoming fingernail. You dove into the hair strands as the fingernail scratched the surface of his ball sack. The hand then left moments later and trapped you in darkness again, as you felt your heart pound against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was way too close!\" While not as long as say, more feminine types would keep their fingernails, at your size, Red's looked like they could cut you in pieces, especially if he scraped them against your body like he was about to. You gulped and decided getting his attention from this position was a bad idea. Aside from the possibility of accidentally killing you, you began to think about the likely scenarios that would occur if Red found you in his private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne case involved him possibly looking annoyed and crushing you for peeping, or maybe just using his Pokemon to do the dirty deed, (like possibly Charizard incinerating you with flamethrower, or Pikachu electrocuting you to death). Another had him doing the same thing while thinking you were just a bug, and another had him possibly torture you in various ways while you were down there. That last one seemed unlikely, but it could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder in absolute fear at the thoughts. Yup. Definitely out of the question to be found here. Sadly, you were kinda stuck, because moving too much will obviously cause him to react again and you could only dodge so much more. You were exhausted by this point. The musky smell around you though made you want to leave, as it was driving your hormones insane. Even if you had wanted to jerk off here, (which you didn't for some obvious reasons), your moving would cause him to react again. You felt like pulling your hair out from the situation you got yourself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH! Why am I so dumb!?\" With a heavy sigh, you resigned to your fate of staying here til he woke and began moving again. Hopefully you could think of a way to escape without him noticing by then. If you did, then you would try getting his attention from a much less compromising position and get him to help you. You also figured you could get some shut eye until then. With slow, careful movements, you lied down on the fleshy surface below and shut your eyes, trying to ignore the musky smell and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you next opened your eyes, you felt the ground moving and yawned, trying to remember what happened. A loud rumble from outside that sounded like a deep 'Pika' startled you awake and you remembered everything, eyes shot open. You look around and wonder if you somehow fell out and Red's Pikachu found you. As you moved around, you felt something on top of you and whimpered when you looked up and saw that you were trapped underneath Red's dick. There was now a bit of light shining in from somewhere so you could see your surroundings. Hey, at least you got to see what you wanted right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?...\" Thankfully, by some miracle, Red moved and his member, which was definitely more than 5 times your size, moved to the side enough for you to break free and put some distance from the pillar of flesh. You heard the trainer make a confused hum, telling you he felt your movement. Your heart beat a little faster, knowing he was about to try and find out what just caused that itch. Knowing you had to flee fast, you look upward and saw some slight light leaking out, which is how you found out where you were, you climbed upward, using some of his pubic hair for elevation, as his hand entered once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you escape being captured?</span></div></div>",

You dumbly giggled before shaking your head and scolding yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, no more of that! Not worth the trouble!</i>\" \"Pika~\" You froze in fright and slowly turned to see Pikachu enjoying some berries nearby, thankful it didn't hear you and wasn't looking at your direction.

He was sure he felt something in there when he woke up. As his Pikachu curiously turned his head to looked at him, he quickly took his hand out and acted like nothing happened, a bit embarrassed at the thought of being caught scratching his privates in front of his Pokemon. He must of just been a bit too tired still and imagined feeling something there. With a frustrated grunt, the teen slowly got up and went to go shower to get all the grogginess out of his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that was the plan, until a grumble from the trainer's stomach reminded him that he didn't eat anything since yesterday. Combined with all the travelling he did yesterday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly sighing, Red turned around and went to eat a few berries from the massive pile his trusty partner Pikachu found around the area while he was sleeping, said electric mouse curiously tilting his head before continuing his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost towards the top of the shirt, nearly thrown of a few times by the trainer's movements. Thankfully, the movements slowed down and were less erratic, and judging by the chewing sound above, you guessed that the famous teen was having breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of how long it's been since you ate made your stomach growled, part of you now craving food. But you also wanted to be found quick before being put in any other situations that either made you uncomfortable or endangered your life. Moaning from your aching stomach, you kept climbing and hoped Red would share some food once he found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally got near the top, you were sweating up a storm and panting, feeling like you might just collapse from hunger any moment. At the same time, you were ecstatic to be so close to your goal! All you'd have to do is climb up Red's facial hair and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in horror as you got to the top of his shirt and saw his chin, completely void of facial hair. Now that you think about it, his chest lacked facial hair as well. It was now you realized with great horror that you fucked up. There was no way for you to climb up to his nose and wave to him now, not without serious risk of being flung off by just the slightest movement. Assuming you survived the long fall, which was doubtful, you'd be back at square one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now regretting not getting Pikachu's attention instead, but was it worth the risk? You don't know what Pikachu is like when it's not battling. More specifically, how it interacts with other Pokemon. Even if it was nice to them, could the same be said to anything smaller than it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome possible unsavory interactions came to mind and you shuddered, deciding to at least try and get Red's attention first from your current position. With a deep inhale, you began yelling and screaming his name in hopes he'll somehow hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the responses you got like usual, your screaming now out of anger. It was a fruitless effort especially with the loud chewing blocking out your screams at some points while the teen ate. You gave up and sighed, still clinging to the fabric and wondering where to go from here.</span></div></div>",

You even got a promotion recently, and got moved to one of your group's better facilities! You were stationed in your secret base under a casino run by Team Rocket. The machine's were actually legit, even though the group had to replace the slots with some arcade games. And the base was only accessible using a secret switch hidden behind a poster in a corner of the shop! It was perfectly hidden and there should've been no way someone could find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, some brat found your expertly hidden base! And right in the middle of your experiments too! You had been working on a device to neutralize larger Pok\u00e9mon and make them easier to capture. Specifically, it shrunk large Pok\u00e9mon like Snorelax and made them tiny enough for an Eevee to carry around like a pup. You had just started the testing phase when that brat showed up. That little boy charged in, and destroyed your fellows with his Pikachu showing powers well beyond that of any you'd seen before. You could've sworn it was performing some moves that weren't proven to have existed before. The destruction they caused launched you into your machine, electrocuting you and knocking you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were waking up with an unbelievable migraine and a feeling of being incredibly dirty. As your migraine disappeared you see that you were no longer base... now you were in a forest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chu!\" You hear a loud sound behind you. You turned around and got a face full of massive Pikachu paw! The air is crushed out of your lungs as the giant rodent's paw forces you into the ground. You can feel that your entire body isn't stuck under the paw, but it sure as hell felt like it and you peeking between his toes up at him didn't help. \"Pi Pika.\" It said smirking at you between his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn rat is taunting me!\" You thought to yourself as you struggle to lift the massive paw off of you. No wonder you felt so dirty, the stinkin' rat was using you as a personal floor mat. All your struggling did was make the Pikachu more satisfied with himself, being his little toy was fitting for such a piece of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chu, where are you buddy?\" The voice of a young boy reaches your ears and you suddenly feel the weight of Pikachu's paw shift as it looks towards the voice. \"Is that the brat who destroyed my work?\" You struggle to look past Pikachu towards the voice. As if one cue, the young boy who attacked your base rounded the corner and he was absolutely massive! If you just barely poked out from under Pikachu's paw, you were certain you could fit under that kid's foot with room to spare. Was he the one that gave you to this rat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing all the way out here?\" He asked kneeling and petting Pikachu. \"You kind of just ran off after we finished up in that base, you had me worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just growled, pissed off at the kid treating that rat with such kindness. \"Yeah, he wanted to play with the guy you ended up shrinking!\" You try again to move a bit, but are quickly interrupted by Pikachu putting pressure on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't really sure what he wanted to do now. He had been having a lot of fun messing with you, but he loved his trainer and wanted him to have some fun. He gave him presents a lot and this wouldn't be any different. Of course he wasn't sure how his trainer would like this gift. Maybe he should put you somewhere his trainer would find later or wouldn't find at all. Someplace like, his shoe! Or maybe his food. Somewhere that wouldn't seem like Pikachu put him there. Of course, he could also just keep you for now... just toy with you a little longer.</span></div></div>",

He slowly strips you of your outer clothing, leaving you in Trevor\u2019s hand with only your underwear. \"Now that's b-better...\" The giant nerd carefully kissed your almost totally naked body. Much to your fear, your underwear became unceasingly tight as the <i>involutnary</i> sensation of the giant's very surprisingly soft lips against your bare skin caused a very unwanted reaction to stir in your body. You fried to cover it, but your lack of clothing and trevor\u2019s grip on you prevented such efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course this response did not go unnoticed to your gigantic captor. Trevor blushed slightly before he  gently placed you back to the ground in front of his big feet.

Judging by the pokemon in the area, you guessed that you were on Poni Island. \"Great, I'm 2 inches tall and on the most dangerous island in Alola!\" Your rant was interrupted some loud snoring coming from behind a large rock. Your curiosity overpowered your caution and you creeped around the rock and sighed in relief at the sight of another human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some male teenager who had fallen asleep right on the ground, no sleeping bag, no pillow, just.... sprawled out in the grass. \"Well, its better than nothing.\" You started making your way towards him and noticed a few more things about this person. He had a bag next to him that had pokeballs attached on the single strap to the bag, he was clearly a pokemon trainer and, judging by the Z-Ring on his wrist, a trial goer to boot! \"<i>Perfect!</i>\" You thought \"<i>If he's a trial runner, that means <br>\r\nhe's a strong trainer and I'll be safer with him!</i>\" The other thing that stuck out to you was his incredibly white hair. It was whiter than snow, and it looked like it was.. glowing in a weird way. Suddenly, a thought hit you. White hair, Z-Ring, and a teenage male? This was the current Champion of the Alola Region! \"Oh thank god!\" You said to yourself, \"The Regional Champion is the safest person in the world to approach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to his bare feet and started thinking on how you wanted to climb up to get his attention, you could climb up his feet, which were pungent and musky, but you weren't sure if you could get a good enough hold to climb, Or you could go between his legs to try to climb his shorts, but that would be a pretty awkward conversation if he woke up and found you climbing his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

The swimwear was just a pair of trunks so it was a safe assumption that it was just a single male camper at this site. Next your attention turned to the tent which glowed brightly from the inside.

A very tan boy who was sitting near the back of the tent eating some sort of confection you weren't entirely familiar with. He seemed to be zoned out at the moment, trying to savor the taste of his treat. Hopefully you can get him to notice you. Scanning the contents of the tent, you saw a bag, a sleeping bag, and what you assumed was the container where he got the food from. That seemed like as good a place as any to get his attention. Either he'll. Price you if he tried to get more to eat, or he'll notice you when he puts it back. You ran over to his food bag and tried climbing the side of it.

With a yawn, he pulled his sleeping bag covers over himself and fell fast asleep, a gentle snoring from his throat as his body processed everything in his stomach, including you.</span></div></div>",

He was also wearing blue shoes that looked like they would be used in water. Following that thought, he didn't appear to be wearing any socks, which slightly excited you at the thought of seeing his bare feet.

Once satisfied, he stopped rolling you underfoot, though he didn't take it off. Instead, he pinned you under the ball of his foot.

Would you like to be my insole?\" Hau pushed his foot downward, squashing you further into his sole. \"Ooor, would you like licking them clean first?\" With a sharper squeeze, his pushed your face right into the sweaty crevice in-between his toes, and forcibly made you take a gulp of the salty stuff that rolled down from it. Whether it was your mad obsession with his feet that spiced the flavour, or if it was genuinely that tasty, you couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, slave. Don't leave me hanging here like that~\" Hau exclaimed ironically, while clenching your whole upper body with his toes, and dangling it from his foot. \"You're gonna do both sooner or later, I'm just giving you a choice.

Not wanting to keep him waiting, you quickly nodded your head accepting his decision.

Part of it felt like a dream come true, but then as you looked back you felt a sense of fear run through you. Was this right, was this really what you want? He seems to be enjoying toying with you, what if he\u2019s not so nice. Are you just being paranoid? Is the tension and anticipation from his teasing just getting to you? What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Hau\u2019s titanic soles have completely taken over your self control and willpower. Even if you wanted to run, you were unable to move. You watched in anticipation as the fleshy walls on either side of you closely closed in. The heat got stronger, as did a faint scent of the ocean that also seemed to linger on them. You almost zoned out once again, but we\u2019re quickly brought back to reality as the feet pressed together, trapping you firmly in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHay smiled a bit as he felt your tiny form shaking a bit between his feet. This complete control he held over another person felt very strange to him. But despite the odd feeing, he loved this. He bit his lower lip a little as he felt you moving about down there. Carefully he opened his soles a little, giving you some room to move and breath some fresh air. Though before long he pressed the soles back together, laughing as he enjoyed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down below, you were flooded with a mix of emotions of your own. You were terrified and yet you found yourself enjoying this feeling of being pressed between his feet. The texture, the warmth, the smells. These conflicting thoughts stopped as the feet separate and you were given room to move. Was he finally done? The answer came quickly as the feet pressed back together, pinning you near his toes. The massive pudgy digits wiggled a bit as they pressed and patted you. Your head was pressed under his big toe, putting you right at the source of some of the stronger smells hitting your nose. The excitement caused something to stir in your pants. You wanted to hide it, afraid of that much being discovered, but you couldn\u2019t move your arms to cover up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHau seemed unaware of the poking so far, but he soon opened his feet once more, having a new idea in mind.</span></div></div>",

Lusamine made is a simple disappointed frown that somehow send cold shivers down the children's spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tsk..Tsk, I'm shocked that my own children give their new family member such a meager experience.\"Lusamine calmly chided all three of them. The way she simply walked towards them is simply menacing as hell. The boy gulped in fear as the president's emerald eyes gaze upon him. While he can see some genuine love and affection in her gaze, but it's almost tainted and twisted into\u2026something you can't even recognize. The woman gracefully sat down on the pristine white floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her slender fingers gently crawled on her impressive legs.She gingerly gripped the heel breasts of those fancy high heels.She slowly slipped them off in such sultry fashion. Her long toes eagerly stretched in comfort and the fact they are finally freed from the oppressive shoes.And judging from her content as hell sighs,the crazy lady must had a <i>long</i> day at being her\u2026or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that I have to show them the <i> proper</i> way to do things.\" Lusamine  remarked with a dark amusement and sweetness in her voice. She crossed her snow white soles.For a woman who just mocked her own daughter for having such \"large\" and \"unlady\" like feet,her own size <u><i><b> fourteen and half</b></i></u> feet aren't exactly <b>small</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The sheer levels of hypocrisy is astounding\u2026'</i> The boy bitterly heeded as he <u>begrudgingly</u> admire her feet. They were slightly curvy in sense,and where surprisedly very thick and meaty.Her bare heels are plump and juicy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho\u2026Admiring the fruits of my labor I see.\" Lusamine impishly teased the little boy with a sly smirk. She then srunched toes,and revealing her masterfully painted nails. \"Then why don't take a more closer and personal look..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this happened,Lillian hastily turned her head...for what ever reason. This cause the woman's perfectly trimmed left brow that to be risen in slight confusion <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hung in head as he soullessly marched towards the woman. And when he finally reached his destination,the thick and complex aroma hits him like a truck. It's was a sweet flowery perfume of cheri and cran berries,and a foul scent of sour eggy vingear and stale cheese blended in together. Due to his size,their already strong potency is intensified greatly,and honestly\u2026he can't even tell which one is the greater odor. Their that well mixed,and doing wonders for already conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further delay, the boy pressed his hands up against her slighty reddened soles. His body involuntarily quivered in arousal as he felt her unimaginably soft skin. He bit his lip in sheer defiance and will-power as hastily caressing her feet. He then rapidly punoch her heels in frustration and anger,but alas he wasn't hurting the not so sane mother\u2026in even slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact,he what doing wonders for Lusamine's weariness and tiredness. Running a massive and very successful foundation is a <i>alot</i> of hard work. She doesn't just sat there,and bark orders and be a pretty face. But despite calm and serene facade\u2026Lusamine is holding back laughter and mad gushing. For she feels his miniscule hands feeling her sensitive appendages,and it feels absolutely fantastic.If they were by themselves then she would be laughing up a storm and then let him indulge in his baser urges,and give him all sorts of affection. But she can't allow her sweet children to see her in such a state,if would\u2026be improper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The boy is obliviously holding back.He wants nothing more to fondle them,and grind his little cock on my soles.The naughty sneasel..'</i> Lusamine quite feverishly concluded as she glanced at the blushing boy rapidly tackling her feet.<i>'Perhaps he also want to \"explore\" the rest of me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happened to look back at her children. Her son is looking at her with thinly veiled anger. He must be going to a phrase,or perhaps he just angry that someone is rubbing her feet? The thought simply amused the woman greatly. But her other child\u2026has a blush on her face\u2026and has a odd glint of shame and disgust in her eyes. Then it hit her like a thunderbolt on a pokemon with the lighting rod ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian has a some certain thing in <u><i><b>common</b></i></u> with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh this is too damn precious.'</i> The mother deviously mused,and sends her daughter a shit eating grin that screamed \"I know what you're looking at.~\". Lillie's face just went ghostly pale with horror and shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lillian,come join me. We need some mother and daughter bonding.\" Lusamine sweetly cooed to her daughter,much to both boys' confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-o thank you mo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here <b>now</b> Lillian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie hanged her head in utter defeat,as she approach her only remaining parent,and sat next to her. Who which gave her a sweet hug,and a brief kiss on cheek. It reminded her of much happier times\u2026which this certainly isn't one of them by far. The young girl mentally braced herself for whatever her mother got planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Lusamine play with them?</span></div></div>",

The weird thing is, he looks like somebody you\u2019ve seen before on tv or something, maybe he was related to a celebrity or maybe your mind was just playing tricks on you. Another thing you notice is the Pok\u00e9mon sitting next to him, it was one that you had never seen before; it had a dog-like appearance yet a fishy tail and a large metal mask on it, must have been an evolved form of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladion was sitting by the fire, getting some rest after he traveled across half of akala just to get some food from the store that gave away free coupons. He looked down at his faithful companion and gave him a pet with a smile. \u201cAlright null, it\u2019s about that time\u201d he said, reaching for his Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s ball in his bag which he quickly locates. \u201cType: null, return\u201d he said, and with a flash of light the creature had returned to its containment unit. \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be a good idea for me to get some rest too\u201d he said while packing up some things in his tattered bag. So he put out his fire and head back for his small torn up tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, good, this was your chance, it would be much simpler to get his attention without that crackling fire and guard dog right next to him, this could have only been a good sign. You then approach the large zipper door of the tent, which even at your diminished size, looked kind of sad. Sure it was huge but you could easily tell it used to be white and he just tried to spray paint it black to make it look \u201ccooler\u201d. You could also see a faint logo under the paint, resembling that of that Pok\u00e9mon rehabilitation company with the floating island, what were they called again? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, as long as I can get this boy to see me I\u2019m good\u201d You think to yourself as you crawl in through a small gap in the zipper. The moment you enter you notice how sad this tent really was, there were full complete holes in it, the air easily getting in, and while alola didn\u2019t have winter, it still wasn\u2019t warm at night. Hell, even the boy had to sleep fully clothed and with his bag on top of him to stay warm, which could actually be used to your advantage. At this size you most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to wake him up so you could easily crawl into ____________ to stay warm until morning.</span></div></div>",

Gladion then opened the door and closed it behind him, meaning that you definitely had to get his attention now as there was no way you could get out by yourself anymore. You continue to think to yourself more, but as you do that suddenly the world around you begins to shake violently causing you to flip and tumble around within the pocket, not long after you could tell that you were in the air, free falling. For a moment it was silent and calm before once again becoming violent and shaky as you hit the ground, as you crawled out you realized what happened, the boy had taken off his sweater and discarded it onto the floor, as most teenagers would when they think there\u2019s nothing in their pockets. Luckily you weren\u2019t hurt by the fall and you looked up at him to see what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, time to really get some good sleep, that shitty old sleeping bag didn\u2019t really cut it for me\u201d gladion said aloud as he arrived at the room, he quickly threw his sweater off to the side, unaware of his small stowaway, revealing a worn and torn white tank top that was covered in sweat. He then took off his shoes and socks which were very similarly covered in sweat. Gladion then let out a sigh of relief as he wiggled his toes in the open air \u201cit\u2019s been a while since I took these damn things off, it\u2019s nice to let \u2018em breathe every once and a while\u201d he said to himself as he began to walk across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your rough landing you begin to crawl out of the pocket and the first thing you notice is the terrible smell. \u201cUgh, does this kid own a vileplume or something?\u201d You say to yourself, trying to find out what the smell is. However it doesn\u2019t take long for your question to be answered, as right away you see the giant teens feet headed your way and make the connection on what the smell was. For a moment you were frozen stiff, simply mesmerized by the giant fleshy soles headed your way, dripping with sweat, covered with dirt. After all, this kind of thing was sort of a kink for you, but you were still smart enough to know that you had to run or you would probably die under those perfect feet you were staring at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t look back as you ran, knowing that you wouldn\u2019t be able to look away again, but you could still tell he was quickly gaining on you, with the loud slaps against the hardwood and the smell getting worse by the second. You then saw a small bedside table up ahead, and you immediately jumped for cover, with the edgy teenagers sole crashing down where you had been standing a moment ago. You look up at him, he was clearly going to take another nap in the bed beside you, and then you take one more look at his feet before they disappear by being raised up on top of the bed. \u201cYes! Nows my chance to get his attention, all I have to do is climb up to his face and scream like an exploud until he hears me!\u201d You told yourself, but deep down you maybe wanted to.... explore a bit, just to \u201csatisfy your curiosity\u201d </span></div></div>",

You then see a droplet of sweat dripping down the sole, you quickly lick it up, it tatstes divine... and salty. Finally, you take one last look at the face of the platinum blonde god laying before, just to make sure he wasn\u2019t waking up any time soon and then look back at your destination. Overtaken with lust, You then practically launch your body onto the teenager\u2019s filthy sole, trying to have his flesh all over yours, feeling every last bit of it. The scent of the foot was filling your nostrils with this amazingly awful scent. His sweat was beginning to completely soak the shirt you still had on, but that didn\u2019t matter as long as you could drink that godly sweat as well. Your now erect cock was beginning to twitch as well, so in order to relive that \u201citch\u201d you began to thrust your member in to the moist wrinkles of the foot, feeling more amazing then anything you had ever felt before. It didn\u2019t take long before you reached your peak point and climaxed on his foot, covering a surprising amount of it with your load.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You then decide that while he\u2019s still asleep, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to look around some more, specifically inside of his pants. \u201cI\u2019ve already got the ball rollin, so no point in stopping now\u201d you tell yourself as you crawl into gladion\u2019s pant leg. It\u2019s very hot and cramped inside, and while it is still sweaty, it\u2019s not the kind of sweat that\u2019s worth licking up, this was probably due to the fact that the only thing he wore was the same set of \u201cedgy\u201d black clothing everyday. As you\u2019re crawling, you begin to notice a few things, like how the rest of the boys body smelled too and how there were little holes in his pants all over the place. Whoever this teen was, it seemed like he really couldn\u2019t afford much. But there were other things to deal with at the time as you had just hit his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no turning back now\u201d you thought to yourself as you grabbed ahold of the grey fabric to unveil the second destination in you little \u201ctrip\u201d. Well at least, it would have been unveiled has there not been a forest of platinum blonde hair in the way. That wouldn\u2019t stop you though, you immediately began to trudge through the \u201cbushes\u201d to get to the \u201ctree\u201d in the middle of the \u201cforest\u201d. You\u2019re moving very slow at first as the hairs tangle around your minuscule arms and legs, but you eventually start moving quicker as you walk around the edge of his member. After not much more walking you finally reach your goal, the head of the \u201ctree\u201d. It doesn\u2019t look any different from a normal circumcised dick, except for the fact that it\u2019s 10 times your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it begins to move towards you, you try to run but it quickly catches up to you and you get stuck near the hole from all the sweat. As it turns out, all this commotion in the underwear had began to make the teens cock hard, and not only that, but he was having a wet dream as well. Still asleep, gladion began to take off his clothes so that we could masturbate to his dream. Unluckily for  you, you were still on top when his fingers went around his member and began to stroke. At first it wasn\u2019t too bad and actually kind of fun. But as it got faster and faster it began to get worse, but at the same time you couldn\u2019t help but enjoy it. Just the thought of something like this alone was enough to put a stain in your pants, but the fact that you were now just a plaything for this boy was like a dream \u201ccum\u201d true. It didn\u2019t take long before you began doing the same thing, maybe even faster then him, trying to savour the moment as best you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes but eventually you blew your load first, and simply sat there satisfied. But it wasn\u2019t just going to end there, after all, the teen hadn\u2019t climaxed yet and you were still very close to the hole that it would come out of. You hear him then let out a moan, still asleep somehow, as the white liquids squirt out from the hole behind you and the sheer force of it at your size then sent you flying all the way to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It sent you flying all the way to his shoes which were across the room. \u201cWow, he\u2019s really gonna have a lot to clean up\u201d you say to yourself as you look around where you landed. The ground was damp and squishy, but the place definitely smelled familiar. And that smell was exactly what you needed to connect the dots as to where you were. Without even a second thought, you started to lick the floor, wanting to taste the teenager\u2019s divine foot sweat once again, and combining that with the \u201cseasoning\u201d covering your body after your flight made it even better. But your some common sense kicked in and decided to let you brain take control for a bit and give your dick a break. You were inside his shoe, which was very dangerous as if he put it on ,there would be a possibility of getting violently crushed underneath the same foot you were worshiping earlier. As hot as that might have been, you knew you had to get out as you have a full life ahead of you, and all you needed to do was make it to the building next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began trying to formulate a plan of action. \u201cI could maybe try just climbing out\u201d you think to yourself \u201cbut I\u2019d probably slip on all the sweat that\u2019s soaked into this thing\u201d \u201cI think that at this point my best bet is to walk around and look for a hole or something like that\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladion yawned as he woke up and looked down around his bed. \u201cArceus damnit, I jizzed in my sleep again, I really gotta stop doing this shit\u201d he said to himself out loud, looking at the mess he had made. He had gotten semen all over the floor even to where his shoes were and somehow even in the wrinkles of his feet. \u201cWell whatever, I\u2019ll just go buy some paper towel at the mart next door, clean up and go back to bed before room service gets here\u201d he said to nobody, but he did have a point, after all, it was 3 in the morning. Good thing Pok\u00e9mon centres are open 24 hours. Gladion then got up out of his bed, pulled up his pants, picked up his jacket and grabbed some money he had hidden in the drawer. He was about to put in his shoes when he realized something, \u201cwhere the he\u2019ll did my socks go?\u201d He asked himself, rhetorically \u201cyou know what, it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m literally walking a few meters away\u201d he thought in his head as he slipped his bare feet into his shoes. He noticed a small lump beneath the ball of his left foot, but he didn\u2019t really pay attention to it, it was probably just a rock or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to walk towards the toe end of the shoe looking for a way out while smelling that beautiful scent some more, you heard some loud noises coming from the outside of the shoe. \u201cShit, he\u2019s awake\u201d you say to yourself. You then hear noises of what you think is him talking, but you couldn\u2019t quite make out any words. These loud noises are then followed by short earthquakes one after another, which was obviously him walking around in the hotel room. \u201cPlease, for the love of arceus, don\u2019t put your shoes on\u201d you hoped to yourself, but apparently prayers can\u2019t be heard when you\u2019ve been shrunken down and trapped inside of a shoe as the teen\u2019s godly bare foot comes in through your only light source, without even so much as a sock. You begin to run forwards trying to outrun the impending ceiling of sweaty, smelly, dirty flesh as best you can, but this was most certainly a losing race as the sole landed on top of you. To your surprise, you weren\u2019t reduced to a puddle of blood on the spot, instead you became trapped under the soft ball of the impending foot, face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladion then opened the door of his room and locked it behind him so that if room service tried to come in they wouldn\u2019t be able to see his sticky white mess. He began walking towards the centre, walking as he normally did, it was a walk he could probably do with his eyes closed. After all, most of his supplies comes from this centre, from his food, to coffee, to whatever else he needed, he could usually get it there if Guzma gave him enough money. He walked in through the automatic doors and a familiar tune began to play in his ears. \u201cWell you\u2019re here early glady!\u201d Nurse joy said to him, cheery as always \u201cI told you not to call me that\u201d Gladion grumbled back at her \u201cI just need some paper towels\u201d he said to the man at the nearby mart counter \u201cI spilled a drink\u201d he said, hesitating for a moment. \u201cOk then, lemme just go get some from the back, we haven\u2019t restocked our shelves yet\u201d the mart men said as he walked into the door behind him. \u201cJust hurry up\u201d gladion said, clearly wanting to go back to sleep. The teen the began to tap his foot eagerly. He could feel that pebble under his foot again, it felt wet for some reason, but it sort of made sense considering route 8 was along a coastline. The man then came back out, gladion paid for his towels, walked back to his room, took off his shoes and decided to just clean up in the morning as he got back into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foot landed on top of you, trapping you there, your first thought was \u201cwell shit...\u201d followed by a \u201cI guess this is it then\u201d. But as you looked around the space, or rather lack of space you were in you began to notice the finer details of the teen\u2019s divine foot. It was sort of like a hand in the way that theirs little lines all across it, and the wrinkles were even more noticeable now that they had to scrunch up a little to fit in a confined space, you could even see all the little grains of sand and dirt and lint bits that had gotten stuck there along with you. And all of this wasn\u2019t even mentioning the feeling, it was heavenly, with his warm flesh all over your body once again, absolutely drenching you with sweat and staining you with the smell. Your whole world was this foot, you were even less then a bug to him, and you loved it. Since you had noticed the dirt, you thought you might clean it for him, as a sort of thanks for everything he had unawarely done for you. You stuck your tongue out, preparing to lick when he began what you assumed was walking and the pressure began. The crazy amount of pain you were feeling on your tiny little body wasn\u2019t enough to take you away from what you wanted to do though, you began licking anyways through the pain so that you could taste this divine being again, while once again having your \u201chardened metapod\u201d get into one of his wrinkles. After a while you came again, and you had drank your fill of savoury sweat through the insane amount of pressure. You had flipped over at some point, when he was what you could only assume was him tapping his foot waiting for something, leaving you facing the insole of the shoe. But you were also extremely surprised you hadn\u2019t exploded or at the very least broken something yet, you figured that the only things keeping you alive were the softness of the sole and the softness of the shoe\u2019s interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter even more time with this insane pressure, you finally heard what sounded like a door locking and his jacket being thrown to the floor again. \u201cFinally! I really need some air\u201d you thought to yourself when...</span></div></div>",

Little did you know that all the foot sweat your body had on it had mixed with his and your semen to make some sort of gross makeshift glue. After being raised high into the air you took a deep breath of fresh air, as much as you loved the amazing scent of his sweaty feet, you still needed some real air. It wasn\u2019t long before you looked down at ground below yo and began to panic as you rocketed towards the floor. Luckily, the floor was carpeted as this motel, and you took minimal damage as you hit the ground. This process repeated itself until you were back on the same bed as before. You decided not to move until he fell asleep, as if he woke up it would be a little hard to explain why a tiny naked person covered in jizz was stuck to his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could somewhat see his face from your position, even with a bit of his sweat in your eyes you could tell when he put on the same dead asleep face on and you could now try to leave. But as you tried to struggle and move, you were unintentionally giving the boy\u2019s feet one hell of an itch. And since his hands were too far away, his other foot would have to do. And out of nowhere the edgy teen\u2019s other brilliant sole popped out of nowhere and crashed into you. You immediately began to scream in pain, as the pressure was sudden an unexpected unlike your shoe ride. His other sole began rubbing against you, grinding you into it, forcing more foot sweat into your mouth. The pressure just kept on getting more intense as the two feet squeezed together unconsciously to get rid of an itch. The same feet you had loved and worshiped were now hurting you more then you had ever felt before. You kept screaming, hoping he would notice, but nothing happened. Your arms were the first to go, being smashed on the other sole, being grinded between the two feet becoming nothing but a mixture of blood and foot sweat. \u201cThis is it, this is how I go out\u201d you think to yourself, and sadly, you were correct as you body was smashed and grinded between the teenager\u2019s two giant soles, becoming more of the very dirt that you had tried to clean. The next morning, the boy would have gone on to become one of the most powerful trainers in the region and even travel the far off Kanto, not knowing about the little itch that was mashed between his dirty, smelly, sweaty feet.</span></div></div>",

You then began to think \u201cyou know what, I think I\u2019ll just wait here for now, after all, I didn\u2019t get nearly enough time to look around before he shot me away, might as well catch some sleep\u201d as you began to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes after his \u201cnighttime activity\u201d when gladion woke up and began to adjust his eyes to the light. He looked around and saw that his pants were down along with some sticky white liquid all over the place. It didn\u2019t take him long to figure out what he did in his sleep. \u201cCrap, I must\u2019ve jerked off in my sleep again, guess I\u2019ll have to clean it up\u201d he said quietly as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He reached to the bedside table next to him, trying to grab some tissues, realizing he didn\u2019t have anymore. \u201cDamnit, out again... I really gotta stop doing this kind of stuff\u201d gladion said to himself as he began to get out of bed. He looked down near his crotch, seeing all the stains on his underwear \u201cGuess I\u2019m gonna have to change pair, I was hoping to save that one for next week\u201d he said, somewhat disgusted after realizing what he just said. He then moved his legs over and pulled up his other pair without even looking at them. He felt a bit of a lump underneath his sack but he chose to ignore it, it was probably lint or something. He then reached over to the other side of the bed where he kept all the money guzma gave him from doing team skull things. Shortly after, he walked outside, locked the door behind him and began walking to the Pok\u00e9mon centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having a nice rest when suddenly you felt something cover your body, it was wrinkly, hairy and felt like some sort of bag. Which means he had done exactly what you had hoped he would, put on the pair you were in, allowing you to have some more \u201cfree time\u201d. The only problem was that you were stuck underneath his balls, and while that was nice it wasn\u2019t quite what you were after. You could then tell that he had started walking, as his balls were now moving all over the place on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaldion then went through the automatic red doors of the Pok\u00e9mon centre and began to hear the familiar jingle all centres play on constant repeat. \u201cWell aren\u2019t you here early glady!\u201d Nurse joy said in her usual cheery tone \u201cDon\u2019t call me that\u201d gladion said with a gruff, tired voice, he then walked over to the pokemart counter to buy the things he needed. \u201cI just need some tissues or something\u201d he said as he faked a sniffle \u201cI got a cold\u201d he said, obviously lying. \u201cAlright, just gimmie a second, we don\u2019t usually get customers this early and so we haven\u2019t stocked the shelves yet\u201d the mart man said as he slipped into the back room. As gladion stood by the counter, he began to feel a little tingle in his pants, he was starting to get aroused. He didn\u2019t even know why, as the only girl around was nurse joy, and while she was cute, she wasn\u2019t exactly his type. So he tried his best to hide it while not making it obvious he was adjusting his junk. The clerk came out a few minutes later, he payed for his tissues and left quickly, thankfully without his lower region being noticed. And so gladion ran back to his room quickly, eager to get his member out of his pants, he didn\u2019t know why he feeling so horny, but he didn\u2019t really care, he just wanted it out of his system. He pulled his now throbbing cock out of his pants in front of the table before letting out a large yawn that made his dick fall to the table with an audible splatting noise when it hit it from the precum. He was so hard at the time that he didn\u2019t even need porn, he just went at it where he was standing. He then wrapped his fingers around his cock and began to stroke like it was his last time until he came all over the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teen began to walk around you started to try to shimmy up to his giant cock so that you could have some fun. Of course, it didn\u2019t take long as the same pubic hair that you were getting tangled in could also come in handy as a climbing surface. It didn\u2019t take long for you climb up to the base of the shaft where you took a moment to rest, as I was much harder to move while he was moving as well. After hearing what sounded like voices from up above you, there was suddenly no movement. You assumed that he must\u2019ve been alone now and you began to massage his shaft, not only with your hands, but with the rest of your body. Even here his sweat tasted amazing and the skin here was even smoother then before. It doesn\u2019t take long before the teenager began to get hard, which is when you saw his pale hand come into his pants. But instead of him beginning to jerk off like you wanted, he adjusted his dick\u2019s position instead, which at least put you on top of it. You continued to massage the teenager\u2019s member, watching it grow and grow to the point where it looked longer then 2 buses together (to you). Soon you could tell he started walking again, but much faster, clearly wanting to get somewhere. You hear what sounds like a door slamming shut and then get greeted by the boy opening up his pants, letting you get on the nearby table to watch him in all his glory. However, this glory would quickly come to an end, as you watched your new god raise his arms into the air in a yawn, brining his dick up as well and then nearly right away letting it all fall down towards you. The head of his penis is what lands on you, reducing you to nothing but a splotch of red on his tip. It seemed so much slower however as you watched the giant shaft and head come crashing down towards you, dripping moist with precum. \u201cIf this is how I go, at least I go down happy\u201d you think to yourself as the pre-soaked cock tip lands on you, turning you into nothing but a stain on a dick. When he wrapped his fingers around it, he began pushing your remains towards his hole, where he unleashed his load in front of him, putting your remains amongst his cum on display for nobody but him to see.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You venture inside the tent. Still no one. All that is in the tent is a purse and a sleeping bag -- but even an open tent might shelter you for the night, so you make your way into the tent, towards the end of the sleeping bag. But, as you approach the mouth of the bag, you hear a rustling in the nearby bushes. If it was a wild Pokemon, it would be best to keep a low profile, so you dive into the bag and crawl to a safe distance. The rustling sound turns to rhythmic thumping as whatever it was transferred from forest to open ground. Then you feel the 'ceiling' above shift to one side as a foot came down, then another shift. If it were a Pokemon, it would be bipedal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibility that it was the tent's occupant belatedly came to you, along with a loud rumbling noise -- the zipper closing the tent flap. You were trapped in a tent with an unaware stranger. Great. Suddenly, there was a blinding burst of light as the giant widened the mouth of the sleeping bag by accidentally kicking it. As you ducked down, you got a good glimpse of the tent's owner. It was a dark-haired girl in a red skirt, blue shirt, and white hat. She was barefoot, with a pair of red-striped white shoes and blue socks in her hand. As you watched, the hat came off and --more importantly -- the red skirt came down as well. Despite the fact that you had already had an almost unimpeded view of her panties already, this gesture caught you off-guard. The precious moments to move that were given as the giantess stuffed her unused clothes into her pack were wasted. By the time you had recovered, the humongous girl was sliding into her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far in the sleeping bag had you hidden? </span></div></div>",

And without any warning, the looming girl's body came down, and you were immediately pressed into the sleeping bag by an incredibly soft, yet heavy object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were to guess, you were being held down by this girl's bare breast. Sleeping with a bra on could be uncomfortable you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl settled in, her chest moved along the bottom of the sleeping bag, dragging you underneath the heaving mass of flesh. Despite looking so young, she was rather well developed. After settling in, it went completely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laid there taking in your surroundings (or lack thereof) for a minute or two. You were certainly in a sticky situation now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin layer of sweat was beginning to accumulate between the girl's breasts where you presumed it to be even more hot and stuffy than it was where you were being held. Soon beads of sweat began to slowly dribble down to your confined prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs enjoyable as this was, this was getting to be too much. You began to flail around senselessly, trying to move the impenetrable walls of tit flesh that surrounded you. It was no use, you were only tiring yourself out, now being covered in the girl's sweat and your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a jolt to the fleshy prison around you and you immediately were lifted up out of the sleeping bag, still sticking to the sweaty underboob, as if you weren't humiliated enough already. The cool night air felt good after being stuck in such a steamy place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo giant fingers came from below you and plucked you off the bare breast. They lifted you up to the girl's giant face. You figured she'd look angry or freaked out or....something, but no. Besides a slight surprised look in her eyes, her face was completely emotionless. All she did was stare at you, like she was trying to figure out what to do first in this kind of situation. Her free arm covered up what little it could of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl continued to stare daggers into you. There was a moment of awkwardness between the two of you as you both waited for the other one to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured she might just be bad with words, so you decide to introduce yourself, and explain how you ended up plastered to her boob. You were lucky that she stayed silent so that you could explain yourself fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after all that, still nothing? Did she believe your words? Could she even hear you for that matter? No, she must have. You were incredibly tiny compared to her, but you weren't that small, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm so if you could maybe help me out, at least for tonight, I could really use a place to rest so I can figure out where I am and how I got like this tomorrow.\" you say, slightly confused at this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl offered a small sigh of relief, completely inaudible to normal sized ears. Her eyes, while vacant, didn't appear to harbor any malice, so it seemed you were safe. The thumb and index finger you were being held by released you, and you fell to the girl's awaiting palm below. Her hand was so soft and warm, just like her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to the ground even further down below, a fall from even this height would do irreversible damage to you. You definitely needed her. There was what appeared to be a Trainer ID lying next to a few Pok\u00e9balls, with the name \"Leaf\" on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was probably the girl's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Leaf\", you smile up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a slight smile in return and proceeds to head back to bed. Maybe you'll finally get some words out of her in the morning... </span></div></div>",

Not too big or too small, probably around a high C cup. Maybe once this whole ordeal was over you could ask this girl out, you both seemed to be in your mid-to-late teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your giant captress laid down on her side, her left breast settled on top of you. While it was heavy, it also made you feel safe, as well as incredibly warm. The sweat from earlier started to accumulate between her breasts once again, covering your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple idea of being in an attractive girl's cleavage turned you on quite a bit, but the fact that she so easily trusted you when she found you in her sleeping bag made you rethink doing anything naughty. Plus the soft and moist flesh seemed very sensitive, so any movements you made could easily be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly your head remained exposed to the open, popping out from the canyon of cleavage. The cool night air hitting your face allowed you to stay cool even though your body was practically encased in layers upon layers of hot and sweaty titflesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell asleep to the relaxing motion of Leaf's chest rising up and down, as well as her soothing heartbeat... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning sun caused you to awake from your slumber. You looked up to see the roof of the tent you were in, with the sun's light clearly showing through the fabric. You took a look at your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you was the sleeping face of the girl you \"slept with\". A slight bit of drool was dangling from her lips. Locks of long brown hair cascaded down her collarbone to where you could almost reach one from within your confined space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did you notice the weird sensation all over your body. It seemed the girl's sweat from the previous night had dried on you, causing you to not be able to properly move your arms or legs. You were stuck until Leaf let you out it seemed. What were you, some kind of sponge? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the morning light had hit Leaf's eyelids as well, causing her to stir. A giant shadow ran past you, it was the girl's hand. It moved over her mouth and wiped the drool off her lips as she let out an earth-shaking yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaf!\" you cried out. She couldn't have possibly forgotten about you right...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...?\" Leaf's eyes groggily wandered to the source of the tiny squeak she heard coming from her own cleavage. Her eyes then widened suddenly as she seemed to remember what had transpired the previous evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess teenager's hand plucked you out from between her fleshy hills. Your body offered a bit of resistance as it was a bit plastered to the soft breast flesh from her sweat. You were lifted up slowly and carefully towards Leaf's eyes as she gave you a warm smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Morning.\" Leaf said softly, her voice nearly inaudible. It was the equivalent to hearing a pin drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe your small size allowed you to hear her easier than most could. She had the most soothing voice you could imagine, it calmed your nerves and made your infatuation with her go way up. Surely a girl with such a calm demeanor couldn't harbor any malice, right? You decided to stop being stunned at the revelation that she could actually speak and answer her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good morning Leaf! You have a beautiful voice!\" you say, trying to get her to feel more comfortable talking with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face becomes slightly flushed, and she looks away for a moment before regaining her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....thank you for last night! I slept really well in your umm...well you know, haha...\" you trail off, suddenly feeling really awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was just tired at the time and didn't want to have to deal with you, so she placed you in her cleavage to keep you for later. Leaf's face remained blank. It seemed more likely that she was just comfortable with her body. As expected of such a mature-looking teen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Leaf puts on her clothing, one by one. First, her bra, and then her red skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf then puts on her blue shirt, only leaving her socks, shoes, and hat off at the moment. Leaf puts on her socks, one at a time, before putting on her shoes, leaving her mostly dressed, save for her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just then notice that Leaf's hair is all messy, and just as you observe this Leaf pulls out a hand mirror from her bag and a hair brush, before brushing her hair straight, which she did surprisingly quickly. Leaf puts on her hat, finishing her look before she turned over to look at you with a slight smile. You blush and Leaf notices it, if only slightly. Leaf, taking your blush as a complement, walks back over to you which, considering you were in a tent was like 2 steps, she picks you up and leaves a small kiss on your head, letting out an almost inaudible \"thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling Leaf's lips on your head feels better than you ever imagined it would, her soft lips complementing her voice like the ocean breeze.

You never knew that a foot could be such a piece of art before, yet Leaf\u2019s flawless body was here to prove you wrong, and you were so glad to be proven wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Leaf\u2019s feet alone were so hypnotizing that you didn\u2019t even notice that she has placed them right in front of you almost in you face. Your view was lost within the endless whiteness of her socks and all you could smell was the pleasant scent emanating from her foot. You began having doubts if she even was human, because this level of perfection would considered, but guess who was here to continue to prove you wrong without saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed up a little bit so that your view of her face wouldn\u2019t be obstructed by the top her toes, at least it seemed to way from your angle. Her cheeks were crimson red and was intentional trying to avoid eye contact. You assumed correctly that she was building up courage to ask you something, what she was going to ask you was immediately obvious. When the moment had finally arrived, Leaf made eye contact with you as her cheeks became even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, could you please.... take my socks off?\u201d Leaf said quietly and carefully to avoid stuttering and coming over as shy, which her face did for her. Luckily for her, you began blushing as well, as a girl has never asked you this before. This made her at least feel a little bit more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all.... you would like to have my socks off, won\u2019t you?\u201d Leaf said as she began wiggling her toes in front of you in an attempt to come over as sexy, it worked like a charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure!\u201d You said equally nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed you hands on the horizontal ends of the sock of her right foot and began pulling backwards, and in it\u2019s place was a barefoot that was so beautifully clean that you literally felt yourself getting hypnotized again, until she again had build up the courage to ask you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please... massage my feet? I\u2019m... having troubles with it lately\u201d Leaf said as her cheeks became the center of the sun in terms of redness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course i would... if you weren\u2019t lying to me\u201d you said easily looking through her obvious lie, as her feet is literally spotless and her blushing said enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-i\u2019m sorry, i was too nervous to ask, but this natural for a girlfriend to ask, right?\u201d Leaf said as your face turns red. She hadn\u2019t realized what she had just said until a few seconds later, her face then went through the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this seemed even more absurd to you than your sudden shrinking. Why did she refer herself as your girlfriend? The both of you just met, so she must have misspoken it, right? You thought to yourself, which was going to be proven wrong by.... you guessed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-look, you\u2019re allowed to do w-whatever you want with it, I promise, as l-long as it\u2019s done by you\u201d Leaf said destroying all potential doubts remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began believing that you were still sleeping. Is this real? You thought to yourself afraid of receiving an answer by her again as if she could read your mind. You were struggling to find a reason for her appeared feeling for you, as the two of you just met... at least it was in your case, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this wasn\u2019t her first time meeting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...i.. i\u2019ll do it!\u201d You said determined <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-really?\u201d Leaf said pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course i would, this is natural for a... you know, to do right?\u201d You said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you again\u201d Leaf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then began pressing your fingers into her right barefoot, but instead of laughing, soft moans were the sounds that escaped her mouth. You expected then sensation to be ticklish, and yet.... well, you get the point. Maybe her feet were sensitive to pleasure or she never had a foot massage before. Of course, there\u2019s still the possibility that the foot rub he\u2019s providing is actually good, but he was highly doubting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhh.... that.. feels good\u201d Leaf said even calmer than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it does?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... it really does... can you rub a little bit harder, please?\u201d Leaf asked as you followed her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were both in pure bliss, Leaf never felt so good before and her soft moans encouraged you to continue, and it did until..</span></div></div>",

The heat emanating from her sweaty toes and soles felt like an oven at your size, And yet, it was undeniable wonderful. The smooth skin of her feet, the sweat soaking into your clothes and onto your skin, the amount of pressure she was using on you; it was all beyond wonderful, and the expression you were making was proof of that, same for Leaf herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm, that feels soooooo good. Don\u2019t you agree.... boyfriend?\u201d Leaf said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..... i-i do.... L-Leaf\u201d You replied to her through moans of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm i... a good girlfriend?... do I deserve to have you...as my boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....

But eventually Leaf decided we should transition into the next \u201cevent\u201d, as she might call it. She proceeded to lift her feet off your doll sized body, releasing you from your wonderful prison. You could see the sweat still dripping off her soles and toes. You were trying your hardest to hold yourself back from frantically licking them, because you didn\u2019t want to obliterate the relationship you just had build with her. Then again, why did she call you her boyfriend right after she met you? And another thing: she didn\u2019t really seem surprised by your small presence. Of course, the answer spoke for itself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t her first time meeting you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you didn\u2019t have mind reading abilities of any sort, so you had no way of knowing this otherwise. Unfortunately for you, she proceeded to demonstrate hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You seem flustered over something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.......hmmmm.... i wonder...\u201d Leaf said as she rested her cheek onto the palm, playfully grinning down at you. She then shoved her feet a few inches away from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if it has anything to do... with my sweaty feet, perhaps?\u201d Leaf then teasingly wiggled her toes in front of you witn the same optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body remained entirely motionless. Your unnatural desire and common sense refusal to come over as a creepy pervert were undergoing an intense debate with each other as Leaf\u2019s grin grew wider and wider. And by the looks of it, it seems your common sense was losing the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, my love, you don\u2019t have to hold back. I know how much you want to lick my feet, and that\u2019s okay; I accept you for who you are, because you have accepted me for who i am. Isn\u2019t that right... my love?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....... I guess so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....i\u2019m glad to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you didn\u2019t bother wasting time. You immediately began stroking you tongue all over her soles and toes, licking the sweat off every inch. You barely resemble the person you were before you met her, but you couldn\u2019t care less. Leaf\u2019s happiness was as precious as your own. If this made her happy, then you would continue to do so until the universe collapsed into itself, which isn\u2019t going to happen, as she had already become your universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, After what felt like several hours, you successfully cleaned both of Leaf\u2019s feet. And after taking the time to catch your breath, you announced this to Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful! Who knew you could clean a girl\u2019s feet with your tongue so well? If you keep this up, i might become your first customer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-i\u2019m not planning to become a foot-licker!\u201d You protested against Leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, don\u2019t be afraid. If you want, i could also become your ONLY customer. You\u2019d want that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Leaf said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....it will be a secret of ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan Leaf began laughing hysterically. She honestly didn\u2019t expect you to accept the new role you have gained. Though you were glad she didn\u2019t, as her sweet laugh was music to your doll sized ears, and she luckily continued laughing for a while until she managed to regain some of her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure, just b-between us\u201d Leaf said through shaky words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTragically, she went to pull her feet back and reach for her socks. An immediate sadness was present on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, don\u2019t be sad my love. We\u2019ll resume after we\u2019ve catched some Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I almost forgot. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve spent so much time together just sitting that I forgot my reason for leaving in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you found something better in the process, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, your feet of course\u201d you said teasingly.

Judging by the supplies and the size of the tent, there was only one person here... or there would be, however despite the fire, the bags and some other supplies laying around, you didn\u2019t see any signs of the actual person who was using this campsite. You looked around curiously, wondering if something scared him or her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard the foliage rustling behind you. You looked back quickly but saw nothing. Probably just the wind. You continued to explore the campsite, figuring you might as well check the tent to see if someone was inside of it. You slowly looked around you as you made your way, unable to shake the feeling that something was watching you this whole time. Maybe the noises from earlier had you a little jumpy. But either way it didn\u2019t hurt to be careful, especially in your condition. As you reached the tent, you saw that it appeared to be empty. Taking a careful look around in the dim light you figured this site was simply empty for now. You pondered wether or not you should wait for whoever set this up and get their help, hide in their bag and hitch a ride to civilization, or quietly swipe some food and keep moving. Sad you turned around to exit the tent, however, your heart almost stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding tall at the exit of the tent was a girl with long brunette hair, clad in a black dress and what looked like some extremely short shorts barely peeking out from under her dress. Her long slender legs towered over you as she looked down directly at you with a grin that frightened you a bit. All of a sudden the tossed something at you. \u201cOww!\u201d You cried as the heavy sphere hit you. Did she just... \u201cOww!\u201d Another hit you. She was actually throwing pokeballs at you. \u201cAHH STOP IT IM NOT A POK\u00c9MON!\u201d You shouted up to her as another hit you and pinned you to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there thankful that nothing was broken. The girl seemed to finally stop throwing pokeballs at you so there was another plus, though you weren\u2019t sure if this was entirely a good sign or if the female trainer had something worse in store for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached you, she leaned down, picking up a few of the pokeballs she tossed before focusing on you.</span></div></div>",

Get that right little man. Secondly kick back on the attitude. You think being so small would make you realise you cant just say what you want and thirdly, I'm curious as to why your small. So i am going to help you. Aren't you happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEcstatic\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen not catching your sarcasm went to her campsite. Walking forward to the folding chair she has. You suppose she doesn't look like she would sit on a stump. Sitting down she dropped you onto her lap. Right onto her back dress as you stare at her. At least the stubborn girl is gonna help and not enslave you. Thats a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now start explaining why your small? And make it interesting too?

They are a sign of love after all.\u201d She said looking down at you. It was pretty creepy when you thought about it. She really wanted you to agree to this. And what was that about her making you her slave if you didn\u2019t agree to be her boyfriend? What the heck did she plan on doing to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on just a\u2026\u201d You tried to say, but Green only puckered up her lips in response. \u201cHey! You can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d But your cries fell on deaf ears, it was pretty clear that she would only hear what she wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have tried to resist and hold out your hands if you could move them at all, they were firmly held in Green\u2019s grip. Her lips pressed against your face, completely covering it with her big, soft, wet lips. \u201cMmmmmm\u2026\u201d Was all that you could hear as she shoved your face between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked on your face for a few seconds before pulling you back away with an audible pop. She giggled, \u201cGirls certainly like kisses too.\u201d Her lips quickly approached again before you could even think about saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was already soaked with her saliva after the first kiss, and as she enveloped you again between her squishy lips. This time though her lips parted as the tip of her tongue pressed against your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed you for so long that you were afraid that you were going to run out of breath, but thankfully she eventually relented and let you collapse into the palm of her hands. As you tried to catch your breath, Green was far from done and she loomed closer again as she planted a long wet kiss against your neck and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and looked down on you, but didn\u2019t say anything. She just leaned back in for some more kisses. You quickly lost count as she started to smother every inch of your body with her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a miracle that she didn\u2019t notice the stiffness of your crotch, which despite how wrong this still felt, you were only a guy and couldn\u2019t help it. You couldn\u2019t believe yourself, you were enjoying this. At least your body was. And Green sure as hell was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for the grand finale\u2026\u201d Green suddenly said after leaning her head back to breathe. You didn\u2019t even bother to protest as her lips once again drew closer and pressed against your face, smothering more than just your vision. You waited for her to finish, but she seemed intent on outdoing all of her previous kisses, and before long your lungs were burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much you could do, even with your hands-free, your struggles seemed like nothing to her. You tried to scream, but you could barely hear yourself over the sound of her smooching. For a brief moment, as silly as it was, you thought you might die here. The kiss of death, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a loud pop that probably outdid all of the previous ones Green released you and allowed you to breathe. She seemed a bit winded herself, but she laughed seeing the state you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you look like a mess. I guess my kisses were a bit much for ya.\u201d She giggled, \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She said expectantly as you caught your breath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a backpack and a couple Pokeballs near her. You feel like its safe to assume this girl was a young trainer who just started her journey. She was opening a bag of snacks as you see this as your chance. She was sitting on the ground and super easy to get the attention of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward you plant to just run up to her and get her attention but stop when you see something much bigger come into sight. A Giant Chikorita!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika. Chi\u201d Chikorita said as it moved closer to her, no doubt her starter pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Chikorita, you can have some.\u201d She said handing a snack to her Pokemon. The Chikorita ate it up as you smile at the exchange. It was rather cute to be honest. The girl seems  nice and friendly. Needless to say you have no doubt that you want to get her attention. You get closer to the two as neither noticed your presence. You get right behind the giant Chikorita as you plan to move through her legs to get to her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Chikorita, now sit\u201d You hear the girl say as your eyes go wide. If Chikorita sits down there she's gonna be sitting down right on top of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought got interrupted as you get smushed into the dirt. The large mound of fat that was Chikorita landing on top of you and pinning you down. Under the grass\u2019s Pokemon buttocks you try to struggle out however you barely could make any ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita outside was getting fed, enjoying ever bite as she gets patted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Chikorita, i know that you want to face Falknor but i think you should leave it to someone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika!\u201d Chikorita said getting up annoyed. Finally getting off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know your angry but think about. He's a Flying type gym leader and your grass type. You'll be at a disadvantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika! Rita Ri Ta!\u201d It pretest as you move closer planning on getting the trainers attention before it gets any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you want to face our first gym leader but please look at it from my point of view. What we should do is train up the Hoothoot i just caught and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika! Chika! Chika!\u201d It said repeatedly shaking its head no, the leaf on its head going around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't angry Chikorita. Look ill get more food and then hopefully we can talk about this. Okay?\u201d The girl said as she stood up to her height and went to the tent. Grabbing more snacks from her tent as she tries to figure another way to tell her stubborn Chikorita. This was gonna be her first gym battle and she doesn't want to fail. Not to mention she's a bit stressed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside your waiting for the girl to come back, and ____________________</span></div></div>",

You go to where she was sitting and stand next to the spot. Your out in the open so your really confident that she will see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thats the thing... you were out in the open. Able for anyone to see you, or more like any Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika....\u201d You hear her Chikorita say as you turn around and look at the giant female Pokemon. She was staring right at you with a surprised look. Your sure she's never seen someone so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita\u201d Her trainer said. \u201cIm still looking for more snacks, just wait a second okay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chikorita then looked back at you and to your horror grew a wicked smile. It was scaring you a lot as you don't want to be anywhere near you. You've decided to ditch your plan to get her trainers help as you start running away. Chikorita saw this and chase after you. Both of you running into the tall grass as the campsite was looking more barren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Chikorita, i have some swinub chocolates!. Chikorita? Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep running with the giant mound of a leaf behind you, Chikorita gained ground easily on you as she stomped right in front of you. Blocking your paths as it smirks down at you. You try to run away the other way but she was faster then you, moving around to block that path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just uh.... please back up\u201d You say to her, she then started to use Vine Whip and generate a vine out of nowhere. Blocking your way and wrapping you up. It lifts you off of the ground and right in front of her face. You struggle within the grip but couldn't do anything to break this Pokemon\u2019s attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChika\u201d She said to you as you try to wait for her trainer to come looking. Chikorita didn't share the same idea of waiting as you saw it open its mouth. From there you know exactly whats coming as it as what you feared from the very beginning. Being in the wild and being lunch to a giant Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it was something cute like a Chikorita rather then a Beedrill or a Snubbel. Chikorita whips her wine and lets go of you, throwing you into her mouth as you scream in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fortunately luck was on your side as she closed her mouth far to early and trapped your body from going in. One side of you looking at the inside of the Pokemon\u2019s mouth while the other side kicking and thrashing for the whole world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChikorita smiled to itself as it felt your struggles, playfully she wanted to leave you in there for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikortia, there you are. You know just cause your angry doesn't give you permission to run off by yourself\u201d Kris says coming back and spotting ___________</span></div></div>",

So when Kris finally caught up to her pokemon she was surprised to see something squirming sticking out of her mouth. \"Chikorita what is that?\" The little grass type wasn't too keep on losing her toy so quickly. Before Kris could fully confront her little pocket monster, the grass creature bolted off sprinting as quickly as her legs would carry her. \"Hey you get back here!\" You could barely make out the shouting from outside your damp prison. Everything was shaking wildly as your captures tried to elude her trainer just long enough to hide you. But it was no use. The girl had the speed and endurance to keep right on Chikorita's tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the grass type was cornered. Trapped against the steep rocky side of a hill. As Kris got closer, Chikorita quickly sucked your legs into her mouth and attempted to keep you hidden under her tongue. You tried calling for help, but Chikorita pressed her tongue down more to silence you. Kris inspected her pokemon, noticing that there was no longer anything sticking out of Chikorita's mouth. This meant that the pokemon either spit whatever it was out during the chase or she's trying to keep it hidden. And Kris had a really good idea of where it was being hidden. \"Open your mouth.\" she ordered. Chikorita quickly obeyed, trying to keep you hidden under her tongue. Kris looked inside, not seeing anything right away. Still she only took a brief glance and already noticed that she was acting weird with keeping her tongue over one specific spot. The blue haired girl gingerly slid her hand inside trying to feel around before sliding a finger under the tongue and feeling her prize. Chikorita's eyes widened, but it was too late. Her trainer had found her toy and was already pulling it out. The leaf creature looked down in shame as Kris finally inspected whatever ti was that gave her starter such a fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped for air as you were pulled back outside, overjoyed to finally be out of that creature's mouth.Kris stared at your tiny form in disbelief. It was like a doll... but it felt like real skin... and it was moving. Could it really be alive? Is this an actual tiny person? She forgot all about the hassle her pokemon put her through a few minutes ago as her full attention was on you. You felt a finger poking you in several spots, but thankfully nothing painful. At last she spoke. \"What are you?\" that was all she managed to get out. it was clear she was trying to think of all the possibilities but wasn't sure what else to ask. \"I'm a person.... like you.\" you managed to respond as you slowly got used to the light and her prodding. \"But... you're teensy.\" You sighed. \"I don't know how this happened to me. I swear I was normal sized like you are. I just kinda woke up like this somewhere in these woods. I was hoping to get some help when I saw your camp.\" Kris put her hand to her chin as she though this through. It was certainly a lot for her to take in. Suddenly she looked back down at her pokemon. The same one who 'helped' her find you. She figured the first order of business would be doing something about the nervous looking Chikorita.</span></div></div>",

Its embarrassing her honestly, that her Pokemon would even consider that. You watch as her gaze moved over to her Pokemon who was trying to play it all natural and coy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita, I'm really disappointed with you. This is a poor shrunken fella. How could you even think of chewing on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiko...\u201d It said as its being scolded. Its eyes on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm gonna have to put you back in your Pokeball until were done. Im sure he doesn't want to be anywhere near you right now\u201d Kris said reaching for her Pokeball with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRita!\u201d It panicked. You could hear it in the Pokemon\u2019s voice. You assume any time not battling and out of the Pokeball is well wanted. And her sad eyes were getting to you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is the only way your gonna learn\u201d She said grabbing the ball and pulling it out \u201cIm putting you in timeout!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u201d You say getting the trainers attention \u201cI mean she's only a first form Pokemon and she doesn't look that old. She probably doesn't know any better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u201d The girl said \u201cBut she ate you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did and i didn't like that but you know, as long as she doesn't do it again its fine right?\u201d You say to her. The Trainer looked at you until she brought her hand down and forward to the grass type. The giant Chikorita once again looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, he's convinced me to let you stay out. But you've got to apologise to him for putting him in your mouth. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiko! Chiko Rit Rita\u201d It said as you just assume that was an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now thank him for convincing me to keep you out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiko!\u201d It said as the joy in its voice made you know it was thankful. You get pulled away from the Pokemon as you found yourself held close to the girl. Standing up to her full height as she plans to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, lets go back to the camp so we can figure this all out. Lets Go Chikorita\u201d The trainer said. The three of you traveled back. She had her eyes on you on most of the trip, just staring at you and holding you kind of protectively. She didn't even bother looking at her Pokemon who was jumping around, clearly very happy and fortunate to still be out of its Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce arriving at the Camp, the trainer sat back on the ground and held you close. Her Chikorita coming up as you don't fear the Pokemon as much now. Now thats its Trainer is near and its been scolded about eating you. \u201cThere now we can talk safely, um.... you said you got small like this but you don't know. Are you sure? I mean if you think really hard maybe you can figure it out... uh sorry whats your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest i don't know my name, or my home or anything. Im just drawing a blank everytime i even try to think\u201d You told the girl as she didn't look happy at the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That much suck, not knowing anything about yourself.\u201d She said feeling bad, before lighting up. \u201cWell maybe you want to know something about me! My name is Kris. This is my Chikorita, and were on a journey to become the Johto League Champion! Or Kanto League? Im still bit fuzzy on the details. Anyway I'm from New Bark Town, my hair is naturally this colour and this style and i just started my Pokemon journey recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her talk about herself did calm you about, just letting you know something about someone. Something you can't for anyone else \u201cJust started your journey, do you have a gym badge yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris lit up, talking about Pokemon \u201cWell not yet, but were approaching our first one. Falkner. He's the Gym leader at Violet City and he's gonna be our first one. He uses flying type from what I've been told. Now hold on, your probably thinking \u2018Isn't Grass weak to Flying, you can't win\u2019 Well what i have to say that is I've got a second Pokemon. Its a Hoothoot we just caught. Now its not as trained up as Chikorita is but were gonna put in some effort in the next coming days. Make the Hoothoot the best. Ive read a lot about Hoothoot\u2019s so I'm thinking I'm gonna teach it Hynosis and work off combos with that. I was thinking about-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKris, you really like Pokemon don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d She said \u201cbeing Champion\u2019s my dream.

You see the giant flying Pokemon come down and land in front of you. Standing on one foot and twitching its head. it didn't take long for the Owl Pokemon to see you. Hopping on its foot as Chikorita lowered its head, letting you see the owl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris crouching down to introduce you two \u201cHoothoot, this is (Your Name). He's gonna be coming with us from now on. (Your Name) this is Hoothoot\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoot...Hoot\u201d It said as you move on Chikorita\u2019s back.

She then grabbed her Pokeballs and got to work. Returning both of them as she moved to her tent. After setting everything up she entered. She placed you onto her sleeping bag as you watch her take off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kris, are you sure... don't you want me to close my eyes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mind, i like eyes on me actually\u201d She joked as she took off her clothes. Starting with her hat she took it off, then lowering her hair straight down her body. Then moving over to her clothes she took them all off. Until finally she was left in her yellow underwear. A bra and a pair of panties. She was in nothing but her underwear as she turned to you \u201cAren't you gonna take off your clothes as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, sure...\u201d You say as you did just that, getting into your boxers as you two were ready for bed. She put her clothes in the corner and followed with yours. Once you two were ready she crawled into her sleeping bag. When she was in and her feet was at the bottom she grabbed you. Putting you right near her face she placed you on her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is the start of a good friendship. To be honest I'm really happy about this, as much as i love Chikorita and Hoothoot, they're not the best conversationists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I'm glad to be with you, but i got to say.. I'm a little cold. Unlike you i don't have a blanket over me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right\u201d She said noticing that grabbing you as she pulled you up to her face \u201cIll get you warm, just promise you won't do anything weird to my body\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise?\u201d You say a little confused. Moving forward she brought you down into the sleeping bag, right near her feet as it a lot warmer down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping you she went back up, kicking her feet around as she stopped \u201cGoodnight\u201d She said going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Good night Kris.\u201d You shout as you were in the bag. Getting down you sleep onto the soft floor. With her feet hanging right over you as you have to try and ignore them. Ignore their smell and go to sleep right now. Closing your eyes you drift off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You call out to your female companions and tell them that you guys should set up camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agree, but just as you guys are looking for a clearing to set your tents you see a Pokecenter in the middle of the forest. Sure, it wasn't uncommon for the league to put Pokecenters in the middle of long roads between towns but it was still really convenient timing, all things considered. You had no reason to doubt it and desired to sleep indoors tonight though, so you kept your doubts to yourself. Before you guys entered, however, Kaitlyn picked you off Cyndaquill's head. Cyndaquill immediately got angry at being separated from her trainer, so Kaitlyn just called her back into her pokeball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up inquisitively at Kaitlyn and she looks back, before saying, \"If I just left you there, everyone would have a clear shot of you, and with evil teams like Team Rocket around, that would just be asking to get you kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to yourself at such logic. Sure, you didn't doubt Kaitlyn and Kris wouldn't try to protect you but they were still only beginning trainers, not at all a match for Rocket higher ups.

She was still upset about earlier, but now she had the perfect little thing to take all this stress and aggression out on. Suddenly the both of you heard the voice of her trainer calling out to her.

With no other options left in mind, the massive grass type starter spit you out into the grass and looked back towards her trainer. Your landing was thankfully soft, but the Chikorita's breath and saliva both lingered on you as you gasped for real air. As Kris saw her small pokemon smiling up at her she smiled back. \"There you go. I'm glad you were able to get over that on your own. Just be careful next time okay. Who knows what could be hiding in the grass?\" Chikorita seemed to smirk slightly at this question. She knew exactly what, or who in this case, was trying to hide in the tall grass. Trying to regain his bearings before trying to escape. As Kris turned around and walked back to the camp, you soon saw a shadow looming over you as Chikorita immediately found her new toy. You tried to scream, but with her vines you were both grabbed and silenced as the little monster hid you under her head leaf and ran after Kris with more energy than normal.</span></div></div>",

Its about time for sleep anyway\u201d Lyra said as she seemed pretty happy with the idea, at least thats what her smile says to you. She smiled so kindly but you couldn't help but feel wrong about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d You say to her honestly \u201cIm okay if you just got a sock and made a little makeshift bed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo i want you to sleep with me!\u201d She said with a smile \u201cI don't take up much room on my air mattress and its the very least i can do, after putting you though that ordeal\u201d Lyra said as she stood up, turning around and dropping you down onto the stump. Seeing her smile \u201cOkay, I'm gonna get this fire then we can sleep okay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went to a bucket she had planned and pour it out, making it a lot more darker. She picked you up as she went to the tent. Opening it up you saw her Air Mattress she was talking about, not to mention that she might of not been entirely honest about the size. Sure you don't take up much room but it looks like she can barely fit on it as it is. Walking forward Lyra gently dropped you down onto it. Letting you bounce a bit. Since your body was tired you just collapsed on the most comfortable thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I'm gonna get changed, just don't look okay\u201d Lyra said as she didn't seem even bothered with that idea. She either trusts you completly or she's open with it. Regardless you didn't look, in fact you were too tired to move. And this Mattress at least at your size was beyond comfortable. By the time Lyra came down onto the Mattress, she was in her night gown. It was yellow with flowers on. her hat to the side and her hair let down as she got comfortable for herself. Laying down you bounced a bit, enough to disturb you as you got up. Looking at the girl. She placed her head on the side as she got comfortable. Smiling at you as you do think your liking her smile. Its so warm and caring, not to mention it just calms you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow its time for sleep, when we wake up we can figure out what to do with you.\u201d Lyra said with a smile, until she started to think about it \u201cBut if I'm being honest i have no idea how you got this size, i guess a Pokemon could of done it but i don't know which ones. Maybe a psychic type if i were to make a guess\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't remember anything honestly, could be a Pokemon for all i know\u201d You say to her, laying down on your side to talk to her giant face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra cheered to herself as she got happy \u201cOh imagine if i caught it! Not only would you be bigger again but i would also get an awesome Pokemon. I could drive through the rest of the Gym Leaders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGym Leaders, are you a trainer?\u201d You ask her surprised this didn't come up before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah i am, i have two badges and i.... you know what we can talk about this in the morning. For now we need to sleep.\u201d Lyra said deciding. You didn't have problem as you could go for a sleep. Lyra seeing you laying near the edge wasn't happy about it. Grabbing you with her fingers she dropped you down right next to her face on the pillow. So close you can feel her warm breath on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra, little warning next time?\u201d You say to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just didn't want you falling off. Plus the pillow i imagine would be more comfortable. Anyway good night, see you in the morning\u201d Lyra said, going to sleep and closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Lyra\u201d You say back to her as you had a bit harder time, you just started at her face as you took a bit of mental thought with you to your sleep. You've gotten Lyra\u2019s attention, which was good. She seems nice but your not sure if she's capable of actually helping you.<br>\r\n\u2028Still she's your best offer right now. Going to sleep you close your eyes, ignoring the hot breath being sent your way as you drifted off too. Your mind still trying to search for ideas on where to go to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you did come to an idea in your sleep. A plan as of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will ____________</span></div></div>",

The sun has completely settled down in the meantime, soon replaced by the pale moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect place...\" you hear the brunette giantess mutter as she sits down on a log, releasing you from her fist, letting you sit down on her gloved palm. <br>\r\n\"My name's May, by the way.

You tell her your name.<br>\r\n\"Cute name for a cute little guy such as yourself.\" she giggles, making you blush furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I said, this is a perfect place to camp in tonight.\" with that, the young giantess gets up from the log she was sitting on and sets you down on it, before reaching for her bag and starting to unpack her stuff, giving you a clear view of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush grows wider as May starts pitching a cobalt blue tent. Then, she collects some breaches, probably fallen from the high trees, and lights a fire.<br>\r\n\"Well then, now that's settled...\" May says, sitting down next to you. She then picks you and sets you down on her lap.<br>\r\n\"... I think you must be hungry.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets out a chocolate bar from her bag and hands you three pieces.<br>\r\n\"That should be enough to fill you up little one. Eat up!\" she beams.

Your eyes open as you glance at your surroundings, finding yourself in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you look around, trying to find a way out of wherever you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's when memories of yesterday start to get you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou distinctly remember that you were shrunken down to a minuscule size by that mysterious light. And then, your brain puts a face to a name: May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette girl who kindly offered her help in this dire situation upon just meeting you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new memory takes place in your mind: you going to sleep with May in her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you fully awake, noticing something odd. A question spontaneously forms in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where is May?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, your ears catch the cheerful humming you've already heard. It doesn't take long for you to put two and two together: May must have woken up before you, and she left you sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means, you must be still in her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around again, trying to find an exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fix on a single glimmer of light, seeping into the sleeping bag from a small hole. Very probably, May left her sleeping bag closed to not let the light bother you. But she left a tiny hole so that you could keep breathing, and you could climb out once you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently thanking your 'captress', you make your way to the small hole, the bright sunshine momentarily blinding you. You blink a few times, before opening the hole with both hands and getting out of the bedroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted by the side of May's tent. She's not in here either. Her bag is laying on the soft ground, but there's no sign of the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the humming reaches your ears. It's stronger than ever here, and it's very, very soothing. You almost feel like going to sleep again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the feeling, you start walking towards the entrance of the tent, soon getting outside. The bright light momentarily blinds you, before your eyes adjust to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you notice the same person you've been searching for, sitting on a stump. She's fully dressed, only her bandana is missing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay is in fact brushing her brown hair, her eyes closed as she hums merrily. You take a moment to admire the brunette giantess in all her beauty. She looks so serene...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling observed, the giantess opens her blue eyes and looks around, spotting you staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile takes place on her visage as she giggles softly.<br>\r\n\"Morning!\" she exclaims cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" you say, sounding much like a Slowpoke who just yawned.<br>\r\n\"Eh... mornin'...\" you stammer awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay giggles again.<br>\r\n\"Admiring the view?\" she teases, sending you in a state of deep embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, the giant girl gets up and discards her brush as she moves over you and picks you up.<br>\r\n\"You were sleeping like a rock when I woke up,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"So I decided to let you sleep a while more,\" a finger from her free hand finds its way on your head as she gently caresses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the physical contact.<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry now,\" May continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if wanting to reply on its own, your stomach growls in this precise moment. <br>\r\n\"Hehe, yes...\" you say her, making her giggle politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" May asks you as she finishes tying up her bandana while you gulp down the remains of the apple slice she gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you respond, before glancing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now we can talk,\" she says, getting up from the stump and walking in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... about?\" you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you, obviously,\" she says. The subject of the conversation takes you by surprise, but May continues.<br>\r\n\"You're so small and vulnerable like this. You clearly need someone to keep an eye on you while taking care of you,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"And...?\" you ask, hoping she'll get it without you saying it. Luckily, she seems to understand as she starts giggling.<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'd be more than willing to help!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank I guess...\" you reply as you rub the back of your head. Such display of kindness has surely caught you off guard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, before looking around.<br>\r\n\"May? Sorry for asking, but... how much longer are we staying here?... Because... We're not staying in the woods, right?\" you ask, before cursing your stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay just giggles.<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" she replies.</span></div></div>",

The embarrassment seemed to have shut down your vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to May's predictions, it was nighttime when she finally stepped into Littleroot Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you leave here?\" you asked drowsily, feeling quite tired despite the fact that you didn't actually do anything but staying between May's breasts all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure you fell asleep a couple times, and you found that you didn't mind it one bit: May's breasts felt like two soft mattresses, with the additional lullaby sung by her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, you were growing tired of your entrapment, which had grown quite sweaty due May walking around in the woods all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" May replied, pausing to let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in front of a house, reaching inside her pocket for a key that was bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's not home,\" she explained, though you could already tell: all lights were out inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay unlocked the door and stepped inside her house, before closing it behind her and locking it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the brunette girl dropped her bag to the floor. It landed with a thud, while its owner dropped her key on a coffee table in front of a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, May finally pulled you out of her cleavage and slid on the couch, sighing deeply, but in a satisfied manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home...\" she muttered with a smile while she lowered the hand holding you as she set you on the couch beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt in need of a bath, your stomach was asking for food for a while and your throat was practically dry, but you didn't speak your needs, preferring looking around instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was nothing out of ordinary... aside from the fact it was absolutely gigantic, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place,\" you timidly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiled at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It's not much, but it's home,\" she replied, before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, that walk really tired me out. I'm sorry from all sides...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis piqued your interest, and it gave you an idea as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little sign of your appreciation to May for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe I could... help you out with that?\" you offered, causing her to look at you with a blush, an expression between surprise and hilarity on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

But you didn\u2019t really seem to be accomplishing much, and May seemed to notice. \u201cCan you push a little harder?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your firmly planted your feet on either side of the knot, you pressed down with all of your strength. \u201cAhhh, that felt good.\u201d May mused, clearly enjoying this. You moved up slightly along her back and firmly pressed into her back. \u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to slowly but surely move along her back, rubbing and forcefully pressing into her back muscles along the way. The task at hand absorbed all of your attention, and you almost didn\u2019t notice the shadow of May\u2019s hand as she unbuckled her bra. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d She casually said, before continuing her relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked at her bare back where her bra strap had previously covered in front of you for a few seconds before continuing you massaging. May occasionally giggled, moan, or reacted to your small movements as you continued, and eventually reached her left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you moved to her right side. \u201cWow, you\u2019re already halfway there,\u201d May said, even though it felt like you had been doing this for a long time by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were confident in what you were doing at this point, it didn\u2019t make things go much faster. Her back was as big as a large room for you. But eventually, you made your way along her slender back to her hip, which was about where you started on the other side.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiled, her bright blue eyes sparkling cheerfully,<br>\r\n\"Well, you did a wonderful job back there, so I guess I have to keep my promise now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement still didn't ring a bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said? We're going to take a nice long bath.\" she clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you did remember that... and for a second, your mind processed the image of a naked May in a bathtub full of hot water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks flared up to indescribable hot levels as your mind flashed with perverted image of the beautiful giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lucky she was no psychic trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were called back to reality thanks to the brunette's hand shaking. You took notice that she was walking, holding you in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl opened a door, which led to her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here for a moment...\" May said in a calm tone as she placed you down on the sink, before bending to turn on the water in the tub, inadvertently (or not?) giving you a pretty good view of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed massively at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirtless giantess then turned around while the tub behind her began steaming as hot water filled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you turn around a sec? I need to undress... and you should too.\" she said. You nearly choked on your saliva; Your already red cheeks were about to erupt like a volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you asked, dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Were you thinking about bathing with your clothes on?\" May asked with a giggle,<br>\r\n\"You're funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you hastily turned around and started undressing slowly, taking as much time as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you came the sounds of May undressing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you heard the unmistakable sound of splashing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little one,\" May's quiet voice reached your ears again, leading you to cover your fully exposed crotch with both hands and turn around, only to see that it was an unnecessary action; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes met with the stunning sight you had imagined before, May laying into the hot water with clouds of steam raising from the water around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was holding out a hand towards the edge of the sink, and she had her eyes closed, while her shorts, shoes, socks and bra were forming a small pile at the foot of the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her eyes being closed, you kept your hands against your growing crotch as you awkwardly walked towards the hand you were offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hopped onto it and jumped on May's open palm; feeling your small body dropping on her hand, the giantess giggled and moved her hand towards the tub, before she dropped you into the hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steaming liquid stung your skin immediately, but you soon found a pleasing sensation in the sudden warmth spreading throughout your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Isn't this nice?\" May asked as her eyelids parted ways, letting her blue eyes be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't initially respond, too busy on admiring May; the water did a good job hiding her nethers, but at the same time it did not a good work covering her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the twin hills in all their beauty, her nipples pointing towards you, as if beckoning for you to get closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for May to realize what you were gawking at, and a deep blush spread across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't mind though. If this little person was going to live with her, something like this had to happen for sure, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must assume I look good to you?\" she timidly asked, drawing your gaze off her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what you just did and what she just said, you too blushed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah,\" you awkwardly replied, wishing you could just vanish right there and then.<br>\r\n\"You're... pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you pretty much expected May's hand to come down on you, push you underwater and keep you there until you drowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut such thing never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, May smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You are pretty cute yourself,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your mind could process the compliment, you were grabbed by the giantess' arms and brought against her bosom as she embraced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you felt like you were about to explode from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what was happening to your life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" May's voice spoke again,<br>\r\n\"Why not use this moment to try and get to know each other better? I know you from a day or so, but I don't know pretty much anything about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense, you figured. You too knew practically nothing of the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\" you stuttered in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was literally the least awkward thing you did today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour, you just floated there against the giantess, talking about your life before you shrunk while she told you about her own life as a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the water began cooling down, May broke her embrace and placed your dripping, naked body back on the sink, before she grabbed a small towel she had previously placed near the tub and handed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you'll have to use the same clothes now, because I haven't got any that would fit someone so small,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was understandable. After all, being a shrunken human must be a really rare thing... of all people, why you, you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped the small (yet still giant) towel around your whole body and began drying yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you took it off, May was out of the tub with a rather large towel wrapped around her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna get dressed...\" she said you while looking away to avoid glancing at your naked self... though you were sure you saw the corner of her eye pointing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, May left the bathroom and you in it, allowing you to walk freely towards your own like of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer feeling awkward, you began dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, May came back into the bathroom, wearing a pink bra and pink shorts, a pink shirt in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment.\" she said you while taking our a hairdryer and proceeding to dry her still dripping hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she put on her pink shirt as well and looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like she had done before, she extended a hand towards the sink and let you climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even spoke, you wondered what she was going to do with you next.</span></div></div>",

The crush of death never came, and then you wondered if she was going to eat you next. That, too, never happened; it seemed like you were gently set down next to the bowl.

You said this to May, and she all but gave you the sincerest smile; it looked like you had truly touched her with your words. With stars in her eyes, May gently hoisted you up to her gaze with that same smile practically glued to her face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks little guy,\" she said. \"That means a lot. I promise that you'll never have to worry about anything dangerous with me around. We'll get you back to normal in no time, and then we'll be able to do all sorts of things as boyfriend and girlfriend when we get the chance.\" Boyfriend and girlfriend she said, huh? Considering how comfortable she was with what she had already shown you, perhaps she was used to moving fast, but despite it all you actually didn't mind it all too much. It was clear that she trusted you enough on an intimate level and that helped you trust her all the more. \"Here, I'll let you grab as much cereal as you need\u2014I'll finish the rest.\" You graciously thanked May as she held you in one hand while lightly tipping her bowl over with the other, asking for a thumbs up on when you were full. That came rather quickly with so much milk pouring from the bowl into your tiny self, and after assuring the girl that you've had your fill she went to town on her breakfast and finished it in record speed, sighing to herself in satisfaction as she slouched in her seat. A sudden burp caught her off guard and she moved her hand to cover her mouth out of embarrassment, but you didn't pay it any mind. You tried belting out a belch yourself, but all it ever came out sounding like was a baby's burp\u2014at least to May; this nearly had her falling out of her chair laughing but it was all in good-natured fun. You were glad that you had someone you could still have fun with even in your shrunken-down size. Silently, you thanked whatever powers that be for giving you into the care of someone like May.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, those Froot Loops really hit the spot,\" May said. \"How was it for you?\" You replied that it was alright, only for May to make a face at you. \"Alright?! Are you kidding me\u2014Froot Loops are the best thing since underwear! What kind of diet did you grow up on?\" You had to choke back a scoff at that one, but May's snickering face meant she caught it anyhow. \"Aw, come on\u2014I was just kidding. Anyways, there's really not much else I need to do for the day since Mom and Dad won't be back for another week\u2014give or take a day or two. Until then I'm mostly just expected to keep the house nice and clean by the time they get back from their trip and to lock up if I need to be out for some time.\" May seemed to not know what to do for the day, but then you saw the proverbial light bulb light up in her eyes soon enough. She immediately turned to you and not a moment sooner did a grin light her face up. \"Well, I do have the house all to myself for the week, and I also have a cute little boyfriend with me who I can keep out of sight well enough\u2026Oooh, we can do secret dates without anyone bugging us. Hmm\u2026 Or, maybe I can bring you along to see a few Pokemon battles\u2014that's always fun! Of course, we could always just chill in the house, at least until you feel comfortable enough to go outside. I'll be fine with whatever you want to do\u2014no pressure here.\" It was true that you weren't entirely comfortable with going outside just yet, it could help with May taking you around here and there. And hey, if May was going to be your girlfriend, why not go out on a date with her? It sounded like a private date could be lots of fun. Then of course there was the idea of watching Pokemon Battles\u2014those were especially dangerous for you but they could also be quite exciting. Thinking about it for a good spell, you decided that you wanted to spend the day by\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Let's just go to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention, your mind went back to yesterday, when you actually slept with May in her sleeping bag; now, you were going to share a bed, like she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cheeks flushed bright red, causing May to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" you stuttered, <br>\r\n\"You do have a point. I'm beat, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay offered a drowsy smile as she arrived to a room that could only be her bedroom; it wasn't too small, and was mostly occupied by May's bed, which had dark blue bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, a colossal closet rested against a wall. Several shelves were on the walls, showing contest ribbons and even badges, collected from unknown gym leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered which objective this girl pursued in her life as a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned her about it and she simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more into pokemon contests,\" she explained, <br>\r\n\"Though I don't mind taking on gyms either.

For now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay trailed off and approached her bed, before pulling back the blankets. You watched her as she slid into the bed, letting the covers fall back all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay spent the next few moments getting into a comfortable position before she looked back at you with a hazy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, gently moving you towards her pillow, placing you right in front of her looming face before pulling a portion of the blanket over your body,<br>\r\n\"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'night.\" you replied, watching as May closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, you heard her snoring softly, almost soothingly; following her example, you yawned, closed your eyes and fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wake up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned in your sleep as a voice ran in your ears, but you didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get up, tiny; the sun's shining and we have a beautiful day ahead of us,\" the voice insisted, causing you to shift on your side in your sleep, desperately trying to cling to whatever dream you were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempts to ignore it seemed to have effect, because the voice didn't speak anymore; but it was when something round and thick pressed into your side with the strength of an Infernape that you realized that your attempts to catch five more minutes of shut eye were vane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting in pain, you opened your eyes in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, your blurry vision couldn't distinguish things well; but, after a vigorous rub of your eyes, you managed to see a certain giantess looming above you, with on knee on her bed and her other leg on the floor, a playful smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a heavy sleeper?\" May teased, <br>\r\n\"And a cute one as well. Good morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned, muttering a drowsy 'good morning' in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to notice something different about May the next second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't in her nightwear, but she wasn't in her usual clothes either; her outfit was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a red, sleeveless shirt with a black bra visible underneath on top of a pair of black and white shorts; her bandana was gone, replaced by a headband that had a red and white bow on top. In the end, May wore yellow and red shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore her brown hair was longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you gawking at her, May smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like my outfit?\" she asked, rising to her full height and doing a quick pirouette, shooting you a wink,<br>\r\n\"My old clothes were all dirty and sweaty from yesterday's trip, so I thought I'd wear something more clean... and comfy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf by 'comfy' she meant 'revealing', then yes, her clothes were terribly comfy, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" May interrupted a perverted train of thought that was beginning to race in your head,<br>\r\n\"Let's get some breakfast, then we can go enjoy this beautiful day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the giantess leaned forward, grabbed a hold of you and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having filled your empty stomach, May carried you out of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunshine rained all over you, engulfing you with a comforting warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhh...\" the brunette giantess moaned while closing her eyes to better enjoy the fresh air and the serene atmosphere of this sunny morning, <br>\r\n\"Splendid day, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" you agreed,<br>\r\n\"I almost feel like laying under a tree and stay there until the sun sets. If only there wasn't the risk some pokemon might just gulp me down whole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the threat was real, May laughed it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.\" she said, beginning to walk,<br>\r\n\"Not on my watch, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement made you feel relieved, so you decided to change subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, May,\" you called from your perch on her hand as she walked around, <br>\r\n\"Where are you headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay let a smile spread on her face before she looked down at you and replied,</span></div></div>",

Things only got worse as she moved her feet back and forth, rolling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo. That feels nice. Much better than what you were doing before. Plus, like this, you're getting both of my feet at once, so it's even faster.\" She stops rolling you. \"I'll make a deal with you.

The difference was night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay steps back and you see her reach down to her feet. Grabbing her shoes and wiggling her feet out. Once it was loose enough she kicked it away from her, right next to her bed. Changing feet she did the same with the other shoe. She sat down onto her bed as she took off her socks as well, letting you see her free and wiggling toes. \u201cWow, finally out of them. Walking around constantly can really get to you. Which used to be a bit of trouble, but not anymore now that i have you\u201d You know exactly what she wants, and honestly your not really happy about it, but then again you did make a promise. \u201cCome on, don't be shy. I promise that i won't hurt you. My feet are friendly\u201d May teases as you got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on her bed, looking down at you as you walk close. Wanting to get this over with, you go closer and start working. May was a little surprised feeling your small hands dig into her sole, but she didn't say anything. Only smiling to herself as she watches you. It didn't really do much, but her feet were still thankful for it. \u201cWow, don't try to much. Your kind of tickling me\u201d May teased as you wanted to get this over with. Moving fast you try to to ignore all her teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes May was satisfied, her feet feeling more relaxed as she moved her feet. Placing them on the ground. Her toes right in front of you. \u201cDon't forget about these ten, my toes need extra care so i hope you work extra hard there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you move forward and start pushing on her toes, trying to avoid the giant toenails that were impossible to massage. You no doubt want to stay away from her toes, knowing that if you go close to the area between her toes, then your probably going to get picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing on her soles and then all her toes, May wanted to continue. Wondering if she can make you massage her heel to. Deciding that would be too far she pulled her feet away and placed them onto the bed with her. \u201cWow, my feet feel brand new\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well, I'm just gonna rest. That got me tired now\u201d You say falling down onto the ground. May smiled to you as she decided to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay leaned down and grabbed you with her hand. Bringing you up to her face as she smiles. \u201cWell since you helped me with the foot massage. Its _____________\u201d </span></div></div>",

It felt like a mere ten minutes before you woke up again. May\u2019s massive nostrils breathed warm air directly into your face, thus making sleep impossible. Though irritated at being awoken, you could not help but admire how cute this massive girl was. In the most ridiculous of circumstances, you looked at her features and the way her mouth hung slightly open to allow for a little drool to escape. You blush as you realize the incongruity of your actions. This nice young girl has rescued me, you think, I\u2019d better not think of her in that way. <br>\r\nStill, you thought, I can\u2019t help but feel a little giddy at sharing a sleeping bag with a girl. Just think of how many people get this kind of opportunity.<br>\r\nYou headed toward her feet until you came parallel with her chest. Then with the desire to sleep all the more intoxicating, you lay down on your stomach.<br>\r\nBefore drifting away, you heard May moan as if in a nightmare. Concerned for your well being, you try to stand and escape to the edge of the bag to avoid being smothered, but before your muscles could respond, it was already too late. Before you could turn yourself over, May, the massive giantess you were entombed with, had done just that. She rolled over... on top of you.<br>\r\nHer weight felt massive, but luckily this was only her upper body and not her full weight.  You were also fortunate that she laid down so that you were down the middle of her body. Too much to the left or right would have smothered you completely, making it much harder to breathe. So, without any capability of limb movement, you could do nothing but try to get some sleep underneath the collosal May. The heat from her chest made it feel as if you were asleep underneath a giant warm bean bag. Eventually, despite the heat and pressure, you fall asleep, albeit not as easily as before. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not to mention what would happen if you ran into a Pokemon at your minute size, a cute little Starly, small enough to fit in your palm would probably be several times your current minute stature.<br>\r\n\tPushing your way through a bush the size of a two-storey house, you nearly shouted in joy at what you found on the other side. A campsite, and from the items scattered around the clearing it was in, said campsite had to be inhabited. A sizable bright orange one-person tent, cooking and eating utensils, a rolled up sleeping bag, and a small yellow backpack was all you could see at the moment. You nearly rushed right into the middle of the campsite, until you noticed something. Despite all the items lying around, there was no one here. Glancing around as you stepped carefully back into the bush. You nearly jumped out of your skin as a set of massive bushes, large enough to obscure a normal-sized person rustled on the other side of the clearing. In a moment, said bushes parted revealing a young woman, probably <br>\r\n\tShe had a unique fashion sense, on her feet were pink knee-high boots, with long black socks peeking out the top. She was also wearing a black v-neck tank top with a pink skirt, a white undershirt beneath the tank top covering the woman's exposed cleavage. A white beanie with a pink poke ball print on front sat atop her head. Her dark cerulean blue hair was held up with a pair of gold hair clips. Completing her ensemble was a black bracelet on her right arm, a pokewatch on her left, and surprisingly enough a pink scarf wrapped around her neck as if it were a ribbon.<br>\r\n\tYou couldn't help but thank your own foresight as the young woman walked into her campsite, head held high she barely examined her surroundings as she walked around.  Gulping softly you could only imagine ending up under the young woman's boots had you gone racing into the campsite as you had planned. At the very least you would have been forced to run for your life as she stomped around, completely unaware of your presence. Looking around she softly sighed, her voice although low easily reaching you on the other side of the clearing. \"I guess I'll be spending the night here, this forest goes on forever. How could I remember everything but a map?\" Another gentle sigh escaped her lips as she sunk to the ground near the yellow backpack you had spotted earlier. Rummaging around the surprisingly small bag, she pulled out a small pink hairbrush, though it was probably larger than you were at the moment. Losing the beanie, and carefully removing her hairclips she gave her head a gentle shake, her dark cerulean hair, freed from the hat and clips spilling out over her shoulders and down to her lower back. Humming softly to herself, she began to comb the brush through her hair, each stroke soft and gentle as she had all the time in the world to take care of herself.<br>\r\n\tThis seemed like the perfect opportunity to try and get the girl's attention, she was calm and relaxed, she wouldn't be moving around much as she took care of her hair so you could probably approach her safely. So what were you going to do?...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has her eyes closed as she brushes herself, humming quietly. <br>\r\n\"Hello? Miss? Down here!\" you shout, hoping she'll hear you and look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she doesn't. She must be lost in her own thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Please, help!!\" you shout again, louder this time. But she still seems to have not heard your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, when you are about to scream again, the giantess gets up and places the brush back in her bag, before starting to walk toward the tent. She gently puts it inside, bending to place it on the ground, giving you a clear visual of her butt in the meantime. You blush furiously at the sight as a thousand thoughts run across your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad you don't notice Dawn walking back to the log. Just when the white sole of her pink boot is about to crush you, you return to your senses. And you scream in pure terror at top of your little lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Dawn seems to notice your voice. Her boot stops in midair as she looks down at the source of that faint scream. She spots what seems to be a weird looking bug, there on the ground. But, inspecting closer, she actually sees a tiny person. A terrified tiny person. And  seeing she was about to crush him, she can easily understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand makes her way to your small form. Two fingers gently wrap around your waist, picking you up and bringing you up to her face. Her deep blue eyes seem to stare into your very soul. You stare back at her, you can clearly see your own reflection in her twin mirrors, your terrorized look still painted on your face. You wait to calm down a bit before speaking up.<br>\r\n\"H-hi... c-could you please help m-me?\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stays silent for a few moments, trying to decide if you're actually real or if her mind is playing pranks on her.

So you just nod your head. Slowly, Dawn kneels and places her hand right in front of your small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you hop on it as the blue haired girl rises her hand back to her face. You stare into her deep blue eyes as she talks again.<br>\r\n\"Sorry for almost crushing you little guy. I didn't notice you.\" she apologizes.

I just remember I was walking in the forest... and then I woke up, shrunk.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn seems to ponder something upon hearing your words. Until she lets out a small yawn.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really know how to help you, but I guess we can figure out in the morning. Let's eat something and then we can go to sleep.\" she says, getting up and reaching for her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into her bag, she pulls out an apple.<br>\r\n\"I think we can share an apple.\" she states, sitting again and placing you on her lap. She slices the apple and hands you a slice. You eat slowly, thinking about this heck of a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your thoughts, you don't hear Dawn calling out for you.<br>\r\n\"Little guy?\" you look up at her.<br>\r\n\"I think we should go to sleep now.\" she says, picking you and walking towards her tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing you down, she steps inside.<br>\r\n\"Wait here...\" she mutters, zipping the tent close, reopening it five minutes later, now in her nightwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing both you and her backpack, she places it on the floor and zips the tent close again.<br>\r\n\"So... where am I going to sleep?\" you casually ask. Dawn giggles in reply. You immediately get where this is going. A blush spreads on your face at light speed.<br>\r\n\"You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" she replies with a smile, while making her way to the point where a single sleeping bag is laying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn slides inside with you still in her grasp. She drops you next to her head. Close next to her head. Stands of her hair lie next to you, some twice your height.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight little one. Sleep tight.\" she says in a whisper, before closing those blue eyes of hers, quickly beginning to snore softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing even more, you lie down as well. You try to recollect your thoughts, trying to figure out what could be the cause of all this... but in the end, your eyelids become heavy. You fall asleep before even knowing it.</span></div></div>",

I know you're probably terrified to see a beautiful giant like me towering over you.\" As she said this, she gently used a finger to pat you on the head. \"I'll bet the whole world looks scary from your perspective.\" She pondered aloud as a smirk formed on her face causing you to shiver. \"Well I guess that settles it. You're staying with me.\" Her declaration shocked you, finding yourself unable to speak up once again. \"That way, you'll be safe in my care and I get a cool new pet.\" The word 'pet' put you even further in shock.

It took you a moment to put 2 and 2 together and realize just what she had planned for her disobedient pet. You tried to squirm free, but her grip quickly tightened around you as her eyes narrowed seeming to grow impatient with her pet's disobedience. \"You will be spending the rest of the trip inside my boot. I'll do everything I can to keep you alive in there, but until I reach the Poke Center and release you I better not feel you attack me again or try to escape your punishment. If you do either of these things, I will prolong the punishment or come up with something worse. And believe me, I can get creative if I want to.\" her tone was very stern and her expression matched this. It was certainly enough to get you to stop moving. Like it or not, you had no means of escaping her right now. The best you could do for now was nod obediently and accept the punishment she set up for you for the time being and hope you can escape some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's expression remained unchanging as she lifted the boot back upright and slowly lowered you inside. As she placed you on the insole of the boot your body was assaulted by a powerful cheesy foot odor and a wave of heat radiating from everywhere. It was so powerful and sudden that you were dizzy just from standing there. \"Now, make your way towards the toe section until I tell you to stop. Then lay down.\" Dawn commanded in an authoritative tone. You dared not to defy her, fearing further punishment. So you walked... and walked... deeper into the hot, dark, damp, and smelly cavern. Finally Dawn ordered you to stop and lay down not too far from where the imprints of her toes were. Giving you little time to react, her black socked foot came rushing in, cutting off almost all light in your prison and making your surrounding much MUCH hotter than they already were. Within seconds, the ball of her foot was pressing down against your face, covering your entire form in a pool of her foot sweat. \"Now you be good in there and think about your new place in life.\" you heard Dawn's voice. It was muffled by the foot and boot, but you could still make out the words. This was going to be a LOOOOOONNNNNG trip. </span></div></div>",

During this her new pet was experiencing h*** while being trap inside her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's foot sweat started pour upon your tiny body like rain. The smell was just awful and to make matters worse the heat of being inside this stinky boot was growing more intense. As she started to pick up speed your tiny body was lunge up and down inside of her pink humid boot. You kept hitting the top of her socked sweaty toes and then hitting her squishy sweaty sole, over and over again. It wasn't really all that painful to you just humiliating and disgusting. You just hope that you can get a chance to escape as soon as possible so to not have to endure this agony of being a pet to this girl. Or at least earn some kind of reward for being put in this dumb situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn just kept on running, the feeling of the tiny man against her foot felt actually quite pleasant. It was a foot massage with each time the tiny guy hit her toes. Dawn was kinda hoping this feeling would never end as she kept running along to the Pokemon center. But to her dismay the Pokemon center was coming into view and Dawn was starting to get really tired from all the running that she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the sole of her boot one last time before Dawn finally began to slow down. At this point you were drenched in Dawn's foot sweat and smelled like Dawns foot. You were able to here a small bell noise that sounded like Dawn entering some kind of store or maybe even a Pokemon center. Hopefully she's in a town where she will let me out of here soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn approach the front counter and handed her Pokemon over to nurse joy to get healed. She also requested for a room and then enjoyed skipping to her room. So she can try and get the relaxing massage for just a few more steps. Dawn then arrives into her single room with a bathroom and looked like a normal hotel room. And she began to sit down on the bed to strip away her pink boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight poured in from the top of the boot as you saw. The socked foot leave the opening to the top of the stinky boot. But the light was only seen by you for just a few moments as a hand comes into the dark abyss and you here Dawns voice say \"Okay hop on my little pet your punishment is over\". With a relief that this torture was gone, you jump upon Dawn's hand to be lifted out and shown in front of her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there my little pet, you look as if you didn't enjoy being inside of my boot. Well I guess that will teach you to not disobey your master, is that understood? (she doesn't even wait for you to respond, just continues with talking) Wow you smell bad just like my foot haha, I guess I have to give my cute pet a bath huh?, Well I will but First I think I should get cleaned up. So how about you hop back into my boot so I know where your at, I'll go take a shower, and take you out to give you yours afterwards. I know it may seem like I am punishing you again by putting you back in there. But let me assure you its for your own good. Now is that clear... hop on in there?...\" Dawn says this smiling while holding her stinky pink boot up sideways so to gesture you to jump back into the dark torture chamber that is this young girls pink boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat when you begin to think that theirs no way your getting back in there. After enduring such torture before and not even given any kind of reward in return. How dare she think that you will just willingly put yourself right back into that smelly place. And top of all this she is still thinking of you as just a pet. This whole thing is starting to piss you off but of course if you do choose to disobey this girl, who knows what kind of other punishment she can put you through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what do you decide to do?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I will not hear any buts about it\" She says this and picks up her pink boot with you in it and places the boot in between a dresser and TV stand dresser, so theirs no way to flip the boot on its side. \"Also don't expect a bath and supper, you can bath in my foot sweat for all I care and eat whatever toe jam is in there\" With that said by Dawn she got up and left you to your smelly chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the shower go, then decide its safe to start moving. You try your best to flip the shoe but can tell right away that she thought of a way to block you. The smell inside of the shoe is intensely bad. You start to think \"I have to really watch what I say for now on ugh. But I can't just back down to this girl. I deserve to be free, I am no ones pet. And who cares if I even think I deserve a reward. This is so bad that its only right\". you then begin to look around the shoe since last time, you never really got a chance to. One thing you notice by a big puddle of sweat is a clump of toe jam. Then your stomach rumbles with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to think about what Dawn said before about no dinner. \"No no no no... theirs no way I'm doing it. Eating toe jam is disgusting and drinking sweat ugh. The thought alone will make me gag. I will not be treated as some dust mite who feeds off whatever Dawn here leaves behind\". After saying this you hear the shower stop, followed by hair dryer and other noises. And after a few minutes of you walking around the inside of Dawns smelly boot, contemplating your hunger and need of survival The bathroom door flies open. The next you see is Dawns face coming up on top of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little pet, just let you know I have calm down because the shower I took and have decided that I will let you out of my boot tomorrow morning if you behave tonight. I am still mad with you, but your just cute enough to let it slide (she then goes in to give you a pet on your head, which further belittle you to her). So you be good in there. I am going out for a half hour, hopefully I'll meet a man tonight that I can have fun with *Dawn winks*\". After hearing that you tried to make some kind of argument to her bringing some random man here, But she got up so fast and skip out of the room. That you had no time to even protest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven this time being alone, you tried your best to flip the boot again but once again it was no use the boot wouldn't even move. Plus the height of the boot mixed with the to smooth surface of the walls of the boot made it impossible to just climb out of the smelly boot. And so you realize that your stuck in this sweaty boot in till Dawn returns. At this point your body is tired, hungry, and a little thirsty. With survival instinct kicking in, you make your way over to Dawns toe jam and sweat puddle. Before you do anything a thought enters your mind \"your about to consume something that is produced by Dawn and something so small that she never even thinks about, making you like a bug to her\". You then go straight in and finish the disgusting things that were once in front of you. Afterward you throw up once, then fall asleep for 10 or 20 mins, only to be woken up by the sound of the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn strolls right into her room with a Firefighter guy (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Firefighter_\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a>(Trainer_class) that she is wrap around. All you got to see is Dawn with the Firefighter walk above and right past you in a flash. Dawn then jumps onto the bed and gestures the man to strip to get ready for the ride of his life. Unaware to him was you a tiny man who is degraded to be this girls pet and is so small that he is trapped in her sweaty boot. And now has to deal with being humiliated by having to listen to his owner have sex. The bed then starts to make crinkling noises, as the two of them began to make out. \"Oh yea, your such a big strong firefighter. I have a way of showing you my thanks for what you do Mr.Firefighter, so lets get these darn cloths off\" Dawn begins to strip away her clothing and Dawns sock just so happen to be balled up, lands in the opening of the pink boot that your trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot itself smelled bad alone but the sweaty sock that has just block out the major air flow has made the inside so much worse. You were forced to endure the humid, sweaty environment while listening to Dawn go at it with the firefighter. You tried your best to yell up to the giantess Dawn to at least remove the sock out of the way. But to your luck the two titans only heard little squeaks which the man questioned one time, and Dawn responded with \"Oh that just my cute little pet, don't worry to much about him. Your big muscle body has my full attention\". They then went back into sex and ignored your cries of distress. This then led you no other choice but to approach the indented toe section of the smelly boot. And lay down on the squishy sole to fall asleep to the sounds of two giants having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually finished and Dawn decided to just doze off in the Firefighters arms. Some more time then passed. The man carefully set Dawns delicate and gorgeous body down upon the bed. He gets up out of the bed to retrieve his clothing and after he finished getting dressed, he remembers where the direction of the squeaking was coming from. Not seeing any cage, but a pink boot only, The Firefighter was a little curious to what the pet was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

After hearing this Hilda stands straight up in shock while holding her boobs as if she was naked and you were starring at them. Her face went bright red and then a stream of anger came across her. With one hand on her hip on the other stuck out with only her pointing finger out like she was disciplining a child, Hilda says \"What did you just say tiny guy?, I was just joking around, but that sounded serious. I was expecting you to not answer or even try to get us back on track but omg you little perv. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\". At this point you still weren't sure if she was trying to joke with you or if this was her true anger. So you kept quiet hoping that she would say just kidding after all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead though of saying that Hilda's anger seemed to grow as she grabbed you into a tight hold that wasn't gentle at all. And then she brought you up to her face and stared at you in the eyes to say \"I can't stand little perv's like you. I can't even think of what to do with you now. Because I am so angry at you. So you know what till we reach a Pokemon center, you will be riding in my boot. And before your little pervy mind goes wild of the thought of being in a girls boot. Let me tell you that it doesn't smell like flowers in there, I have never washed these and I have had them since the beginning of my journey so get in there, I don't even want to see your face anymore\" With that said she brought you over to her black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were screaming up her, telling her to stop this, that you were only joking, or egging her on. But it was no use Hilda was ignoring everyone of your pleas. And just drop you into her boot. The smell from the inside was toxic, the mushy sweaty ground felt nearly impossible to walk on which made you face plant a couple times into Hilda's left over sweat. Her face was right over the only exit of the boot, as you say \"Hilda it smell's disgusting in here and the humidity is so bad let me out...\". Hilda just look at you and gave a smirk. She then stood straight up and lifted her foot up, giving you a gesture of 'you better get to the toe section fast'. In which you did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning head first into the dark stinky abyss that was this young woman's boot. Of course on the way you kept slipping and falling into the sweaty insole of Hilda's boot. But you were always able to get yourself up, but right as you were about to make it the very edge Hilda titanic size foot comes in. And the first thing you notice is that she has decided to take off her socks before putting her foot in. As you are greeted by your new inmates being Hilda's huge toes, Sweat seems to start to emit from them immediately. To make matters worse she also starts to play with you using her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda begins to walk over to her stuff, taking her time with packing everything up, so to give you enough quality time as possible with her foot. With everything packed she began her journey towards the Pokemon center, humming to herself the whole way. The journey to her was a long one. The heat from the sun made her sweat and walk even slower. All the while you were basically in a pool of sweat and toe jam. You hated this experience, the heat was unbearable, and it felt like the smell illuminating from her foot was getting worse by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hilda finally saw the Pokemon center and ran her way over to it, forcing you to literally get one of her toes into your mouth. Once she arrived in the cold air inside of the Pokemon center. Hilda requested a room and while walking down the hallway to her room she thought to herself that maybe putting you through her boot torture was to harsh, but other the hand she thought you might deserve something like this as she enter her room. Hilda sat down on her bed and began to take off her boot. Shaking you out and into her hand to find out that she...</span></div></div>",

However, before you even get a chance to shout her black socked foot enters the shoe and presses you to the sole. \"Ah, wish I had more spare socks with me, but, oh well, I'll just have to wear these again. They are still even wet from sweat from the last walk, ugh!\" By taking one breath through your nose you confirm Hilda's predicament, her socks are indeed very sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then firmly presses her foot into the shoe and pins you under her sole. Your face is right at her toes and the rest of your body is under the ball of her foot, almost reaching the start of her heel with ur feet. Hilda then firmly fastens her laces, locking you inside of this prison. You try to approach her but you realize you are just stuck down here, unable to move a single inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then starts to walk, and the pressure on your body makes you breath more and more. You try to breathe through your mouth but, the skin in between her toes exerts enough pressure on your face to keep your mouth firmly sealed. Only your nose has a bit of space, forcing you to inhale through your nose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe in deeply and the smell of Hilda's sweat fills your lungs. You try to move but you still cannot move a single inch and Hilda seems unaware of your torture. You think to yourself: \"Stay calm, stay calm! The only way to make it through this is by breathing calmly...\" And so you do. You slowly but deeply breathe in and out, inhaling Hilda's smell very deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, this right boot is rather comfortable, as if there is a new insole in it...\" you hear Hilda say from high above you. She wiggles her toes a little, releasing even more aroma from her toes. You are simply forced to smell her toejam for as long as she desires...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I think I am going to take a long walk today, I need to get some more Pok\u00e9balls, so I might as well take a the long way around so I can buy myself some.\" Hilda says. You think to yourself: \"Oh boy, just my luck... She is going to take the long way around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the journey begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda is completely unaware of your predicament and just keeps on walking. With every breath you are still smelling and almost tasting Hilda's sweat. Her socks are completely drenched now, forcing you to breathe in even deeper and deeper. You need to inhale very deeply, in-between her wet toes, to try and get some air through those wet and sweaty socks. From time to time Hilda wiggles her wet toes a little, releasing even more sweat into the socks and for you to sniff up. You try to breathe as deeply as you can, to maybe dry the socks a little bit with your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then speaks up again: \"Hmm... My one foot almost seems to get a little less sweaty than the other, gosh, if I'd find something that could make my feet sweat less or clean them for me while I walk, that would be amazing!\" You shiver... It's almost like Hilda is hinting at something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey then continues and you keep on breathing in and out, deeper and deeper, filling your lungs completely with Hilda's sweaty scent with every breath. Her socks are leaking sweat onto your body and specifically your face. You still cannot move an inch and you are simply forced to just keep on breathing her sweaty, wet, socked toes like this. Her sweat starts to pool around your mouth and slowly trickle inside, you want to keep your mouth firmly shut but you realize you don't have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if her sweat starts blocking your nose? With that scenario in mind, you open your mouth slightly and let Hilda's sweat enter your mouth. You swallow and taste Hilda's mouth... Doing your best to survive! You still have to breathe in very deeply through her wet socks, smelling the very essence of her sweat with every breath. Meanwhile, her sweat is dripping into your mouth, forcing you to swallow that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wiggles her toes, and everything becomes worse again, more sweat comes into your mouth and the smell gets worse too. She then wiggles her toes again... And again... And again... If only Hilda knew what kind of torture she was putting you through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than an hour or two, Hilda finally takes a break. She finally sits down and your body gets some rest. However, you are still firmly pinned down by her foot, smelling her drenched socks. You think to yourself: \"This is my chance! I could get her attention! And... Or... Well... I could also... Not get her attention I guess... It wasn't this bad was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? Do you seek Hilda's attention or do you simply endure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mind almost gets numb and you start to realize that you're getting an erection from the smell. Though, you want to keep it going and going, you want to breathe in as deep as you can and smell every single sweaty fiber from her wet sock. Her toes wiggle again, and the smell gets worse once more and sweat starts dripping in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now welcome any sweat going into your mouth and keep your mouth open as far as you can... More and more sweat trickles into your mouth and you fully taste it with your tongue before swallowing it, over and over... And over. Meanwhile you keep inhaling very deeply. You even try to exhale through your mouth so you can inhale as much pure sweat-smell as possible with your nose. And there you go again, inhaling as deeply as you can while Hilda wiggles her toes once more. You then hear Hilda speak up: \"Oh my! It's so warm today, gosh! The day that I am in such a hurry just HAD to be the day with insanely high temperatures! Well, at least my sweaty feet are locked up in those old shoes...\" Hilda says with a slight notion of annoyance in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't mind at all, in fact, you love the fact that she is getting so sweaty from all of it. You start to get addicted to it, the smell, the taste and the predicament of her just deciding what's going to happen. Even though she doesn't even know that you're there. She decided to start walking again and just the thought already makes your erection grow immensily. With every step you force yourself to breathe in deeply, turning it into a forceful rythm based on Hilda's pace. Sniff, sniff, sniff and again, a deep sniff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale as deep as you can, trying to make the wet sock as dry as possible, which is a lost cause by far, but an erotic goal if you are addicted to the smell. The journey takes rather long and every second is spent in bliss by you, smelling Hilda's delicious sweat and letting it in trickle into your mouth all the time. You even came once or twice when she pressed her foot a little firmly on you, in combination with all the smelling and tasting you've been doing. Then, time just slowly passes by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder to yourself, would you rather have her know your predicament or do you actually prefer to be subjected to her random whims and just going on about your days like this... Hmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or two, you feel something moving and you realize that Hilda's foot is leaving the shoe. Oh no, your worst nightmare, you actually have to stop smelling her feet now! Then, after a few minutes something happens... You see a figure above you, it's ... it's...</span></div></div>",

What were you even doing in there?\" Hilda asks, with a surprised voice, totally dumbfounded as to what to do in the current situation. You were just numbed by the trampling and foot-smelling for so long and... You couldn't even answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just thought to yourself that your heavenly life as Hilda's insole had ended... Hilda then looked at you and frowned: \"Wait, are you a new Pok\u00e9mon or something?\" She put you on her table, you were apparently in her room, and you saw her boots and socks on the ground, sweaty and warm. You looked around and just thuoght of it as a simple girl's room in Unova. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then called someone: <br>\r\n\"Yes? Hey hello, its Hilda here!\"<br>\r\n- \"Oh, hello Hilda! How are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I am doing great professor Junipor,  <br>\r\n- \"Well, what is up Hilda?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, when I came home I found a really small person in my shoe but they almost seem dazed,<br>\r\nI am not sure what I'm supposed to do with them.\"<br>\r\n- \"Oh, I see Hilda, hmmm... Could you send me a picture Hilda? I'll text you my thought afterwards!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright miss Juniper, talk to you in a bit then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda and professor Juniper then hang up the phone and Hilda took a picture of you, she sent it to Juniper. Juniper was holing her phone in her hand, excitedly waiting for Hilda to send the picture, she looked at it and thought to herself: \"Oh my, it's truly a shrunken human... Wonder how I will have Hilda test his functioning... Hmmm, Oh! I have an idea!\" Juniper then hastily texted something to Hilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's phone buzzed and she looked at the text: \"Hmm... Juniper says I can just play with you all I want, and be as devilish as I can be. What a strange thing for Juniper to request but, oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then grabs some tape and wraps it around you, before you know it you are almost mummified, except for your face. \"Hmmm, what to do with you...\" Hilda said while an evil smirk started to slowly emerge on her face. Maybe she is less innocent than you thought! \"Hmm, you know what, since you liked it so much in my boot, lets see how you like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then took her sweaty sock and pressed it against your face, the wet toe area was mushed into your face and drops of sweat dribbled onto your face. You instantly start breathing in heavily through your nose, wanting to experience that heaven from before once again. Hilda seemed surprised: \"Wow! You actually, you actually started smelling it? Hmm... How about this then...\" Hilda then squeezed the sweat out of her sock and a little pool emerged next to your face. She slowly turned you around so your face was straight in the pool, your entire face just disappeared into it. However, you couldn't breath! With her finger she even tapped your head, pushing you further into it. You had no choice, you had to start drinking her sweat in order to breathe again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started gulping down the sweat and you heard Hilda laugh above you, \"Oh my, quite the predicament I put you in, didn't I?\" You started swallowing, one mouthful after the other. After about 20 more swallows you finally could breathe again through your nose. You inhaled the smell of Hilda's sweat and got really aroused, meanwhile, your mouth and tongue were still coated with her sweat. She then ordered you, \"go on, keep licking up my sweat like a doggy!\" You did as she commanded and started licking up her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then went away for a minute and she came back in her pajamas, in the meantime you just kept licking the pool of sweat, getting really accustomed to the taste of Hilda's sweat. Hilda then grabbed a small piece of tape and put it firmly on your mouth only allowing you to breathe through your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my little toy... I am going to play a lot with you! I never really had a smaller brother or sister or any kid in town I could kinda play with. In fact, most kids here were older than I was and I often got bullied a bit, it wasn't all too serious, but it wasn't pleasant either. \" Hilda says with a more serious tone, She then looks straight at you: \"But now I have my own toy and I can let my devilish fantasies loose on you, time for vengeance!\" Hilda says with a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Hilda, slowly recovered from the insole trip from earlier, you start to realize the situation you are in now. Shrunk, bound and completely at the mercy of this girl, Hilda, who is likely going to tease and harass you a lot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then grabs her other sock, still really sweaty. \"So, wanna sleep in this do you? I bet you do! Let's get you ready for bed!\" Hilda then put you in her sock and all the way to the toe area. She then wrapped the sock tightly around you, squeezing your face firmly into the sweaty fabric. You started inhaling through your nose, without much choice. As a result of the smell, you started moaning, out of desperation of your situation but also due to the intense pleasure it gives you. Hilda then ignores your sounds and says: \"Well, goodnight, hope you like your new bed. I'll see you next morning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then put you in her drawer and walked away. This was going to be a loooong night...<br>\r\nThe entire night you spent smelling Hilda's socks even more, every breath arousing but, and you even tried to move out of the bondage you were put it but, to no avail. The tape was wrapped firmly around you and all you can do is just endure whatever Hilda has in store for you... Uh-oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you wake up... The drawer that you were put in opens and rays of light invade your dark prison. You have your eyes half-shut while you feel a hand picking you up. You see it's Hilda and she takes you out of her sock, she then smirks: \"Hey there my toooooy, how did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to nod a little bit, still in a haze from smelling Hilda's sweaty sock all night. Hilda then walks to the side of her bed and sits down with you in hand, \"I am glad you liked it! Well, since you were sleeping in my sock, I can't possible wear that again!\" Hilda says, with a playfully evil tone. She then puts both her boots in front of her and grabs a bit of tape, \"I guess you'll have to endure my bare feet this time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind just explodes at hearing that! What is she gonna do? You could hardly survive her socks, let alone her bare feet! You might faint down the-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your thoughts of despiration are interrupted by Hilda forcefully ripping all the tape that was wrapped around you, taking your clothes off in the process. She then puts you in her shoe, butt-naked, \"spread your arms and legs for me!\" Hilda says, with a demanding voice. You do so, and she then quickly puts small bits of tape around your wrists and ankles and securing them to the sole of her boot. \"That's looking great! Now you can feel my foot rubbing against your whole body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get a chance to protest you see Hilda stand up and her foot approaches you, you squirm in your restraints but not before long Hilda's foot is firmly settled on you. She then fastens her laces very tightly, which pushes her foot firmly onto your body. Your face is mushed against the skin between her index toe and her big toe, while the rest of your body is under the ball of her foot, and your legs reach somewhere around the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's sole smells a little sweaty already, but that's mainly because you are directly smelling her toejam. \"Hey toy?\" Hilda says while grinding her foot on the floor, increasing the pressure on you. \"I want to feel you licking... Aaaaall the time, is that clear?\" The only response you can give is to start licking, and so you do. \"Hihihi, good! That feels kinda nice!\" Hilda says giggling, while starting to walk around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda eventually leaves her house and starts her day, she ignores you for the most part, but she knows exactly what she is putting you through. It seems to be a warm day and her foot starts to get sweatier and sweatier. Let alone that the boot itself already has a very distinct smell of Hilda's sweat, she must walk in those every single day. You spend your time smelling her toes, getting aroused form the smell of her sweat, which is way more intense now than when smelling it through her socks. Meanwhile, you keep licking in-between her toes and the top of the ball of her foot, you start to greatly enjoy licking the soles of her feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin is so smooth and her sweat tastes so... erotic and enticing. You start to lick faster and faster, attempting to satisfy your owner as much as you can. You can hear Hilda giggle from time to time, which makes her wiggle her toes and release an even sweatier scent into your nostrils, which you deeply breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you're doing a great job down there, you're actually really enjoying that aren't you?\" Hilda says, while coming to a stop. She then puts a bit more weight on the foot you're under and playfully grinds it into the ground, \"you must love this position don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even answer, you are just too busy enjoyed licking and smelling her feet. And when she starts grinding her foot against you, you get even more aroused from the way her sweaty sole smoothly rubs against your crotch, making your erection noticeable to Hilda; \"Oh my, someone is loving this position A LOT... Guess I'll feel a tiny bit of liquid spurt against my sole later, haha!\" Hilda says with a playful tone, while starting to walk again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes when she stands still she just grinds her foot into the ground, on purpose. Meanwhile, it's getting warmer and sweatier and you just keep on smelling and licking, getting very accustomed to Hilda's smell, yet, it is way more erotic than when you were smelling it through her sock. You can actually taste her sweaty skin now and you love cleaning her toejam like a good insole. You try to move your body now and then, but you simply can't even move an inch, you are totally at Hilda's mercy. This whole predicament just gets you so turned on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hilda grinds her foot again into the ground, and this time you blow your load... You breathe heavily, inhaling even deeper than before and licking even faster, trying to clean all the skin between her toes and taste as much as you can. You still breathe heavily and it takes a minute before you calm down from orgasming onto her sole. You hear Hilda giggle, but she pays it no mind and simply continues walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long day and you spend every minute smelling and licking her feet. Your nose is still buried between her toes, which she presses onto your nose most of the time, or wiggles them on purpose to allow you to inhale really deeply. Meanwhile, the taste buds on your tongue have become very addicted to Hilda's taste, you just wanna lick every single inch of her sole. Thus, you do your best to reach new spots every single time, despite your restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then sits down, finally, and her foot leaves the shoe. She looks down at you and you see that she seems to be in a park of some sort. \"Hey there my insole! We're in the Pok\u00e9mon safari! Don't worry, nobody is nearby. You really enjoyed it there didn't you?\" Hilda's hand then enters the shoe and she grabs you out of it, \"you know, by smelling and licking my right foot, you've made it a lot less sweaty than the other, but... Now my left foot is feeling lonely, hihi!\" Hilda says with an evil tone while giggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what's gonna happen and brace yourself while Hilda puts you in her left boot and restrains your ankles and wrists to the boot's sole with the same pieces of tape. \"So, my left foot is wayyyy sweatier now, I hope you're ready.\" You don't even protest anymore, you simply lay there and wait till her foot covers your entire body. The boot itself was already very sweaty and warm, but now her left foot covers your body, sweat dripping onto you and you get an erection again almost instantly, simply from inhaling through your nose. Your arousal drives you to start licking enthousiastically as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it continues, as Hilda's insole...    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ahhh, what a day!\" Hilda says, while slowly coming to a halt near her front door. \"I caught a ton of new Pok\u00e9mon and explored an entire new forest nearby! Phew, my feet are just soaking wet from all this.\" Hilda wiggles her toes, releasing some sweat onto your face. \"And, how was ur day, little one? I felt several orgasms against my sole, I suppose you loved it...\" Hilda says while entering her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been licking and smelling her feet almost all day, her soft and smooth soles have been thoroughly explored by your tongue. You can feel Hilda walk up the stairs, but you're rather used to the pressure of her steps by now. She walks into her room and takes her boot off, \"Oh my! You must be hungry right? You've eaten most of my toejam, but I guess you might want a bit more than that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then leaves you in her boot as she goes downstairs. You lay there in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe in through your nose, and your lungs fill with the warm and damp air that is coming from the steaming boot's sole that you're attached to. It is so sweaty and warm that your vision is basically blurring, it's almost as if steam is coming from her soles. You breathe in deeply once more and get an erection... Again, you are just hoplessly addicted to the smell of Hilda's feet. You start breathing more heavily and relax your body, accepting your place under Hilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then enters the room again; She then gets a small piece of bread, a very dry kind and starts to rub it across her foot. Her foot is still as sweaty as when it just departed from her boot, but now the sweat is being soaked up by the piece of bread. \"Oh my... This is going to be disguuuusting! Wooow!\" Hilda says while working on her sole-cleansing. \"Hey Toy, you know you're gonna eat this sweat-soaked bread right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then bends down and takes you out of her boot and puts you on her desk, she quickly mummifies you with tape, leaving only your face open. You can only move like a caterpillar at this point, dragging your body forward. Hilda then taps on your head, \"Hey not so fast little one... It's time for your dinner!\" You look up at Hilda and then see her crumble the sweat-soaked bread before you, a small pool of her sweat even appears below the bread. However, your hunger takes over your fears and you rush face-first into the bread, chomping away at the wet, soggy dinner that your owner has provided you. You can just taste Hilda's feet when eating the bread, the taste of her sweat is easily taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you love this and you eat away at your dinner. Hilda giggles, \"My oh my, not only do you eat whatever I tell you to, but you even seem to enjoy this particular dinner! You're such a funny thing to toy with!\" Hilda says, while attaching a piece of cord to your neck and attaching it to a knob on her desk. \"There we go! I'll be eating downstairs, and I hope you will have ur dinner finished once I get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Hilda leave the room, but you're too hungry and too aroused to reply, you just want to eat... Eat... EAT! You keep going and going, within a personal record time you've finished your dinner. You've eaten sweat-soaked bread the size of your entire torso. You think to yourself: \"Maybe the insole duties today made me hungrier? I mean... I love them but, at the same time... I can't help but think if there is maybe a chance that I'll escape from thi-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bdam!- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda opens the door and walks towards you, \"Ah MY toy, I have a proposition for you...\" Hilda says while walking towards you and taking a seat at her desk. She looks at you, \"Oh my! You've finished all the bread! Good job my toy!\" She says, while petting your tiny head. \"You really enjoyed that, didn't you? Don't worry, you'll get a similar dinner every... Single... Day!\" Hilda says, strongly emphasizing the last three words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\" Hilda says, \"I think I want to try some things... Mainly by using you on some other people, however, I want you to have a say in this.\" Hilda says with a serious tone, folding her arms, \"I know I am the owner and all, but I want you to be able to choose your predicament, in the end I can just do whatever I want anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then holds two different socks up, a black thin nylon sock, the kind Hilda always wears. It has slightly dried up now, but you can see it's been very sweaty. The other sock she holds up is unfamiliar to you, it's a white sock, almost fully transparent from the sweat that has been soaked into it, still warm and steamy. \"Here! Have a good sniff!\" Hilda presses her black nylon sock against your face. \"Inhale!\" Hilda demands with a stern voice. You do so, you inhale very deeply through your nose and let Hilda's sweaty aroma fill your lungs. \"You like that, don't you?\" Hilda says, noticing your enthousiastic breathe of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there's also this one...\" Hilda then switches the socks and presses the wet, damp, white sock into your face. \"Inhale deeply!\" With all your might you inhale as deep as you can, \"This one is from my mother, she just got back from jogging! I managed to snatch one, you like that one too don't you?\" You breathed in very deeply, in an attempt to even get some air through the wet fabric. However, before you can answer, Hilda takes the sock away, \"Wait! Don't answer! Do it like this, you move to whichever sock you wanna smell the most okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then puts her mother's white sock on one side of the desk and her own black sock on the other side. \"I won't hold it against you, don't worry, this will just depend in what way I will toy with you...\" Hilda says, while looking at you with a devilish grin on her face. \"So, my toy, to which sock are you going to crawl; You prefer my own worn-out socks, or wanna try my mother's sweaty socks? What kind of fate will you choose for yourself?\" Hilda says with a majestic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... What will it be?  </span></div></div>",

This is going to be sooo muuuuch fuuuuun!\" Hilda says, with a giggly emphasis on the last few words. She then helps you out and presses her mother's sock onto your face and rolls you firmly into the sock, with your face pressing against the soaking wet toe area of the sock. \"Let me hear you breathe now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale deeply and get highly aroused from the smell... The sweat is more mature, but just as erotic, if not more! Hilda holds the sock firmly against your nose and then rubs them against your face. The sweat from the socks is dripping onto your face and you inhale as deep as you can to get any air out of it. Every breathe you take is as deep as you possibly can muster, your lungs are getting filled with the mature smell of the socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looks like you're enjoying it?\" Hilda says with a surprised tone. \"Well... You could sleep in these socks if you want. And then tomorrow I'll have an amaaaaazing surprise for you!\" Hilda says, with a joyful tone. You nod; \"Yes Hilda, please! I'd love to smell these more...\" You answer, the words just flew out of your mind before you could realize how ashamed you are for saying that. However, you simply gave in to your urges and Hilda seems to like putting you through any kind of 'torment' anyways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you settled for the night then!\" Hilda says, while she leaves the room and comes back in a minute with some laundry in her hands. \"Well, I think some socks are even worse than those...\" Hilda then grabbed a pair of violet socks, you could see the soles were full of lightbrown markings of the sillhoutte of the owner's foot. \"These are definitely mom's worst socks. She ran a marathon with these this week, after wearing them for almost every workout session. There was a thing with our laundry machine, so she used to same socks a lot.\" Hilda then moves the socks closer to you and continues, \"Well, we didn't want such socks in the house. So I just stuffed them in her worn-out running shoes, thinking I could maybe prank someone with them at some point. Well... Guess they'll be for your training now!\" Hilda says with a satisfied expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then folds the socks inside out and holds her nose with one of her hands, \"Phew! They reek so much! But it's you who will have to endure them anyways... She had so much sweat in them, it all dried up. She also just walked around a lot in these, so God knows what's on these things. Oh well... Let's make some adjustments to you first, so we can really see the effects!\" Hilda then grabs a pair of scissors and starts cutting away some of the tape around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every cut you take a breathe as if it were your last, in fear that Hilda may cause some collateral damage. However, she is very precise and focused, and finally she looks at you with a smirk of accomplishment, \"So! Now that your crotch is free, we can see how much seed you leave on these socks in the morning!\" You notice now how your whole body is still firmly stuck in the tape, except your genitals breathing in some fresh air. However, Hilda's hand then approaches \"Just one more thing!\" You see Hilda grab all kinds of small pieces of fabric from the violet socks and then kneads them into a ball, \"Open up!\" Hilda demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much of a choice in your restraining situation, you simply open your mouth just to find it filled with fabric from the violet socks. You can just taste the sour but mature sweat, some hint of grime and it basically just tastes like an old sock, a very well-worn one that is. Then Hilda uses some of the cut pieces of tape to enclose your mouth. \"Ah! There we go! Now you can taste my mom's socks too a little bit! But most importantly, now you HAVE to smell them all night. We'll be getting up a bit early though, you'll see why tomorrow!\" Hilda says, with an evil smile, \"But for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two violet socks, folded inside out, are wrapped around body, with the toe and ball sections firmly pushed into your face. Your mouth is busy with tasting the fabric of the socks and the smell that invades your nose confirms the taste that your tongue was identifying. It smells rather sour, heavily used, heavily sweaty socks, with a very mature kind of scent, but most of all; They smell very unwashed! Hilda then looks at you, wrapped in tape and covered by her mother's smelliest socks; \"Woah! This is gonna be something, I wonder how the night will treat you! Well, let's get this started because we gotta get up early tomorrow! Nightnight!\" Hilda says, while opening the usual drawer and putting you in, then closing the drawer. You can then vaguely hear Hilda's final remark: \"Gosh, what a smell, good thing I can just let him bake with that smell in my drawer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in fact hope that you will bake in this smell! After a few breaths you notice your boner is fully in action, you don't want to taint the socks too much but... This is what Hilda needed for her experiment anyways right? Might as well not hold back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so your night continues, taking a deep breath from the well-worn socks of Hilda's mother, who apparently ran a marathon in them and had several work-out sessions in them too. Well, you could surely smell and taste the things these socks have been through! The sweat is very intense, almost burning your nostrils with every breath you take. However, it's a very erotic and wild sensation of burning, it turns you on, and on... And on... And on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost count of how many times you came this night and how much you actually slept. You spent most of your time squirming in your tape-restraints, completely lacking any sense of time, while deeply breathing in the smell of the highly sweaty -yet dry- socks. The sour smell surprises your nostrils every single time when it invades so that it makes you shudder at every breathe. This was a long night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, you feel the drawer opening!</span></div></div>",

So this is the cause of the strange thing Hilda was describing.\" She frowns and then continues: \"Hilda told me to take a look in her shoe since she was feeling like something was maybe there and that one of her feet felt much more comfortable and less sweaty than the other... I am going to assume here that you are the cause of that.\" She takes a look at you and inspects you closely. She then notices how there is some cum on your clothes and how numbed and blissful you look. \"Oh! Hmm...

A-A-Amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Juniper asks you another question: \"Well, if you want, I can just restrain you down there so you'll stay there without Hilda ever noticing... I'm no mad scientist but, if that's what you really desire then I'm willing to indulge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper then continues: \"Here's my current plan for operation; I am going to make a small gap in the sole so that you can remain there without her feeling it at all, with your face well between her toes. Moreover, I will make her shoes wearable by either of her feet and tell her to switch them every day... This way you can tend to both of her feet! Ofcourse, she'll never wash those socks ever again... Maybe I'll give her some of my sweaty socks too from time to time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to drool at the thought while Juniper raises you a bit closer to her ear: \"Would you want me to just secure you in her boots then?\"</span></div></div>",

Then, without further ado, she grabs you and takes you to her lab, apparently, that's already the location you were at. She then makes a nice gap for you in the sole, fitting your body perfectly. \"Okay, let me put you in there\" Juniper says, while she grabs you tightly and takes off all your clothes within a second. \"Ofcourse, I want you to fully enjoy it down there, so having clothes on would be a waste wouldn't it?\" With a numb gaze, you nod, simply awaiting the heavenly predicament that is yet to come. She then fits you in the human-like gap she has made. You lay there with your arms and legs stretched, naked. Juniper then secures your wrists and ankles with some small leathery restraints. \"There. Now Hilda can do whatever she feels like and you cannot even protest against it. Oh my, this is going to be a fun experiment!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then secures one more strap aroud your neck and another aroud your waist before lifting the shoes and walking out of the lab. \"I also altered the shoes so that Hilda can wear them with either of her feet, just to make things more interesting for you. I ascertain you that she'll never notice your presence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear Hilda's voice again, \"Oh professor, did you find something?\" Professor Juniper then answers: \"Well, yes there were some height differences in one of the soles, I simply fixed that and also made some small adjustments to make things even better.\" Hilda nods and Juniper continues: \"However, it is important that you wash those socks only once every three months, when you do, you come to me. It is just really important that you wear the same socks for the utmost comfort! This is because the sweating of your feet will be absorbed by this... -cough- Magical sole, and it will make its sole even more comfortable! Isn't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda nods and cheers, \"That sounds really strange, almost unbelievably strange but, alright! If you say so professor...\" Hilda says, with a slight sound of suspicion in her voice. But she trusts professor Juniper and simple puts the shoes on. You can see the sweaty dark sock coming down, still as wet as you remember it to be. However, this time you are even more properly secured and Hilda slowly walks away while giving her thanks and her goodbyes to professor Juniper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes by slowly, you get to spent every minute under Hilda's wet and sweaty socks inhaling as deep as you can and swallowing as much sweat as you can. You even end up gently licking her sock at this point, trying to get as much sweat out of it as possible and partially cleaning it for her too! \"My oh my, what a long walk, however, these shoes feel great! What if I actually switch them... I haven't tried that before hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda sits down and takes her shoes off, then, you see Hilda's other foot come down. Oh my... This sock is SO much sweater and much more wet. It makes sense given the fact that you've been giving the other foot all this anti-sweat treatment, by swallowing it and drying off her sock a bit with her breath. This one however, is purely sweat, completely wet and untouched. You have to breathe in really deeply to get in any air through this, but you do so and your erection grows, you are already close to ejaculation. Her wet socks gently rubs you body, with a bit less pressure now due to the fact that you are laying ina  gap, however, it is still very firmly rubbing against you body, as well as rubbing against your erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet fabric swirls past your erection over and over, while you have to breathe very deeply to get any air, filing your entire lungs with Hilda's delicious sweat-smell. The arousal then makes you breathe even deeper and fast, making it sound like you are almost hyperventilating, while blissfully enjoying the smell of Hilda's untouched, sweaty, wet and soaked socks. You can't help but start licking as well, tasting the sock and its sweat very well. Then... You can't hold in much longer and simply cum against her sock. Given the difference in size, it's not a lot. However, within a few minutes your erection slowly starts to respond again to all the stimulation you are getting through your sense of smell and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now my right foot is getting less sweaty too! Oh, I guess that's why I should switch them from time to time, hmm!\" Hilda says while she continues to walk to an unknown destination. You inhale really deeply again, not knowing how much further Hilda is going to walk or whatever she has planned. You just remain there and enjoy the smell and the taste of her wet and sweaty feet. Her sweat trickling down onto your body, while the restraints keep you firmly in place, forcing you to be subject to each of Hilda's whims...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaven... And it continues...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours pass by with you smelling Hilda's wet and sweaty socks. Every breath reminds you of your position and arouses you more and more. You must've had several orgasms. By the time it gets dark and the evening falls upon Unova, Hilda finally stops. She sits down and takes her shoes off. You feel Hilda's foot sliding out and you are left there in your smelly prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a familiar voice, it's Professor Juniper again. \"Alright Hilda, I hope you enjoyed the test run, I'll now go ahead and do some final check-ups on the shoes! You can pick them up again tomorrow morning.\" You feel the shoes being taken somewhere, with you confined to one of the soles. You remaind silent, still in daze of the amazing experiences earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear another voice, is that Lenora, Nacrene City's gym leader and the director of Nacrene City's Museum? You see a glimpse of the tall and firm dark skinned woman, she doesn't see you but speaks up: \"So Juniper, here are my socks, I wore these for over a month while doing some archeological expeditions, they are just soaking wet and full of grime and toejam. Ehm... Why exactly did you want this again?\" Juniper sounds exited and replies: \"Oh, oh oh oh! Thank you Lenora, I knew your socks would be very... appropriate testing material. It's for a... ehm... A new investigation on a new type, smelly Pok\u00e9mon! ... -Juniper stutters- Yeh that's it!\" Juniper says, obviously lying. Though, Lenora seems not to care all too much, \"well, you handsomly reward me with special Pok\u00e9balls so, I don't really care what you do with my socks. I'll bring you another pair next month then!\" With that Lenora leaves and you are left alone with professor Juniper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper then looks at you through the opening of the shoe. \"I guess you heard that, didn't you?\" Juniper then holds Lenora's socks and dangles them above the entrance of the shoes. The smell of them just invades the shoes and reaches your nose quickly. You breathe in more deeply and start getting hard again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lenora has been doing her best on these socks! You should be grateful. Now, there is more to this.\" Juniper then opens up the shoe, so she can clearly see and touch your entire body. The light from the lab hurts your eyes initially. You had no idea she customized these shoes THIS much! You are now lying there, basically in the open.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper then looks at you with an evil smile, \"you know, my little test subject, Lenora's feet leave a LOT off toejam and grime in her socks and you must be getting hungry... Certainly Hilda's sweat will make sure you get some kind of hydration but I guess you need some more to survive. Ain't I a nice doctor?\" Then she folds Lenora's socks inside out and starts to grab pieces of grime and toejam out of them and lays them on a small platter. After a few minutes she collected quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up.\" Knowing your position, you simply open your mouth and Juniper instantly puts some of Lenora's grime and toejam in your mouth. \"Eat that, this will be your food. Lenora sweats SO much, I wonder how that tastes...\" You bite on it and eventually chew, it's mainly dead skin, small bits of her toenails, grime, sweat and small soaked pieces of her socks, all combined into a very sweaty meal. Though... The taste is amazing... You can really taste every essence of Lenora's sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeding continues, for almost an hour you are eating small bits of toejam and grime, put it your mouth by professor Juniper. She then takes a small piece of tape and puts it on your mouth. \"Okay, you've had a lot of food, now only smelling for the night, okay?\" Juniper says with a sweet voice. She then closes up Hilda's shoes again, giving you back your usual prison, only able to see through the hole on top, where Hilda's foot would enter. However, for now, Juniper puts Lenora's socks into the shoes and presses them firmly onto your body. \"Smell those, let me hear you smell them.\" Juniper says with a strict voice. you obey and breathe in deeply, the smell is astonishing. Lenora must have beens weating so much, these socks are still completely drenched. Most of her sweat starts pouring onto your body and you have to breathe in really deeply to find any kind of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper then turns off the light and leaves the lab: \"Okay, goodnight then, we're doing this every week to keep you fed. You better get used to Lenora's smell as well.\" Not like you have a choice... Everything goes dark and you just fully focus on breathing through your nose, since your mouth is taped shut anyways. You breathe in deeper and deeper, getting more aroused with every breath while inhaling Lenora's immense foot sweat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to fall asleep, but eventuall you do, while breathing in deeply from the wet socks, specifically the toe section. You had a lot of wet dreams and probably one or two orgasms just from smelling Lenora's sweaty socks. You wake up, you hear sounds outside and realize it's morning, but it must be really early. Who knows when Juniper comes into office? You just lay there, enjoying Lenora's foot smell while it lasts. Deeply inhaling the sweaty socks... Over and over. </span></div></div>",

Professor Juniper is back and she slowly takes Lenora's sock out of Hilda's boots. \"Okay, good job! Looks like you even got some cum on them, I guess you really enjoy sweat then hmm? Interesting...\" She takes Lenora's socks and puts them into a small container and really stuffs them in firmly. \"In that air-sealed container they'll stay nicely warm and retain their smell... For next week's feeding session.\" Juniper says teasingly. She then walks out of the door and comes back... You hear Hilda's voice! Oh, how much you desire to smell and taste her sweaty socks again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then speaks up, \"Oh, my boots! Thank you for making sure they are as perfect as possible professor Juniper. But, you told me to have socks as sweaty as possible but... Mine are in the laundry right now, I can start wearing them tomorrow.\" Juniper then stands up and puts her hands on Hilda's shoulders, \"Oh, wearing sweaty socks is really important for the shoes' comfort and longevity! Well... How about you just wear my socks now? They are really sweaty from several months of wearing them... Without washing them a single time! Oopsie!\" Juniper says with a fakely nice voice. She then continues: \"Let's do it like this, you wear my sweaty socks now, and at night you wear your newly washed own socks. Then after a week or so, you start wearing your own socks full time again and give my sweaty ones back to me. Then you can just continue with your own sweaty socks, till you want to wash them again and then we'll switch. Just so that you'll always wear the sweatest socks while in those boots!\" Juniper says, almost enthousiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGosh! That professor really thought things through... And then you hear Juniper and Hilda sit down, while Juniper hands Hilda her sweaty socks. \"Wow professor, they are almost soaking wet!\" She replies, \"Yeh! I often wear them over night too and only take them off when I shower haha! Sorry, strange habbit!\" The ladies laugh and eventually you see Hilda's foot enter the shoe, wearing Juniper's thing white socks. You can basically see Hilda's gorgeous soles through it. They are so arched, smooth and perfectly shaped. With long toes and a very natural arch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot comes to rest upon you and you realize professor Juniper never removed the tape... You start inhaling deeply and then the smell hits you. You can smell Hilda's sweat, her feet are just as sweaty as ever, despite having walked in different shoes on her way here. But most of all... The socks from professor Juniper are EXTREMELY sweaty. The sweat almost pours into your nose. You inhale deeply, and then just deeper and deeper, trying to get air through the wet socks. But most of all... You love the smell. You start getting a full-on erection already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then stands up and starts to walk. \"Alright professor, thank you so much, I'll wear these now and tonight in bed ill wear my own socks till they get sweaty enough to wear em in my shoes again! Thanks for everything, see you!\" Juniper says her goodbyes and Hilda leaves the lab. She then starts walking, \"alright, back to catching Pok\u00e9mon! I heard the forest nearby has some rare ones I didn't catch yet...\" Hilda then starts to pick up the pace and walk for miles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step you enjoy your prison, this is how your life should be. You smell Juniper's sweat very well, and the mature scent is has just thrills you. It invades your nostrils and has a sour smell to it. The sweat from Juniper's socks eventually makes the tape come off your mouth and you instantly start licking the sweaty sock getting as much of Juniper's sweat into your mouth, causing you to orgasm already. \"Hmm, not sure what I felt but, it must be because of these special shoes hydrating my feet, I think that's what the professor told me.\" Hilda says, unaware of your presence, let alone your orgasms and enjoyment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk continues, and you Hilda's feet get more and more sweaty, mixing with that of professor of Juniper's. Causing you to lick and smell a mixture of their sweat. It's a hot day and especially, there is a lot of walking and running. You just enjoy your time and smell and taste the delicious sweat of your owner and Juniper. Sweat drips into your mouth while you lick Juniper's soft and sweaty socks, and you keep inhaling as deeply as you can, almost humping against Linda's sole if it weren't for the restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin half an hour you came again and the 'torture' just continues... Eventually when the evening falls, the scent of Juniper slowly fades and Hilda's sweat becomes more prominent. Hilda's feet then leave the boots, however, she stuffs Juniper's socks into the boots, firmly onto your face. \"I wonder why the professor told me to keep her socks stuffed only in this shoe and not the other one but, well, alright, I'm exhausted! Time to wear my own clean socks and see how quickly I can get them sweaty again...\" You just lay there, in your restraints, now licking and smelling Juniper's socks, containing a mixture of her own and a bit of Hilda's sweat. The taste and smell are just mind-blowing and give you an erection instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night falls and you eventually fall asleep... Eating whatever toejam you can find and smelling and licking the amazing, thin and sweaty socks of professor Juniper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

This continued for a few days, you endured the entire day smelling and licking Hilda's foot while she was wearing Juniper's extremely sweaty socks. And then in the evening you would be smelling Juniper's socks the entire night. Over the course of a week they start to smell more and more like Hilda's sweat and less like Juniper's sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the next day you see an extremely weat and sweaty sock enter the boot, a black sock! Hilda is back to her own socks and they are as sweaty as ever! You take a deep whiff and almost orgasm instantly. You start inhaling deeply and suck on her sock in search for sweat to get in your mouth, meanwhile practically making out with her sock. Your urges want you to hump against her foot but you can't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next evening you're brought to Juniper again to stay there over night, you are forced to smell Lenora's socks again there and eat any toejam they contain, bit by bit. Once the feeding has been done, you get to enjoy the smell of Lenora's sweaty and soaked socks for a full night till Hilda comes to pick you up again the next morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black socks enter the shoes again and once again you almost orgasm on the first big and deep whiff you take from Hilda's socked foot. She walks as much as she always does, making sweat envelop your body while you fanatically breathe in, as deeply as you can giving you a constant state of arousal. Meanwhile you kiss and lick her socks, getting plenty of her sweat into your mouth. After a few hours she switches her boots and you get to enjoy the other foot as well, giving you a lot of 'untouched' sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis routine continues... Day by day, week by week. Then after a month or two you are reunited with Juniper's socks for a week and then back to only Hilda's. All this time you simply survive as an insole, with Hilda unaware of your presence. But that's exactly how you like it, being subjected to Hilda's every whim without taking you into account at all. You simply have to endure whatever she feels like doing and you do so with pleasure, smelling and tasting her sweat like it's the only world you know. The only right world, the only right thing to experience every single day, over and over... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling the smell of Hilda's wet, sweaty socks, while sweat trickles into your mouth. Yet, Hilda being fully unaware of what she is doing to you. Being restrained and forced to do this for as long as professor Juniper desires, all the while being subjected to her socks as well as Lenora's, giving you great pleasure. And then back to being Hilda's silent insole, taking in her smell every single day while the cycle simply continues... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, that's the only right world for you, the only right ending...  However, it only just began and it'll never end!</span></div></div>",

It might be harder for her to feel you while wearing the silky smooth legwear, but you decided to go forward on your quest anyways (plus it would take you another good 5-10 minutes to simply make your way back to her face with how minuscule you were).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the soles of the young teenage giantess. Even before you could really get close, waves of heat could be felt emanating from her feet. It was a hot day in this area of Unova, and the stockings weren't exactly helping the girl keep cool. You could tell that layers upon layers of heat and sweat were being stored within those black stockings, just waiting for their chance to be released. Luckily, you were on the outside of them, so it was still somewhat bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...How humiliating it was to even think that a little body heat from a teenage girl's feet could be so intimidating......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your hand on the girl's left foot and moved it around in a circular motion, feeling up the steamy fabric and noticing the intricate stitching that was needed to sew even the simplest pair of stockings. Puffs of what felt like steam from a sauna hit you in the face every time you forcefully placed your hand on her plushy and squishy soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, her feet were definitely drenched in sweat underneath those stockings, and her sweat was slowly seeping onto you. You looked over to your right to see her toes flex back and forth from within their dark fabric confines, almost as if they wanted to squeeze something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a small yawn could be heard yards away (to you). It seems the girl was waking up thanks to your efforts, but at that moment, something caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small hole in her stockings could be seen right next to her pinky toe. You had the perverted and dangerous idea to crawl into that steaming sauna of body heat and foot sweat, if only so you could be squeezed by her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could wait outside the stockings patiently for her to fully wake up, and finally get her attention for real.</span></div></div>",

This plan had it's own risks, but you decided the benefits outweighed them. Of course since she seemed like she would be out of it for quite a while, you might as well curl up under something and get some sleep yourself. Since she didn't bother getting changed from her normal clothes before crashing into the bed, your only option was the socks she tossed to the side of her bed. They were a little damp and gave off a powerful odor from a long day of nonstop traveling, but they were the only option you had. Grabbing one of the socks, you pulled it over you like a blanket, preferring to stay outside of the sock if possible. Thankfully, the heat it was giving off felt pretty good after being in the cold all day. Small comforts to take away from a bad situation. Within moments, you were off to dreamland as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later you were jolted awake from a loud ringing sound. Apparently Rosa set an alarm. You blindly reached around for the source before remembering what happened. Thankfully you slept quite well in spite of your conditions. Rosa on the other hand was much slower to get up. She clearly wanted to sleep in longer, but after a minute or two, she lazily turned over and shut off the alarm, sitting upright and stretching her arms. \"Guess it's time to get up.\" she said in a groggy tone. You got out from under the sock and ran up close to her as she was rubbing her eyes. You were eager to get the gigantic girl's attention, but there lied a small problem with your plan: actually getting Rosa's attention. As you tried waving your arms and calling up to her, Rosa was still too tired to really notice or hear you. As she turned to get out of the bed you saw her massive bare foot dangling overhead. \"Oh crap.\" you thought and turned to run. Looking back you saw her massive sole lowering towards you as the unaware giantess takes her first step out of her bed.</span></div></div>",

Sure you wanted help, but not from a young trainer. She\u2019s probably going to try to capture you or something. Just as you pass the extinguished camp fire, you hear the zipper open up and the giant girl emerge from the tent. Tripping up onto the ground as she tried to escape the tent too fast, which did make you kind of laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl heard your laugh and spotted you running, \u201cWait, please i won't hurt you\u201d She says as she picks up her hat and got up from the ground giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour almost into the tall grass and away from the campsite when your stopped by a giant sneaker blocking your path.

I said I'm not gonna hurt ya and I mean it.\" A finger from her other hand began to gently rub your head. \"But that doesn't mean I can't get some use out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her that she can't do that, you're a human and she should be helping you and not keeping you.

She had clearly decided that she was going to do whatever she wanted with you, and she probably was going to do that sooner rather than later. She said she wasn't going to hurt you, so for now you could relax knowing that she won't do anything dangerous. Well, relax as much as you can knowing you're in the hands of a girl who hardly seems to care about your status as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa hummed happily to herself as she moved through her tent. It was cute humming coming from an equally cute, but surprisingly malicious, girl. She made her way over to her bag and, using her free hand, began rummaging through it. She purposefully held you far enough away from the bag that couldn't see what was inside. You could only sigh in submission. The happy look on Rosa's face probably only meant bad news for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, found what I was looking for!\" The bun haired girl declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout showing off what it was, Rosa sat on the ground with her legs crossed. Singing a little jingle to herself, Rosa changed her grip on you, holding you between her fingers instead of fully in her hand. She giggled quietly as you struggled just as futilely as before; though she was merciful enough to not tease you. Without a care in the world, Rosa's fingers moved you to the floor on the tent and held you in place. Her other hand came into view and Rosa's jingle started picking up for the final. As her other hand descended on you, you felt something sticky wrap itself on your body and the floor: tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dah dah dah dah!\" Rosa finished her jingle cheerfully as she moved both hands away. Yep, you were well taped onto the floor. Your arms were firmly pinned to the side of your body, which was completely stuck in place. You were one hundred percent trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to her humming, Rosa began doing something you did not like at all. She was tugging at her shoe laces! You could clearly hear the fabric of the shoelaces rub against each other as Rosa undid the knot of her shoes. In a moment, one of her popped out of her shoe and into the open air of the tent, her toes wiggling excitedly. Her other foot was quickly freed from its own shoe and Rosa set them both aside. Aside and behind you of course. Miraculously, they were far enough away that they didn't smell. But if you looked behind you as far as you could, you see inside of her shoes; and they were well worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... can you help me out?\" Rosa asked cheekily, grabbing your attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauntingly, Rosa held her pink socked feet over you, casting a shadow over your tiny form even inside of her tent. She scrunched her toes eagerly. You weren't sure if it was because she was excited or if it was some sort of taunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet have been sore lately from all of the traveling I've done! Would you be a pal and give them a <i>little</i> massage.\" She laughed at her emphasis on the word little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't going to admit it, but playing like this with someone tiny had been on her mind for a while now. It had been ever since her last film she did at Pokestar studios. She had had a lot of fun at the studio for awhile after winning her first badge, but she stopped after a movie about a giant woman or something. She played the woman's sister and had to help her get back to normal size. It was a weird movie, but she had filmed plenty of weird stuff while at the studio. The idea of being big never even occurred to her until she met a fan after the film. They were a little strange, talking about how they wished Rosa had been the giantess and ended the movie with a city in her shoe, but they were nice. And their words struck a cord with Rosa and got her interested. Now she was having a chance with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you don't wanna, I could always just rest my feet on you. You'd be a bit more comfortable than the hard ground. What'll it be?\" Rosa asked eagerly.</span></div></div>",

She hoped you would be a little more willing, but your refusal didn't really mean anything to her; after all, what could you even do at this size? Tickle her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, little guy, you know what I said I'd do if you didn't rub my feet...\" she grinned wryly, wiggling her toes through her socks. \"Now I have a <i>different</i> kind of massage in mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break into a sweat at the notion. Why did that sound so...foreboding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa stamps her feet down, sitting with her arms around her knees. Slowly, she began to sneak her socked feet near you, humming a familiar tune...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuh nuh...duuuuuh nah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour large stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...duh nah duh nah duh nah duh nah...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steps are speeding up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...duhnahduhnahduhnahduhnahduhnahduhnahduhnahduhnah...!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet are almost touching you, and to your abysmal luck, you can smell them, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...Duhnahnahnah-<b>NA!</b></i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clamps her left foot over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body is covered in a mass of warm, slightly damp fabric. Your face is pushed into the space between her energetic toes and the ball of her foot, right where she sweats the most. The moisture isn't too overbearing now, and the slightly cheesy smell isn't intolerable (though it's still quite potent) but somehow you feel like that'll change as this torment goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, toasty! I hope you're getting warmed up too, little buggy!\" Rosa exclaims, clenching her toes over your face and squeezing it into the crevice of her big and second toes, \"Here, lemme help you out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, she rubbed her foot back and forth over your body, still clutching your head with her plump, meaty digits, and making sure to ruffle your hair with them every time they pass by your head. You hate to admit it, but this 'foot massage' did feel pretty cozy; though that's probably because she just taped you to a cold linoleum floor, making any source of heat relatively snug. The heat from her tired feet starts soaking into you and the tile you're on, along with an almost imperceptible layer of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa had to admit, this was <i>really</i> fun! It felt right to be able to toy around with this little dude that came by her way, even if it wasn't the most morally sound thing she'd done. She had to thank that fan for the great idea later; maybe she could even convince the tiny boy under her to come along...after he warmed up to her feet, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little bit naughty, Rosa deliberately traces the big toe of her right foot across your taped legs, delicately brushing against your inner thighs, until the pad of it was pushed firmly against your crotch. Even though you weren't really enjoying it, your felt yourself getting hard from the teasing pressure she put on your genitals. You instinctively relax and absentmindedly nuzzle the toes covering your face, the endorphins surging through your mind clouding your common sense. Whether out of your own free will or not, you plant a kiss on her socked big toe as it slides past you, a slight hint of her perspiration meeting your tongue. Surprisingly, the salty tang of the sweat wasn't too bad; in fact, it was kind of refreshing- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! What am I thinking...\" You suddenly feel embarrassed at how quickly you've become accustomed to being under this cute girl's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little show of appreciation didn't slip by Rosa, though, and she squealed at the subtle feeling of your lips press against her toe. \"Eeee! The little guy likes my feet, hehe~!\" You blush, realizing you've been caught. You look away, unable to show your face to your eccentric captor. \"What a cutie! He's sooo shy, he just can't admit it to himself~. Maybe I can help with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa's big toe begins to stroke your groin even faster, putting more of her weight into the motion. You feel your penis rapidly expanding from the consistent ministrations this huge mass of toe flesh is applying to you, and you feel kind of light-headed from both the heady scent of feet surrounding you and all the sexual excitement you've received in a few minutes. After a few agonizingly long moments where you were edged by Rosa's toes, they suddenly retreated, leaving you cold and, to be honest, lonely. You already missed the physical contact you had with this mischievous girl, even if it was at the expense of your dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the teen titan towering above you, attempting to find out what caused her to stop caressing you. As your gaze trails down her modest outfit and back down to her legs, you can see that she's taking off her pink, knee-high socks. What is she doing?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't see or hear you so you decided to run over to her, climbing over many hills and valleys created by the blankets. You crawl near her socked foot, which was absolutely massive to you. A slight stench emanated from the worn fabric, but it wasn't too bad. You poke the plush wall a few times to get the giant cute girl's attention, and it seemed to have worked! Well, sorta.

One of the first things you noticed about this girl were her breasts, they were massive, and hung over you like two hot air balloons.

You don't have to ask twice!\" the giantess immediately replies. She lowers her hand down and you jump on. As you are raised up to the girl's eye level you get a better look at her body. She seemed about 16-17 but could easily pass off as an adult (a combination of her BW/BW2 designs). Her low-cut white tank-top showed off an impressive amount of cleavage, even with a black shirt underneath. She also had a puffy looking orange jacket and green pants. You reached her green eyes and looked at her bright, kind looking green eyes, and could almost see your own reflection in her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bianca by the way! Sorry for not saying that earlier.\" The giantess remarks. You tell her you can't seem to remember your name. \"Hmm, I see...

Whether it was because of the tight hug or the simple fact that you weren\u2019t tired, you were stuck there, wide awake and trapped in the giant blonde girls loving hug. Not the worst situation but the novelty was wearing off and you were getting bored just laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 10 minutes, your prayers seemed to get answered. Bianca shifted a little and removed one of her arms from you. While the other was stillon top of you, the grip was now loose enough that you were able to easily slide free. Stretching your arms and looking back up at the sleeping giantess, you couldn\u2019t help but smile a little at how cute she looked. Returning to your newfound freedom you decided to...</span></div></div>",

She was still out like a light, snoring cutely as her arms shifted once more. Even as a huge giantess, Bianca was admittedly really cute to you. Realizing you had time to kill you looked around your surroundings. Of course you were pretty much stuck on the bed given that no-one designed anything with someone of your stature in mind. Not that you'd blame them. But it was such a shame that you couldn't really do anything to kill time.... besides. You looked back to the sleeping Bianca. You almost felt guilty about the thoughts that were going on in your head at the moment... Still you could probably have some harmless fun before she gets up... nothing too bad... honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resumed your internal justifications for your thoughts as Bianca suddenly rolled over, now resting her back near you. You figured now or never. Why not have a little fun? You made your way down towards her feet, stopping to marvel her massive ass along the way. This girl was definitely blessed with one hell of a body. You doubted you'd have the chance to explore all of it, but you hoped you'd at least get to see the ass. As you reached her feet you gently ran a hand along the sole. The toes stretched and wiggled in rhythm with your motions. You rubbed along the toe causing it to stretch out some. Your guilty thoughts were slowly being pushed aside and being replaced with a mixture of curiosity, desire, and amusement. You soon pressed your second hand into the sole and gave her a gentle foot rub, hearing her sigh happily up above. You started to get nervous about her waking up from this, but kept on rubbing, almost compelled not to break the rhythm you had going so far. </span></div></div>",

As the blonde giant looked about curiously, she felt an odd yet pleasant sensation at her foot. Of course, even tired, it didn\u2019t take her too long to put one and one together. Your cover was quickly removed as you saw the giant staring at you. You wanted to lie, find a way to talk your way out of this awkward position. But of course you were caught red handed. You were right there hands still on her sole. The question is, how does she react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blonde giantess stared at you, sleep still clear in her eyes. You nervously stood by the girl's sole, too nervous to move away from it. You were caught like a deer in headlights, except those headlights were the eyes of a giant girl who's foot you just rubbed. Your face flushed read with embarrassment, and you averted your gaze slightly. How in the world were you going to explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca looked at you, her mind clouded by sleep. She could see that you were embarrassed for some reason, but she couldn't process why. She rubbed one of her eyes and groaned quietly, trying to wake up. \"What are you doing down there little guy?\" She yawned. \"Was I snoring or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Bianca became more aware of what was happening. With her mind mostly clear of drowsiness, she finally noticed that you had your hands on the sole of her foot. She began to blush at the sight, not expecting to see that. \"O-oh my.\" She said quietly. A small smile started creeping onto her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frantic by her foot, half expecting her to grab you with her toes and crush you into paste. You see Bianca's foot shift slightly, and you bring your hands up in fear. Nothing happens though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca giggled happily. \"That's so cute! You wanted to give me foot massage while I was asleep.\" She seemed to be taking the situation well. \"You could've just asked but what you wanted to do it without me noticing.\" She shifted onto her knees, resting herself on her legs and taking her feet away from you. \"You should've just said something. I would have given you a reward for the massage or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood in front of Bianca, relieved about how she was taking the situation. She really was seeing the best in the situation and didn't seem to suspect that you had been drawn to her feet because you were genuinely interested in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed Bianca had a very happy look on her face. \"I can't believe that a boy likes my feet so much that he'd massage them when he was like two inches tall! It must have been so big to you.\" She beamed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, looks like she had figured out your real reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay with that?\" You asked, embarrassed that she was so happy about your interest in her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! You can't imagine how happy it makes me.\" She said earnestly. \"When I first went on my journey, my two friends got really obsessed with Pok\u00e9mon. Which is nice and all but later down the line I started hoping one of them would be... interested in me. It never really happened, but I didn't mind.\" She gingerly tapped your head and giggled. \"But now I got you. And...\" She trailed off, bringing her foot back in front of you. She flexed her foot, trying to be seductive and showing off some wrinkles. \"If you're already so enthralled by my feet I bet I can get you to love all of me pretty easy.\" She winked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bury you face in your hands, incredibly embarrassed by the situation. You had no idea that a sudden interest in feet would result in Bianca trying to make you her boyfriend. She was a cute girl, but your size was a bigger concern than finding a relationship. Though you doubt that she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. I got a little plan for you.\" Bianca said in a singsong voice, emphasizing the word 'little'.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bianca leaned forward; arms crossed on her knees. She moved her other foot forward so that you were treated to the sight of not one, but two giant feet, curling and stretching to get your attention. Despite your misgivings about her \u2018goal\u2019 of making you her boyfriend, you couldn\u2019t help but peek out of your hands, only to take them off your face completely when you were inevitably captivated by their lovely curvature and billowing wrinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got my little plan figured out,\u201d she beams, delighted by your awed reaction. She gently tips her feet towards you, her toes wiggling infectiously at you. They were inches (to you) from your face, sending your heartbeat skyrocketing and worsening your blush. This time, you lean forward. She halts her toes, wanting you to make the first move. You can\u2019t will yourself away, no matter how hard you try; instead, you push your face into the soft, fleshy bulb of her big toe, and, after a small moment of hesitation, give it a soft kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca makes a cute squealing sound. \u201cEEEEE! So cuuute!\u201d she squeaks, \u201cYou do like me, little guy!  That proves it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, you groan a little. Why did you let a moment of weakness stop you from setting her straight? Your \u2018height problem\u2019 wasn\u2019t really something you should\u2014or could\u2014put off until later. You needed help. And yet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you contemplated your regrets, Bianca\u2019s feet began their plan; slowly, so as not to immediately draw your attention, they moved in coordination: one to the back of you, the other to the front. When they got into position, they slapped together, surrounding you in their warm, slightly damp grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-aahh\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were squashed, both soles facing towards you. The sudden change in environment shook you out of your thoughts and put a blush on your face. The undeniable tinge of sweat is all around you, sending a tingle up your spine at the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, you look so adorable there, little guy! Maybe you should stay a while\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe firm, fleshy foot prison you were trapped in began to shift as the large, travel-weary soles ground against your body. If it was possible for any more blood to rush to your face right now, it\u2019d happen. The movement was agonizingly slow, and the growing tent in your pants spoke more clearly than any words you could\u2019ve said; you were definitely enjoying this. You nuzzled against the sole in front of you, giving yourself up to the lovestruck girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMh-hmhm,\u201d she laughed to herself, obviously pleased with her work, \u201cYou\u2019re in safe hands, little guy\u2014or maybe feet? Hehehe\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, she slid her soles back down to the mattress, taking you with them. She carefully maneuvered your body, making sure to not drop you, as she laid you out face-down on the bottom of one of her feet. With no willpower to resist any more, you simply hugged her foot and let your body relax. You were too tense, anyway\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca\u2019s eyes lidded, her gaze never leaving you. Suddenly, a great idea to entice you even more popped into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lay there, cutie? Let me help you\u2026relax,\u201d She drawled, attempting to sway you further. She didn\u2019t even need to try; you\u2019ve already been turned into putty by the soft embrace of her feet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA toe pokes your back, seeking purchase on your body. After a bit of nudging, it finally wormed its way into the back of your shirt, dragging it off of your chest. The feeling of warm, firm flesh on your back was soothing, so you just let it happen, even helping it by grabbing your shirt at the end and fully pulling it off. Now you were topless, giving Bianca free access to your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe resumes its calming massage, digging deep into your back and working out the kinks like a master masseuse. You moan softly and without restraint, lulled into a blissful state of mind by her wonderful, angelic toe. You repeatedly kiss the ball of her foot in gratitude, and Bianca hums in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get those pesky shorts off, cutie\u2026\u201d she whispers, ready to send her tiny boyfriend-to-be to the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping your body over with her toe, she carefully pushes her toe against your chest, rubbing your body deeply as it slowly descends towards the waistband of your shorts. Already trusting of her, you don\u2019t stop her as her toe hooks into them, pressing slightly against your package. You straighten your legs, making it easier for her to slip off your legwear and toss it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your relaxation, you instinctively become nervous as you realize that, even with your height difference, Bianca can easily see your member, steadily hardening in your boxers. Should you really be going this far with someone you just met?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Bianca\u2026\u201d you mutter, looking up at your giant\u2026girlfriend-to-be? Maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops, rather flustered herself. \u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026If we\u2019re going to do this\u2026be gentle, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of clarity washed over her. Was it really right to do this; to get him addicted to her feet, just so she could have a boyfriend? Was it even a real relationship if she had to coerce him? She sighs, her mind filling with doubt. Tears begin to well up in her eyes as a terrible guilt opens up a pit in her gut. She really messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retracts her feet, careful not to bump you around too much. You look up. You\u2019re confused, but as your arousal dies down, it feels like a huge lump of anxiety that you only just noticed dissolved, filling you with such an intense feeling of relief that you doubt you\u2019ll ever feel anything like it again, short of being saved from mortal danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks, Bianca\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so awful! Unable to hold her misery back any longer, she quietly began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, little guy! I don\u2019t know what came over me\u2026I\u2026I-I-I\u2026took advantage of you!\u201d she yelps, hot tears falling down her face. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026h-horrible\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but feel a bit sad yourself, even though she did, indeed, take advantage of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it isn\u2019t a good reason at all, a-and I shouldn\u2019t even say it, because you don\u2019t d-deserve to hear my excuses\u2014\u201d she chokes back a sob, \u201c\u2014but I\u2019m just so, so l-lonely\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou very intimately know how it feels to be alone; you experienced it in a more intense fashion than you ever had in your life, just before you met Bianca: the person who rescued you, who kept you safe with her. As you watch her bitter tears fall, splashing upon her skirt and onto the bed, you can\u2019t help but feel sympathy for her. You forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianca,\u201d you state, more power in your little voice than you even knew you had, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand that kind of pain; what it feels like, how desperate it makes you\u2026I wasn\u2019t sure before, but I\u2019m certain of it now. You being able to stop yourself from going to far, the genuine tears you\u2019re crying, are more than enough for me. I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pit in Bianca\u2019s stomach lightens, ever so slightly. She\u2019s still crying, but she\u2019s a bit calmer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d you respond warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026hug you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand stretches out, slowly laying itself out on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk forward and lay down in her palm, hugging her hand gently. \u201cGo ahead, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile, though wavering, sets itself onto her face. She closes her hand, ever so carefully, around your body, and raises you to her chest. She lays back down on the mattress, clutching you to her chest and letting her tears run dry. You lay just below her cleavage, gripping her stomach in a tight hug, comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two just stay there for a while, calming each other down. A few tears of your own fall from your eyes, both from the relief of not being forced into less-than-consensual sexual contact and pleasant company of a friendly (if a bit possessive) face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both of you calm down, emotions running low. You realize that, even if it was a bit dubiously consensual, you really enjoyed your time down at Bianca\u2019s feet. The tender embrace between you and the girl has left you still slightly aroused, particularly do to your member pressing into her skin through your undergarments. Now that you two have opened up to each other, you\u2019re much more receptive to her advances, even if it meant delaying your search for a cure to this bizarre shrinking condition you have. You tap her finger, still unsure if you\u2019re completely ready for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally done crying, Bianca recognizes your tapping, and gently lifts you to your feet. You chuckle a bit, realizing that you can\u2019t see much of her face due to her bountiful breasts blocking most of the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, cu\u2014I mean, little guy?\u201d she hesitantly switches her names for you, thinking that the latter is a bit more respectful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you see the dried streaks of tears stained on her reddened face, you feel your resolve falter. Maybe you two should just sleep this off and talk about it tomorrow. Then again, you can feel your erection poking hard at your trousers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

To finally sleep on an actual bed. It's been days the last time I got to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this declaration, one main question came to your mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca?\" you called, causing her to moan out a soft,<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you in the forest in the first place?\" you asked, recalling the brief stay in her tent, which was followed by a long trip in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was doing some research,\" Bianca quietly replied, her usual excitement reduced because of the drowsiness,<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper asked me to find and observe a rare species of Pokemon, but-\" she paused to yawn,<br>\r\n\"... I had no luck. The most rare Pokemon I found in that forest was a Pansage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began giggling after that remark, causing you to start laughing as well. Her laughter was contagious, not to mention her face looked so cute while she let out a series of polite giggles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother yawn escaped Bianca's mouth, interrupting her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...

She tripped over her own feet on the way and nearly fell, managing to keep herself on those same feet of hers by grabbing the chair behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, shot you an awkward smile and resumed her walk to the bed before laying down, her head landing straight where it was a moment ago, next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl let out a sigh of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked off her shoes as well in the meantime. After a day of walking around the forest, you'd expect a rather pungent smell coming from them or from her feet, but you actually smelled nothing. This giantess knew to take care of herself, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to sleep?\" you questioned her, feeling like that would be a good idea after the day she had... and after the day you had, constantly battered by her bosom as she walked all the way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Bianca turned her head slightly so that she was facing you. However, you noticed, she had lost her smile and was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" she said, sounding flustered,<br>\r\n\"I was hoping... do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe request sounded a bit weird coming so suddenly from such a sudden change of persona, but you replied,<br>\r\n\"Sure. Anything,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks!\" Bianca said cutely, her smile returning,<br>\r\n\"You see, I was hoping for a foot rub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back. This wasn't what you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Foot rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" she replied,<br>\r\n\"After walking around all day, my feet are killing me. Could you help me relax by giving me a foot rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw nothing wrong with the request coming from the cute giantess. You considered it as a way to pay her back for her kindness and proclaimed confidently,<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'll do my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca smiled in response, so warmly, so brightly that you couldn't help but smile back as you headed down to where her bare feet were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short stroll, you found yourself right in front of her towering soles, her toes wiggling with anticipation. And, while not smelling bad, her feet didn't smell good either. They emanated a neutral odor, but were damp with sweat after being stuffed in her boots for all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, you moved forward, wanting to please your massive caretaker, and placed your hands on the sole of her left foot before starting to rub, trying to put your back into it to do an at least, if not good, decent rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour efforts went beyond your own expectations as Bianca began moaning after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do keep that up... feels wonderful...\" she cooed, closing her eyes, deciding that you were quite capable of handling the situation by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt your small hands sliding across her sole and going all the way to her heels before rising up to her toes, which were hanging right above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes of you working on one foot, you moved on to the other and started rubbing again, ignoring the dampness the sweat left on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp, down, middle; up, down, middle; up, down, middle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated the process over and over, paying particular attention to the ball of her foot and to the spots between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca felt your hands on her other foot and let out a contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did grant the favor she asked you: you were really helping her relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she felt so relaxed that she felt she could simply nod off at any moment.</span></div></div>",

Thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think you could give my back a massage too?\" she asked, starting to rub her back with her hands, whining,<br>\r\n\"You know... sleeping on the ground isn't too good, and I have this pain since I gotten into the forest. Do you think you could take care of that, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back would be a harder task to accomplish, you mused, but if you hit the right places, even with your stature, you should have been able to do at least a decent job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I can do that.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca started clapping childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonderful!\" she happily cheered,<br>\r\n\"Just let me take this off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, in a few seconds, her white shirt came off, leaving her only in the black one she was wearing underneath, her cleavage coming into view even more than before. However, she was not done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThreatening to give you a nosebleed, she took off the black shirt as well, remaining in a white bra that could barely contain her massive bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was perplexed for a few seconds, before she realized why the blood cells moved to your face and smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you did ride all the way here in them,\" she recalled jokingly,<br>\r\n\"Don't tell that seeing my underwear is too much for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made your blush become deeper. No, it actually made Bianca laugh at how cute your reaction was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter reduced to a cute giggling that she stifled by placing her hand over her mouth as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she gently got a hold of you and moved you aside while she laid down, her head taking place where you were standing a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca turned it slightly to the right and sent a smile your way, before dropping you onto the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back looked like a massive landscape to you, and all of a sudden it dawned on you: how in the world were you supposed to massage something several times your height? One thing was her foot, which was only slightly taller than you at the moment, but this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you're ready.\" Bianca encouraged, her head, sinking into the soft mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to yourself and hesitantly walked down onto her bare back, which was only partially covered by her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what you were supposed to do, you knelt down and began sliding your hands on the soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed your hands into it, trying to reach the bone below to massage it, moving after a few minutes of massaging the same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was being eerily quiet, unlike when you massaged her feet: she had stifled moans then, but now she wasn't making a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to give it much thought, you kept going, feeling your arms burning from the effort of driving them into Bianca's skin, but that did not stop you. You kept going while half an hour slowly went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached the end of Bianca's back and dropped by her behind, resting for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" she said, sounding surprised,<br>\r\n\"Are you... are you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded... disappointed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"So, how...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca looked down, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realized that you failed to ease her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... barely even felt you...\" she admitted, her blush widening,<br>\r\n\"Bu-But it's okay! We all have limits! You don't have to be sorry, I-I appreciate the effort, really!\" she hastily said, trying to make up for her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the damage was done, and you felt your pride being stung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to grab you, but you stopped her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Let me try again, I want to help!\" you said, her hand stopping in mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I wouldn't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you...\" she kindly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to think that, Bianca!\" you retorted, wondering how could she even think about such things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then...\" she murmured, her hand retracting,<br>\r\n\"If you are fine with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she couldn't see you, you nodded and knelt down once more, starting to rub again, making more of an effort this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, as minutes went by, it became clear that Bianca still couldn't fully feel you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, you stood up, deciding to try with a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began pressing your feet into her skin instead of your hands. Initially, Bianca didn't seem to notice, but when you pressed hard into her knot, she gave a surprised,<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did I... did it hurt?\" you wondered, expecting her to turn around with her face twisted with rage or at the very least gone from a smile to an upset expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she turned her head with sparkling eyes and a huge smile, saying that you were confused didn't fully describe what you were feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding!?\" the blonde giantess exclaimed,<br>\r\n\"That felt wonderful! Keep doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieved. Whatever you were doing, you were doing it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started walking around her back again, pressing down with your feet into the hard bone below her skin, making her murr in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it...\" she murmured after a while,<br>\r\n\"Keep going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more time passed, but you had given up trying to keep track of it. Eventually, you did reach the top of Bianca's back, where you started, and began 'massaging' her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Bianca declared her satisfaction in a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped, feeling that your arms and legs had fallen asleep after the massage you gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed you before sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that felt great!\" she praised, placing you down onto the soft bed before grabbing her white shirt and putting it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she stared down at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing.\" you humbly replied,<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\"</span></div></div>",

A yawn came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she replied, fixing her green eyes back on your form,<br>\r\n\"I am a bit sleepy, after wandering through the woods for the whole day. What do you say we go to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you yawned as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sleep sounds about great right now...\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca smiled, finding you adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she got back up from the bed, giving you a good view of her butt. You couldn't look away, as much as you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca turned around and caught you staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou abruptly snapped out of your trance and blushed, staring at her sorrowfully, thinking she'd be mad at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, Bianca just giggled, winked and began walking, heading for the a door that connected the room to the bathroom, not before having picked up her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back!\" she said cheerfully, disappearing inside the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have gone to change into her sleepwear, you figured, imagining how she was going to look like when she walked out of that bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you felt guilty, thinking about her in such way, but you justified yourself telling that it was out of admiration for bother her looks and the kind way she acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people would have helped a shrunken person who entered their tent in the woods without their explicit authorization, but Bianca went past that and decided to help you the moment you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt blessed to have found such beautiful with an as well as beautiful heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the bed and waited for the blonde giantess to return. You never saw her in her sleepwear, having only met her yesterday before she left the forest, bringing you along in a trip that lasted a whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you realize how lucky you had been, not just meeting the right person, but meeting her in the right time and place: had you failed to find her tent last night, Bianca would have left the forest without you, dooming you to a nearly certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a distraction came pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm back...\" Bianca's voice called, causing you to snap out of your own world and look in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her smiling face staring down at you, her body fit in a white top over matching white pants that went down to her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment, dropping her bag to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" she asked, striking a bit of a pose, causing her bosom to bounce and you to nearly suffer a heart attack..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...\" you stuttered, several lewd adjectives running through your head; you had to breath in a moment, calm down and reply,<br>\r\n\"You look great, Bianca!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiled massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks c- ahh!\" she screamed as she went to take a step, but tripped over her discarded bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer impact with the ground seemed to shake the whole room. Having something like this happened before, you came to the conclusion that Bianca was a bit of an air-head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her laying on the floor, probably seeing stars... you had to choke back a laugh, watching as she got back up, looking beyond embarrassed, her cheeks burning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry...\" she stammered, flustered, as she skipped her bag and headed to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush didn't leave, but the smile came back to her face as she recalled her previous line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying,\" she told, sitting down on the bed, leaving one leg out,<br>\r\n\"You're awfully cute! None of my friends has ever complimented my looks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Bianca paused to sigh dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all great people, but they're so taken by Pokemon that they hardly talked about anything else back when we used to travel as trainers,\" she explained, closing her eyes,<br>\r\n\"And now, Cheren is a gym leader and I hardly see him; as for Hilbert, I haven't seen him in a year and a half. Sometimes I wonder how he's doing, if he's alright or if he's still even alive. He taught me a lot during my journey as a trainer, he helped me realize that my path was research,\" she explained, glad to have someone who listened to her tales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head, not sure how the conversation took direction, but listening anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you miss your friends, Bianca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her turn to nod,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. But... it's nice to remember those times. It's been almost three years now,\" she said, smiling at you,<br>\r\n\"Now, let's go to sleep, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the blanket from the bed and slid beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are we actually sharing a bed?\" you asked, causing her to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's only one, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... guess I'll just sleep over here then,\" you said, moving to the edge of her pillow, which could easily pass as a bed for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy now,\" she said, grabbing you and pulling you embarrassingly close to her massive chest,<br>\r\n\"We've already been that close, no need to be ashamed,\" she told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, this is for the great job you did,\" she said, pulling you up to her lips, giving you a quick peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips felt soft, warm, <i>heavenly</i>. One quick peck was enough to send you in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight!\" she said, bringing you back down to her chest, embracing you, before pulling the blanket over her and your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, and Bianca fell asleep. She had been hiding it well, but she was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as she was asleep, you too laid your head down and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I'm in love.</i>' you thought to yourself, before drifting off to sleep as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night went on peacefully as you slept soundly against Bianca's massive bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept throughout the night without waking once and, eventually, dawn's first lights began to shine in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the sun kept rising as you and your host kept on sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while more passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the first waking up. After yawning and rubbing your eyes, you looked up at Bianca, who was still snoozing with you pressed against her warm chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your cheeks slowly adopting a red shade as you were reminded of where you slept throughout the night. Not that you minded, since you literally rode all the way here in direct contact with <i>those</i>, but it still didn't keep you from feeling embarrassed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour moved up to Bianca's sleeping face. She looked very cute while asleep, with her hair disheveled and her mouth opening and closing as she snored softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful was the right word to describe her, beautiful on the outside and on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you couldn't move nor get free from her grasp - not that you really wanted to - you had no choice but to wait for Bianca to wake up, which didn't take too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes after your awakening, Bianca's snoring came to an end, and a yawn escaped her mouth before she smacked her lips and slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing that she was holding onto something, Bianca looked down, discovering you staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile crept up across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey...\" she said, still mostly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" you replied, <br>\r\n\"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca hazily extended an arm behind her and reached for a nightstand near the bed to retrieve her Xtransceiver before looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... 9 AM.\" she replied, putting the device back on the nightstand and sitting upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your sleep?\" she asked. You couldn't tell for sure, but you could detect a hint of teasing playfulness hidden beneath her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you smiled back,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great, thank you.\" you replied, making Bianca's smile grow slightly wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that. Now, wait here,\" she said, placing you on the bed, stretching and getting up. A small moan escaped her mouth,<br>\r\n\"I need a shower. Then, we'll wash you up, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bianca disappeared into the bathroom, leaving you alone much like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, you heard the sound of water running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft to yourself, with not much else to do, you sank into thinking once again and, of course, your thoughts went to Bianca. She was so nice to you, though you figured that when she offered to help you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thought made your line of thinking go from Bianca to... yourself. As much as you appreciated the giantess, you couldn't simply forget that you were still very tiny and very fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began wondering if there was a way to restore your size. After that... you didn't know, but you'd cross that bridge when you came to it. For now, getting your original size back was what mattered, because without it you were vulnerable... well, not as long as you had your blonde guardian watching over you like a caring mother would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a comforting thought, but the fact you were tiny was real, and you had to find a solution for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps... Bianca could have known of a way to help you? You looked in direction of the bathroom, a low humming now mixed with the sound of water running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca did mention a certain 'professor', though you couldn't recall their name right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the blonde giantess was willing to bring you to them, then... it would be your salvation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to ask... whenever she came out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Bianca came out in her usual clothes, though missing her coat and hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn now, little cutie,\" she said, smiling cheerfully, grabbing a hold of you from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Bianca, can I ask a question?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you just did,\" she joked,<br>\r\n\"But, sure, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly looked down, before meeting her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering... do you happen to know of a way to help me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca lost her smile and stared at you, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked after a moment of hesitation, regaining her smile,<br>\r\n\"I am, am I not? I'm taking care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll never stop thanking you for it,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"But I'm talking about my stature. I was wondering if you could help me fix that. Y'know, get bigger again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Bianca's smile faded as she adopted a pondering expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an odd question,\" she commented, starting to rub her chin with the tip of her index finger,<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I could help you grow big again, at least not by myself. I do know a few people that probably could, though I'm not sure. Yours is a very complicated riddle, little cutie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, and so did Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered something for a while, staring at an imprecise point of the room as she tried to come up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she looked at you, her expression very serious in contrast to her usually cheerful self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what...\" she said,</span></div></div>",

You didn't know why, but for some reason you were starting to feel a little uncomfortable with the way she was looking at you as well as the way she was talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" you questioned, wondering where the conversation was going to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca bit her lower lip and looked elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what I mean is, your size, is it that bad?\" she asked, readjusting her glasses on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust where was this coming from? Of course this size was bad, you were completely helpless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What do you mean, Bianca?\" you asked. Perhaps you had misunderstood her, it was the most likely explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, still keeping her expression, Bianca repeated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your size, is it so bad? Do you really hate it?\" she asked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she playing psychologist with you? Of course you hated this size! Who in the world could ever like being so small?... Well, there probably were people who would enjoy this kind of situation but, sadly, you weren't among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Bianca? Of course I hate this size!\" you replied, perhaps a little too brusquely, but you couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca's expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable,\" she said calmly, slowly taking a seat on the bead beside you, causing the mattress to bounce under her weight,<br>\r\n\"But, have you even tried seeing the bright side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright side? Why, was there any aside from the fact that you weren't in a Pokemos's stomach right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Bianca read your mind, because she kept going,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm sure that size must be scary and all, but it's got to have some great perks as well!\" she spoke, suddenly cheering up, her face enlightening with that kind smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had conflicted feelings running through you, and the same question as before lingered: what did she want to achieve by telling you these things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Like?\" you asked, a bit unsure where this conversation was going, though you had a feeling and hoped it wasn't going to take such turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Bianca hesitated a moment and put on that cute expression she had when thinking. When she finally came up with something, she smiled,<br>\r\n\"How about this, food is giant and you can eat your fill without really eating at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were perplexed for the next couple moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why would I care about that?\" you pointed out,<br>\r\n\"Honestly, there's a great chance I could <i>become</i> food if I'm not careful enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you have me!\" the young giantess countered with a big smile,<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'd never let anyone eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into Bianca's green eyes, which carried a gentle sparkle in them, the same you've seen before: she wanted to protect you. This reminded of the kindness she had shown so far and made you calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you wanted to know just where was she headed with this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Bianca, I appreciate all you're doing for me,\" you repeated,<br>\r\n\"But please, tell me, what are you up to? Why are you asking me these questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you spoke those words, Bianca lost her smile and let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she began, looking elsewhere, the serious expression from before back on her face,<br>\r\n\"I don't know, even if I take you to Professor Juniper, if she's going to be able to grow you back to your original size. There's no telling that, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say, Bianca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is, maybe the best way to solve this problem... is not solve it at all.\" she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart froze up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, hold on,\" you interrupted, jumping up, alerted,<br>\r\n\"Bianca, just why are you telling me these things? I thought you wanted to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no, don't get me wrong, I do! But...\" again, Bianca hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou encouraged her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, the giantess met your gaze, picking you up from the bed to better look at you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, it's been so much time I had someone traveling with me that I forgot how good it felt,\" she explained, finally coming clean,<br>\r\n\"As I said, Cheren is a gym leader now, and Hilbert is gone. You... are the first real companion I have had in a long time, and I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You want me small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So that you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Yes...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Bianca...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole bed shook as the giantess suddenly got on her knees, hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, stay with me, at least for a while longer! You'll see I'm going to take ca-ahh!\" she screamed as she lost her balance and fell off of the bed and to the floor, impacting with quite the thud, leading you to wonder how she had survived up to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't important. Bianca was really asking you to choose to remain this size so she could carry you around as her 'traveling companion'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt conflicted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as the giantess could be, you didn't want to remain tiny for much longer... and yet, something about her, maybe the way she plead you or the cute way she did it, made you want to make her happy. After all, she had said it herself: there was no telling if you were going to regain your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Bianca got back up, you had an answer ready.</span></div></div>",

You recall walking in the forest, then there was this blinding light and you were knocked out... you grunt in pain as you take notice of an annoying headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left hand travels to your forehead, whole the other gently finds its way on the ground as you stand up. You glance around, and the first question that comes out of your mouth is:<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you are green things you don't recall ever seeing before. They almost look like blades of grass, but that's impossible. Blades of grass couldn't be so tall, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong smell pervades your nose. And your heart leaps in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the smell of <i>grass</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Wha...?\" you question as you peer upwards, your eyes meeting with the sight of something green... and totally gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood seems to freeze in your veins. That's a leaf! And it's  gigantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... this can't be possible... so there's only one alternative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE SHRUNK!\" you cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the emotion for your discover is cut short as the ground beneath you quakes lightly, a booming sound following what seemed an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany other quakes follow the first one, other booming sounds can be heard. You actually hear the noise getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser and closes, until a huge shadow eclipses your body more than the grass itself does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, discovering a giant girl standing there before you. She has honey colored hair, light blue eyes and a slim figure; she wears a black, sleeves shirt, red skirt with knee-length black socks with matching black shoes, a pink pokeball painted on each side of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up again, you notice the giantess wearing a pink fedora hat, and she's carrying a pink backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the sight of the giantess disappears, replaced by the black sole of her boot. You urgently notice that she's going to step on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp as you leap out of the way, the boot landing right where you were standing not three seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of you, the giantess keeps going, taking several other steps as she walks towards an unknown destination. You stand there for a few moments, watching her leave, silently thanking whatever higher that you aren't a red stain under her boot right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you suddenly think about something: this giantess could be the only one person walking through this woods aside from you. If you can get her attention... maybe she'll help you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily deciding that you've got no chance of catching her attention while she walks, you choose to follow her until she stops, when there's a higher chance to get noticed and, most importantly, a lower chance to get smashed by her foot without her even knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you gather all your energy and dash behind the giantess before she disappears into the forest. Wherever she's going, it's a mystery to you. But you find that you really don't care, as long as you manage to get her attention and, hopefully, her help with this new, dire situation of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the honey haired giantess for what seems an eternity. By the time she stops, the sun is close to setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the girl noticed.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... it's getting dark,\" you hear her say to herself. You listen as the words you hoped for come out of her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should set up camp.\" you mentally cheer as you notice the girl agreeing to herself, before taking off her bag, starting to dig into it, taking out the things needed for her to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner than you had anticipated, the girl had pitched a yellow tent, gathered wood and started a small fire as the sun completely disappears over the horizon, the sky getting dark as the red sphere takes its leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" the giantess giggles to no one in particular as she goes sitting down on a fallen log, closing her eyes to enjoy the warmth it carries. For a moment, you can't help admire her, the red shade of the fire giving her hair and face a fiery look. But you quickly shake your head, remembering your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your chance, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint towards the girl again, stopping by her black boots.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... excuse me?\" you shyly try, not quite sure of how to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the giantess doesn't hear you, and keeps her eyes closed as she relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... sorry?\" you try, a little louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the honey haired girl doesn't hear you. Even worse, she starts humming to herself, further covering the sound of your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you cry out as loud as you can. Your call goes unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and the several other ones that join it out of your mouth.<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" you exclaim, punching the black surface of her left boot out of frustration. Only to regret doing so the following instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, the girl stops humming and looks down at her feet. Feeling observed, you look back up, discovering the giantess staring down at you with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, none of you talks. But then, you break the silence:<br>\r\n\"Help!\" you yell, hoping to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obviously did, you judge as you watch her blue eyes widening, and her face shifting into a...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were absolutely massive, which was fitting for a giant girl you supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well,\" You heard Shauna coo above you, \"Seems like little boy can't take his eyes off my shoes. Are you excited or something?\" She taunts with a flirty smile on her face. You feel a rush of red come across your face, for some reason you couldn't deny her words. You were awestruck by her footwear. How is that something you previously dreaded would become something you admired by a single glance. With a sly smile on her face, Shauna places you gently on the ground in front of her. She watches you for a moment to see if you'd run. To her pleasure, you didn't make a move to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love these shoes you know...\" Shauna began as she began to take them off. \"They're so spacious, with room for all kind of tiny, little things inside them.\" Her foot now free, she wiggles her toes at you tauntingly. \"Like my dainty toes and my soft soles.\" She planted her foot in front of you and waved it at you. \"But sometimes they get lonely in there all by themselves. That's why they always make room for a guest!\" She punctuates her statement by grabbing you with her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash her toes hoist you high into the air and then plunge you deep into her shoes. You see the world outside rush past you as her foot drags you deeper into her shoes, you weren't sure if you ever wanted to come out. Eventually, her foot completed its journey to the bottom of her shoe, and mushed you into the its surface. To your surprise, the material of Shauna's shoe was surprisingly soft... and a bit damp from her sweat. She must be used to traveling a lot in these shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it seems like they found a new guest to play with. I'd be careful though, sometimes they're a bit... rough while trying to be hospitable. Maybe you should try giving them some kisses?

A small window with white curtains on the wall opposite the bed, two nightstands at the bed's sides and a coffee table in front of it. And, of course, there's the wooden door, which is currently locked, from which Shauna came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is rudely drawn by the giantess, who starts walking towards the bed. She nearly throws herself on it.<br>\r\n\"Much better!

It would have been cute, if it wasn't for the fact that she's not even asking you for an opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make your annoyance clear to the overexcited giantess, but she simply cuts you off by pressing a finger on your mouth.<br>\r\n\"Quiet, cutie. I need to think, about how the two of us can start our playtime~\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of unnerving silence pass as the brunette giantess ponders how to get started. Every once in awhile, she would think out loud, and you don't like her ideas too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA full five minutes had passed when the giantess removes the finger from your mouth and closes her hand in a fist as she exclaims:<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" she says...</span></div></div>",

Grabbing you by your sides and roughly lifting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat want to boast?\u201d She said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo its not because of that. Look believe it or not I'm not sleepy. I just don't want to be a part of this. But clearly Shauna wants me to\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thats obvious\u201d Serena said with a bit of anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but i think I've thought of a plan you can get her frisky.\u201d You say to her as she looked skeptical \u201cWhat you've got to do is __________\u201d</span></div></div>",

She then smiled as she said \u201cYes found it\u201d You watch as she brings out a small long piece of string. It didn't take a genius to figure out what she was planning. You turn and try to run away from her however she stopped you before you could gain any real distance. You feel her hand wrap around you as your then pulled to her foot. You hit it hard as she pins you to her foot with her finger,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna giggled above you feeling your small body on her foot. \u201cOhhh This is going to be so much fun\u201d She said above you \u201cJust hold still, I'm going to tie you there\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel her wrap the huge string on your back and pulling you even closer to her bad smelling foot. Once done she tied it to the front of her foot. Shauna leaned forward seeing you tied to her foot. She couldn't help but giggle, a sound which some may find cute but you find really annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel her move as she stands up. Getting up on one foot so your raised above the ground. However all you could see was her pale skin right on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I'm going to lower you gently. Yell if it starts hurting you\u201d The giant brunette said as her voice betrayed her words. She sounded a lot more excited then concerned. You feel her lower her foot slowly and slightly. Until you hit the ground. Your then hit with the added pressure of her foot. Her shifting weight on top of you as you have to struggle. She told you to scream if there was to much pressure, however your mouth was completly covered by her sole. So even if you try to get her to stop, you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna was amazed, she loved feeling her shrunken boyfriend under her foot, and she's loving that she hasn't been asked to stop. Either it doesn't hurt that much or her boyfriend enjoys this.

You wanted to shout up to her and say that her foot was putting an uncomfortable amount of pressure on you, but you couldn't. Every time you opened your mouth, you risked accepting some of the moist sweat that clung to her foot into your mouth. You were stuck without a means to communicate your suffering, although you weren't sure if your \"girlfriend\" would really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Shauna was besides herself in joy. \"I got a little cutie for a boyfriend and he doesn't even care about me walking all over him!\" She thought to herself gleefully. When she first set out on her journey she knew that she had wanted to make memories, but this was something she never expected to happen! Not only did she get a boyfriend, but she got one that no one else had ever had before. The knowledge that a little guy loved her enough to submit to her every whim made her giddy inside. That giddiness made her eager to have some fun at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she began to rub her sole back and forth on top of your body. \"Oh you're such a little cutie~\" She began as her sweat rubbed off onto your tiny body, \"A little bug so willing to submit to his girlfriend's feet and be absolutely dominated by them is so thoughtful! What's it like down there huh?\" She cooed slowly moving you towards her toes. \"It must be like a whole new world huh? My feet are suuuuper sore from all of my walking, not to mention sweaty.\" She giggled to herself, happy to be teasing her boyfriend a little bit. As long as he didn't protest she would be glad to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below you were mortified by what you were hearing. Now Shauna was really getting into this whole controlling girlfriend thing. Rolling her sole on top of you like you were some kind of cleaning mat. And you were certain that you were slowly getting dragged towards her toes. Whatever was happening was not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my little boy toy, I'm so glad I found you. I've been looking for a little playmate~\" She said as you felt yourself dragged further up her foot. \"And since you haven't protested I'm sure you've been searching for something like this too. Ha, I like that about you.\" She coos as you start seeing light poking from the gaps near her toes. You were just about at her toes now, but is she done teasing yet or still rearing to go?</span></div></div>",

She was waving her hand in the air in a friendly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her friend Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna remembered on the very last second to slide her hand into her pocket. To Serena, it looked like a casual gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, only Shauna could know the real purpose behind such action... her and you, who were suddenly plunged into a dark, tight space. Shauna's hand lingered inside the pocket, making the whole place even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shauna!\" the newcomer greeted her friend upon catching up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Serena~ long time no see~\" Shauna chimed, her empty hand sliding out of her pocket as she hugged her honey-haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena hugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the hadn't seen each other for quite a while now. Last time Shauna saw Serena was in Lumiose City, days, maybe even weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her pocket, you were suffering a tight hell of heat and darkness. You gulped, trying to use the least amount of oxygen to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you was a thin opening, not so much air could enter your entrapment. You feared that you were going to die asphyxiated if Shauna didn't let you out soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lungs burning for the desperate desire of air, you started squirming inside Shauna's pocket. But your new girlfriend didn't seem to be able to feel your squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe she wasn't paying attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you looked up at the opening of the pocket. If you only could crawl up to it, you'd have a chance to get out... Serena would see you, but was she any better than Shauna?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the two giantesses speaking outside this hell, she seemed to be nice... maybe, if you managed to explain the situation to her, she would be able to pull you out of this situation and offer her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you tried to make your way up to the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Shauna kept chatting merrily with Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she stopped in mid-sentence as she felt something moving inside her pocket... her new little boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned - what was he doing in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know, but she instinctively gazed down - she choked back a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny head was starting to emerge from the pocket of her shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shauna?\" Serena called, concerned about the sudden change of expression on her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh?\" Shauna asked, digging her left hand in her pocket again. She couldn't let Serena know about her tiny boyfriend, that'd be a bit weird to explain... especially because she didn't actually give the tiny human in her pocket a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... are you alright?\" Serena asked, concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna smiled.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes~\" she replied, feeling the tiny guy in her pocket struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena looked skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I-I just remembered that I have something to do later, that's all...\" she came up with a decent excuse, causing Serena to stare at her for a few more moments before nodding, the smile returning upon her visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna forced a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she only had to leave Serena. As much as she wanted to spend some time with the honey-haired girl, this wasn't the right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had someone more important to deal with right now...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps, you could still date her when you were a lot bigger than this, because you had to admit she was pretty cute; on the other side, if Shauna hung out with Serena, it would mean more time inside of her tight pocket for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was not like you had any say in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Shauna, after thinking for a bit, she offered a smile. An opportunity like this wouldn't come back for a long time since she and Serena traveled separately, while she could have all the fun she wanted with you later, since there was no way she was letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, count me in!\" she cheered, causing Serena to smile massively,<br>\r\n\"Great! I think we are near Anistar City, we can head there! I could really use a new pair of sunglasses...\" she said, taking off her sunglasses from the top of her pink hat to examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can get a treat too! Let's go!\" your captor chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. We gotta head...\" Serena paused to look around, before remembering which way their destination was,<br>\r\n\"... That way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna giggled and hurried behind her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she told herself, she did need to get to Pokemon Center. She would deal with you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were able to hear this too and became a bit worried. Judging from the way Shauna acted since she found you, you could easily tell that letting you go was not in the list of her wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you could come up with something to convince her... though you were sure she'd still want to keep you as her 'shrunken boyfriend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though there was barely enough air for you to breathe inside of her pocket, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no telling how your situation would evolve in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnistar City was renown to be pretty when the sun set because of its sundial, though it was still an interesting place to visit during daytime.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the two friends went to check out the local boutique, then decided to simply have a walk around the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna enjoyed herself as she and Serena casually talked, but the former's mind was still focused on her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly wondered how you were doing inside of her pocket, before deciding you were fine. She still could feel you moving in there, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, deciding that overthinking might appear suspicious to Serena, she decided to just let her mind off of you for a moment. She would check on you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, chatting about their past adventures, the two bought ice creams and went to sit on a bench in front of the sundial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Shauna sat down, the pressure inside of her pocket grew even more, putting you into an even tighter situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really beautiful, isn't it?\" the girl whose shorts you were hanging out in commented as stared at the pink crystal with the golden rings below shining under the warm sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It really is.\" Serena agreed, licking on her ice cream,<br>\r\n\"So, how's your journey going? Have you met any interesting pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh, I've met someone interesting alright.</i>' Shauna thought, smiling at her friend,<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. The other day I saw an Eevee, it was so cute! I mean, I do have a Sylveon, but I kind of miss when it was an Eevee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like an eternity since all that crazy adventure with Lysandre and the ultimate weapon, huh?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Can't believe it's only been a few months.\" Shauna replied, recalling how the ultimate weapon and the plans of the Team Flare boss were stopped just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile remembering such things, Shauna polished off her ice cream and stared at the cone somewhat nostalgically, before remembering that you were still in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hey Serena,\" she said, getting up, <br>\r\n\"Mind if I go to the Pokemon Center to heal my pokemon real quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but... don't you want me to come?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want you to see them right now,\" she said, getting up with her bag on her shoulders,<br>\r\n\"They're in a pretty rough shape after my last battle. Don't worry, I'll be quick.\" she reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena smiled in response while her friend turned to head to the Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having left her pokemon to the nurse, Shauna went to sit down and, making sure no one was paying her attention, she slid a hand in her pocket to retrieve you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" she said, smiling, as she pulled you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" you said, feeling like half of your body had fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry. I wish we could spend some time together, but I can't right now...\" the giantess apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important.\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"I need your help, I can't be this size!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna adopted a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'aww, but you're so adorable like that!\" she cooed,<br>\r\n\"My own cute little boyfriend! Who wouldn't want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't talk, I gotta head back to Serena.\" she said, giggling,<br>\r\n\"See you later~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, giving you a quick peck, silencing your protest, Shauna lowered you back to her shorts' pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wai-\" you couldn't finish as dark and tight your world became once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you safely tucked away, Shauna got up and went to get her pokemon back, before heading out and back to Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like hours faded away in your tight prison; you couldn't move at all and could barely breath. Even worse, you weren't able to reason with Shauna, meaning that, for the time being, you were stuck with being her tiny boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, your entrapment finally loosened and two fingers came in to pick you out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed in fresh air as you noted that...</span></div></div>",

You had tried to get through this girl already and it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed determined to keep you as her boyfriend and wasn't willing to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, she was with someone, no? Maybe, if you could get the attention of her friend, she might be willing to help!... Too bad she wasn't there, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you all there?\" the giantess wondered, poking you with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Shauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you with someone?\" you asked back,<br>\r\n\"A girl... Serena, I think you called her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. She's left to take care of something, should come back soon. Me and her still have a lot of catching up to do,\" she said, before her smile grew wider,<br>\r\n\"But so do we, little boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that, she brought you closer to her face and puckered her lips, giving you a soft, quick peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt rather nice, but despite that, you tried to fight back her lips. A pointless effort, since you were endlessly too small and her lips were endlessly too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the only thing you could do was flail against the smooth pair until Shauna finally felt you squirming and pulled back with a wet smack of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot you a concerned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked,<br>\r\n\"Why are you moving around so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped your face, which was left damp because of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shauna,\" you said, feeling like you could talk now that you grabbed her attention,<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be your boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess adopted a surprised expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" she mouthed, her look becoming one of sadness that nearly broke your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe you had to rephrase that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I didn't mean that, sorry,\" you said, causing her expression to cheer up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! You like me!\" she exclaimed triumphantly while holding you to her cheek, beginning to rub you against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Lo-Look,\" you stuttered, blushing,<br>\r\n\"You're going too far! You practically just met me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Met' didn't seem like the right word though, 'kidnapped' was more fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem! It's gonna be great!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Shauna!\" you protested,<br>\r\n\"I need your help growing big again! Don't you see, I can't be your boyfriend like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Shauna dropped her cheerful expression and looked at you with a more serious one as she pulled you away from her cheek and held you in both her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"Just what is wrong with being my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm small!\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"Look at me, I-I... I need to get back to my size! What am I supposed to do, like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, there's me,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"You can stay with me, no? I can take good care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do need my size!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Shauna gave a cute giggle and  waved an arm forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that size makes you really cute!\" she countered, causing you to blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciated the compliment, but she didn't get your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look-\" you began, but were interrupted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look,\" she said, wearing a smile,<br>\r\n\"You don't need your size to be my boyfriend. You should really see the bright side of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any?\" you sourly asked, curious to see what she was going to pull out to convince you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be my boyfriend,\" she repeated, continuing before you could protest,<br>\r\n\"And in exchange I'll take care of, protect and feed you! Plus...\" she trailed off, leaning in closer to place another kiss on your small body, this time in an even slower fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was savoring this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you didn't fight back. You had a moment to think, even if it was a pretty awkward one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauna did raise some good points: you needed protection and everything else she mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... she was admittedly cute. If this situation was normal, you'd be the one asking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, there was almost nothing normal in this, except the very fact she wanted a boyfriend. For the rest, you were a shrunken person and she a towering giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Shauna pulled back and began panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've enjoyed this one.\" she giggled, winking at you,<br>\r\n\"Didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I...\" you paused, reluctant to admit that you were so deep in your own world that you didn't feel the kiss at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Shauna mistook your embarrassment for shyness, which she found adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I can tell you did,\" she said, gaining a bit of a blush too,<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say now? Are you on on board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she almost had you... and, truth be told, that was true: her logic was valid, her kiss nice and her offer definitely not the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all you knew, she could have wanted you as a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a hard choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour previous life over... whatever this was?</span></div></div>",

You remember leaving your house to go to the local Pokemon center to check up on a friend's Pokemon while they were out of town before getting jumped by some random Team Skull grunt. You managed to get away and the grunt gave chase, you ran into some forest and turned your head to see a bright flash of light envelop both you and the grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you look around you only to see that everything has become MASSIVE to you, your own footprints were the size of a car! You start to turn towards to where the grunt was before said grunt plows into you, knocking you flat on your ass. The grunt grabs you by your shirt and shoves you the ground. \"I dunno what kinda trick you're trying to pull, but it ain't gonna work punk!\" The grunt then raises his fist above you, ready to give you an old fashion beatdown before two enormous barefeet land on either side of the two of you, startling the grunt so badly he fell off of you. Looking up at the person the feet belong to, you could see that it was a teenage girl, judging by the mounds on her chest. You could also see this girls whitish-blonde hair, which dangled down from her face while she was looking down at you with her large, piercing golden eyes. Those eyes.... they felt like they were burning a hole right through your very soul, it was almost like if you kept looking into them you'd get lost in them and never find a way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over you saw the grunt trying to stumble away before the girls foot moved insanely fast and stepped on his lower body, pinning him to the ground and causing him to scream in pain. You started backing up before her hand swooped down and grabbed you. You were brought in front of those terrible eyes, that piercing stare was thousands of times worse when they were so close. \"Just.... who are you?\" The strange girl said, the terrifying glow from her eyes fading away, making it easier to look into them. \"You look like a person, but you're too small.\" She said, poking you in the stomach. The grunt was crying in pain under her foot. You saw her eyes dart from you to the grunt as she shifted her weight to put more pressure on him, Your stomach churned at the sickening *pop* the grunts body made as the girl put all of her weight on the foot on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shifted her gaze back onto you. \"My name's Luna, by the way.\" You were to scared to say anything, this girl just killed someone and went right back to talking as if nothing had happened! You started looking around, hoping that there was some miraculous way off her hand, but no such luck. Seeing you panic, Luna attempts to comfort you.by petting your head with her finger. \"There there little guy, I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Luna said with a caring look in her eyes. You were still trying to struggle out of her grip, which was starting to annoy her. \"Hey, stop that.\" She said in a firm voice. You still kept trying to get out. Again, she told you to stop. You didn't stop. \"CUT THAT SHIT OUT!!\" She yelled, fed up with your constant movement. You finally stopped, not wanting to piss her off further. She composed herself and looked down at you, her annoyance still visible on her face. \"Honestly! If I wanted to hurt you I would've just crushed you like that worthless Team Skull jerk!\" She said, indicating towards the red stain on her foot. You look up at her, trying to figure out just what was going on behind those golden eyes. Then...</span></div></div>",

I didn't realize this was possible. How did you get so small?\" She asked as she did her best to keep her hand steady. You explain to her that you're not entirely sure what happened. About the bright light and waking up hours later. Lillie seemed very curious about the whole thing. \"A bright light... maybe it was a Pokemon. Can't think of many other things that could fit the bill. Oh forgive me, I never introduced myself. My name's Lillie. What's yours?\" You gave her your name causing her to smile suddenly. \"That's a cute name.\" She noticed you blushing a little at her comment and smiled once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anyway, you're free to stay with me for the night at least. Maybe we can figure out what to do in the morning.\" You simply nodded in response as she set you on her lap and rested by the fire.

It is twice, almost thrice your height.<br>\r\n\"Get to work slave.\" Lillie commands again, blushing and giggling at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk near Lillie's bare foot. You expected it to smell not exactly good... but boy were you wrong. Her foot smells like blueberries. You inhale deeply, the scent pleasing your nose. Evidently, Lillie often takes good care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an impatient 'ahem' from your goddess, you start rubbing the foot slowly, almost immediately getting a stifled laugh from her. You assume she's simply ticklish and you resume your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, little slave.\" Lillie says with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Now for the other.\" she places her other foot in front of you. Knowing what to do, you start rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie is in heaven right now. Her new little friend is doing such a good job in pleasing her, she's really enjoying this one game. Even though it is the first time she gets to 'command' a tiny 'servant', she's quickly getting more and more at ease with it. A small moan escapes her lips. Blushing, she covers her mouth and looks over the little guy. Luckily, he doesn't seem to have heard anything. Sighing, Lillie relaxes back, hoping to not get carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pass as you keep rubbing, before Lillie scoops you up and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n\"Good job little guy. That was wonderful!\" she beams. You smile as she speaks up again.<br>\r\n\"Now, I was wondering, maybe you...</span></div></div>",

To make sure you don't get in any trouble, am I right?\" Lillie asks.<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking, since I need a bath as well... Why don't we share one?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face gets completely red.<br>\r\n\"You want me to what?!\".<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's for your own good, trust me.\" Lillie says, turning off the water.<br>\r\n\"But... I...\".<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get undressed, no peeking.\" Lillie giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes instantly shut close. You patiently wait for Lillie to undress.<br>\r\n\"You can look now.\" she says. You open your eyes. Lillie is already in the tub, the water doing a great job in covering her body but her head and hair.<br>\r\n\"Come on little guy, your turn, undress.\" Lillie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing even more, you start removing your clothes. You notice Lillie closing her eyes as you remove your boxers.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Lillie, a little help here...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde haired giantess extends a arm to grab  you from the sink. You are then moved into the tub. You expect Lillie to drop you in the water, but she doesn't. Instead, she dunks your whole body and grabs a soap bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie starts rubbing your body against the bar, creating a bunch of bubbles in the tub. After rubbing your body for a while, she takes you out of the water, letting you breath.<br>\r\n\"There! Don't you feel better?\" she asks giggling.<br>\r\nYou spit some water out.<br>\r\n\"Except for the fact I was about to drown... yes. I feel much better now. Thank you.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie smiles and moves you closer, pulling you in a hug. She presses you into her chest, you can feel the warmth of both the water and her skin. Plus, you can heat her heartbeat from here.<br>\r\n\"Isn't this nice little one?\" Lillie asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much.\" you close your eyes to enjoy the moment. The warm water, the soft skin and the soothing heartbeat, you almost feel like going to sleep right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good, relaxing while, Lillie takes you out of the water and moves you on the sink once again.<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes little one.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as commanded as Lillie stands up. She grabs a large towel and wraps it around her body. She then uses another one to dry hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes are still closed, but you suddenly feel something soft wrapping around your own body. <br>\r\n\"Lillie?!\".<br>\r\n\"Relax little one, I'm just covering you.\" she says, calming you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping you in the towel, Lillie picks you and walks out of the bathroom. You hear a door opening. Lillie must be searching for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little guy, try these on, they should fit you.\" you hear her say after a bit. Crawling out of the towel, you notice Lillie in her usual outfit. She's looking elsewhere, trying to avoid seeing you naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you notice she got you some doll clothes. A white shirt and white pants, along with matching shoes, socks and boxers.<br>\r\n'Wow, she must really like white.' you think, trying the clothes on. And, true to her word, they fit you.<br>\r\n\"You can look now Lillie.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde haired girl turns around.<br>\r\n\"Aw, you look so cute with that outfit.\" she giggles, picking you.<br>\r\n\"And now we're all nice and clean, I think we can...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You remained asleep through all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to sleep undisturbed for a couple of hours before waking up. Yawning, your hands find their way to your eyes and you start rubbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening your eyes, the first thing you notice is you that Lillie is missing; you were - at least until now - laying on her soft, massive bed, the sheets pulled up to your neck and your head gently placed on the huge landscape of the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of an effort, you manage to remove the sheets from your body and get up. You walk over the edge of the bed and you carefully start climbing down, using the blankets as a support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you manage to get on the floor and head to the door; you easily manage to slide under it and look around; you're currently standing in a massive hallway. There are many doors, so Lillie could actually be everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a strong, sweet smell hits your nose. You sniff deeply, and the smell makes your mouth to water.

She sets it on a near table before heading your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't seem to have noticed you though. She must be going to 'wake you up'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the young titaness' shoe lands mere inches from you and you let out a startled screech, she looks down and spots you. A cheerful smile lots her face.<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" she says, bending to scoop you up.<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead. I was just about to come.and wake you up. Guess you beat me.\" she giggles, making you smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growls again. <br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry? I got something special for you little one.\" the green eyed girl says, bringing you over the table. She sets you next to the package. The smell is incredibly strong here, whatever it is, it's within this box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at your impatient behavior, Lillie unwraps the package, revealing two weird looking things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're malasadas.\" Lillie explains upon seeing the curious look on your face.<br>\r\n\"And they're delicious. I got them from a store nearby, they make wonderful ones. Dig in!\" she exclaims happily, eating her own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, you bite into the treat. Lillie is right: it tastes like nothing you've ever tasted before it's delicious. So you dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're going to throw up. Sure, the malasada was delicious, but it was enough to threaten to make your belly to blow up. Lillie gently pats your belly with a finger.<br>\r\n\"I think someone is full.\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n\"And now you're filled up, what about doing something together?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I could show you the rest of my house.

In the end, she wears a Z-Ring around her right wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lillie!\" the girl exclaims cheerfully. Lillie takes a step back, before a smile spreads wide on her face.

Do you need any help?\" she asks back. Lillie smiles, but shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. It'll be brief.\" she says, starting to casually walk upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at you, you're starting to feel dazed from the lack of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the experience is short lived as the giant hat is removed from upon you, letting you breath again.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure of what you got,\" Lillie's voice booms from beneath you as she offers you her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb on it as she lowers it back to her face.<br>\r\n\"But my friend Moon is here, and she'll be staying for a while...\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"I got that,\" you reply as you glance around to take a good look at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big, white bed suggests that you're in a bedroom. The room is quite large, well furnished with a large bookshelf full of books, a coffee table, a desk and an armchair. A small breeze blows inside from a window with white curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie casually sits on the bed, gently placing you on her lap while throwing her hat on the armchair.<br>\r\n\"Now, I really need you to stay here for a bit while I'm with Moon,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally huff. Alone and shrunken in a room. Being shrunken means that you can do pretty much nothing. This is going to be boring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Lillie gently stroking your head with a finger.<br>\r\n\"It won't be so bad. I'll check on you whenever I can, promise.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to sound ungrateful for all the help she's given you so far, you smile up at her.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I'll be fine in here!\" you cheerfully say, hiding your annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess smiles.<br>\r\n\"If that's so,\" she says, gently removing you from her lap, placing you down on the bed.<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon.\" she says, flashing you with a warm, grateful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the giantess takes her leave, closing the door behind her. Only then you dare to huff, laying down on your back, arms and legs spread wide on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith absolutely nothing to do in such shrunken state, you close your eyes, deciding to catch a quick nap. At least, until Lillie is back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up at the sound of a door opening. Remembering what happened before you got asleep, you glance at said door, discovering Lillie standing there, a smile painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you says, before yawning.<br>\r\n\"Hi Lillie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything fine?\" she asks as she walks closer to the bed you're laying on.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Just took a nap...\" you drowsily reply.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"But, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie giggles.<br>\r\n\"Checking on you. I did promise, no?\" she says. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I really shouldn't keep Moon waiting, so...</span></div></div>",

You were a guest, after all, and this wasn't how guests were treated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the fact she was biting her lip while staring at you with a hesitant stare made you understand that she was waiting for you to say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's alright. Just go to Moon, I'll wait for you here. I'm not going anywhere, see?\" you reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back.\" she promised, lowering herself to the bed and moving a finger to you, who fought back the urge to cower and let her gently rub your head with her index finger before she stood back up and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled right back and watched as she turned around and walked to the door, giving you one last glance before ultimately walking out, leaving you to yourself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed, you let out a low sigh, once more alone and bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejectedly, you sat on Lillie's bed with your hands on your cheeks, patiently waiting for her to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" Moon asked once she saw her friend walking back from her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie blushed vaguely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, nothing. I was just checking that... thing I told you about earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon adopted an amused expression, now curious to know what her friend had gone to check twice already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, before gaining a smile, <br>\r\n\"Are you housing a pokemon? What is it, a Clefairy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie's cheeks flared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be housing a Clefairy!? You know I only had Nebby...\" she justified,<br>\r\n\"And... it's nothing to worry about. Don't think about it too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you reeeeally sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon giggled and gave a shrug, loving her friend's reaction. Lillie bit her lip; a part of her wished to tell the other girl about her tiny catch, but it would be awfully hard to explain. Plus... she really had no idea how Moon would react. What if she became overexcited about her guest and refused to leave him alone afterwards? Lillie couldn't have that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Moon, she smirked, now sure Lillie was hiding something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was definitely curious enough to want to find out what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you passed your hours in a sad, silent solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat on Lillie's bed without saying a word and with your legs that were beginning to fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, you got up and started walking up and down on the bed, expecting the door to open soon and Lillie to enter from it to check on, giving you a minute-short break from this silence before returning to Moon, with whom she was surely having lots of interesting talking that you were however missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like a kid grounded by their parents and confined to their room, with the difference that everything looked gigantic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes in isolation passed and eventually became hours, but Lillie didn't come back. <br>\r\nAnd, at some point, you began feeling sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having been wandering in the woods all day, after a warm bath and after having consumed your energies just walking back and forth on a bed, you were ready to hit the hay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the moment you laid down, the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing it opening, you shot it a glance and sat back up: Lillie entered, yawned and shut the door again before shooting you a drowsy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Moon.\" Lillie said to her friend once both agreed to go to sleep, Lillie wanting to check on you and Moon having admitted she was beat after the trip to the former's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when her friend turned around, Lillie failed to notice the grin she was carrying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the house just opened her door and retreated inside, yawning, before closing the door and giving the bed a drowsy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she was expecting, she saw you still sitting on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" she said cheerfully, clearly happy from her talk with Moon and even happier she could finally spend some time with her little new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you addressed her right back, before sighing, <br>\r\n\"Are you going to leave again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie closed her eyes and smiled in an awfully cute way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" she said, before walking over the bed you were on, bending until her giant green eyes were right in front of you. It pained her knees a bit to stand in this position, but she didn't mind, <br>\r\n\"I'm staying now. Moon's gone off to sleep... and so will we, if you don't mind. I'm a bit sleepy myself. If you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great. I'm really tired too.\" you mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie too regained her smile and stood back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" she said, before getting back up and walking over to a closet, opening it and digging herself inside for a moment, retrieving a white nightshirt with pale blue laces at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde giantess turned her head to you to give a a flustered expression with a blush adorning her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... could you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own cheeks flared up as you have a hasty nod and turned around. From behind you, the sounds Lillie made while undressing made you tempted to take a peek, but you decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was very cute, despite how gigantic and frightening she was to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought the urge and tried to control yourself. This girl was taking care of you, peeking at her wasn't the way to repay her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" her voice came, interrupting your thoughts. You didn't move, but there was no need to: Lillie moved to the bed herself and entered your eyesight, now wearing her nightshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing an indecipherable expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to apologize to you.\" she said while gently grabbing you in her hand. Her statement perked your interest,<br>\r\n\"For what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have liked to spend some more time with you, get to know you better. I mean, with you living in my house and all, at least for the time being...\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" you replied, admiring the giantess' kindness. There were very few people like here, you mused, willing to help out anyone, even shrunken lost people like yourself, <br>\r\n\"We can do that tomorrow. I'm not mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, a smile appeared on Lillie's pale visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she said, before yawning,<br>\r\n\"Now, how about we go to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, the giantess laid down and slid under the blanket, still holding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured she would place you on her pillow or something, so it was quite a surprise when she pushed you to her chest instead and enclosed you in a full embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lillie!\" you exclaimed while she giggled, though blushing. One thing was sleeping next to her in a sleeping bag, but this was excessive! You met her just yesterday! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she quickly apologized,<br>\r\n\"But it's for your own sake. If I roll around in my sleep, I'd crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom red, your face became milky white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind sleeping like this?\" Lillie asked, flustered - this was the first time she slept in bed with a boy. Shrunken or not, you were still a person, she mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" you admitted, not lying. Her body shared heat with yours and both her skin and her nightwear felt really smooth, making a comfy bed for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice. Good night then, I'll see you in the morning.\" she said, before laying her head on her pillow with a satisfied smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacked into an embarrassed state, you hastily laid against her chest and closed your eyes, praying for sleep to take you away from this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wish was granted minutes ago: you fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

But before you get hugged, Lillie sees Moon hug you close. Right next to her cheek. Smiling to herself as you look away, an awkward smile on your face. That sight made Lillie feel slightly jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour playing, thats great!\u201d Moon said as she put you in front of her face \u201cOkay so i was thinking the first game we should play and hear me out on this... Climbing Mount Moon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the place in Kanto.

Placing you down onto the ground and standing to her full height. It happened so fast, you almost needed to compose yourself to understand what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna be so great!. Ok time starts right now! Go go go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, your really excited for this, aren't you\u201d You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo talk, only climb!\u201d She cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah\u201d Your reply as you got to work, walking up to her bare feet, you look up at her long legs. You don't even know how your gonna climb them, they looked so smooth and so.... unclimbable. Regardless that didn't stop you as you jumped onto her feet, moving across her giant foot as you arrive at the pillar which was her leg. Moon could feel you and had to hold in her giggles, in an attempt to not throw you off. Looking up you try to figure out how to do it.<br>\r\n\u2028Just trying it you try to ascend her leg, trying to get your best grip and rock climbing all the way up. You think your a pretty good climber but this was borderline impossible. Moon saw this too and decided to help you out.<br>\r\n\u2028You feel the ground shake as you panic, grabbing her foot and trying not to fall off. She raises her foot and stands on one leg, until her foot was right next to the bottom of her shorts. \u201cHere, a little helping hand to help you get started\u201d Moon said as you took it, jumping off her foot and grabbing onto the shorts. Moon put her foot back on the ground as you hug it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is easier. Thanks Moon\u201d You say to her as she smiles, something that made Lillie slightly sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since there was no way for you to climb my leg and since i didn't want you to be stuck down there the whole. It only made sense.\u201d Moon admitted \u201cStill, I'm kind of sad. I wanted to see that part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you just sit down, that way he can easily climb your leg since it won't be straight up\u201d Lillie added as Moon lighted up. As soon as you reach the top of her shorts you feel Moon\u2019s hand grab you, bringing you down to the ground once again. Moon sat down next to Lillie as she stuck her foot right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats a great idea! Thanks Lillie\u201d Moon said to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....

Gladion doesn't seem to notice anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants eat silently, Lillie occasionally passing you pancake pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gulping down the whole plate of pancakes, Gladion looks away.<br>\r\n\"So, Gladion...\" Lillie tries to make conversation while finishing up her own breakfast. Her brother looks at her.<br>\r\n\"When are you leaving?\".<br>\r\n\"I think I'll leave tonight or tomorrow in the morning. Why?\" he asks back.<br>\r\n\"Um, nothing.\" Lillie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...\" the blonde haired girl talks again.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't we something together?\" Lillie asks.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie stops to think. She perfectly knows that she'll have to hide you again if she spends time with her brother, but she really wants to enjoy his staying.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could hang out?\".<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Gladion replies.<br>\r\n\"Good. Just let me get ready and we can go.\" Lillie says, before closing you in two hands, getting up and walking towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she entered the room, she closes the door and gently puts you on her bed.<br>\r\n\"You heard that, right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're going to hang out, right?\" Lillie nods as she picks her dress.<br>\r\n\"No peeking.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around in understanding as she gets changed.<br>\r\n\"You can look.\" she says after five minutes.<br>\r\n\"So, how about me? Am I going to spend the day inside your hat again? Not that I'm complaining, but...\".<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy, I understand. Now, I'll give you a choice. You can come with me, in my hat.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Or?\".<br>\r\n\"Or you can stay here, alone.\" she finishes.<br>\r\n\"Alone? Is it safe for me to stay alone in this huge house?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you'd be perfectly safe. And I'd leave you with something to do... though I'd prefer if you stick with me. So? What are you going to do little one?\".</span></div></div>",

You start stomping on the blonde surface beneath you, trying to call out for Lillie. But she doesn't seem to be feeling none of your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, desperately, you kneel down and start pulling her hair, trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n\"Lillie... can't... breath...\" you whisper, struggling to not fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Lillie seems to feel you pulling her hair and quickly realizes: you are about to suffocate. She quickly ponders what to do; she doesn't have time to go into another room, and she doesn't have any excuse to get away from Gladion anyway. <br>\r\n\"Something's wrong, Lillie?\" her brother asks, noticing her uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie catches this opportunity to come up with an excuse to distract him.<br>\r\n\"Uhm...

Sending you flying down on the couch the two young giants are sitting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf unconscious, you don't even scream as you fall on the leathery surface. Luckily, Gladion didn't seem to notice the little body falling from Lillie's head, but neither she did.<br>\r\n\"I didn't see anything.\" Gladion says, while Lillie hastily puts her hat back on.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a pokemon...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two start talking again. You stay perfectly still, not making any noise. You aren't sure of how Gladion would react after seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants keep talking for a while, until Lillie looks at a clock.<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" she says, taking notice that it's midnight.<br>\r\n\"Time flies when you're having fun. Oh well, I think I'm going to sleep, Gladion.\" she says, putting a hand over her mouth as she yawns.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going as well.\" the teen replies, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers walk away simultaneously and, soon enough, you hear two doors closing. Now, you thought Lillie would notice you are missing, and that she would return to pick you. But you didn't know how tired she was. So tired that, as soon she entered her room, she absentmindedly threw her hat on a chair and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider to get down and reach Lillie, but you quickly shake off the idea. Jumping down is out of question, and you can't possibly climb down, lacking a good surface to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you decide to just sleep on the couch, waiting for someone to find you... Hopefully, not Gladion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, you hoped to sleep. But this couch isn't anything near to a bed, making it hard for you to drift off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend hours trying to get in a comfortable position to sleep, but you don't even manage to get five minutes of shut eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the night passes, replaced by the day. Dawn slowly enlightens the sky. A few more hours pass. And, just when you were about to get some well-desired sleep, you notice a huge shadow looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, your gaze slowly shifts upwards as you notice who that shadow belongs to...</span></div></div>",

She brought you to her lips and gave you a big kiss before setting you down on the ground while she gathered up her things and put it all in her bag. \"Well I think it's time for us to head home.\" She said while reaching for you. \"Wait, you mean you're taking me with you?\" She seemed shocked by your question. \"Of course I'm taking you with me! What, did you think I was just going to leave you in the wild?!\" you felt dumb for asking a question with such an obvious answer. \"Oh... right, well thanks for taking care of me Lillie.\" you said, happy that you found someone to watch over you. \"Now I would ask you where you wanted to ride.... but I think we both know where that is.*<i>wink</i>* \" She moved you back in front of her butt and fit you snugly in between her cheeks. She then grabbed a pair of somewhat tight shorts and put them on so that she didn't have to worry about you falling off while she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's head home!\" Lillie started her walk back to Iki town, since she was close friends with the current champion of Alola they had bought her a house not to far from theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie's butt was so soft and warm, you felt like you between two soft blankets that had just gotten out of the dryer. It didn't smell bad either, she clearly washed it thoroughly every night, it smelled like an exotic flower that had just bloomed. Of course there was still a hint of musk in there but in made sense considering where you were. Every now and then, when she felt like you weren't wiggling enough for her she would clench her cheeks together and start smothering you with them, you didn't mind though, the feeling of her cheeks pressing down on you was amazing. Eventually, you started to get sleepy... her warm and soft cheeks were the perfect bed for you. Feeling your movements slow down, Lillie realized you had gotten sleepy so she started swaying her hips slightly, rocking you to sleep. <br>\r\n<i>\"Goodnight my little butt boy.\"</i> She said in a singsong voice as you fell asleep to the sound of Lillie humming to herself.......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The clinking of dishes, the sound of a broom sweeping across the floor, Lillie was very adamant about keeping her place tidy. Doing this work in the Alolan heat was making her sweat, which, of course, soaked you to the bone. Trying to get Lillie's attention, you start wiggling as much as possible, which caused you to sink further into her crack. Lillie felt your struggles and realized that you had woken up.... but hadn't realized that you wanted out of her sweaty butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Does my little butt boy want to have some fun?\" Lillie said playfully, \"Well then, I think that I want to have some fun to\" Lillie said with a wink, despite the fact that  you couldn't see her face. She grabbed each cheek rather hard and started kneading them around you, smothering your small form with her butt and making you sink even further down her crevice, the smell of musk got stronger the further you sank, and the sweat wasn't helping either since it seemed to \"activate\" the stench of Lillie's butt that wasn't there when you first entered. You couldn't understand why Lillie, the quiet and timid girl you met the day before, was acting so weird. \"<i>Did something happen while I was asleep?</i>\" you thought to yourself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, something DID happen on the way back. Lillie had run into someone that was VERY important to her, someone that had helped out of a difficult time in her life and the person that she has never been able to convey her true feelings towards, which frustrated her to no end. So she was flustered by that meeting and was distracting herself by \"playing\" with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie lied down on her couch and parted her cheeks, making you fall right down to the bottom of her.. well, bottom. You land right on her hole. The impact of your fall caused Lillie gasp out and instinctively clench her cheeks together, forcing your face into her hole, fortunately her panties stopped you from getting suck in, \"Ohhh.... you want in huh?\" Lillie said, blushing heavily. \"Well I think you'll fi--\" Lillie was interrupted by a knock at her door. Sighing in frustration, Lillie clenched her butt to keep you in place as she walked towards her door to open it... only to find the very person that had made her so flustered. \"Oh! H-hello there __!\"</span></div></div>",

She grinded her hips side to side, rubbing her bum into you as much as she possibly could.

You could hear the light haired girl laughing and giggling to herself, clearly having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, this was borderline torture to you. The immense weight smashing around on top of you was unbearable, but that was almost as bad as the fact that you were having your ass handed to you by some girl\u2019s ass.

At writing Scottish so please give me some leeway)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the giant clearing of the forest that you find yourself in, you look up ahead and see a giant campsite. It was massive, and this was the salvation that you spent so long to look for. You were walking all through the night, dodging Pokemon left and right. Not wanting to be eaten and taken, you were careful. No doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich makes you so happy to find this circular tent, a couple hours after the sun rose. Your gonna get the attention of whoever is camping and hopefully, relax for the rest of the day. Your small body is just so tired at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran over and went straight for the tent door. Arriving under the giant door as you look up. There was no way you were gonna be able to zip this up. You could not even reach it, let alone move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not seem to be a problem though, as you can see above you the zipper start moving. This is a sign that someone is coming out. You take a couple of steps back, ready to give room to whoever was coming out. At your size there is a big chance they won\u2019t even see you and you will get stepped on. So best to avoid that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you see it open, the first gain trainer you see comes out. Taking a massive step out, it was a young girl. Got to be in her teens somewhere. She had medium length brown hair all around her head, a green and white cap on. She wore a red dress on and over that a grey sweater. She had boots made for trailing and no doubt a beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your time and just stared at her. She was beautiful, almost like an angel really. She looked elegant, and down to earth a bit. The type of girl you can\u2019t imagine a single bad word coming out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she opened her mouth and proved you wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh! My head\u2019s minced!\u201d She said, letting you note her very strong accent. You think it\u2019s from down region Galor. \u201cLast time i\u2019m flipping with a piking Bewear\u201d She said \u201cEhh, get over it. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said to herself as she turned around, letting you see right under her skirt. More specifically what was under there. Her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were above you though, and this was a sight you were not sure you should be seeing. \u2028\u2028But you were seeing it, no doubt about that. She moved around and pressed a button on her tent. Almost like a wild contraption, it folded in on itself. To the point where it was more like a blanket rather then a tent. Although you could note a pillow and blanket in there. She put it all in there as she got up and put in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed something out though, dropping her bag onto the ground and almost squishing you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where the bleeding hell am i?\u201d She said looking over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl looked like a beauty, but she had a bit of a potty mouth. And for some reason you were liking that more about her. You just stared at the girl, not noticing the bag until it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did and you jumped, seeing your one chance to be in a safe spot. In there you can rest and you will be moving with the girl. You start to run over to the bag, planning on moving and jumping up into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ruined it cause you moved too late though, as the bag lifted up and she put it back on. You fell onto the ground seeing it raise back up. Now with a new plan, you realise you have to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, there\u2019s a Xatu up a head. Oh you can bet i\u2019m gonna net that!\u201d She said ready to start moving. While you were ready to move as well. Move right to her boot. You waste no time running right up, running right up and arriving just under her. You leap onto her boot before she lifts it up. Getting to the edge. You hug on for dear life, not wanting to fall off as she raises her foot. She raised it right up, taking a step as it feels like a natural disaster to you. This tells you instantly that you need to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she keeps walking more and more, you climb fully onto her boot. Shifting around and climbing the neck of it. You grab the long socks she had and made sure not to let go. Not to let go at all, as you grip as she walks you can see that she was walking with purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour starting to get tired, but what are you gonna do to get her attention. Not like you can climb her legs, speaking of how smooth they were. You do look up though, seeing her panties as you blush. Maybe you should just stay on her boot. It\u2019s no doubt the least safe spot you can be, but your not really looking for safe right now. Your looking for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea, and this is one your not really keen on but might prove the most beneficial in getting her attention, is to climb into her boot or sock. if you make your way in there, you can jam yourself in like a pebble. So if you do that you should be able to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again it would also probably irritate her, and she seems like not the girl who you really want to irritate. She seems... well she seems like she has a bit of a hair trigger. Still you were gonna have to pick one of those three options.<br>\r\n\u2028And hopefully before she gets to that Xatu that she is going to. Cause that could no doubt be super dangerous to you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're a team yell grunt, a member of what is basically a fan club. All of you admire one person, a beautiful punk goddess with a pure heart. Most members are satisfied simply watching her battle and stopping other trainers from beating her, but not you. With the help of a Clefairy you had found in the Wild Area combined with constant use of Minimize and Growth from another pokemon used on you, you had gained the ability to use those moves yourself, not unlike trainers who train with Psychic types to unlock psychic powers. Another thing you had learned about gaining these abilities is that while shrunk you became near-superhuman, invincible to nearly everything. You had learned this the hard way when a wild Pikachu gobbled you up and you went out his digestion track the natural way but not getting dissolved by the stomach liquids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reasoning for going through this kind of training was that despite how fervent team Yell was, they could never actually see Marnie in her most vulnerable, alone in her room. You, on the other hand, could easily sneak inside her room and watch her. Some might say this was a scumbag idea, but you didn't care. All that mattered is that you would be able to see your goddess up close and personal. This wasn't solely admiration though, as you were a healthy male and of course, had perverted thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, (Like all team yell members) knew where Marnie lived. Spikemuth was a compact area and could hardly be considered a town. There was one path and on both sides of said path were buildings. At the end of the path was where Piers, Spikemuth's gym leader, and Marnie's older brother resided. Marnie also lived with Piers, but ever since she left on her journey she only stopped by occasionally. Coincidentally, Marnie was at her leg of the journey where she would be fighting her older brother soon, meaning it is the perfect chance for you to join her journey without her even knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day Marnie was said to have made it to Spikemuth you decided to not put on face paint or wear the team yell uniform, the reasoning behind it that purple stands out much more than beige. You went beside the side entrance of Spikemuth because the main door was blocked off and Marnie knew about the side entrance. You went to a corner away from grass and used minimize, shrinking yourself to a meager 3 inches, about the height of a pinky finger. Just as you reached your final height, Marnie walked around the corner with a pretty cute Scottish girl who seemed really polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they decided to have a pokemon battle. With their focus entirely on the battle, you would have no trouble sneaking on one of them. The thing is, you started to have second thoughts about whether you should choose Marnie or not. Marnie and the new girl seemed to be good friends, so if you stayed with the Scottish girl for a bit you would probably see Marnie again. On the other hand, Marnie was your goddess and you had learned how to shrink and grow just to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was almost over, so you had to choose quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose...</span></div></div>",

When you first woke up, you were shocked to find that you had somehow been shrunk to a ridiculously tiny size. You were smaller than the smallest Caterpie and you had nearly been food for a few Hoothoots in their place. Lucky you had avoided such a grizzly fate, but it certainly hadn't been easy. Luckily your previous travel experiences helped you know what was safe to eat, you really regretted not getting a Pok\u00e9mon now, they'd be a big help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just settled into a bush to rest for the night, something you still weren't used to. You could feel the filth covering your whole body, nothing you could do about that unfortunately. It might be helping you to stay hidden actually. It had been awhile since anything had taken notice of you, so maybe things were settling down into-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as you were swept up into some sort of object. Whatever it was, it felt smooth and pristine. You could hear some streaking sound as you slid along its surface. The only good thing that could mean was that you weren't sliding down the gullet of some Pok\u00e9mon. Your slide along the strange surface was stopped as your back slammed into a wall. Inertia forced your legs past your head and you tumbled onto your face. You groan softly, \"What the heck was that?\" An odd noise sounded above you, causing you to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly recognized what you saw. You had been scooped up into a jar! The lid had just been sealed on, thankfully it had holes in it, which meant whoever was using this meant to collect things your size. You wondered how the owner of the jar had managed to sneak up on you, as the jar moved loudly through the leaves of the bush. Whoever was doing this had to have seen you earlier and moved quietly to scoop you up so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I got ya!\" You heard a voice from above. Whoever it was sounded really excited. You were lifted up to the face of the one who had captured you. It was a purple, or lavender?, haired boy. The look on his face reflected the enthusiasm in his voice. \"Wow I can't believe it!\"</span></div></div>",

Incredible!\u201d Astonishment clear in the boy\u2019s voice. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find something as intriguing as you before. Glad I came out today, I might have missed you otherwise.\u201d He turned the jar you were trapped in around repeatedly, trying to get a good look at you. The movement through you around a bit, but you mostly kept your footing. \u201cIt was hard to tell from a distance though. You\u2019re super dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have been out here for a couple of weeks now.\u201d You speak, your tone a mixture of annoyance and exhaustion. \u201cI didn\u2019t figure out a way to bathe myself yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! And you can still talk too, this is great!\u201d The boy\u2019s excitement continued to grow. \u201cMy name is Bugsy, I\u2019m a bug type gym leader. I\u2019ve been catching bugs since I was a kid, that\u2019s how I snuck up on you and caught you so easily.\u201d He explained, correctly guessing that you were going to ask how he snuck up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you was laughing because he talked about being a kid like it was a while ago. He clearly wasn\u2019t much older than what would usually be considered a kid. Most of you, however, was relieved that a gym leader of all people had found you. You were saved! \u201cSo you can help me right? I\u2019ve been stranded out here for so long, I\u2019d given up on ever finding help. I figured I\u2019d end up food for a Hoothoot or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugsy laughed and shook his head. \u201cNah, I doubt a Hoothoot would be very interested in you. You\u2019re a bit too small. A Beautifly might have liked you though, you aren\u2019t much for filling bellies, but you still got life force to be sucked out.\u201d Apparently his comment visibly upset you, because he quickly stuttered an apology. \u201cAh, sorry! I tend to freak people out with bug facts at normal size. You probably don\u2019t need stiff like that on your mind now. You probably weren\u2019t tasty looking to any Pokemon out here anyways.\u201d He hastily adding at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I was always thinking about how badly things could\u2019ve ended for me. I didn\u2019t think about having the life sucked out of me by a Beautifly though, that\u2019s super creepy. I didn\u2019t know those things lived around here.\u201d You found it strange that you were having this kind of conversation immediately after getting rescued. You figured you were just so relieved that you were up for talking about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bit rare in this area, but you definitely could\u2019ve run into one. This forest has been thriving with bug Pokemon for a while now. It\u2019s a phenomenon where several environmental chains have merged together. There are bug types and Pokemon usually found around them all over this place!\u201d Bugsy spoke, his enthusiasm returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? To come see all the bug Pokemon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head enthusiastically. \u201cYeah! I wanted to see how this massive ecosystem was developing. I was hired as part of a team to observe it. I got another bug type gym leader with me, her name\u2019s Viola, and a whole team of scientists. We\u2019re in the independent phase right now so we aren\u2019t working together but\u2026\u201d Bugsy started going on a tangent about the work he was doing, leading to you losing focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuning him out, you take a good look at Bugsy, comparing him to your disheveled and horrible appearance. Looking at him fully, you realize for the first time how gigantic he is! He looked like a building with the strange view from your jar. He would probably look even bigger if your view wasn\u2019t slightly distorted. For the first time since forever, you look down, now through the bottom of the jar which gave you a much clearer view. And you were right, the clear view did make Bugsy look even bigger! His brown shoes alone looked like large houses. You could only imagine the blissful heat that was inside of them and under his foot\u2026 compared to the cold outside you had to endure for the past few weeks of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for a moment you tune back into Bugsy\u2019s long tangent. \u201cI think Viola just came here to take pictures though. Why else would she bring her favorite camera? The scientists were providing some for us anyways.\u201d He seemed to be expressing doubts about the other gym leader he had mentioned. He was one to talk though. He brought bug catching jars and you could clearly see a giant bug net on his back. Totally just for research right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you were just relieved to have help and decided to interrupt Bugsy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but do you think you could let me out of this jar now? It\u2019s not very comfortable.\u201d You note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugsy stops in the middle of the story and smiled sheepishly. To your confusion and slight concern, he shook his head. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do that?\u201d He said simply. You immediately wanted to ask why, but he cut you off. \u201cThere\u2019s a good reason for that though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But quiet little pieces of doubt and suspicion just echoing one little phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' I\u2019m making you part of my collection.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' I\u2019m making you part of my collection.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>'I\u2019m making you part of my <b>collection</b>.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLOUDER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>'I\u2019M MAKING YOU PART OF MY <b>COLLECTION</b>!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT IN THE <i>ABSOLUTE</i> HELL DO YOU MEAN BY I AM GOING TO PART OF YOUR STUPID COLLECTION!\" After a few minutes of dwelling on it, the reality of the situation dawned on like Monday morning.

It was amazing that you didn't alert the sleeping pokemon in the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it was a...um..a Freudian slip...yes! A simple Freudian slip.\" Bugsy quickly responded. His voice shifting from \"nerdy boy acting his age\" to \"professional scientist\" in the span of a few thirty seconds. It was both kinda scary and impressive. Even with his cheeks slowly reddening into a fainted pink. \"The reason why I said you be part of my  \"<i>stupid</i>\" collection...\" The voice Bugsy used to speak the word 'stupid' was a high-pitched nasally parody of your own. That along with the air quotes he used when saying it just shows that you struck a chord with him. \"..is because it so I can found out how did you get so tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not show me to the other scientists in the camp?\" You were quick to counter his point. This is your life we are talking about here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I simply don't know how they will react to you.\" Bugsy honestly spoke. They were too much of an unknown. And Viola...has her head in clouds too much. Upon hearing this you made silent. The young giant said nothing as he enters his ten-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you...and sorry for calling your collection stupid. I was wrong for that\" You relented with a sigh. Causing him to smile widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Bugsy laughs almost a little <i>too</i> excitedly. those cheeks getting a little brighter too. Seeing him do that causes you to pale and sweat...which he notices and quickly dons a that neutral \"scientist\" facade again. \"That is good to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm so going to regret this. I just know it.'</i> Bugsy places you on top of what had to be his sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Everything was a blur of motion as Misty\u2019s backside came into view. She used her other hand to pull back the gap in her swimsuit just above the small of her back, then slowly dangled you over the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet comfortable, cause you\u2019re gonna be there a while!\u201d Misty exclaimed before dropping you down the back of her swimsuit. You yelled as you fell through the air and descended into the dark, before smacking into a massive mound of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpside down, you slid face first into Misty\u2019s crack. Which seemed to be somewhat warmer than being jammed against her swimsuit. You felt her spread her gargantuan cheeks apart, causing you to fall deeper between them. Misty\u2019s finger pushed you even deeper from the outside of her swimsuit, then after she was satisfied that you were firmly wedged she smashed her cheeks together, smothering you with her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and plopped her butt back down on the stump, and resumed the gyrating motion that she had been doing earlier. You squirmed in protest as you felt like you were kneaded around between her ass cheeks like you were a glob of dough, Misty laughed aloud to herself, \u201cThat definitely was you that I felt down there earlier. I wasn\u2019t sure I felt something, but now that I think about it.\u201d She giggled, \u201cI can definitely feel you squirming back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty quickly sat up, lifting her bottom off of the stump, only to quickly drop it back down. She repeated this a few times, before rubbing it out all over the stump again. She sighed, stretching out her arms and legs, putting much more pressure on top of you before finally standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough for now, but I still have to keep training. So you\u2019re not quite done.\u201d Misty said, jogging back over before the lake and continuing her training session with her Pokemon. Her ass smacked and jiggled around you as she jumped around commanding her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for probably about another hour until Misty finally recalled her pokemon. Without bothering to say anything to you, she took off back up the trail to her campsite. Whipping you around in a torrent of motion in the confined space between her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at her campsite she rooted around through her bag for a bit then stood back up. She slid her hand down the back of her swimsuit, and found you in about the same spot that she left you, but slightly lower. She brought you back in front of her face and looked at you with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have no idea how or why you ended up shrunk the way you are, but now you're less than a foot tall and in the middle of the woods.

It's been a fruitless search so far, and you're beginning to lose hope as your stomach starts to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you smell it. Whatever it was, it smelled like the perfect blend of berries all mixed together. You follow your nose to the fruity smell, but instead of finding a berry stockpile or a feast, you see only a girl slumped up against a tree sleeping. There wasn't a berry in sight, so you can only assume that the smell is coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked so cute as she rested there peacefully. She had shoulder-length blue hair with a red headband. She also wore a green, floral print kimono with a red dress. On her feet, she had a pair of white socks and brown sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer to her, you realized that the smell that led you here was getting stronger.

Your only hope to get her attention would be to climb up to her face and try there. Then again, that's a really high climb. Maybe you would be better off going inside her kimono and climbing up from there. Then you at least get the bonus of seeing what it's covering up. Of course, there's always the safest option of just staying put until she wakes up on her own and trying then.

If you were caught she would most likely not be happy to your presence no matter what the excuse is. But climbing up from the outside didn't sound to bad. It's survival to you right now, and the best way to survive is to get this woman's attention as fast as possible. \"I mean whats the worse that could happen?\" you say this right before preparing to climb up this giantess dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman makes a slight movement in her sleep that makes it a little harder to just reach up and grab the dress. So It takes you a few tries to jump up and finally grab onto the kimono. The smell illuminating from her perfume was so sweet smelling that it made the climb a little more do able tolerate. While pulling yourself up, you begin to realize just how hard this journey really is going to be. With each pull up that you were forced to make, the muscles in your body were aching for rest. \"Wow I definitely need to do more working out\" you think to yourself as you continue your climb to the top of the woman's knee. And as to your luck the woman starts to wake up as you are still only about half up to reaching her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ugh... I must of doze off for a bit while studying grass type Pokemon. I wonder what time it is?\" Erika said this to herself as she begins to stand up and check the pocket watch that she owned.  Her standing has caused you to stop climbing for a moment and just grip hard onto the dress of the kimono. \"Oh my is it already this late, I guess I should really start getting ready to head back to the gym. who knows what kind of trainers are there waiting for my presence...\" After Erika said this she stops in her sentence as she begins to look down, she expects to only see the bag that she brought but to her surprise there is also a bug who has decided to climb upon her. One thing to know about Erika is that she loves all Pokemon but believes bugs to be disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing you, Erika begins to freak out. You were being swung left and right as this girl was just screaming and stomping about the ground. To make matters worse she also started to brush her hands vigorously against her kimono. You were doing your best to keep your grip, trying to scream up to her to stop. But it was no use she could just barley could hear random squeaks. She was way to focus on trying to get rid of the disgusting bug that is you, to even check what you really are. Then it happened with one full sweep of her gorgeous soft hand. You were lunged off her kimono and launched onto the ground where you were given a new obstacle to avoid her massive stomping sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were doing your best to avoid each stomp. The area around you felt like an earthquake that kept knocking you down each time the sole of her dirty sandal came down. And as you were just about to make it out of the chaos that was happening. The quakes knocked you down one last time. Which forces you to stare up at the bottom of Erika's brown sandal. The sandals underneath was coated in dirt, grass blades, and some tiny insects, That you will now join on the bottom of this random woman's sandal. This stranger to you is about to crush you like the insect that you are to her. With no concern of your tiny life the sandal brutally comes down on top of you. And to finish the job which is unknowingly done by Erika, she continues to stomp up and down. Giving you random flashes of light and eating the hard dirty ground that is below you...</span></div></div>",

You were somehow surviving each blow to the ground, hoping that she would just stop already. As in instant your arms was a smashed red mess under her sandal. This was soon followed by each of your legs crushed and squished against the hard ground. With body and head the center of the sole you were still somehow still alive but now stuck to this random woman's sandal who didn't care if just died already. But finally the stomping stopped as your just barley alive at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... I think I got it. Sorry little bug but you should know the rules if you end up on me its lights out for you\" with that said Erika picked up her bag and walked her way back to the gym. It was a long a nasty journey that again for some unknown reason you were still alive for. She went through mud, tiny insects, and other disgusting trash that was left on the ground. At this point you were hoping that death would just bless itself upon you. Being basically the sole of this woman's sandal was h***. Days seem to pass by as you were endlessly stomped into dirt, concrete, and other things. Then at the end of each day you were stuck to the bottom of the sandals that were just carelessly tossed in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't till one random day (at this point you lost track of time) that you were finally discovered. The day was like any other beginning with random activities to ending with a gym battle. The last really bad stomp you ever experience under Erika's sole was when she stomp her foot/sandal down after losing another Pokemon battle. She strolled her way to the bed room and again carelessly tossed the sandals which this time landed with the bottoms side up. Erika saw you sticking to the end her dirty sandal bottom. She gave a grossed out face look at you and then said \"Ewww whats that icky thing there..\" she then grabbed a tissue and with little to no force grabbed you in it. She then gave it a good squeeze which literally squeeze the life out of you. And she with no thought of your existence what so ever just tossed your lifeless body into the trash. Some of your remains were still on that sandal and would eventually be washed off. Leaving no trace of your tiny existence...</span></div></div>",

Even if this girl was asleep right now, you weren't sure if she would stay asleep. She could wake up while you were climbing her and that would be a lot of trouble for you. Especially if you were climbing her inside of her clothes, it would be hard to explain why you were climbing inside of her clothes, and looking for help doesn't really excuse you from climbing in that particular way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus it was possible that just interacting with her more directly could simply wake her up. All you did before was pull on her kimono a bit, that's something that she could easily miss. Even if you weren't smaller than a doll, such a small action probably wouldn't get her attention even at a bigger size. Perhaps trying a bit hard to get her attention could work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the girl again and try to see what you could interact with. Anything above her waist was out. Reaching above that would require a bit of climbing, which means you would already be climbing her. Her legs were completely covered, so that didn't leave you much to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a second to look at the girl's face, checking to see if she was starting to wake up. She was still sleeping soundly and remained oblivious to your presence. You had to admit that she was beautiful, radiantly so. Her floral perfume seemed oddly appropriate now. She had this natural beauty to her, like a pristine flower. Hopefully when this flower woke up, she wasn't one that had any thorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefocusing on your task, you look past the girl's legs and check around her ankles. That's when you notice the girl's socks. They seemed to be pretty long and then traveled up into her dress. You had considered trying to take the girl's socks off, hoping her foot being exposed to the air would wake her up, but that wasn't an option now. Your last option seemed to be the girl's foot itself. Quite an interesting situation. The foot is the part of the body that so many people ignore and now your fate was partially tied with this girl's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl subconsciously scrunched her toes in her sleep, reminding you that you weren't completely safe from her actions either. Looking at her socked toes, you consider your options. You could just wait for the girl to wake up naturally, that would be the safest option by far. All you'd have to do is make sure that she saw you when she woke up. You decided against climbing her, that seemed too risky and you weren't in a rush to get her attention. Finally, the girl's toes were right in front of you and you were willing to guess that she'd be ticklish there. But would she even feel you through her sock? And would she react consciously? Or could her toes have their way with you?</span></div></div>",

She didn't even make a sound as her eyes flustered open and she woke up. Erika in her mind slightly scolded herself. Just sleeping out here, this isn't the first time she's just fallen asleep on a stump, in fact it was the third time. She just can't help while its so peaceful and pleasent. Planning to get up and move back to her gym, hoping that a problem didn't raise while she was gone. However just as she was about to move she stopped when she spotted something near her socked foot. Being the careful and kind girl she was, she didn't move and try to scare it off. Staying still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at it she was confused. It surely didn't look like any Pokemon she knew, in fact it looked almost humanoid. She would say it was some poor girl\u2019s lost doll but you were moving around and... talking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, its the only thing to do. Just dive in.\u201d You say unaware that she was actually watching you. Above Erika was watching you, realising that you were no Pokemon or Doll. You were a human? Erika needless to say was amazed, wondering why you were so small and more importantly what you were doing near her foot. Suddenly you ran straight into the sole of her socked foot. Ramming yourself into the wall as you planned to get her to feel you. You just rub your body against the wall that was her sole, planning to stop when she actually feels you. You turn your head to see if she was awake, to see her watching with open eyes. Watching as you rub your body against her. \u2028\u2028Embarrassed you walked backwards apologising \u201cUh I'm sorry! Its not what you think. I only did it for Ahhh!!!\u201d You didn't finish that sentence properly as you fell and tripped onto your back. Erika wanted to reach down and help you up but she wasn't to sure. She was too concerned with what you were doing near her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Erika is use to perverts, she runs a Gym made of young girls after all. She knows perverts and reluctantly knows about Foot Fetishes. If Erika was to hazard a guess she would say that you had one of those. She\u2019s willing to give you the benefit of the doubt but its not really looking good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up after your fall you look up to the girl, not taking her eyes off of you. Her eyes locked straight onto you. \u201cUm... What were you doing by my foot?\u201d She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird. You expected her first question to be about why your small size. Regardless your gonna answer honestly. \u201cSorry, i was just trying to get your attention, but you were asleep and well... I guessed that rubbing your foot and tickling you was the best way to wake you up. I thought about climbing you but figured you wouldn't like that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you, tilting her head sideways as she asked \u201cIs that it? Is that the only reason you were by my foot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah of course, i mean i saw you sleeping there and i had to get your attention. Uh whats your name if i can ask. My name is (Your Name) but the way\u201d You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErika\u201d She answered simply, thinking about if what you said was true. She wants to trust you, and you don't look like a pervert. But she knows she has to be careful. Maybe a couple more questions to clear this up more. Moving around she moved so her knees were right in front of you and her feet behind herself. \u201cWell i guess i should of asked this first. Why are you so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Wish i could answer that myself. Don't really know?\u201d You admitted to her. She wondered to herself if that was the actual truth or your just trying not to admit something. Granted you apparently didn't know Erika but you could be faking that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika reached her hand down to you. Holding it flat as you look at her, her smile inviting you. You climb onto it as you Thank her. She's taking this better then you expected and is being extremely sweet. Looks like you made a good choice. She raised you up to her face as she smiles. Suddenly she said \u201c___________________\u201d</span></div></div>",

I saw you run up and jump into my foot like it was some kind of playground. I deal with creeps like you all the time and I will say being tiny is a new one. But your all the same, just trying to perv on me and my girls. (now with her free hand, she starts wagging her finger at you like your a bad child) This was very naughty thing for you to do. Woman are not just objects for you to abuse and perv on. We are....\" Erika goes on a tangent about woman, in which you really don't have any arguments against and just want her to believe that your not a pervert. But anytime you try to argue that fact, she shuts you down and keeps talking.Your like a doll to her who has to listen to every word with no interruption and no means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika finally finishes her grand speech, she then looks at you with are cold angry stare. \"Listen Erika I am not a...\" she cut you off again. \"What part about I don't want to hear your arguments, do you not understand? I have made up my mind. Your a perv, who somehow invented something to let you shrink and live out your purvey fantasies. You had your chance to tell me the truth but there is no way I am just to believe that you just randomly ended up tiny and boom your diving into my foot. It's not something that just happens. Now I believe a punishment is in order for you\" Erika stood there for moment with you tightly in her soft beautiful hand's grip, trying to think of a proper way to teach you not to perv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no real options you were forced to just sit in her tight grip. She won't listen to you and honestly she is kinda right, the whole situation is pretty bizarre to even consider to be true. But its true, hopefully she will just let me off with something easy so maybe she will begin to trust me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was so enraged by this bug creep, she even considered just tossing him on the ground and just crushing the life out of him with her brown sandals. But she then said to herself that being the one to directly kill a person isn't what she wants to do. So that just left were two other options deal with him herself or let the authorities punish this perverted tiny man. Erika then begins to speak \"Okay perv, since I don't really have a lot of time to think about this. Cause I have to get back to my gym. I am going to just...</span></div></div>",

If by some means you do end up surviving, trainers shoes then I'll untape you each day and give you food. That sounds fair?\" Erika looks at you with no real concern for your answer but is willing to listen this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this your in shock and wishing that you kept walking when you saw this crazy woman \"You can't do that, first off I'm not a perv and second I will die...\" Erika cuts you off again. \" I told you once and I' ll tell you again little perv I don't believe anything your telling me. Plus who knows maybe you make it to the end of each day just fine then free food. Or maybe I get bored of this and decide a new punishment is more fitting\".

Your not happy and excited about this, in fact you were feeling a bit scared. If you were truly a pervert you would feel very excited about this. So it was good to know, very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, once they see i trust you they will be okay. Now to get you somewhere safe\u201d She said as she brought you around, standing up onto her feet as she twisted her hand. Holding her hand up as she shifted and put you into her Kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in her sleeve as you were hidden in. No one will see you, and you got plenty of ground to hold on in there. It was actually pretty smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be extra careful when i walk\u201d You hear her talk from the other side of the hand \u201csee you at the gym\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long walk, at least to you it was.

You were there, and you were about to get judged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm girls... can you come around\u201d She said out loud as you could hear other girls talking. While you were stressing in the sleeve. What if they decide you were a pervert. What if they are mean and hurtful to you. At this size it was not like you could really defend yourself. They sat down onto a painted seat as she looked around. Many girls don\u2019t come everyday, so there was only two others. Which was good, it means she can introduce you easily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... i was taking a nap in the forest and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously Erika\u201d A voice chimed in \u201cYou got to stop doing that, all your doing is getting attention, and not the good kind\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to agree with Lori, it was not very smart\u201d A third voice said \u201cThat\u2019s where you meet the pervs\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually i did meet someone Kay\u201d She said being honest \u201cHe is a guy, but not pervert\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoubt that\u201d The one identified as Lori said as you start fearing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is not a pervert, trust me.

You move and jump from her sleeve down to her hand. Landing down as you then feel yourself get held up and presented. Facing the two girls as they look over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was a cute girl. With a blue skirt, white hair and burnet hair. She was looking to you of course amazed. Which was good.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Spr_FRLG_Lass.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one had long blonde hair, and a beautiful face. More mature and more defined. She was looking at you with disgust. Which was not good.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Spr_FRLG_Beauty.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d Kay said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh\u201d Lori said \u201cThe pervert shrunk himself down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat no, i\u2019m not a pervert i swear!\u201d You say trying to defend yourself. Lori didn\u2019t want to hear anymore from you, as she brought her hand and grabbed you. She hung you in the air into her eye as she glared at you \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I am gonna deal with this little boy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said that as you thrash around. Not very happy about this, however Kay came to the side. And... well you thought she was going to say something better \u201cLori! Don\u2019t hog him all for yourself. I want to punish him too\u201d She said as you were not happy about this. You try to get away, but you were stuck in her hand which was sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika saw the trouble you were in, and she tried to help you. She moved up and grabbed you, pulling you from the others and safely to her chest. You were held to her chest as she protects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, he is not a pervert. Just a small guy in a bad situation. One we have to take care of\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at her, almost like she didn\u2019t trust you fully. However Erika was the leader, so they trust her judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d Lori said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, i will look after him\u201d Kay said with a bit of enthusiasm, so you guess that is good. You guess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if it\u2019s only you three, i guess that is good\u201d You say up to Erika smiling \u201cHonestly i was expecting more\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Erika said trailing off giving you a nervous smile \u201cThese two are the only ones here today. They\u2019re are a lot more girls\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, that would love messing with a pervert like you\u201d Lori said leaning forward \u201cEven a pair of young twins. They would love you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her\u201d Kay said \u201cI would love to play with you as well!\u201d Kay said as it seems your size alone was enough to change her mind. You sigh massively as Erika scolded them. While she was doing this, you look over left and right seeing the Gym you were in. It was much more like a garden rather then a building. Plants, trees and a grass everywhere. It would seem like paradise for a girl like Erika and honestly paradise for you. You can even see some fruit trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself get moved and placed down onto the ground. Right down onto the ground as you stumble a bit at Erika\u2019s sandals. You look up to her and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, have fun and explore. This is your home now\u201d She said giving you a big smile. You listen to your giantess and start walking. You walk and look around of course, going around the corner as the three girls look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were by yourself for a while, a long while until you meet up with __________</span></div></div>",

However you were easily able to tell that this was nothing but a doll house. Which means your probably in her giant toy town. You look around the house and notice dolls. They were all the same size of you and they were off a couple gym leaders. Misty, Erika, Janine and the Elite Four Member Lorelei. They were incredibly well detailed. Not to mention a little too life like. They're clothes feel so real, you wonder if they even have the undergarments on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you done perving on them, i want you to step outside\u201d You hear Sabrina\u2019s voice outside. You follow her and leave the house and dolls, looking up you saw that you were in her toy town like you thought.

Much like a zombie, they got close as you back up into her boot. \u201cIf i was you i would start running, Zombies like to eat if i recall and I've got the power to make you bite size\u201d Sabrina said as you wonder what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the four girls dolls started sprinting towards you like they were on a mission.

Slowly as she was walking, you moved slightly closer to her chest, almost touching her ample bosom. Her robe seemed like it was skin tight, and not designed to account for so much bust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were ogling her breasts as they drew closer, and suddenly you were falling. You collapsed on the floor dazed, but despite what felt like a fall from a great height you were unharmed. As you dusted yourself off and looked back up, Sabrina was already getting comfortable on the sofa, looking down at you by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if you come up here, I might consider helping you.\u201d She said rather plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019This is my punishment\u2026?\u2019</i> You thought, looking up at her perplexed. \u201cYou just want me to\u2026 Climb up there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and if you don\u2019t\u2026 Well, maybe I\u2019ll get a little creative with you\u2026\u201d It was like every word she said was alluding to something else, the prospect both terrified and excited you. Despite her demeanor, you didn\u2019t feel like she would ever want to hurt you. This was a game to her, but her sly expression gave little hint towards what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled slightly, \u201cNow that would be telling. Let\u2019s just say that you don\u2019t want to find out, this <i>is</i> your punishment\u2026\u201d She leaned forward a bit, wickedly smiling. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know it yet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear instantly shot through to the pit of your stomach. There was something very wrong about her, this was more than just a game to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she could sense your fear, \u201cNow you better get moving. I said you wouldn\u2019t want to find out what happens if you fail\u2026\u201d She added, before leaning back and relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripped by fear, you rushed up to her towering boot. Almost expecting her to kick you for a moment, you looked up, but her face was obscured by the sofa. You could only wonder what she was thinking right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boot was made of very soft leather, that was noticeably slippery as you hauled yourself on top of her foot. It was almost as if the material was designed to be smooth and slippery. Chosen to make your task even more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe clock is ticking\u2026\u201d Sabrina ominously said from above you, \u201cYou don\u2019t have very much time before I get bored\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, you ran against the slope of her ankle and tried to get a running start to climb up her leg, but after a few steps, you slipped back down. \u201cPathetic\u2026\u201d Sabrina emotionlessly said as you fell on your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had any chance of doing this you were going to have to move slowly. Carefully, you pressed your hands against the slippery material and were able to get a little bit of purchase by squeezing your hand together, pinching the little slack in the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019I can do this\u2026\u2019</i> You realized, pulling yourself up slightly to reach your other hand higher. But as you started to make some headway, the reality of just how small you are started to set in. If you did manage to climb up, it was going to take some time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina huffed, \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m starting to feel bored\u2026\u201d She said almost sassily. You kept forgetting that she could read your mind. You knew she could, but it was perhaps scarier that she knew you knew\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His daughter Janine who has also studying the art of being a ninja and becoming a gym leader is taking over today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoga then shows you around the gym. and after doing so he brings you to a room of ninja tools. \"This is our final stop together. as my daughter should be here soon and she will teach you in the art of being a gym leader ninja. Soon you will be able to successfully use each one of these many ninja tools\". He says this and as you begin to look around you see one tool by it self sitting on a pillow. It was red with what seem to being a puff of smoke in it. you then ask \"Hey so what is that red one on the pillow anyway?\". He looks at you with excitement and says \"Ah I am glad to see that your getting into becoming a ninja. That is the only one of its kind that I know of. it was said to be forged by real ninjas back in the day. I myself have no idea what it does. But according to the man who found it and gave it to me, he said that it should never be used'. The story freaks you out a bit an seeing your face Koga then begins to laugh at you and say \"hahaha you should see the look on your face. listen that old thing is a relic and even if it was ever used there is no way the contents in it would work the same. The guy who gave it to me must have been a real drunk, I know that feeling hahaha\" Koga said this to you. And you just felt embarrassed and mad at the fact that you have to deal with such a disgusting man right now.  He then tells you to freely look around the room, He said he has to get going to the elite four and his daughter should be here very soon. With that he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you had to admit to yourself that curiosity was getting to you as you began to approach the red orb thing.\"pssshhh I don't even know why even keeps it around then. If he doesn't see it as dangerous why even keep it around then\" You say this to yourself as you poke the orb and it falls to break. The smoke then appears around you and disappears. A little dizzy from all that smoke you begin to cough \"Dumb orb all it was doing was collecting dust....\" you stop in mid sentence as a young girl in a ninja outfit enters the room your in. And then you see that her and everything around you has gotten much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange dad did say the man I am suppose to train is in here. Oh I know he must be trying to ninja surprise me like my dad does. Listen if you can hear me let me tell you that its not going to work I won't let some rookie show me up (giggles to herself) this guy must be quite the character to pull off this disappearance act because not even I can detect him right now\" The giant girl says this to herself as she began to enter the room. She kept looking around boxes and saying gotcha every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this you kinda just feel bad for her, but then prioritize your situation. knowing that the only way to get help to return to your normal size must be to get her attention. but how? is the question</span></div></div>",

The plan is simple, do to this campsite to what you've done to the twenty something past campsites. Sneak around and loot. Well loot what you can carry, which turns out not to be much. Still a sewing needle is much more useful in your tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer you see the giant girl who was sitting there. She looked in her late twenties, with red hair done into a ponytail, a black outfit and a pair of beautiful eyes hiding behind a pari of glasses. She did look beautiful, too bad your planning not to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer you plan to stay out of her sight, moving around as you see her reading a book by firelight. You've never read a book before, due to your height. You've still managed to find a way to read but never a way to read a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer you walk behind the girl, looking up as she seemed to not see you. You smile as you walk to the giant tent. Thankfully the zipper was slightly open which means you can sneak your way in. Stretching your limbs you get up. Climbing over the small wall you had to. You jump over as you land on the other side as you can see inside the tent. Didn't look to impressive, just a standard tent. Now that your out of the chance of being spotted you walk around. Seeing what you can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorelei, out of your sight. Smiled to herself. You may not think so but she did see you, in fact she saw you out of the corner of her eye. She held her posture to not give you away as she watched you come closer and closer. She's seen the odd before so a shrunken man didn't shock her. But it did... intrigue her. She watched as you walked to her tent and climb in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little scavenger\u201d She said to herself, thinking that you were trying to scavenge from her tent. Which was true. She also wondered if it may be a bit more perverted then she believed. Closing her book, she stood up to her full height. Suppose she should go and have fun with the little intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you were trying to climb into her bag. Everything was sealed and organised so you cant find anything. Too bad Lorelei found you. As you watch her giant form enter the tent. Acting quickly you get on your stomach, wanting to make yourself smaller and have less of chance to be spotted. A simple tactic but one thats proven to be effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it would be effective if it wasn't Lorelei. She spotted you, and like before she didn't give anything away that she did. Looking at the corner of her eye, she wondered if she could continue to act unaware. Just for fun</span></div></div>",

Not intentionally at least\u201d The giant girl said as she reached for you again. Seeing as your path was gone you did your only plan and start climbing her sneaker.

Holding the long white shoe lace in front of you like a police line. She then started to wrap around you, well both laces as you try to get out.

You gulped, on one hand, part of you relished the chance of getting this close to such a fine pair of tits, but on the other, it looked like her cleavage could eat you alive. \u201cIn you go, cutie!\u201d She excitedly said, before plunging you into the crack between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasted no time firmly wedging you in the dark chasm that was her cleavage. Although it was dark as her squishy boob flesh swallowed up <i>all</i> of the light above you. The muffled sound of Whitney giggling echoed in your ears as everything around you jiggled into a torrent of motion as she took off moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camp that Whitney had set up was torn down in record time as she quickly stowed everything away. The giant girl\u2019s erratic movements as she gathered her things shook her breasts around like mad. Her bra was put up a valiant effort but was no match for the weight of her breasts which she insisted on throwing around more than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was yell your disapproval as the walls around you shifted and smothered you between her impossibly soft boobs. \u201cHehehe, you feel <i>soooo goooood</i> in there!\u201d You heard her say suddenly before you felt the pressure around you suddenly be amplified by ten as she squeezed her boobs together, laughing as she felt your insignificant little squirms between her sensitive skin. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I decided to keep you as my boyfriend! I\u2019m going to have so much fun with you!\u201d She said, before eventually stopping the onslaught of pressure shifting around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention shifted elsewhere as she hopped onto her bike and took off down the road. Whitney\u2019s bosom gently rocked around you as she peddled her bike. After you had settled down in the cradle that her boobs provided, you started to feel a little tired. It was probably a combination of all of that walking earlier, the immense warmth that Whitney\u2019s body provided, the barely audible sound of her heartbeat, but you were getting pretty tired now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the gentle rocking as Whitney peddled down the road put you to sleep. You were awoken by\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still waking up, the light almost blinded you as you felt the unforgettable feeling of Whitney's lips pressing against your body. This snaps you out of your stupor. \"Wakey wakey cutie pie.\" You hear Whitney's voice ring out as you finally open your eyes to see Whitney smiling back at you. You look around and see that you are in what appears to be a bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, but you looked so cute in there that I let you sleep while I got changed.\" She sets you down on her bed to show you. She was wearing a French maid outfit, complete with a miniskirt. The top of the outfit  was completely open, showing as much of her creamy white cleavage as possible without showing any nipple. She gives herself a twirl to show you everything, making her skirt flare up and show you her underwear, pink with black spots like a Miltank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I look? Cute enough?\" You stare in stunned silence at how she looks, making her laugh at your response. \"I'll take that as a yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap yourself out of it. \"So, what's with the outfit? Not that I'm complaining of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised you I'd be nice with you when we got back. I wanted to apologize for manhandling you when we met.

Beneath your body, you feel the cold, hard ground of the forest you've been walking through earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit upright, and your hand travels up to your head. You distinctly remember that you were walking into the forest, but you can't remember where you were heading. Actually, you don't seem to remember anything aside from who you are.<br>\r\nWeird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you whisper to yourself. You stand up and glance around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes meet with the sight of enormous trees, but without leaves and with entirely verdant trunks. You stare at them in disbelief for a few seconds, before shifting your gaze downwards. The ground seems... closer for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant trees... closer ground... You look up again to realize that these are not trees... They're actually blades of grass! Which means... that you've somehow shrunk down to size! And, as if it's not enough, you're deep inside this forest, making you an easy prey for whatever pokemon looking for a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up into the sky. The sun is slowly descending over the horizon. You <b>absolutely</b> have to find a shelter before it gets dark. Otherwise, it would most probably end bad for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your survival instinct starting to kick in, you start running, trying to get out of the thick 'forest' of grass, the sun disappearing completely in the meantime, while the moon slowly takes place in the now darkened sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while, but eventually the grass comes to an end. And you end up in what seems a campsite. A small tent, a cheerful fire burning, and a fallen log. Yep. Indeed a campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your heart fills with hope as you notice a young-looking girl sitting in front of the fire, a relaxed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the log she's sitting on and gaze up at her. The giantess has long, light brown hair tied in two small pigtails; she has a light green dress that stops to her knees. She also has a white jacket, an orange bow on her chest and she wears a pair of sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, she looks very peaceful right now. You can't help but admire this gorgeous brunette giantess who hasn't noticed you yet. You even momentarily forget your new, dire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're so lost in observing her that you don't notice that the giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A curious expression paints itself on this girl's face. She stares down at you for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... are you a tiny person?\" she asks shyly. You recompose yourself.<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... you know... how did you... how did you get so tiny?\" she asks as she reaches down, placing her open hand in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop on it as the girl brings you upwards, towards her face. Her hazel eyes stare at you with genuine amusement.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I was just walking around in the forest when I was suddenly knocked out. When I woke up, I was like this.\" you explain.<br>\r\n\"Dear.\" she says with concern.<br>\r\n\"I need help. Can you please help me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes a bit from your request.<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm sorry, I have no clue of how you got like that... nor how to grow you back up... but, if you want, I can watch over you for while... at least until we figure out what happened to you...\" she says, blushing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't quite sure of what to do but, then again, this giantess is your only chance of survival right now. Plus, she seems nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you agree with her suggestion. Even though the pink shade on her cheeks, you notice her smiling slightly.<br>\r\n\"Then... I'll be taking care of you for the time being. Oh, we never got to introduce ourselves. I'm Jasmine,\" the girl, whose name she said is Jasmine, says.<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's... ehm... a cute name.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and, with you sitting on her palm, walks towards her tent.<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry,\" she says as she crawls inside and reaches for a bag. Everything is in perfect order in here, you notice. You soon hear your own stomach growling, remembering you that you haven't eaten in a while, and now it is demanding its daily satiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine gently places you down and digs into the bag, emerging from it shortly after, holding a round, red object that you recognize as an apple.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure of what you like to eat. But I think this'll do it.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou patiently wait for Jasmine slice the apple. She hands you two slices and takes the others for herself. She sits down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I understood good, I can stay with you for the time being?\" you ask while chewing on your second slice. She nods down at you with shy smile.<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, I never thanked you for it, Jasmine.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh... ehm... don't even say it. I couldn't leave someone so small and... um... helpless alone in this forest.\" she replies, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile gratefully, before a question comes to your mind.<br>\r\n\"Hey, now that I think about it, how much time are we going to stay here?... Because, you don't live in the forest... right?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles politely at your last question.<br>\r\n\"Luckily, no. I'm actually a gym leader.\" she says. You blush upon realizing how dumb your question was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head as you hear the young giantess talking again, and you notice that she is replying to your first question - how much time is she staying here?</span></div></div>",

Not at all, i want you to here\u201d She said as she realise how the last part sounded, gaining a blush she added \u201cNot like that... More that um.... i... am happy that i found you, so you won't be by yourself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts fine Jasmine, i understand.

After all, when your my size. Pretty much anything can end you. At least with you I'm safe, and I'm getting giant apples\u201d You say as you chomp into the apple slice, something that Jasmine found absolutely adorable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it didn't take long for you to be full \u201cWow, i feel like I've eaten a truck load. I don't think i can take another bite\u201d You say. Jasmine smiled then grabbed the apple slice from in front of you.

In fact you were laughing as you were thrown into the wall which was made by her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine watched you play around with her hand and loved it. She never got to play with other kids when she was younger.

It took you a moment, but you quickly realized she was walking towards you, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be very good for your health if one of those giant sandals landed on you. \u201cOh, SHIT, I need to run, like now!\u201d You said to yourself as you began to do just that. You began to desperately push your way through the grass, but because of the size difference, she quickly caught up. One of her sandalled feet landed directly behind you, making the ground beneath you shake to a point where you were knocked into the air and into her toes, it was not a pleasant place, with the sweat and smell and whatnot. Luckily, the slight pressure of your body onto her toes was enough to make her look down towards her feet and notice you. She stared at you with her gorgeous eyes for a moment, simply looking confused until she finally broke the silence. \u201cA-are you a person?\u201d She said quietly \u201cYeah, you kinda almost stepped on me, but I\u2019m fi-\u201c you tried to say, but the woman immediately scooped you up in her hand and began to talk over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my arceus! Are you ok?! I\u2019m so so so so sorry\u201d the lady said with the most genuine look of worry, concern and fear you had ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m fine, you didn\u2019t actually step on me so nothings broken\u201d you say to her, trying to calm her nerves. \u201cAre you sure? Do you need ice or a bandage or anything at all?\u201d She said in the same worrisome tone. You thought that it was actually really cute that she was worrying about you so much, considering the two of you don\u2019t even know each other\u2019s names. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t hurt anything, but could you not squeeze so hard\u201d you said to her with a nervous laugh as she was still holding you in a fist. Right away she let go of you and let you stand in her palm instead \u201cSorry, sorry! M-my name\u2019s jasmine by the way\u201d she said smiling while sticking out a finger from her other hand, gesturing a handshake. You tell her your name and hold her finger with both your hands, trying to give her the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cS-so how did you end up like this anyways?\u201d Jasmine said \u201cI\u2019m not really sure, I just sort of woke up in this forest and saw the fire and then stumbled onto your camp\u201d you explained. \u201cWell, I was just heading back to olivine city, where I\u2019m from\u201d she said \u201cI could drop you off at a Pok\u00e9mon centre, or...\u201d jasmine trailed off, blushing heavily \u201cwhat is it?\u201d You asked \u201cY-you could come with m-me..\u201d she said, extremely embarrassed. Judging by how this girl was talking, you could tell that she definitely wasn\u2019t very good with people, and was clearly shy. You thought that this was also very cute, making you want to get to know her a bit better. \u201cUm, yeah, sure. I\u2019d like that!\u201d You said with both enthusiasm and awkwardness. Jasmine blushed even harder, clearly not expecting you to say yes. \u201cUh, alright, well let\u2019s get going then, heh heh\u201d Jasmine said, even more awkwardly then you. \u201cBut uh, I guess I gotta finish packing up first.\u201d She said while putting you down on the same log she was sitting on before, then putting out the fire and going to put the rest of her stuff in her miscellaneous bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she packed, you couldn\u2019t help but watch her and take in every detail about her. She was one of those girls who was just, pretty and beautiful. Not super hot with a large chest and butt, but somebody who just looks like you could really spend time with. Her brown hair was long and flowed down her back, but somehow also was tied into pigtails that went straight up. Her brown eyes had an air of calmness to them, her long legs suited her white dress quite nicely and her orange bow that was on her somewhat small breasts (but definitely there) was cute as well. You were guessing that she was probably somewhere from age 19 to 25 (she\u2019s going to be 20 in this story). Maybe after all this shrinking business was done with, maybe you\u2019d ask her out, and take her some place nice. But now was not the time to think about that, as jasmine finished with her clean up and was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright, I\u2019ve got all my things, I guess we can go now\u201d she said, still looking embarrassed, but slightly less now. \u201cSo am I just going to walk beside you?\u201d You asked \u201cwhat?! You can\u2019t do that! You could get hurt!\u201d Jasmine said with yet again the same concerned tone. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll just put you here...\u201d she said as she picked you up and carried you towards her...</span></div></div>",

There was a lot to look at inside, namely the poke balls in the corner. Now, it was normal for most people to have at least one Pok\u00e9mon on them, that was just sort of a thing people did. However, 6 fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon, all of the same type, was quite different from most people. Her team consisted of many different steel types, ranging from steelix to empoleon, all seemingly very high leveled. \u201cIs she one of the elite four or something?\u201d You asked yourself, not being up to date with the current people in the league. But considering she said the two of you were headed to olivine city, it was highly unlikely that an elite four member would live so far away. After taking a long look at her animal companions, you decided to look around a little bit more, most people considered it rude to look through a woman\u2019s purse, but it\u2019s not like you had anything better to do. As it turns out, there really wasn\u2019t much else to look at, just a bit of makeup, keys, money, that kind of stuff. So you ended up just sitting there thinking about how you were going to get out of this situation and what you were going to do after. Eventually, you just fell asleep, resting your head on a soft glove that was left in there, hoping jasmine would remember you when the two of you arrived in olivine city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to the smell of food, seemingly laying on something else, you\u2019re not sure how much time has passed or where you are. You feel the ground beneath you, it sort of feels like a carpet but not as soft. \u201cWhere the hell am I?\u201d You think to yourself as you finally open your eyes, only to find yourself on what looks like a folded up towel on top of a table. You then look towards the place where that smell was coming from. In the other room, there Jasmine was, preparing some sort of food, humming a tune to herself. You doubted she could hear you, so you contemplated wether you should try to get over there yourself. Before that though, jasmine began to walk towards you again, this time definitely aware of your presence. Her eyes lock onto you and she looks at you with the same smile as before she speaks up. \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake!\u201d She said \u201cI made some food if you\u2019re hungry, I hope you\u2019re not allergic to pasta\u201d \u201cOh, that sounds great, I\u2019ve been pretty hungry ever since I ended up like this\u201d you say, definitely looking forward to a meal. Jasmine then picks you up again her her delicate hands and carries you over to her kitchen, where she then sets you down at the table in front of a single cut up noodle with a few drops of tomato sauce on it. \u201cI really hope it\u2019s enough, I wasn\u2019t sure how much I should give you\u201d She said as she sat down across the table from you. \u201cNo no, it\u2019s great\u201d you say, trying to use the broken toothpick utensils she made you. The two of you eat in silence until Jasmine finally broke the silence. \u201cSo...um...do you think you can give me your address or something? Or at least what town you\u2019re from? I can just bring you home after this if you want\u201d she says, with a small hint of sadness in her eyes \u201csure, I\u2019m from...\u201d your mind blanks \u201cI\u2019m... not sure where I\u2019m from...I can\u2019t remember...\u201d you say to her, unable to recall where you lived. \u201cWell, maybe you can tell me at least what the place looks like?\u201d She asked. You think hard for a moment, unable to remember anything at all about your old life. \u201cI - I think when I shrunk my memories must have shrunk too, I can\u2019t remember anything at all...\u201d you say. Jasmine looks at you with that same look of concern she gave you when she found you, it seemed like she was the caring type. \u201cWell... I guess you can s-stay here if you want...\u201d she said, clearly flustered. You thought about it for a moment \u201cdo I really want to live with some girl I only met a few hours ago? I mean, it\u2019s not like I know anyone else, and she\u2019s also super cute and kind...\u201d you contemplated for a few more seconds before coming to a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her attire was little more than sky blue, knee-high boots, and a matching bodysuit with a black cape. At her command was a wide assortment of dragon pokemon who looked like they were exhausted. \"That will do for now.\" she said in a content tone withdrawing each of them back into their balls. This woman must be a dragon master. These trainers were legendary. You really lucked out by appearing near such a strong trainer. Granted there was the problem of even getting her attention. Also there was no guarantee that she would help you. For all you knew, this giantess might in fact be the most dangerous thing you could encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you stood nearby, pondering if you should ask her for help, or sneak around near her and just stay safe through proximity to her until you get a better idea of who this is..</span></div></div>",

And so this act of rudeness will not go unpunished.\" She says in such a strong way that your to scared to even say anything back, just struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggle just makes her laugh as she decides your punishment \"Now tiny man you will see what pets get when they disobey there owner...</span></div></div>",

Definitely one hell of a thought to have on your mind, especially with just how close you were to this goal. Though the trip through Victory Road did take a lot out of you. Thankfully there were rooms for trainers to rest up if needed. As you climbed into your bed, you imagined what it will be like to be the new League Champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up several hours later, well rested and ready to take on the world. But... something seemed wrong. You tried to roll out of the bed but you couldn't reach the sides. Opening your eyes you realized three things: that you were no longer in the room you fell asleep in, that everything was absolutely gigantic around you, and that you were naked. Though it seemed like a possibility, all the clues seemed to point towards you being shrunken somehow, but how exactly? And how did you get to wherever you are now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by footsteps. Realizing that you were now on a carpeted floor rather than a bed, you looked around to make sure whoever was walking wouldn't end up stepping on you. What you saw however made you silent. Standing near a giant dresser was a massive figure with silvery hair, a yellow tank top, white knee-length pants, and yellow heels which matched her top. You couldn't believe it. This giantess wasn't just anybody. It was Karen. You were shrunken and in the room of the leader of John's Elite Four. You knew plenty about her thanks to preparation for a battle against her. Specializes in dark types, has a philosophy about using Pokemon you like and not just the ones everyone thinks are the strongest. Seeing as she leads the Elite 4, she definitely seemed to pull it off. Of course right now none of those things mattered. If you were stuck like this, chances are you won't be battling anyone. Hell you don't even know where your stuff is right now, including your Pokeballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren seemed to be combing her hair right now. She probably just woke up too and was getting ready to go about her day. Based on what you know about her, you figured she would be a safe person to approach like this. Everything you've seen seems to suggest she's a kind person. Granted reading up on someone and actually meeting them are two different things. Still, it's not like you have any better alternatives right now. And so you ran up to the yellow heel trying to shout up to the Dark Type trainer.</span></div></div>",

You're only going to make thi-EEEP!\" Karen began to say before she felt you plunge into her womanhood. Karen tried to keep her composer, but she too was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you crawled through Karen's vagina, the walls began to pull you in deeper inside her pussy. Her heartbeat began to race with excitement and you didn't regret your decision one bit. You could tell she was enjoying it because you could hear her moans echo inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then began to lay down on the couch to get more comfortable. She immediately pulled up her shirt and opened her bra to play with her breast with one hand and masturbate with the other.  You eventually were pushed towards her cervix. Her moans became louder as you caressed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you are.....keep going! It feels s-so good!\" Karen said as she shivered with delight. You also decided to help her out and started to lick her cervix. You couldn't believe what was happening, you were having sex with one of Johto's Elite 4!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter continuing to caress her cervix, a stream of her juice started to gush out, pushing you out of her pussy. You and Karen were still trying to recover from your \"little session\". Eventually, Karen then grabbed you and carried you towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to treat a woman right.\" Karen said with a satisfied tone. You were shocked to hear that tone of voice. Instead of killing you there, she actually liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for intruding on you, I needed to get your attention somehow and this was the only way I could think of.\" You said as you tilted your head down to avoid eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mind. In fact, I needed something to cure my boredom while I'm here.\" Karen said. \"What's your name and how did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her your name was *Think of anything clever or dumb/Anon* and told her about the what happened to you and how you got inside her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll *Anon*, it is strange to see you in this predicament. Some Pokemon can use \"Minimize\", but I don't believe it works on humans\" Karen theorized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it was a Pokemon. I didn't even have a Pokemon who use that move.\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren then noticed the sadden look on your face, as if you lost hope. Karen then moved you to her lips and gently kissed your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trainer never gives up hope. And besides, you chose me for help right?\" Karen asked reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, cause I thing your hooooooooo-\" You began to say, but immediately heard yourself and failed at trying to save it. Karen smiled at your mistake and lightly blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, your so sweet!\"  Karen said happily. I guess this means that you and Karen are dating now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment, Karen asked you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: \"You want to get some shut-eye?\" (Sleeping exploration)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: \"Do want to watch a movie?\" (Yes, there's a TV.

You start sniffing through your nose as loudly and intensily as you can, hoping that the air you breathe out will somehow be felt by her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench then hits you, she must be wearing this heels like... Always! However, the smell of her dried up, mature sweat is also arousing you, especially this whole situation of being dominated by Karen kind of turns you on! Your arousal leads you to demand more air, sniffing harder and harder, creating a cycle of increasing lust and heavier breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel Karen's toe wiggle ontop of the back of your head, \"ohhh!

Hanging there on the edge. It became a lot more clearer when Karen brought closer. So close that you were pinned against the wall of flesh. Your back getting pushed by her finger and your body splattered to her breast. Not to mention her erect nipple is right in front of your face, making one of the most erotic and uncomfortable pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger came off of you as she let go of the bra, slamming it shut and leaving you in darkness. Being against an erect nipple, needless to say it was getting to you. Very badly. And although it was getting to you, you still desperately wanted to get away. Unsure how your gonna do it though but seeing as her Bra wasn't that tight, maybe you could slip your way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like Karen read your thoughts, she adjusted her straps. Making it as tight as she possibly could.

Just stay in there and enjoy yourself. You felt Karen start walking but it didn't matter, you were pused that much into her breasts that you moved up and down with it. Something Karen felt and loved. If her nipple wasn't already erect, it defiantly would be right now. \u201cJust remember, I'm being nice putting you in there. Do something wrong i guarantee your going in the mouth. Understood\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am i even asking, you can't say anything. You got a face full of boob\u201d Karen said laughing at her joke.

You tried to make sense of this craziness but youre mind was still getting over the initial shock. As luck would have it, the room, or hallway it seems was mostly empty. Only a couple of other people as far as you could tell. Judging by the layout, this was a school of some sort. Thankfully, the people you saw appeared to be older, thought there were a handful of kids wandering around as well. Must cover a lot in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to quietly move down the hall, you heard a loud clicking thud which seemed to be a gigantic girls shoes hitting the floor near you. This of course was based on sound alone as you were too nervous to actually look back. You moved to the side by the wall and tried to move quicker, but then you heard a feminine voice from up above. \"Do you really think you could get away with sneaking around in the halls like this?\" Oh shit. You've been spotted! You want to bolt right then and there.

Dreading the confrontation, you turned around to face the source of the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you were a pair of black shoes with magenta leggings going up the entire length of this girl's legs. The giantess appeared to be wearing a grey dress uniform with no sleeves and a short-sleeve white undershirt. Finally you reached her face with it's red eyes and long pigtails. Despite looking fairly young for the job, you could tell that this girl was faculty, likely a teacher. Definitely the studious type either way.

Even though you were a good distance from the giantess, you could still feel the ground shake with every tap of her shoe! It was easy to keep your balance, but the tremors caused by her shoe were still clear. You dread to imagine what it would be like closer to her tapping shoe. Your eyes were drawn away from the girl's shoes back to her face as you heard her clear her throat. \"Honestly, I can't believe you!\" She spoke, disappointment clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what's wrong?\" You ask her without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she actually heard you and responded. \"Don't play dumb! I caught you in the act again! Honestly, how can you still try to run away after all the times I've caught you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the woman's scolding eyes with confusion before a realization hits you. You remember who she is and where you were! You were at the Pok\u00e9mon School in Rustboro city, and the girl was your teacher Roxanne! You must have been daydreaming about that forest setting earlier, probably thinking about the outside away from all your classes. \"Miss Roxanne, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne cut you off by pointing at you accusingly. \"Ah, zip your lips! I don't want your excuses. Nothing you say will excuse your behavior.\" She squatted low to the ground and held her hand out to you. Obediently, you climb onto her hand and surrender. She was already being strict, you didn't want to upset her anymore. \"You silly thing, you really should behave yourself.\" She scolded, though a smile was starting to creep onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes Miss Roxanne.\" You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I had hoped you would set a good example for the other students. I let you into the advanced classes, despite your size, because you seemed earnest and hard working. I thought your diligence would rub off on the other students.\" She spoke as she rose to her feet. \"And you started out that way, but you've been nothing but trouble for a while now.\" She playfully poked your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but, I've been struggling to focus lately is all.\" You mumble, not quite remembering how or why you had been running around. You were a little concerned too now, considering you were imagining yourself in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm. Well, I appreciate that. But you'll still have to be punished. I'll take it easy on you and just give you detention.\" Roxanne smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You're giving me detention!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You have to be disciplined, a have to be an impartial and strict teacher. But don't worry, I'm making this detention interesting. You'll be having...</span></div></div>",

They all walk past you as you dodge their feet. They go inside and its just you and the giantess. Well at least for a little while until she stared to head off herself. Not wanting to be left alone you react quickly. Running you up to her feet and grabbing on holding onto the nylon which hugged her legs all the way up to her thighs. You get taken for a ride as she steps repeatedly down the hallway. Each one almost making you fall off as you struggle to keep your hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could easily just drop off and find someone else but you want to stay with this girl. She seems nice to a degree and one that sticks to the rules. Meaning that she will most likely help you then not. That is if you manage to hold on during the entire ride. You could always jam yourself into her shoe but her feet honestly kind of scare you a bit. Knowing that they could smash you into the ground without much worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the girl made it to her destination as she enters a room. It was an empty classroom. One that looks like it was just in use. Figuring that she's gonna stay in here for a little while you jump off the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land as you see the girl sit down at the teachers desk and start organising things. Cleaning it as you see this as your chance. She's sitting down and this is your best bet no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to her chair as you yell to her side. \u201cHey, Miss down here!\u201d You wait a second before trying again. Screaming even harder as she still didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. As it looks right now your gonna have to climb her, but thats far to risky to do when she doesn't even know your there. If only there was another way to get her to notice you. And thats when you looked and realised that her shoe was off, and her nylon covered foot was sitting by itself complete unguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not want to go near it but this is your best bet. You run under the desk and under her seat, arriving at her giant foot as you become a lot more cautious. Knowing that if she just shifts slightly, she could trap you under her foot and snuff out your life, and during that she would be up top completely unaware of the small man who just died at her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down your fear you run upon and bite her big toe.

You look up to see Flannery; still not looking down. You continued your way towards your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a series of careful walks, you finally made it near the girl's red belt. At this point, she really does look like a mountain to you but that still won't stop you from giving up. As you were about to climb up her upper body, Flannery suddenly stood up from her seat and you quickly cling to her belt after you quickly lost your balance.

As she got inside, she picked up a red bag and leaves her tent.

Thankfully, it's less hot inside compared to the outside so maybe you could stay here a little longer. \"Alright, I'm finally here.\" you heard her say as you peek from inside the pocket. This looks to be some sort of mountainous area but what got your attention was a large pool of steaming hot water. \"Wait a minute, isn't this supposed to be the hot spring in Lavaridge Town?!\" you said to yourself. So this is where Flannery wants to go.

The only real challenge other then the woman gym leader who would be nothing compared to your strength, was that team magma was also sending a top grunt to steal this artifact. So you took the mission on, got packed and told your girlfriend not to worry you should be back in a few days top. With the arrangements made, you went off towards your mission. But in all the excitement you forgot your Pokemon at home base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived at your campsite to begin the mission, you notice that you left your Pokemon at home but figured that you probably wouldn't need them anyway. And so It became a bit late in the afternoon as you began to approach the gym. Looking around the perimeter you saw the staff of the gym going home and the gym leader starting her training in the battle area. This was the perfect time to break in you thought as you shot a grappling hook towards the gym. Once inside you snuck your way around, looking into each room for the artifact. To your luck you found the room and quickly went inside but to your surprise a magma female grunt drops down from the air vent in the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she gracefully grabs the artifact that was in the desk and puts it into some ray gun device. As she turns the woman sees you and then gives a smirk, \"... Well looks like we don't have to wait to see if this machine can do its job..\" The girl says this. And right before you can even question anything a blast of white light hits you. The next thing you know, your knocked out and the magma grunt leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours past and you wake up to the sounds of vibration and loud stomping noises. You begin the wake and notice that that the desk that was right in front of you is now gigantic. And right as you see that a colossal shoe is stomped right next to you. Leading your eyes up from that shoe you see the giant gym leader Winona standing above you. She walked over to her desk and sat down. She then open her desk drawer and notice that the artifact she was safe keeping has gone missing. \"Oh my.. where is it?? I gotta find it...\" Winona says this while frantically getting up to neatly search through her desk and other filling cabinets in the office room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you realize that you somehow shrunk, and now are in even bigger trouble then just lost your chance of acquiring the artifact. You think that if you leave now, there is no telling what kind of things outside of these walls could kill you, now that your so small.

Its looks like my Skarmory has earned itself a treat\" Winona says to herself.But with you being to busy with trying to get out of there you don't even here what she is saying till \"Go Skarmory, see that bug over there. It's all yours...\". After that is said you see the danger your in and try to pick up some speed. All the while the Skarmory charges itself over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant metal beak comes down right behind you, the vibration of the beak hitting the ground launch you slightly in the air. You were luckily enough not to fly into the Pokemon's mouth but instead landed on top of its beak which you grasp out to as tightly as one could. When Skarmory saw this it started to wave its beak up and down, trying to get you to fly up in the air so it could catch you in it's mouth. While this was going on Winona was getting on her hands and knees searching underneath a filing cabinet. But then a the moment happened where you could not hold on anymore and you were sent flying off of the beak. Again you were in luck as you were launched off the Bird Pokemon was shaking its head back and forth. This sent you right under the filing cabinet where Winona was searching under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkarmory then came charging after you, and in doing so the bird Pokemon hit Winona into a wall. As the Pokemon's giant beak appeared from right under the file cabinet entrance. It was chopping right in front of you, But had no way to reach you since the cabinet was to low to the ground and you were to far back under the filing cabinet for the Pokemon to reach you. Winona was kinda of angry at this point, just getting shoved against the wall and having a Pokemon who was being bested by a bug. She just said \"Ugh... I can't even deal with you right now Skarmory, Now return...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning her Pokemon Winona turns her attention towards you. She gets back on her hands and knees so she could just reach in under and grab you. She looks under and scans for you in the darkness and then suddenly you two make eye contact. \"There you are\" Winona says as she quickly and easily grabs you with her gloved hand. \"Now time to get a good look at the bug who somehow survived..\" as she says this her face is starting to come closer and closer to you as you hang there struggling in her strong grip. Winona's face become's a look of shocked as she see's that \"Your not a bug.... your a tiny man???\" She says. Winona then starts to loosen her grip slightly to allow you to just sit in her palm. And then Winona...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were feeling pretty lousy after a hard fought battle. You had traveled over from Slateport to Mossdeep city because of work, but you had a few days off after you finished your duties. You were a small time trainer, but had never battle very much because of your city. Slateport wasn't very close to any city with a Pok\u00e9mon gym and you never got into Pok\u00e9mon contests. Sometimes you'd go see one with a friend, but you never considered participating in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in Mossdeep for work gave you the perfect excuse to take a shot on a gym with your Pok\u00e9mon partners. You figured that you didn't have a very good chance at winning, but you wanted to have the experience anyways. You even had the luck of one of the gym leaders being absent! Usually the Mossdeep gym was run by a pair of young twins named Tate and Liza. Tate was apparently away on business for some unspecified reason and Liza was the only one present. You were surprised by how young she was, maybe it made you overconfident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Liza hardly seemed concerned. She even encouraged you to use both of your Pok\u00e9mon against her while she used one like normal. You thought that the advantage you had gave you a good chance to win. But you were dreadfully wrong. Liza's Lunatone wiped the floor with your duo of Pok\u00e9mon. They put up a good fight and got some good licks in, but you were hopeless at directing them. In the end they both ended up knocked out at the same time, while Liza's Lunatone stood strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza had tried to assure you that you had fought well considering it was your first big battle in a long time, but that didn't make you feel much better. She seemed to be able to tell that you were exhausted from the battle, so she let you rest in a private part of the gym. She even offered to have your Pok\u00e9mon delivered to a Pok\u00e9mon center, which you happily accepted. You had been sulking in the private room ever since, disappointed that you had grown cocky and let your Pok\u00e9mon down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really feels like it was my fault we lost.\" You laugh to yourself quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour musings are cut short when you hear the door to the room open. Looking up at the door, you quickly look down a bit as Liza entered the room. You were still a little shocked that such a small girl was a powerful gym leader. \"How are you doing, challenger?\" She asked you, a kind smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back, disappointment reflecting on your lips. \"I'm feeling alright. Still a bit disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza kind smile shrunk into a stern look. \"Why? You did perfectly fine for your first serious battle. I was impressed by the strength of your Pok\u00e9mon. They were raised well and seem very fond of you.\" She took a seat next to you, her feet just barely not reaching the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those two did really great. So I feel bad that I did so badly. It feels like it was my fault we lost. I didn't direct them well enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza laughed before looking at you sternly. \"I see. That explains why you are so upset by a good battle. You feel responsible for the defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Exactly, if I gave better instructions, they might've been able to almost beat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost isn't giving your Pok\u00e9mon enough credit.\" Liza's shoes slipped off her feet slightly, only be held off the floor by her toes. \"I think I know why you feel like your ability to command is lacking.\" She said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't battled much correct? You are mostly an everyman worker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of kid calls an office job 'everyman worker'?\" You thought to yourself, amused. \"Uh yeah. Never really got a chance to get into battling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you don't feel comfortable with giving instructions for battle. You haven't faced much adversity in you life.\" She paused briefly before hastily adding, \"A-adversity in battle mind you. Adversity in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click your tongue, unoffended by her wording. \"I guess that makes sense. It's too bad my Pok\u00e9mon are stuck with a trainer like me.\" You laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza laughed a bit as well before everything grew quite. Then she spoke again. \"I could help you with that you know.\" She said in what amounted to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask, not sure if you heard what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you put a bit more adversity in your life.\" Liza explains, slightly more confident. \"To help you lead your Pok\u00e9mon better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Liza for a moment, unsure how to respond. But the earnest look on her face and the fact that she was a young girl trying really hard to sound cool made the scenario feel endearing, so you agree to let her help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you agree, you hear a slap as Liza's shoes seem to snap back on her feet. \"E-excellent! I've been wanting to try this out for a while.\" She admitted, you having no idea what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to ask what she meant, but were stopped when you noticed that Liza was getting... bigger. Confused, you look at your hand and begin to panic when you notice a glowing aura around you. \"Wh-what's going on!?\" You shout at Liza as you reach eye level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a happy smile on her face as she watched you dwindle below her neckline. \"This is all part of your adversity training.\" She pronounced happily. \"And I wanted to see if my shrinking psychic was working yet.\" She mumbled that second part, quietly enough for you to not hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to get any more words out you watch as you dwindle to an absolutely puny size. The once small girl was now bigger than the Mossdeep space center! \"What exactly does your adversity training involve?\" You ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza smiled happily before explaining. \"In order to experience adversity you must see what other parts of life experiences. Think of it like living out the life of another being.\" She pulled her legs up onto the couch you two were and lowered her head closer to you. Her eyes sparkled with wonder at your miniscule size. \"Awww, this is cuter than I thought it would be.\" She cooed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now let me explain your first task. You must...\"</span></div></div>",

But since you were the size of an insect, you were afraid of what exactly she had in mind. The foot of the girl you once towered over probably towered over you now! But you had agreed to letting her help you, so you had no choice but to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I face the adversity of an insect exactly?\u201d You ask Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza opens her mouth to speak, but stops. \u2018I honestly didn\u2019t think that far.\u2019 She thought to herself. So she wouldn\u2019t look like a fool, she brought her finger to her chin and started rubbing back and forth, smiling at you to make it look like she wasn\u2019t frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer act was pretty convincing and you wanted to believe that she was examining you, trying to figure out which of her many ideas would be best. But the sound of her feet nervously coming on and off her heels made it hard to believe she wasn\u2019t completely calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza continued to look at you, her mind swirling with desperate thoughts. How could she sound cool and responsible when she had no idea!? If she was reckless, she could lose her gym license and without her the gym would be less interesting and less challenging. But Liza\u2019s nervous shoeplay actually gave her a quick and convincing idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling confidently, she turned around and looked at her feet. She quickly took off one of her shoes and took a moment to compose herself. \u201cOkay, I just got to look confident and the trainer will go along fine with this. Maybe he\u2019ll help make the gym famous when word gets out about my power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of her inner monologue, you wait with baited breath for Liza to turn around. You gasp loudly when you see that Liza one of her shoes in hand. You didn\u2019t like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, brave trainer, what do you see?\u201d Liza said presenting her shoe to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She didn\u2019t have to put it so close.\u2019 You thought, disheartened at the shoe\u2019s size. It was clear that there was plenty of space in the shoe for you, even if her foot was in with you. And you definitely could see signs of her wearing the shoe, especially around the toe section. \u2018I guess posing on your tip toes would cause that.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your shoe, Liza.\u201d You answer the girl\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and smiles. \u201cYes! That\u2019s right. Now\u2026 pretend you are a bug. Now what do you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look past the shoe and at Liza confused. \u201cA shoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza groaned and rolled her eyes. \u201cNo! Bugs don\u2019t know what shoes are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say. I\u2019ve never been a bug before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now you are the size of one, so roleplay a little.\u201d Liza said, not understanding how childish she sounded. \u201cI\u2019ll help you. What do humans use shoes for when they see a bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace hearing her question, not wanting to think about that at your current stature. \u201cUh, we step on them with shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza nodded eagerly. \u201cYes! And stepping on bugs\u2026\u201d She trailed off expecting you to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKills them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Good job my little pupil.\u201d Liza gave you a small clap, shoe still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m some kind of student now!? I thought this was a quick favor?\u2019 You groaned mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, as a bug, when you see my shoe you should be thinking \u2018death\u2019.\u201d Liza explained, trying to make her point at the expense of intimidating you. \u201cSame thing for me feet or even my toes. They are all death to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-great, that makes sense to me!\u201d You say exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her position, Liza slams one of her feet in front of you, startling you in the process. She also uses her hand to hold her demonstration shoe in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a bug, these two things are the greatest adversities of your life.\u201d As if to emphasize her words, her toes wiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The feet and shoe of a little girl. Bug\u2019s leading humiliating lives.\u2019 You moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want me to do? What\u2019s my training?\u201d You ask Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two courses that you can follow.\u201d Liza began, trying to sound cool. \u201cWhenever someone sees a bug, their first instinct is to squish it. I will play the role of the giant trying to stomp you, while you try to avoid my foot. No shoes of course\u2026 because I would crush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour second course if more difficult than even the normal life of an insect. I could dump you into my shoe and force you down all the way to the toe section. Then I would leave you and my shoes in this room alone for a while. Your mission would be to escape my shoe before I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second mission sounded a lot easier to you since you wouldn\u2019t have to directly worry about Liza until the time was up. But how much time would she give you to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Liza spoke, \u201cI will not specify how long you have. A bug would have no way to know so neither will you. It will be a reasonable time though. Plus my shoe is pretty small, it should be easy to get out.\u201d Liza laughed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer description of her shoe hurt you though. Small was not the word you thought of near her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, which of the paths laid before you will you chose?\u201d Liza giggled happily in her mind. \u2018That all sounded pretty good I think!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your choice?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sighed wearily. You really didn't want to chose either of Liza's trials, the whole experience was humiliating! Liza was so young but so massive compared to you that she was asking how you wanted to be tested against her feet! You were smaller than her foot and she was using it to put some adversity in your life. You could never tell anyone about this, not even your Pok\u00e9mon. You wanted to say no to Liza, ask her to grow you back, but you felt like you couldn't. She seemed so mature and serious about this that it was downright scary. Thankfully she had been generous so far, but you weren't sure if she'd take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Liza waited eagerly for your answer. As you remained silent, she got more and more nervous. 'Oh no, what if he says no? I can't force him to do this! Well I guess I could, but then I wouldn't be able to let him go ever. It might not be bad to have a little trainer in my shoe forever, but I would have to keep it a secret from Tate. He would be super mad about this.' She cringed internally, imagining what her brother would do. 'M-maybe I could shrink him too! He doesn't know that I've been practicing this type of psychic power. A brother in one shoe and a trainer in another could be nice, and then I could be a strong solo gym leader. Or maybe Tate would want to share? One week in his shoe and then one week in mine..' Liza shook her head. 'What am I talking about? I'm doing this to help a trainer grow, and test out how I've improved, nothing more. I just gotta focus on making this good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza's internal monologue gave you enough time to make your decision. \"Okay Liza, I made my choice.\" You take a deep breathe, astounded that you were about to agree to this. \"I want to try getting out of your shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yessss.' Liza thought happily. \"A wise choice. The time you spend alone in my shoe will... allow you to grasp your adversities more effectively. It should be a good experience for you.\" She said trying to keep up her wise teacher image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put me in your shoe please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza nodded eagerly. \"Okay, let's begin your trial.\" Trying to contain her excitement, she gingerly plucked you off of your seat and moved you to the entrance of her shoe. As she carefully stuffed you inside towards the toe section, a dreadful thought came into her head. 'Oh, I forgot that the assistants at the gym hadn't replaced my shoes. These were supposed to be washed and have the insoles replaced! Sorry trainer... but I guess this is more authentic.' Pushing aside her concern for you, she gently set you down in the toe section, unintentionally putting you in the worn spot of her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How long has she been wearing these?' You wonder to yourself as you feel the moist floor, clearly from the sweat that dripped off her toe. 'Hopefully the rest of the shoe isn't as... damp.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were occupied with your new environment, Liza was busy with her psychic energy outside of her shoe. She focused her mind on the entrance of her shoe and mumbled some unnecessary words. This was part of the trial that she didn't tell you about. She figured that escaping her shoe would be a pretty simple task, even for someone of your size. So to make it more challenging, she put an illusion on the entrance of her shoe. When you laid eyes on it, your mind and body would be flooded with an artificial experience. You would feel like you were going through your task as normal, but you would actually be standing in place. The illusion could only be broken by doing something that would cause great shock to you. Liza wasn't sure what that was, but she figured you could figure something out. With her work done, she addressed you at the toe section of her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my little bug trainer. I am going to put this shoe on the floor. I ask that you don't start moving until you hear the door to this room close. Of course there's nothing I can do to stop you, but please do as I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble to yourself, dissatisfied. \"I guess I can listen to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortable with just one shoe, Liza wiggled her foot out of her other shoe and kicked it away, under some nearby furniture. As she started to lower her shoe with you in it to the ground, she gave you a few more words of encouragement. \"Now don't be afraid brave bug. You can escape my shoe as long as you don't give up. You might have a great shock or two on your journey, but you can succeed as long as you persevere.\" With her last words, she set her shoe on the ground and walked out of the room, making sure to slam the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to go too far, Liza sat next to the door, her legs crossed together. \"Hopefully this will be as helpful to him as I think it will be. It would be a shame if he didn't get anything out of this. How long should I wait anyways?\" Liza scrunched her toes eagerly, wondering what she should do to pass some time. Glancing at her feet, she noticed that they were a bit dirty and rather sweaty. \"I guess I'll wash up a bit.\" She stood to her feet and moved to find a place to clean up. \"I don't think he deserves to deal with dirty feet and dirty shoes if he fails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were in Liza's shoe, still laughing at her final parting words. She sounded so serious about the whole thing that it was adorable. Even if she did sound mature, she was still adorable. Figuring you should work as fast as you can, you begin your trek to the opening of her shoe, slightly climbing out of the imprint of her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you able to break through the illusion and get out of her shoe before Liza gets back?</span></div></div>",

It was a little strange, but she seemed to legitimately want to help you be a better trainer, and you guess that\u2019s what was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Liza walked to the bathroom to try and clean up her bare feet, and she giggled to herself as she wiped her soles down. \u201cI wonder how he\u2019s handling against the illusion\u2026 I bet he hasn\u2019t even moved yet\u2026\u201d She giggled, imagining the trainer idly standing in the tip of her shoe, waiting for her to come back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 But of course he could always overcome the illusion like a strong trainer would\u2026 And if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll get to train him more! It\u2019s a win-win\u2026 I could think of tons more ways to help train him! I\u2019m sure wriggling around under my toes will put things into perspective\u201d She giggled, wiggling her toes as she cleaned them off. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get to keep him, and battle him against my toes every day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly realized that her thoughts were wrong, he was just a trainer who needed her help, she shouldn\u2019t take advantage of him like that. Even if it would be amazing. \u201cRiiiight\u2026\u201d She said, having cleaned both of her feet she looked at herself in the mirror and smiled. \u201cI should get back to him, I have a bug to sq\u2026 Train! A bug to train!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside her shoe, you were just how she envisioned you, helplessly standing in the front of her shoe. But you felt like you were just where her heel sat in the shoe normally. Calmly, you continued and started to climb the back of the shoe. On the edge of your hearing, you heard the door opening. She was coming, and you were right there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren\u2019t, and as Liza eagerly walked up to her shoe, something was off. It sounded muffled, but you were right there\u2026 \u201cAw, you didn\u2019t make it\u2026\u201d Liza\u2019s cute voice chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this was wrong\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear ran through your veins and your breath heightened, and suddenly you appeared in the tip of her shoe again. \u2018What!?\u2019 You thought, but you were there! This was wrong! You stood in shock as the earth shook beneath you as Liza\u2019s foot gently started to push into her shoe. What little light got into the shoe was quickly extinguished. \u201cI really hope you\u2019re not in there\u2026\u201d She lied, \u201cAnd if you are\u2026\u201d She giggled, \u201cYou\u2019d better be reaaady!\u201d Her toes wiggled around like the heads of a Hydreigon as they made their way towards you, seeming to hunger for you. Instinctively you backed away, only to fall back against the front of the shoe. There was nowhere to run, and all you could do was watch as the light faded. The warm presence of her foot washed over you as you were pinned to the front of her shoe by her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed that it could have been worse, you could be smothered by her toe, or trapped underneath her sole. Her big toe pushed you against the front of her shoe, covering your lower body while your upper body was pinned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza giggled and wriggled her toes around, feeling you pinned in the front of her shoe. \u201cLooks like you couldn\u2019t break the illusion, that means you should have tried harder.\u201d She scolded, pushing her toe as far into the front of her shoe as it would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and squirmed against the unstoppable force that was only a girl\u2019s big toe. This was utterly humiliating\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liza smiled happily as she swayed the shoe you were in side to side. She could feel you firmly pushed against her big toe. She made sure to stifle any delighted giggles that escaped her, she had to hide the fact that she was enjoying this. 'When I started learning this psychic ability, I wasn't too sure about it. But now I can say that it was totally worth it.' She thought gingerly, briefly scrunching her toes to let you get some breathing room. 'Not that he has much room anyways, he's... an honest trainer who let me try to help him grow. I gotta at least try to make this a little beneficial for him, even if it is really fun.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her shoe, you groan as Liza's big toe once again settles on you. \"From now on, I'm always going to check for bugs whenever I put my shoes on.\" As if hearing your words, Liza's toe pushes against you, further pushing you into the toe end of her shoe. As the giant appendage pushes into you, you notice something interesting about. \"Her toes are, agh, a lot cleaner than her shoe is.\" You say groaning when the toe crushed against you mid sentence. \"She must have cleaned them while I was... training. That's pretty nice, even though she stuck me in her shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her fill of enjoying you be trapped by her toes, Liza finally settled down. She let her foot drop to the ground and remain motionless, lightly pinning you against the end of her shoe. \"Hey, can you hear me in there? My foot might be muffling my voice, so signal if you can hear me. Just... scratch my toe or something.\" Liza frowned for a moment, did that sound responsible enough? She had to keep up the wise teacher image or else-.A scratching sensation on her big toe let her sigh and relief and forget her worries. \"Good, I'm glad you can hear me. We have some things to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to leave me in here.\" You groan, letting your head drop onto her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so... you failed your first adversity.\" Liza began, once again making everything up on the fly. \"But that's alright. There's no shame in failing a difficult task the first time you are required to do it. I don't think anyone could escape my shoe at your size on their first try.\" Her heart skipped a beat at the thought of others being in her shoe. What if she had a whole group of people in her shoes? One for each toe? The idea was both embarrassing and thrilling, being in charge of a group for once would be great! She quickly shook those thoughts from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't even aware of the illusion I put on the opening of my shoe.\" She felt another scratch on her toe as those words left her mouth. \"W-wait! I'm sorry for deceiving you, but it's all part of the lesson! Things will not always go as planned, obstacles you were never aware of can always present themselves without warning. And you honestly probably should have guessed I would do something like that. I mean, if I can shrink you with my powers, a little illusion wouldn't be much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frustrated sigh escapes you as you lean against the wall that was Liza's shoe. \"I guess she has a point. Her test was a little simple.\" You weren't sure why you convinced yourself of that, but you felt like you couldn't be mad at Liza. She meant well and everything she said continued to make sense. \"No wonder she's already a gym leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of any more irritated scratching gave Liza the confidence to keep going. \"I'm glad you understand. Now let's go over the results. You couldn't break my illusion and ended up squished between my big toe and the end of my shoe. If you were a bug you probably would've been a stain by now. I won't let anything like that happen, but you should receive a penalty for failing your first test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsn't being trapped inside of her shoe enough for now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after she finished speaking, you felt a tingling sensation across your body. Quietly, Liza's big toe scrunched away from you. Though you had room to move, the tingling sensation prevented you from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you did not get squished like a bug, I will have to give you a different penalty to make the adversity more difficult. And I have the perfect idea for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, the cramped space that was Liza's shoe began to grow bigger! What was once a cramped space slowly grew into a hall like space and then into a spacious room! And things only got bigger from there. You never thought you would miss the ability to scratch at a little girl's toe, but now you couldn't do that to protest to Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that you're super confused right now.\" You heard Liza clearly from outside. \"But this is the best way I can penalize you while keeping the theme of the trial. There's just one more tiny detail.\" There was a brief pause before Liza spoke again. \"Sorry, I didn't mean tiny in a taunting way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was wait to see what else Liza had planned for you. By now the toe you had once been close in size with was like a large building! The tingling sensation continued to wash over you even though you had stopped shrinking. To your horror, you felt your body begin to move! You weren't headed out of the shoe like you wanted, but were being dragged closer to Liza's toes! No... it wasn't her toes, you were being moved to the gap between her toes! You were tossed into the gap between Liza's big and second toe, the space acting like a vast canyon. \"Good luck brave trainer!\" Liza said in a cutesy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the world outside of her shoe, Liza finally let loose a giggle. She had just tossed a trainer into the space between her toes! The experience was absolutely surreal and she loved every second of it. \"I'm such a good mentor.\" Liza mused to herself, half kidding, half genuinely proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat dose Liza do as you have your perilous journey?</span></div></div>",

A sad, disappointed noise escaped Liza as she watched you scurry away. Gently she reached forwards and scooped you up in her hands. Feeling you struggling, she created a cage with her fingers, cutting off your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, her eyes clearly apologetic and spoke, no longer concerned with sounding cool. \u201cHey, please don\u2019t be afraid! I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m actually going to eat you! I\u2019m not a cannibal!\u201d Liza explained desperately. She hadn\u2019t thought you would react so badly to the start of her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the look on her face and hearing her speak made you realize that maybe you overreacted to what she had said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You nervously rub the back of your head. \u201cI guess I overreacted. I\u2019ll trust you, gym leader Liza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know, but adding the gym leader part made Liza really happy. Since she was pretty young and fought as a tag team with her brother, she didn\u2019t get much recognition as a gym leader. She understood it was weird, not even normal gym leaders were referred to that way, but she wanted to hear it once. It sounded more respectable in a strange way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as you know I don\u2019t mean harm. I just want to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \u201cOkay. So\u2026 how are you going to eat me without actually eating me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza, keeping you in her hands got up from her sitting position and made her way towards the exit. \u201cOkay, I just thought of this now but I think it will really help.\u201d She admitted honestly. She decided to stop trying to sound mature for now, she had to focus on her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving through the strange halls of her gym, she finally got to a new pair of doors. Hoping to keep you secure and comfortable, she pushed against it with her back and made her way inside. Inside you saw that there was a single table with a simple chair tucked under it.  On top of the table was a plate of food. A simple bowl of white rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza gently set you down on the table, next to the bowl of rice. \u201cOkay, so before I saw you, I had one of the workers prepare a snack for me. I know white rice is pretty boring but I like it.\u201d She stopped, noting she was blabbing, and continued. \u201cAnyways, I think this is the perfect scenario for your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the plate, you were confused about what Liza meant. She had just brought you to her snack. Was she going to have you watch her eat it? Close to her mouth maybe? You stare at the large bowl of rice, not certain how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you want me to watch you eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza bit her lip nervously and groaned. \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to eat the rice and you are going to\u2026 be inside of it.\u201d She mumbled that last part, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t going to eat me!\u201d You complain to Liza, ignoring your desire to run again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know and I won\u2019t!\u201d Liza answered defensively. \u201cBut you being in the rice while I eat it is the only way this will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and look at the bowl again, trying to convince yourself of Liza idea. But you can\u2019t. \u201cBut- you\u2019ll be eating me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza held a finger in front of you, telling you to hold on a second. She had to think of a good way to explain her plan to you. She didn\u2019t want to eat you but the way she explained it sounded like she did. Eventually she figured it out. \u201cI-I won\u2019t be swallowing you! You\u2019ll just be in my mouth while I eat the rice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now the pieces were starting to come together but you still had concerns. \u201cNot getting swallowed is good, but you\u2019d still chew me into pieces!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t! With each bite I\u2019m going to feel it on my tongue, tasting for you. If I feel you, then I\u2019ll give you time to get somewhere safe and observe from inside my mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly am I observing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not just observing, you are also experiencing the adversity of food.\u201d Liza explained, figuring trying to sound mature and cool now would help. \u201cWhile you\u2019re submerged in that rice, waiting for me to come in and eat it, you will understand anxiety. Then when I start eating the rice, you will understand fear as more and more of it is eaten away. Eventually being moved towards my salivating mouth and watching food go down my throat will give you a greater rush of fear. And then when you\u2019re inside of my mouth, watching the rice get chewed ans swallowed, you will be filled with adrenaline and a desire to survive! Fear, anxiety, and adrenaline are all important parts of Pok\u00e9mon battles. This will help you understand those emotions better; I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated to admit it, but somehow Liza\u2019s crazy idea made sense. The things she was saying sounded like they made sense and her confidence really sold it better. Your unwillingness from before falters before giving way. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go along with your idea. Just don\u2019t swallow or chew me please.\u201d You ask as you begin climbing into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza pumps her fists happily; she had convinced you to try her idea! \u201cAlright, I promise. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a picky eater. I might spit you out by mistake if you taste bad!\u201d She giggled cutely, making you a bit calmer about the whole thing. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll come back in in a minute. I can\u2019t make the experience feel real if I know where you are in the bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to protest but when you caught your breath to do so, you heard the door close. Groaning you continue your way into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Liza actually had a plan to make the experience truly authentic for you. \u201cI bet I could temporarily wipe my memories of the trainer in my rice. That would make the whole thing more effective! Oh, but if I don\u2019t remember him I could break my promise. And if he somehow caused the accident, I might not remember him in time to fix it. What should I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza scratched her head and paced back and forth for a while, debating her options. After a small debate, she made her decision\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to walk back into the kitchen until she spotted the bowl of rice, unaware of you presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a coincidence. I was getting hungry!\" Liza said happily as she licked her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down, chopsticks in hand, and began digging in. You were able to climb back to the surface of the rice, just as you saw a chunk of rice began to ascend towards of the young trainer's mouth as it disappears almost instantly. You decided to stay where you are to get it over with and sure enough, Liza's chopsticks began to dive towards you. Liza was right, you began to fell anxiety as you were brought towards her mouth. Her lips parted slowly as you were dropped into her maw with the rice. You felt her warm breath blown on you as you saw the last bit of rice vanished behind her tongue. You later felt a huge amount of fear and adrenaline rush through you. Liza began chewing the rice as you began to move to safety. Bits of rice were obliterated  from her pearly whites and at the same time, you almost backed up to the edge of her tongue. You stared down her throat as you almost became mesmerized by the sight, but you snapped out of it, remembering that you didn't want to be eaten. You manage to back away towards the tip of her tongue, only to be surprised attack<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"This piece of rice, why does it taste so good!?\" Liza thought to herself. She began sucking on you like a jawbreaker, moving you from cheek to cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM! Whatever it is, it's better than this rice!\" Liza smiled to herself. She then opened her mouth, revealing you to the outside. Her tongue continued to taste you body. Her breath became more humid, you could tell she was enjoying this too much. Finally, she closes her mouth with you inside and...... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liza continues to suck on you with increasing intensity, your body being coated in thick layers of saliva as she enjoyed your new and exotic flavor. A part of your adrenaline addled mind had started enjoying being treated like a piece of candy in the now dark cavern that was Liza\u2019s mouth. The rest of you distinctly remembered Liza\u2019a promise to NOT eat you and was getting increasingly worried that she had somehow forgotten about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the moans of contentment stopped, as did the sucking as Liza\u2019s tongue returned to its resting position in her mouth, with you laying in the middle, too exhausted by your ordeal to move. The vigorous tasting and sucking had devastated your clothes. Your shirt was gone entirely, having been weakened by the saliva and torn off at some point, while your shorts had mostly disappeared, revealing your plain black boxers underneath. Your shoes and socks had been left outside as Liza had determined they would taste bad and had stealthily teleported them off while you were carried by her, leaving you barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to catch your breath, too weak to call out to Liza, your fears were confirmed as the tongue lifted up and the whole of Liza\u2019s mouth tilted back, sending you straight towards the back of the throat, like any other piece of food to pass through the young Psychic\u2019s mouth. Any attempt to stop your inevitable descent was foiled by a combination of your pitiful strength and the slickness of her saliva covered tongue. Before you knew it, your body was caught headfirst in her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment that seemed to stretch on for eternity, as you sat on the precipice of no return, of being nothing but nutrition for the growing gym leader. No one would remember the challenger who had been defeated by one half of the Psychic gym leaders and had disappeared the next day. Liza obviously didn\u2019t remember you, as it so obviously seemed. And part of you... enjoyed this? Yes, the same part of you that felt inadequate to be a trainer, the same part that enjoyed being sucked on like a piece of candy wanted to disappear down her throat, past her collarbone, and into oblivion. The rest of you, too weak to protest, accepted your fate as a loud *GLUCK* and a final moan of contentment rang around your ears and you were pulled down past the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza took a second to breathe as the oddly large piece of rice slipped down her throat. She could feel it as it slid down and felt compelled to trace its path with her finger. Down, down, the lump disappearing behind her collar bone. She continued to trace the rice as it slid towards her stomach, the feeling being indescribable. A fuzzy part of her mind seemed to protest, but it was smothered under these amazing new feelings. She felt the rice slow as it approached the stomach ring and waited with baited breath for it to enter her stomach. \u201cSooo good!\u201d She thought. \u201cHurry up and get in my tummy! I can\u2019t wait anymore!\u201d Liza murmured to herself as she panted, a strange feeling building in the core of her body, getting stronger as the rice piece, or whatever it was, got closer to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey down the esophagus was far smoother and more pleasurable than you could\u2019ve ever believed it would\u2019ve been. The muscles massaging your entire body had been an amazing sensation, as had the gentle sound of Liza\u2019s heartbeat. It all had to come to an end though, as your head bumped what felt like a small, circular indent in the throat, \u201cher stomach ring!\u201d you realized, as your journey was about to come to an end. Around you, you could hear Liza\u2019s heartbeat speed up, as if in anticipation for what\u2019s coming next. Sure enough, the ring started to open and one last push from the esophagus sent you barreling face first into your new home with a thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Yes Yesyesyesyesyes!\u201d Liza chanted to herself as the most delicious piece of food to ever pass through her mouth finally dropped with a noticeable thump into her stomach. A shockwave suddenly shot through her body as she arched he back and opened her mouth, a silent scream passing through as her vision turned white. Liza\u2019s powers seemed to pulse through the room, lifting various things like her rice bowl and some pair of shoes and socks someone left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a moment, it was over. \u201cAhhhh... Soooo goood...\u201d Liza moaned to herself as she pat her belly, feeling more content than ever before. Not even catching her beloved Lunatone had compared to this! \u201cYou feel so yummy in my tummy Mr.rice!\u201d She giggled, feeling a bit childish after that amazing high. She frowned, as the fuzzy feeling from earlier started coming back, like she had forgotten something vitally important...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could take in your new surrounding, the stomach lurched, throwing you around as Liza\u2019s heartbeat reached a fever pitch and a load moan rocked your world. When the stomach settled enough for you to get your bearings, you realized that you had a surprising amount of room in the stomach, enough to stand up and even walk around a little. \u201cDid I shrink more without realizing it?\u201d you thought to yourself as you caressed the gently pulsing walls of your fleshy home, the stomach acids tickling your ankles. After walking a bit, you sat against the fleshy walls, closed your eyes and listened. Around you, the warm stomach pulsated and gurgled gently, the acids, (which didn\u2019t seem to burn as much as you thought they would) rocked back and forth, splashes sounding around you as more dripped from the walls and ceiling. The heartbeat had calmed down, along with the stomach, and resumed its gentle beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you had completely given up on returning outside. Liza very clearly thought of you as only food now, and you didn\u2019t really mind anymore. The sounds and sensations around you were making you feel things you never had before. Your boxers had dissolved a while ago, revealing your erection as your now obvious vore fetish manifested itself in full. So great was your arousment that a few mere strokes were enough to send you over the edge, causing you to white out temporarily as you hit peak levels of pleasure. Yes, you were content to disappear in Liza\u2019s tummy, to melt away into nothing but nutrients, like any other piece of food. That\u2019s all your were now anyway. Liza\u2019s stomach agreed, as the level of acids rose to your waist and the liquid stared to churn slightly. As you sighed in content, you wondered why the acids still didn\u2019t burn just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Liza held her head, as the fuzzy feeling got stronger, culminating into a sudden *ping* as her psychic memory wipe wore off, and a slowly growing dread replaced it as she realized what that delicious rice piece was. \u201cOh no... and I even told him that I wasn\u2019t a cannibal, but why did it feel so good then?\u201d Liza\u2019s thoughts were split. Unbelievably, she had enjoyed eating him, more than anything before, yet if she kept him in her tummy, he really would end up like any other piece of food. She had to make a choice, and soon...</span></div></div>",

Rather than fear, I can feel... happiness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza was so confused, what kind of person LIKED being eaten? Yet, that was all her psychic powers felt from you. Slowly, the dread began to melt away, slowly being replaced with a victorious smile, as feelings of happiness, satisfaction, and power replaced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo.... you really like being in my tummy that much Mr.rice?\u201d She giggled, no longer thinking of you as a person, just like you wanted. \u201cWell then, I\u2019ll make sure you stay there. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll send all your friends down with you!\u201d She rubbed her tummy as it gurgled happily around it\u2019s food. With that, she sat back down, all feelings of guilt gone, as there was nothing to feel guilty about eating food after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, your heart felt elated as you saw more rice fall in from the ceiling to join you. You had started to enjoy Liza\u2019s stomach so much, you were beginning to worry she might teleport you out. Worries assured, and your final fate confirmed, you reached down and pumped your rock-hard erection more vigorously than ever. The stomach walls seemed to shrink slightly, contorting around you and the rest of the rice. The walls began to rub against you with renewed vigor as the stomach got warmer, the acids now at your chest. The experience was overwhelming, as you indulged in the complete fulfillment of your hidden fetish, as well as Liza\u2019s new one. Before long, the acids filled the stomach as you came one last time, sighing in contentment as you disappeared below the pool of acids, never to resurface. Liza\u2019s little tummy continued to churn and mash away at its contents. Eventually, the acids drained into the small intestine, with no trace of the human that used to occupy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiza sighed, rubbing her tummy in content as she felt the last of you melt away, her body happily absorbing your nutrients. A small burp escaped Liza\u2019s mouth, one she didn\u2019t even try to cover as she kept giggling over the absolute power she had felt over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve discovered my new favorite food... heeheeheee... hah hah hah!\u201d Liza\u2019s giggles turned to laughter as her enjoyment reached new heights, her psychic powers letting her feel you as your nutrients spread across her body, her power growing as you were absorbed. Soon, a dangerous thought popped into her head... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder... if eating other psychic trainers would make me even MORE powerful...? Teeheehee!\u201d The now very carnivorous Liza happily skipped out of the kitchen, pausing only to casually throw a pair of shoes and socks away, the only proof left that you existed. Liza\u2019s skipping turned to levitating as she tested her newfound power. \u201cLook out bro, you and all the trainers in our gym will go a long way to granting me supreme power! Hahahaha!\u201d Liza cackled to herself as she headed straight for her gym, where she felt that her brother had just arrived. She couldn\u2019t wait to devour him too! She bet he would go well with some rice...</span></div></div>",

However, as you looked up to her eyes, it is not worry or compassion that you saw in them, but malicious amusement.It appears that your blind trust in the girl was ill placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess approached, one shocking step after another, you found yourself instinctively walking away from her, only to be blown back on your ass once one of her feet slammed right in front of you.

It looks like I've been blessed with a little dance partner! I wonder how well you can keep up with me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the giantess gracefully moved one of her legs forward, rising her foot over your little, frail self. With mouth agape you watched, as her smirking face disappeared behind the sweaty expanse of her sole, readying it for the merciless stomp she was about to deliver.<br>\r\n<i>She couldn't be serious</i>, you thought to yourself, while staring intensely into the fleshy expanse of her foot. You took note of her well-cared for sole, with every ridge and wrinkle only accentuating its perfect, as if manually crafted look. Even the occasional speck of dirt, or a drop of sweat served only to add to this beautiful, yet haunting image of your imminent, pathetic demise.<br>\r\nYou were silently hoping, praying that all of it was just a part of some sick, crappy joke. The giantess didn't seem to be in on it however, as her foot suddenly fell down, going in for the brutal kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeaky shriek you dove out of the way, barely managing to avoid her sole's crushing embrace. The cruel girl giggled maniacally, most amused by your sad display of defiance. Standing up, you came face to face with a set of her powerful toes, the giantess pounding the ground below with them, and imagining how delightful it would be to squeeze your form underneath her digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha~! I see there is some fight left in that scrawny body of yours.\" She said mockingly, making light of your dire predicament. Again you looked up to the sky, once more witnessing that malicious smirk on her face. It was clear you were nothing to her but a mere toy, a fleeting, disposable source of amusement. All you could do to survive was to play along, and pray for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again her foot rose above you, the giantess wriggling her toes in sickening anticipation. Coming loose from all that flailing, her footsweat came down raining all around you, further adding to your pessimistic outlook on your current situation. Though shaking all over, you've managed to steady yourself, and prepare for her next stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, little guy. The first step is always the hardest. It's all ought to be smooth sailing from here on out~\" She said with a grin, bringing her foot down upon you...</span></div></div>",

When you actually got in there you saw gym leaders, Pokemon coordinators and a bunch of high end business snobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial shock it went a little down hill after that. It was clear you didn't fit in, everyone you talked to could tell that as well. You had no idea about half of the things they were talking about and couldn't contribute. Whenever you weren't lost in a conversation you were wondering around the party like a complete goof. Your also pretty sure some of the snobbier people were laughing and making fun of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to leave the party, but stopped when someone asked you to dance. It was... It was Glacia. You'd never forget her older, elegant beauty. She looked amused at your antics. You two got to dancing, moving back and forth as she started a conversation with you. Almost instantly she could tell that you felt out of place and almost pinned down exactly what you were thinking. She was very kind and well... she spent the whole night with you. You couldn't believe she wanted to but you weren't gonna say no. She was so nice, trying to simplify for you and talk about topics you might share a common interest with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours you told her you were going to leave and you hugged her goodbye. Getting a sweet kiss on the cheek from her. Something that you couldn't help but blush at. She waved you goodbye and you went to leave, but first you just needed to go to the toilet. You went and quickly emptied the tank. And..... that was it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Present-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk that doesn't explain why you passed out, maybe you ate some bad food or something. Then again you doubt they wouldn't test it before hand. While thinking this the box started to shake and you panic, trying to hold on as you stumble around. The movement stopped and you breath a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the roof lifted up, light pouring in as you have to shield your eyes. The light eventually became easier to see through as you were amazed. Stunned at what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside the box.... was a giant ____________!!!</span></div></div>",

They're she saw you small form standing in the box up to her. And you could see her big beautiful face shocked at seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d Phoebe said, moving forward so you could see her too \u201cIts the guy from the party! I got him for you so you can keep him as a boyfriend! No need to thank me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlacia, regained her composure after a little while, giving you a warm smile which helped a bit. But then turned to Phoebe, from there you watch the two giantess\u2019s speak it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoebe dear, while i do appreciate the sentiment. You must know i can't take him\u201d Glacia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, come on. Have fun with him. He's like the only guy you liked at the party. Take him, i promise i won't tell\u201d Phoebe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you reverse this dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. i think i can\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, then do that for him. Bring him back to normal size, and give him some Pokedollars. As a way for saying sorry\u201d Glacia said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u201d Glacia said facing you in the box \u201cWhile i did have fun at the party, I'm afraid she took that the wrong way. I hope this doesn't strain our relationship in the future\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Of course not.\u201d You say back to her, glad she's being so understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you can have fun with him and if you try you'll might find that your-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Phoebe\u201d Glacia said sternly handing the box back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe just stood there, not liking how her plan just blew up in her face. She knows Glacia will be happy if she kept you. She's just got to be more open to that idea. And if she took the box she won't be able to give that chance. Which means she only has one plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe didn't waste anytime running away from Glacia. The young fit girl left the room and Glacia was wide eyed. Very immature, but typical for Phoebe. Walking to the door Glacia could see no sight of Phoebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't tell me she just...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm afraid so. Your most likely gonna be smaller for a little while. Is that all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I'm with you, its okay\u201d You tell her. She then suddenly brought her hand down to you. You could do nothing as Glacia reached in and very gently lifted you out. Now out of the box you were able to see the room. Im seemed to be a dark and tropical place? Phoebe\u2019s room most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, i promise you that ill find Phoebe and ill get her to reverse this. Might take a while but i promise\u201d Glacia said walking out of the room, and into the hallway. \u201cProblem is i haven't the faintest idea where she would go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Glacia go first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Earlier today, she and some close friends made a stupid bet where the loser has to do something that would have to be very weird for Friday thru Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can see, the schoolgirl has clearly lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stupid friends seemed to think that she has a major crush on that Kalosian ghost gym leader that lives in their home city. What utter nonsense! She just ..um..really like her fashion sense and stuff! But Anyway, they basically shrunk her by using their own pokemon and basically dumped the girl here all on her lonesome. Friends of the year I am right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing I can do about it right now.\" The girl dejectedly sighed as she just aimlessly wanders around. The sights of the massively scaled furniture are simply jarring and surreal. After while the girl finally decides to sit down on the floor, and relaxed for a while. As she began to comb her light chestnut-colored hair, it's awfully frizzy due to the heat out-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOOM!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOOM!</b>    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FOOM!</b> <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<b>FOOM!</b>    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive sounds that startle the girl right out of her self-grooming.She began to frantically look around in order to find who or <i>what</i> making the sounds. And soon she found the answer in the awe-inspiring form of Fantina coming to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kalosian has always been a quite tall woman and her stature has always been formidable to a lot of children like herself. But right now, she is nothing short of a monumental goddess, and the girl is a just puny little wretch in comparison. Instead of her trademark ballroom gown and heels, she is wearing a violet colored baby doll type of nightgown with a wine colored frilly peignoir over it. Her clothing greatly enhanced her modest cleavage and low-key sensual curves. Her <i>very</i> long hair id completely let down and was just naturally smooth as high-quality wurmple silk. The girl produced a red blush and look to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bont\u00e9 gracious! These past few days have certainly been balmy.\" Fantina softly groaned as she wipes the sweat off of her forehead. She gracefully walks toward a crimson reclining chair, with unwittingly showing off her impressively curvy legs and small but <b>plump</b> bottom to her unknown guest. The beauty sat on the comfy looking chair with a rather undignified plop, and with a big relaxed sigh. She pulls the lever downward and out came the footrest. The woman places her feet on it, and proceed to cross them. As this was happening, the girl absentmindedly moves closer to the woman. While she feels all hot and weird all the sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got near the footrest, she noticed the monolithic appendages that were Fantina's feet. Considering Fantina is a very tall lady, her size simply reflected this. The girl roughly reckons they are definitely above the size thirteen range and are in the upper teens. Their arches are pretty medium-sized, and the heels are fat and doughy. The soles are wide and plump, and her toes are long and slender. Her toes scrunched up and revealed the magenta colored toes that have red rose petals etched on them. She can show see the faintest droplets of sweat on the stupidly soft looking skin. And it looks like the toes are pointing directly at\u2026<i><u>her</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bonjour petite fille! Enjoying the view non?\" Fantina bubbly questioned at the beyond surprised and flustered girl. Her bare hand gently scooped the frozen solid girl up and placed her near her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-how did you noticed me?\" The girl hastily questioned. Her hands clasped each other elbows, in an attempt to calm herself. The scent of faint sweat and sweet rawst berries that was emitted from the woman's body were making the girl go internally wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sweet chouchous were acting awfully worried as if someone was intruding in their home,\" Fantina answered the lovesick girl and is surprised by the girl's courage. \"I thought nothing of it, and merely came in here to cool off, but then a little <i>tarte cutie</i> came to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe schoolgirl might not know what a \"tarte cutie\" is but the two words made her blush quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do me?\" The girl meekly questioned to the woman as she feels dread welling up in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't simply ignore the fact that you have intruded in my home.\" Fantina scolded like a stern mother. The girl began to fidget,bit the gym leader quickly began to gently stroke her head with her slender index finger in a comforting way. \"But fear not child! I would only make you repay me by giving me a service. It isn't in ma nature to do. any truly cruel and heartless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do you want me to do?\"The girl softly asked the woman. For her words calmed her quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hm, How about you..\"</span></div></div>",

The girl was about to make an \"oh\" face until two fingers gingerly grab her body, and placed her to her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's positively <i>gigantic</i> feet is relatively still. The girl's nose tickle as she smelt the surprising strong but sensual odor of sour vinegar and sharp cheese. There were hints of the fruity aroma of some hondew berries, but it's almost completely disappeared by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! If you do your task well then I will give you a special reward.\" Fantina softly cooed as her toes wiggled in such a welcoming way. \" And try to put some <i><b>amour</b></i> <br>\r\nIn your work.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot and bothered girl gulped as she knew the meaning of that word.

The foot gentle grinds her developing breasts and sending waves upon waves of amusement and new confusing feelings for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pardonne-moi, I was merely stretching. Hope I didn't scare you.~\" The girl just <i>knew</i> the woman wasn't truly apologizing, and she did this on purpose. In a stunning display of self-control, the girl gently pries herself off her feet and began to frantically press her hands against the pillowy sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, Ms.Fantina. no harm is done\" The girl shakily did her task. With every time she strokes the moist skin, her body shuddered. Every now and again, her body would shudder in semi-unwarranted pleasure. After a few minutes, the girl finishes and sat down.

Her eyes gleamed in understanding. \"Little one I know you have been smitten with me for a <i><b>long</b></i> time. And honestly, it warms mon heart greatly. And I know better than anyone that lying to yourself will only hurt you in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl offered no reply for Fantina as she stared downward.

And not only that but the Gym leader seems to be willing to go into her same fetishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardenia crouched down and lowered her hand closer to the small woman. Her large tree trunk fingers pinching her sides as she raises it off the ground. Gardenia could see the smaller girls eyes look at her feet, not wanting to get pulled away as Gardenia reassured her \u201cDon't worry, you'll have plenty of time with them lately. For now i want to get a closer look\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardenia pulled the catcher up and got a closer look. \u201cYou know, i think I'm going to be ok with this.

The smaller woman did what she was told and looked down. To her absolute joy she saw that with Gardenia\u2019s free hand was holding the open of her top. This let the bug catcher see the two giant mounds that Gardenia was hiding, as well as the light green bra holding them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd down you go\u201d Gardenia said with a huge smile of her own, she let her fingers go and watched the little girl fall right into her cleavage. Until she got stuck as far as she could go. It was great for both of the girls. Gardenia absolutely loved the feeling of her smaller friend in between her breasts and the tiny bug catcher loved being in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks you miss Gardenia!\u201d The Bug Trainer asked as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour very much welcome, but your not in fully yet\u201d Gardenia said to her. \u201cLet me help you with that\u201d Gardenia then lowered her finger down and pressed it on the young girls head. Making her sink fully and completely in between the breasts. Closing her top she felt the tiny girl struggle as Gardenia loved the feeling. Loved the feeling that her nipples were getting slightly hard from the tiny girl. Something she doesn't feel like she should share just yet. The favourable word being Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her the tiny girl was also getting herself very aroused. Which led to you guessed it her nipples being hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both girls being aroused at the situation, how will this story go and what fun is to be had?</span></div></div>",

Really weird cause she makes sure not to have anything around her training space. Very dangerous just in case she slips up or something. Maylene moved around out of her stance and raised her foot, seeing what she stepped on. It was too soft to be a rock but far to tough to be a rogue berry. She raised her foot and her eyes went wide as she saw that she was stepping on a small man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-\u201d She said in complete shock, however that quickly turned to panic as she knew that she just stepped on you. \u201cOh crap. Oh crap oh crap!\u201d Marlene got on her knees and scooped you up to her face. You weren't moving and you weren't talking. It was only after she raised her giant finger over your chest and felt your incredibly tiny heartbeat did she relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour still alive good, i thought you were done for\u201d She said to you, even though you couldn't respond. \u201cBut why would you be near my foot tiny guy... you should of known i was gonna step on you\u201d She said as she got back up. \u201cSuppose this means training is over for now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene went to her tent carrying you with both hands. She then dropped you down onto a small towel she prepared for herself to wipe the sweat off, however this was a far better use for it. Speaking of sweat you were covered in Maylene\u2019s. After stepping on you, you became drenched in the thing and she noticed. Using the towel to clean you slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaylene just looked at you until she grabbed your small and fragile arm. Pinching it between two fingers as she marveled at your size. Normally Maylenes the smallest one around... well compared to the rest of the big burly guys at her gym. Sure she's confident she can beat them all in a fight but it was always a bit annoying when everyones bigger then her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of your arm as it just flopped down, wondering what she's gonna do.

You weren't going to be cold anyway. The hot feeling of embarrassment running through you would keep you warm. Combine that with the many thoughts going through your head and you'll be lucky to sleep. Your thoughts are interrupted by a soft set of lips being planted on your head. M...m....Maylene?

Your body was so frostbitten that you feel like you got an ice beam straight from a legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time with adrenaline, you run closer to the fire. Not even bothering with the girl who was sitting around it. As you got closer you felt the warmth of the fire as you were beyond happy. Sure your still frozen beyond belief, but there was fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... hi?\u201d You heard the voice say, sitting right next to the fire was a giant girl! Staring right at you in shock. She defiantly didn't expect to see a small person walk closer. She was beautiful, a clear face and loving eyes. Her hair was sent in twin tails to either side and her black hair close. She was wearing just a white shirt, with her jumper wrapped around her was it. \u201cHow... how are you so small?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to answer back, but you were too cold... far too cold. All you could manage to do is shiver and give out chattered teeth. Something Candice saw and realised. \u201cOhh, let me try to help\u201d She then leaned forward and grabbed you. You were in her warm hands as she lifted you up. Closer to the burning fire. Her hands were warm, and you got a much better warmth from on hr hands then you did on the ground. The fire got to you as you welcomed it. You turn around and see the girl looking worried. Unable to say anything you gave a thumbs up to her, calming your saviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, just take the heat of the fire and don't stress yourself. if anyone knows how bad the snow can be, its me.\u201d She said with a smile \u201cSince you can't really talk right now, i suppose ill tell you about me. My name\u2019s Candice. Im the Gym Leader of Snowpoint City\u201d You looked at her in surprise, out of all the people you could find, your lucky it was a Gym Leader. \u201cI was out here training my Pokemon but i kind of went too long, and got stuck out here in the snow. Kind of stupid i know, but i know its stupider to move during the night. Especially with all the Sneasels around. Is that you were doing, moving at night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to her and rub your back, saying yes. Kind of embarrassed \u201cI thought so, your lucky a Sneasel didn't eat you. Your about the right size. Im curious as to why your here, but i think ill ask that when your warmer. I suppose your also curious how far away you were from town, only a couple of hours honestly. But like i said before, to risky to move at night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence, until finally you get on your knees and bow to her, thanking Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you don't need to do that, i wasn't gonna let you die out here in the snow\u201d Candice said nicely.</span></div></div>",

At least, if she couldn't grow you back, she could at least protect you from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice pondered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't travel back to Snowpoint, not at such dark hour when, like she already mentioned, she could be the local Sneasel's next victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how was she supposed to warm you up...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym leader finally had an idea... and blushed bright red; her gaze finally fell back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... listen, I think I've got a way to warm you up,\" she declared, her blush becoming more intense,<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be a bit... awkward, but I see no other way I could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decided you didn't care, as long as it saved your shrunken behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offered another nod, letting Candice know that you agreed with whatever was in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice nodded too as she made her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug was suddenly broken and the hand that held you began moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed at the giantess in front of you, noticing what she was up to...</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she slowed down as you started to feel a bit warm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while she would move around, maybe to feel if you were still there? Maybe to feel you out? Once she felt confident that you\u2019d warmed up enough, she lifted her behind off of you and reached down and gently pressed her fingers against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve warmed up.\u201d She said as her fingers wrapped around you and brought you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I uh\u2026 Thanks.\u201d You said, more than a little confused about what to say. She\u2019d undoubtedly just saved your life\u2026 By sitting on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d She said, beaming with delight, \u201cAnyone would have done the same in my place, you were freezing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure anyone else would sit on me like an egg,\u201d you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice laughed, her face flushing, \u201cWell\u2026 Uh, it got the job done.

Looks like I won!\" Iris cheered cheekily as she returned her Pok\u00e9mon to her pokeball. \"I'll admit though, you're really good despite your awkward prospective.\" She was referring to you of course. You were a unique trainer to say the least. An incident with a mischievous legendary Pok\u00e9mon had left you shrunken to an incredibly small size. You were so small that when your house Pok\u00e9mon, a friendly Mightyena, had almost swallowed you many times after she first dealt with your diminutive stature. Everyone had insisted that you give up on being a trainer, saying that it would be too dangerous for your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their protests, you were persistent in your goal of becoming a trainer and tried to tame some wild Pok\u00e9mon. The only reason you survived some of the encounters was because your small size made you an unappealing snack to the Pok\u00e9mon you foolishly confronted. Your hard work eventually paid off though because a kind hearted Ralts eventually took pity on you and agreed to be your partner. She would eventually grow into a towering Gardevior who was very eager to protect you. Although even she couldn't resist the temptation to occasionally toss you around in her mouth or keep you restrained in a hug. Regardless your bond was still strong and you hoped to challenge some gyms with her to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris, a relatively new gym leader was your first target. You thought her inexperience would make her the best bet for a win, but she had thoroughly smacked you and Gardevior. You sat on the ground in shame, embarrassed that you had let your partner be humiliated, when you felt a shadow be cast over you. You look up to see the smiling face of Iris, a glint of wonder present in her eyes. \"Oh don't feel bad cutie, you and your partner did really way. It was an honor to face someone new at the Gym scene like me.\" She said smiling warmly. \"Thank you.\" You reply simply. \"Luckily for you, I think I can arrange for you to get my badge anyways.\" Iris says, her voice becoming laced with mischief. You look up at her quizzically, raising your eyebrow to encourage her to elaborate. Her grin only becomes wider as she begins to explain...</span></div></div>",

How would you be able to earn a gym badge without doing something with your Pok\u00e9mon. You had heard about exceptions with gym battles before, but no one ever got a badge without using their Pok\u00e9mon as far as you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, what exactly does this special battle entail?\" You ask uncertain whether or not you want to know the answer. Iris' eager smile suddenly shrunk to a bemused grin. \"Well... before I tell you I have some things I need to confirm first.\" She says as her voice becomes more collected. \"Okay, shoot.\" You say eager to answer so you can hear what she has to say. \"Alright! There are only two questions that I need you to answer.\" Iris begins, excitement slightly etching back into her voice. \"First of all, what happened to your Gardevior and can you call her back at anytime? And second, do your parents currently know where you are? I can't be sure I'm allowed to do this until I know.\" She states simply. \"Well those are both easy. My Gardevoir automatically returns to the Pokemon Center whenver she is knocked out and can't get up and my parents... don't know where I am right now.\" You admit slightly guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they still leave in the next town over, so they're not very far if you would end up needing them.\" You insist, hoping that the knowledge your parents were still relatively close would convince her to let you try her challenge. For a moment you thought you saw a scary flash of eager mischief flash across Iris' face, but it was too quick for you to be sure. \"Oh! Well that's great then!\" Iris said very eagerly. \"Since you're parents are so close by... I think I can allow you to have a go at this special battle.\" Suddenly Iris' massive hand slams down behind you and begins pushing you towards the edge of the table. \"There's no time to waste! We need to start your challenge right away!\" She pleaded eagerly as she pushed you over the table's edge and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She reaches down to her pink shoe and pulled it off. Because she wears no sock your able to instantly see her big brown foot. It only took you a moment from this point on to understand what she is going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the shoe and places it near the table. Meaning if you fall back, instead of hitting the ground, your falling right into her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not pushing me in there, are you!\" you shout, a bit stricken with fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you want that Gym badge don't you\" she teases as her hand keeps pushing you back. Your at the Edge of the table so if you take a single step back, your falling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops moving her hand, wanting you to jump in their voluntarily. Her big grin growing bigger as you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I jump in there, will I get the Gym badge?\" hoping that it's all your going to have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you jump in there, you accept the Special Battle\" she replies. Great that means this is only step one for you. Deciding you can't put it off anymore you turn and jump into the shoe that was in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land onto the soft sole of the shoe. It was soft and cushioned which was nice. However the smell coming from it made it a terrible situation. It smells like a dump in here. You look at the toe section of the shoe, it looking like a dark damp cave. While when you looked up you saw the smiling excited face of Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, you actually accepted! I mean I probably would push you in there for laughs if you didn't, but anyway this is going to be so great. Are you ready for the greatest challenge you've ever faced in your entire life!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As ready as I ever be\" you say not sharing her excitement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Iris do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking out the entrance of the shoe, your face begins to pale slightly. Iris had already been massive before when you were on the table earlier. She had to squat down just to keep you at her neckline and her finger was bigger than your head! But now you were being reminded of how truly massive everything was compared to you. Truth be told it had been a long time since you were alone on the ground, so this was a re-learning experience for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenaline pumping through your veins made the short time it took for Iris to set down her shoe seem like eternity. Even after it settled on the ground, you were still to unnerved to pull yourself off of her sole. Your body awkwardly sunk into it, wetting your body with Iris' sweat. \"Aw! You look pretty cute in there!\" Iris cooed happily. \"Almost like a little bug in his house.\" Her words never reached your ears, you were to busy having a panic attack to hear them. Iris towered like a goddess above you! She was so big that her face loomed almost out of view and if you were registering her voice it would sound like the roars of her dragon Pok\u00e9mon. She wasn't just a goddess to you, she was bigger and more powerful than that! You would've prayed for Arceus to save you, but you were pretty sure she could snuff it out under her toe if it did come. Of course it would actually be bigger than you and her but that wasn't on your mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright it's time to reveal the details of your battle. Dun dun dun!\" Iris says dramatically, trying to make light of the situation. Her shoe and your world begins to shake again as her toes suddenly appear over the opening of the shoe and wiggle cheerily. Being so close to her feet, you notice some of the wrinkles in her feet and the sweat trapped in them. You would probably be joining them soon you thought. \"Your special battle involves spending some time in my shoe with my nice soft feet! Ha, I bet this is a lot easier than you expected huh?\" She said leaning closer and putting her finger to her cheek. \"Well you might be underestimating me if you think this will be easy. I happen to live a very active lifestyle beyond being a gym leader and you were my last opponent for the day before I could leave. Now you'll get to see what the rest of my days are like! ...At least the part that happens in my shoe. See ya later cutie!\" She says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words, your body reflexively sprung into action. You might have willed yourself to do this earlier, but the unfamiliar fear of being on the ground alone had overcome whatever sense of bravery you had developed before. You tried your best to scale the inside of the shoe and hop out before Iris got her foot inside. Fortunately for you, she was really taking her time putting her shoe on, probably trying to tease you a bit before your epic battle for survival. As you near the top of her shoe, you can see the light from outside her shoe and feel some of her sweat drop onto you before...</span></div></div>",

You feel yourself get taken to the front of her shoe as it gets darker as it gets farer from the opening. She brought her foot down as you get pinned down under the gym leader's toes. At least you were under them rather then under her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay we'll I'm going to go, you know. Important Gym Leader things to do and everything.

Luckily it wasn't that hot a day outside so Iris wasn't sweating at all. Maybe the time in her shoe wont be as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris was walking around the gym, smiling to herself at the feeling of you under her toes.

As weird as it was, you were finding the experience.... kinda sorta... pleasant. Maybe this trial won't be so bad after all. Iris was also enjoying this feeling. Feeling the tiny person's body pressed under her toes was definitely a surreal and empowering experience for her. She pondered the possibility of convincing you to stay with her after the trial was over. Heck, no one knows you're there, she could just keep you and tell no one. Though that would be mean. Though she definitely enjoyed playing with you, she didn't want to do anything too cruel... maybe. It was definitely a tempting thought. But for now, you had a trial to clear, and it was about time you earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were busy being rolled around by Iris' toes when you heard her speak up. \"Okay, enough warm-up. Let's get to the real trial. I'll try not to go too hard, but you'll still want to try your best to stay near the toes.\" Before you could ask her what she meant, you suddenly felt everything jerking around violently. You were flung to the toe end of the shoe before falling back to the thankfully soft ground below. Seconds later, her toes cam crashing down on top you you. Iris was careful not to put too much weight on you, but the weight was still overpowering. Without another second to waste you were flung to the back again as the process repeated. Iris had upped her pace to a brisk jog as she made her way out of town. The feeling of you inside her sole distracted her from the exercise as she kept pondering what else she could do with the toy sized trainer. She felt that there was plenty she could do to add to your \"special trial.\" Her mind then shifted to curiosity over how you were handling this. As she took another step down on top of you, she felt something around the toes. At first she wasn't sure but soon she realized that you were clinging to her toe for safety. She blushed slightly as a huge grin filled her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, you were clinging to the dragon master's toes for dear life as her pace seemed to speed up even more. Each step, while not enough to cause lasting harm, hit you with an enormous amount of pressure. You felt the air forced out of your lungs, forcing you to breathe in more of the cheesy air that was trapped in her shoe for so long. You slowly tried to make your way over to wedge yourself between the toes, hoping to avoid being stepped on again. This did not go unnoticed, Back outside, iris felt you shifting and squirming your way between her toes. She was tempted to force you back out, but decided to just give you a gentle squeeze before resuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jog went on for roughly another 20 minutes. By the time she got back, Your surroundings had gotten much warmer and a bit damper. Iris finally removed the foot from the dark prison, pulling you out as well as you seemed to stick to it. You heard laughter overhead as your eyes readjusted to the light. \"Great job down there. I was worried that i was going a little overboard, but you hung in there like a real champion.\" Hearing these words of encouragement you couldn't help but smile, despite what she just put you through. Maybe the impromptu trial Iris put you through was worth it after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That wasn't really what I expected.\" You explain to Iris as you stretch and try to forget about your experience inside the gym leader's shoe. Through your whole tiny life you never thought you'd end up in a stranger's shoe. Sure it had happened before with your family, but that's when you and your siblings were younger and brattier. Plus it only happened once, your parents were furious after they learned about that little incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris simply laughed in response. \"Yeah I'll admit I just kind of made it up. But it turned out fine! It actually felt pretty good too. Maybe I could find a way to make it an alternative to gym battles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of someone other than you being stuck in Iris' shoe was amusing and you figured it would certainly get her gym a lot of attention. \"I'm not sure if the league would allow that.\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris rests her chin against her hand and sighs. \"You're probably right. That's not that much of a challenge... there would have to be a bit more too it!\" She adds excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh. Did you just give some new ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would probably be hard to find someone else with my... condition too.\" You say trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but I still want to try some stuff out.\" Iris had a smirk on her face as she said this. Truthfully she had considered keeping you in her shoe and for herself. It would be pretty easy to cover up, and no one would've believed that a gym leader would trap a challenger in their shoe. The idea of a tiny person would be too unbelievable for anyone who hadn't seen it anyways. But she decided against it, she didn't want to be a kidnapper. Besides, she could just manipulate you without having to take over your life. A tiny boy like him probably wouldn't say no to what most girl's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Iris, I really shouldn't stay out too long. Honestly I shouldn't have done this at all, my family will be furious when they find out I tried this.\" You say trying to get Iris to sympathize with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You challenged me at your size without anyone knowing?\" Iris asked shocked. Knowing that gave Iris all the material she need to get you to do what she needed. \"Do you know how dangerous that is!\" She scolded you wagging her finger. \"It might've been okay if you had won the battle and had your Gardevior left to carry you home, but you lost! Imagine if I had just made you leave after that, how would you get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough nervously, realizing that she had a point. You just assumed your bond with your Pok\u00e9mon would win the battle for you, losing never crossed your mind. Even if you somehow got to a Pok\u00e9mon Center, would you even be able to get the Nurse's attention? You realized that Iris was actually being pretty responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a gym leader, I can't let you wander outside without supervision. We are supposed to be leaders of our communities, the people in the city are our responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm technically from out of town-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter, you live around my gym so you're my responsibility!\" Iris insisted. Noticing you were a bit anxious, she softened her voice a bit before adding, \"Just consider this part of the trial, once you're home I'll officially give you a badge in front of your family. Just think of it as an awesome way to show off!\" She brought her hand down in front of you and ordered you to hop on with a commanding tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately comply and hop on her hand, holding her finger for support. She brought you up towards her face and giving you a stern look all the while. Secretly, on the inside she was pretty happy. She had convincingly put herself in charge of you for a good amount of time. You were all hers for at least a few hours before getting you home safely. Surely she could have some fun with you before giving you back to your family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little guy, here's the plan.\" She announced to you with authority in her voice.</span></div></div>",

Taking care of your Pok\u00e9mon is the most important part of being a trainer. They aren't slaves and they're more than pets you take for a check up every now and then. They're partners who deserve all the respect and care you can give them. Trust me I know, my relationship with my Pok\u00e9mon wasn't very good until I proved I respected them and earned theirs. Right now Gardevior likes you, but that doesn't mean you can slack off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by how serious Iris was being. She really was trying to help you and set a good example as a gym leader. Stuffing challengers into her shoes for a jog aside, she did seem to be a model gym leader. At such a young age it was impressive and you felt compelled by her. \"Thank you so much Iris, you really are pretty cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris blushed in response. She had never been complimented like that before. Well not by someone close to her age at least, her old boss always encouraged her before he retired. Since then she'd mostly met people who didn't care about the gym leader and only wanted the badge. She never really had fans like the other gym leaders did. Elesa and Skyla had huge fan groups dedicated to her and Lenora was well respected by the other gym leaders and in other industries. Even that punk Roxie had a bunch of fans and her \"gym\" was her stupid rock club in some basement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I'm glad you noticed! I do have to set good examples for aspiring trainers like you.\" She said winking at you. \"Remember how important it is to bond with your Pok\u00e9mon and someday you'll be just like me. Now uh, where is Gardevior's pokeball?\" Truthfully Iris had been curious about that since you challenged her. She had no idea pokeballs could get so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh hold out your other hand I guess.\" You say to Iris. Her monolithic hand moves itself in front of you as you work on your belt. The single pokeball you had on your belt actually wasn't specially made for you, just a regular pokeball. Somehow they were able to shrink down to accommodate your special size. You were always concerned that somehow affected Gardevior, but she had never done anything to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" You say placing the pokeball as far on her hand as possible. You were only able to reach the middle of her fingers though and she gently rolled it the rest of the way to her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's so cute!\" Iris gushed happily. \"Such a teeny pokeball, I didn't know they could get this small.\" She maneuvered the ball between her pointer finger and thumb and squinted at it. \"Ha, is it polished? Kind of cute to think that big Gardevior stays in here. It's like her way of letting you be bigger for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but she used to stay outside of the ball and keep me all the time. Even as a Kirlia she barely listened, sometimes she tossed me in her mouth while she went about her day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Didn't your family get mad at her?\" Iris asked as she sized up the pokeball and put it in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I never told them about it.\" You admit blushing in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Were you scared that she'd do something to you?\" Iris asked as she put on a pair of socks with one hand. It was difficult for her do that and balance with you on her hand, and you felt shaky as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't want her to get in trouble. She was stuck with a little trainer like me, I don't blame her for wanting to keep me out of sight back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow and now she adores you enough to battle in a gym battle. Your relationship really improved.\" Iris complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply nodded your head and wait for Iris to finish getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iris slipped her feet into her shoe she gave you a sideways glance, \"You wanna hop in?\" She joked as she finished putting her shoes on. She brought you closer to her face and opened her mouth wide, extending her tongue outwards. \"Or maybe you want a trip down memory lane and want a trip in a cute girl's mouth?\" She finished with a giggle and started heading towards the exit, ready for a normal trip to the Poke Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were seriously considering her words. Iris had been pretty pleasant, and the idea of being dismissed by a giant did seem oddly nostalgic. You weren't aware that was exactly what Iris was trying to do. Do you want to give in and let her have some fun with you?</span></div></div>",

For some reason the idea sounded of being in her mouth or shoe sounded good, but you knew that you'd feel differently once inside. \"As tempting as that sounds, I think I'll have to pass.\" You answer Iris, trying to sound like you were joking. \"I don't want to give Gardevior any ideas by having you pull me out of your shoe or mouth in front of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris simply laughed. She could tell that you had thought about her offers, and that excited her a bit. If she was a bit more subtle and indirect with her suggestions, you might give in eventually. Slipping her shoes off a bit, the occasional toe wiggle, and deliberately obvious swallowing of food might be good motivators. And, of course, if you asked she would tease you a bit about it. That would have to wait a little for now, she had to get you to the Pok\u00e9mon Center.  There would be plenty of time for her subliminal messaging while you two waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Oh, I just realized that I can't really hold you out in the open.\" Iris explained as she closed the door of her gym behind her. \"Even a gym leader would raise a few eye brows if she was carrying a shrunken person in their hand. There's no way they'd know you were always like this. They'd think I shrunk you to make you my little toy.\" She said trying to get the idea into your head. She knew she shouldn't be too heavy handed about it, but this was too good a chance to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have put me in your shoe already, so they wouldn't be completely wrong.\" You joke to her as she sets you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but that was to earn your gym badge. It was totally legit and you agreed to it. Officer Jenny couldn't arrest me for that. Even if I was the shrinking terror they thought I was, she couldn't do anything about it. If she confronted me, I could shrink and keep her too. Then she could be my second little toy. One for each shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad that Iris had put you on her shoulder because you were blushing so hard that your face felt hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe...\" Iris continued, \"Maybe you too could share a shoe! If I made her small enough then you could both fit under a toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that would be something.\" You can't help but stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whichever one of you did a better job would get a reward. I'd shrink the worse toy smaller and make them the other toys servant. Imagine massaging a giant Jenny's foot while she gives my toes a little massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you saying that I would be the worse toy?\" You ask with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, not necessarily.\" Iris hummed, \"But I imagine you would enjoy that more than the alternative. Would you want a little Jenny serving you? To be the big one for once?\" She asked genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. It seems so unrealistic that I can't even picture it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same thing for having a mini trainer standing on my shoulder, but here we are.\" Iris said tapping you on the head without turning to look to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris simply returned her attention to her walk to the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Meanwhile, your mind swarmed with dirty thoughts. You realized that Iris was simply teasing you, but she was really good at it. It was like she was trying to brainwash you with thoughts of submission. You shake that thought out of your head. Iris was too nice to do something like that. If she wanted to keep you, she could do it whenever she wanted and she hadn't yet so you had no reason to suspect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

But she didn't make a move to do anything. She simply stared at you, a neutral expression on her face. You weren't certain but you thought you could see a smile vaguely present on her lips, fading and emerging at different times. You call up to her, asking if anything is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris doesn't even process your voice as she is lost in her thoughts. \"Wow, I can't believe how well that went. I was practically running by the end of the trial. He should've been trampled but he's perfectly fine. If he's that durable, he could be really fun to keep around.\" She could feel herself getting giddy at the idea. \"So many people I meet are bigger and more powerful than me. I've always been trying to catch up. Before this little guy, hardly anyone came to my gym and people who did though it would be an easy battle.\" Iris curled her toes slightly, reaching out at the sensation of you hanging onto them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get weirded out by Iris' lack of response and started waving and calling up to her. You were still unable to get her attention and toes started to wiggle as her train of thought continued. \"But him, this little guy is definitely weaker than me. He lost to me in battle, and he only survived being near my feet because he clung to them for dear life. I'm like a goddess to him! I could've made the trial harder, but I showed him mercy. Don't I deserve a little payment for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Iris began to rise to her full height, knowing what she planned to do. As Iris rose to her fulll height, the realization of your position in the world once again dawned upon you. This girl, despite the kindness she had shown you, was still akin to a goddess and you could only trust her word and pray that she would keep it. Looking at her face, you say a mischevious grin quickly transform into a kind one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said before, you did a great job down there inside of my shoe!\" She beamed proudly. \"Not anyone could do a trial like that you know? Only the strongest and most diligent people would be willing to endure a cute girl's shoe to earn a badge.\" Her words gave you encouragement again, and you slowly forgot that she was a towering goddess in size. Perhaps this was the start of a friendship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have great news for both of us! I've decided to call off our little trial and alter our deal.\" Iris said cheerfully. You felt your body tense in fear and shock. What did she mean by that? Had you done something wrong. You wrack your brain to try and think what could've gone wrong. And then you remember how you had clung to her toes during the trial. Was that not acceptable? Had that been cheating and now she wasn't giving you a badge? You asked her these questions and she simply laughed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no it's not anything like that! I could not be more proud of your performance in the trial! Now I know that you have what it takes.\" You ask her what she means by 'have what it takes' and she smiles. \"Well, to be my permanent servant! I can't be a goddess if I don't have a servant.\" Iris responds in a matter of fact tone. You couldn't believe what was happening. The sweet Iris you had known earlier had suddenly become a lunatic who thought she was a goddess!? You couldn't let her think like that and you immediately protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris simply stares at you with a smirk on her face. \"Aw, that's cute how you're trying to deny that you love this.\" She says coyly. \"Don't act like this hasn't crossed your mind at some point. I saw the way your Pok\u00e9mon coddles you, how much you love it. This has been a dream of yours for a while now I bet. You didn't have to accept the trial inside of my shoe. I could've thought of something else. But you agreed so easily and then, during the trial, you clung to my toes like a security blanket. You love being at my mercy, you love being a tiny little toy for me to use as I please. I'm just trying to fulfill both of our wishes. You know I'll be a loving goddess, you just need to admit how much you'll love being my servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words left her mouth, you felt some emotion stir up inside of you. A feeling that you couldn't deny. You pause to think on this emotion and then you realize something...</span></div></div>",

Most of your Pok\u00e9mon have gotten used to their new owner pretty quickly. In fact you wondered if they even knew where their diminished original trainer was this whole time. Reguardless, they all served Iris well and she took great care of them in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were still feeling a bit weird and uncertain about this new arrangement in your life. Despite your stature, you had freedom, a semi-normal life ahead of you. Now you were property of the dark skinned dragon goddess. Your life belonging to her whims. For the most part, iris had you serve her feet, rubbing them, kissing them, staying inside her shoe when she exercises or accepts gym challengers. She did occasionally have you serve other parts of her godlike form, but seeing you at her feet seems to amuse her the most. It was what truly made the upcoming gym leader feel like a goddess deserving of worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis week however was differant. Iris finally decided to let your... HER new Gardevoir discover the fate of her old trainer... sorry, that would be her new pet now. At first iris simply let Gardevoir hug you, she probably did miss you after a few weeks of vanishing suddenly. But then she started to encourage the green haired creature. Helps her realize that you were no longer her trainer. The first day was innocent enough. But as the week went on, Iris continued these little sessions, making your former guardians more and more open to the idea that you now belong to Gardevoir rather than the other way around. The whole role reversal in your relationship made things feel even weirder for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris however was loving every second of it. She declared the Gardevoir to be your secondary owner after herself, and even pondered if any of your other Pokemon would be fun for such a position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday as you woke up, you saw Iris beaming down at her tiny servant. \u201cExcited for a big day? I hope you are.\u201d She said as she moved on to her plans with you.</span></div></div>",

You get up and face her. Stretching your body and preparing for the rigurious work your gonna get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother day with your feet?\u201d You ask her while you do some stretches, Iris loves seeing you do this and she's often requests it.

Since I'm big i can know, since your small you cant\u201d Iris said as you groan. That was by far the worst part of this entire thing. Not the being enslaved to a giant girl who loves putting you with her feet, no surprisingly your okay with that part. Its the fact that she constantly puts you down and tries to belittle you. You've had this happen all your life though but coming from Iris is just the worse. \u201cAnyway, like i said I've got big plans for today. But first i think we should eat up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat\u201d You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and today, I've decided that I'm not gonna feed you puffins. Your gonna get actual food. Am i not the nicest or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReal food. Every since Iris has made you her property she's just feed you pokemon puffins. Sure you got used to the taste but you cant help but miss real food. \u201cYes you are Goddess Iris. Yes you are!\u201d You say smitten as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know i am, now I'm going to go grab the food, i want you to stay here and get ready. Because you wont sit around in my shoe like you do most days. No this day is gonna be action packed.\u201d She said dropping you onto her bed and getting up, looking down at you before smiling. \u201cIll be right back you little cutie\u201d She said before going, your left by yourself for sometime doing as she ordered and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough you've gotten more fit ever since you've been with Iris. Maybe from all the protein puffins or the fact that your constantly working with Iris. Regardless she's liked that you've gotten into shape and your happy that your impressing her.

Maybe something like bacon or eggs? You were glad that you were going to get something other than puffins, but the sogginess of the cereal really only reminded you of Iris' foot sweat. She probably thought that too and that was why she chose cereal. ...No she probably just chose something quick and easy, not everything about Iris revolves around her feet. Well that was true for her at least, you were a special case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as Iris' rear came barreling towards you. She did feel the need to look for you when she sat down. It was your concern avoiding getting smothered under her rear, not hers. You desperately dive out of the way, just barely getting out of the way before Iris' massive (to you) rear came crashing down. As you caught your breath, you looked up to see Iris smiling at you mischievously, already eating the cereal. \"Well, well looks like your pervy antics almost backfired on you. Of course I don't really blame you. You're used to being under my beautiful form, you probably feel uncomfortable not being beneath me.\" She said coyly before slowly bringing another spoonful of cereal up to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously watched Iris bring the cereal into her mouth and close her lips around them. Lately you'd begun to had dreams about Iris becoming a goddess for the whole world and not just you. Everyone, including the family you once knew, were specks before Iris and she did to them what she did to you on a grander scale. Cities were her foot rests, mountains were her chair, and the people were nothing but tiny foot servants. And the people outside of the cities were livestock waiting to be swallowed by Iris. In reality that spoon was full of cereal but in your dreams tonight it would be filled with dozens if not hundreds of tiny people being sacrificed to a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, tiny guy.\" You were snapped back to reality by Iris' voice. \"Quit having pervy thoughts and listen to what I have to say.\" Iris said before swallowing her latest bite of food. \"I thought you were just giving me some breakfast?\" You asked in response. \"Have I ever made anything simple for you?\" She asked wagging her finger at you. \"What do you want me to do?\" You sighed, unwilling to put effort into questioning her. Iris smiled cheerily, an ironic appearance for someone taunting a shrunken human she kept as a pet. \"It's simple really! I'm gonna lower my spoon to you and you climb in. I'll drop you into my bowl and you can eat whatever cereal you grab.\" You groan to yourself, half in annoyance and half In terror. \"But if I'm in there while you're eating, then you'll scoop me up and swallow me!\" You protest. Iris' smile simply grew. \"Well of course! You can't try and take a cute dragon's food without risking becoming it.\" She explained as if it was common knowledge... and did she just refer to herself as a cute dragon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just give me the breakfast you said you would?\" You begged. Iris brought her finger to her chin and hummed to herself. \"Well...\" she started after a brief pause, \"if you don't do the challenge I won't give you any of this cereal, but if you check inside my slippers you could probably find some crumbs you could eat. It's your choice little guy.\" She said lowering her spoon next to you. Will you jump in her spoon or scavenge around in her slippers for crumbs that might not be there?</span></div></div>",

If she heard you say that she would make it much worse. And you don't want that. \u201cFine! Lower the spoon.... ill climb in\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris smirked down at you, Tilting her spoon to get all the contents off she lowered it down onto the bed. You were small, but the Spoon was still a hard platform to stand on, mainly cause of the wet floor. Once you were on completely Iris lifted her spoon back into the air. You've been picked up before, but normally theres a grip to hold you. Whether that was her fingers or her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected it to stop at the top of the bowl, but instead it kept going up, until you were right in front of Iris\u2019s lips. And even worse she licked them. \u201cNo Goddess, please don't!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I'm the kind of Goddess to play with her food, it would be boring if i just ate you now\u201d She told you. \u201cBut just so you know i could totally do it\u201d She demonstrated this by opening her mouth wide. Letting you see right inside. Her pearly white teeth, her wiggling tongue and the inside of her mouth. One line of Saliva trailing from the top of her mouth to her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes as you act quickly, jumping off you didn't wait for her to lower you down. This is actually people food! You cant wait! You land in the bowl and due to your size it wasn't a hard impact. Making sure to avoid the hard bowl or the soggy cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you landed you got to it. Swimming towards one you lay into it. Eating it, and it was just as good as you remember. \u201cOh wow I've missed you\u201d You say with a mouth full. Eating cereal, drinking milk and treading water isn't an easy thing to do. But your too determined to quit. You keep going, you were so into eating that you almost didn't realise the giant spoon shark coming from the side. Seeing it you quickly backstroke away. The spoon grabs the cereal, surrounding cereal and the milk around. You watch as it gets lifted up to where you were just before, going into Iris\u2019s mouth as she swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her eat cereal here was a lot more intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... pretty good, but i cant help but feel it was missing something? But what could it be? Oh thats right! You!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris brought her spoon down and this time aimed for you, you acted quickly and kept swimming away. The spoon swoops up a few more obstacles as she lifts it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you realised Iris\u2019s true intentions. She never wanted to reward you with Cereal. No she wanted to mess with you. She probably schemed to drop you in her cereal in her sleep. You wouldn't put it pass your dark skinned goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm coming again\u201d Iris said in a sing song pattern as she reached down again.<br>\r\n\u2028What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe she was only trying to give you a scare earlier, or maybe she\u2019s planning something. You had no clue.

Before you could ask what was happening the tongue shot out and started licking around your body. Before you knew it, the tongue grabbed your tiny form and pulled it inside. Iris savored the taste of you covered in milk and bits of food. Gently licking and sucking what she could off of you. You panicked as you felt random prodding and pressure in complete darkness but to your surprise you were soon spat back out into the awaiting palm of your goddess. \u201cThat was fun. You lasted a lot longer than I was expecting.\u201d She said in her carefree and cheerful tone. You were still a bit shaken, though you wanted to glare up at her for treating that whole ordeal so lightly, it was probably for the best that you couldn\u2019t right then since she was actually in a very good mood with you. \u201cSince you did so well, why not have a few pieces of the cereal. No tricks this time I promise.\u201d You were initially skeptical, but true to her word, the dark fingers soon dropped a few pieces of the puffy cereal before you. They were a bit soggy by now, but compared to the poffins you were usually fed it was still a treat. Iris giggled as you devoured your share. \u201cOh, I guess someone was hungry. Well I hope you had your fill. We have a huge day ahead of us.\u201d You looked up as you wiped bits of food off your face, curious what she had in mind. Iris was difficult to read sometimes. Sometimes she could be incredibly nice and sweet to you. Other times she would spend hours demeaning You for her amusement. \u201cI told one of the trainers to close the gym today, so we have the whole day to ourselves.\u201d With that she got started with her big plans.</span></div></div>",

So you were a bit surprised when the dragon master moved you back to the familiar position on the ground between her bare feet. Looking back and forth, you saw the part of your owner that you were most frequently assigned to. You didn\u2019t exactly mind this fate (though you were reluctant to openly show that to Iris or else she\u2019d tease you even more). You watched the toes wiggle as she seemed to be preparing something. Looking up you awaited her command. But Iris remained silent. Were you missing something? She never spoke since she placed you on the floor. But it turns out that your inaction was the wrong choice. <br>\r\n\u201cMore than a minute and you still haven\u2019t moved. I thought by now you\u2019d get to work without having to be told.\u201d Iris said in mock annoyance. You tried to explain yourself but Iris neither listened nor cared. In all honestly this was just part of her game. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to give you a crash course in keeping me happy. Quite literally in this case.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that her right foot lifted up and over you. Not wasting another second with begging you quickly dived out of the way just as it fell down to where you were seconds ago. Iris simply giggled as she raised it again. You dodged again, but it was clear that she was only toying with you and while seeing you flee was cute, right now she wanted to see her toy squirm. The foot moved about with lightning fast speeds. You almost couldn\u2019t keep track of where it was going before suddenly you felt it on top of you, pinning you onto your back. \u201cThere we go, that\u2019s much better.\u201d She shifted the foot back a bit so that your head was sticking out between her toes. \u201cNow let\u2019s get started on the actual event.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But that didn't happen. Instead Iris got out of bed and rose to her full height, looking down on you like the day she first shoved you in her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit something my precious bug,\" she began with her chipper voice, \"When I decided to keep you that day, this arrangement wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her confused, unsure about what was wrong with the situation on her end. You had been serving her diligently since the day she took you and you had thought you'd done well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris simply giggled in response. \"Don't worry! You've done a great job as my little bug! But that's kind of what the problem is.\" Okay now you were really confused. \"When I decided to keep you I thought of you as my little boy toy. And you've been a lot more of a 'toy' than a boy. And while I do love that so much, I kind of want to spice things up a bit. Little toys exist only for the people that play with them; that's what you've been. But boys, even the little ones like you, want something for their hard work. And I've decided to give you a bit of a break. After all, a boy toy is only good as long as he keeps the boy part.\" She ends with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on your bed, your mouth hanging open slightly. You're not really sure what she just said, the dragoness' thoughts followed their own logic that was beyond yours but you did understand part of it. Apparently she wanted a bit of change and to reward you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you goddess, I'm so glad you've decided to reward me!\" You thank her enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a half smile. \"Sure, I think you've kind of earned something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise off her bed sheets and get ready to make your request. \"Okay goddess I'd like you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I didn't say that you chose your reward.\" Iris cuts you off with a wag of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't chose your reward? How does that make sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my speech was a bit confusing for you. Just because I'm trying to make you less of a toy, that doesn't mean you're suddenly not my boy toy. I'm still in charge and I'm just giving you something that should satisfy the boy side of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris smirks and turns around, showing off her massive (to you) rear. \"I know little boys like you go crazy for a girl's butt, so you're going to spend some time in their today!\" She punctuated her sentence by slapping her butt. \"It's not as adorable as having you in my shoe, but I'm sure even someone as obsessed with my feet as you are will loving being in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush furiously, causing Iris to laugh when she turns around. You hadn't really thought about being near Iris' like that before, you had only ever really known her feet. Spending so much time with her rear would be a completely different experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say something, but Iris simply yanks you from her bed between two fingers and holds you over her outstretched pants. \"I hope you appreciate my generosity! Go ahead and struggle while you're in their if you want. Show me that you're more boy than toy. Bye bye!\" She finishes dropping you into the darkness of the back of her pants. She lets go of the mouth of her pants and with a snap your forced against her right cheek as she walks out the door. She misses your presence as she slips on her shoes, but she enjoyed feeling you under her butt as she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow are you going to struggle and show a bit of defiance? Or are you a good toy who will stay still and enjoy the ride?</span></div></div>",

You struggled against the gigantic butt hoping to prove... something to Iris and yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris giggled as she felt your movements, your squirms doing little more than tickling the dark skinned goddess you called your owner. Your struggles both amused and pleased Iris. As futile as it was, Iris was definitely glad to see that her boy toy had some fight in him. She considered doing something to put a stop to your squirming, a fun reminder of the power she held over you as if you needed more of those. But instead she just sat there and enjoyed your movement. Within the five minutes this went on, you didn\u2019t  even manage to move an inch from your starting position. Your struggles did not slow or stop, but they were still ultimately proving to be ineffective. Though Iris certainly appreciated your dedication. Perhaps she will reward her toy later.

Iris gave a little frown as if it was supposed to be obvious what you were going to go through today. \u201cObviously you\u2019re going to serve gardevoir her exactly the same way you serve me every day!\u201d She said, gaining back her gleeful demeanour. \u201cCome on garde, show the slave what I mean!\u201d She said, gaining a twisted look of evil on her face. Gardevoir simply continued to stare at you, not showing any sign of emotion whatsoever. \u201cCome on gardevoir! Do what I showed you!\u201d Iris said, stomping her foot down hard on the ground next to you, gesturing for gardevoir to do the same. You look at your old friend one more time, her expression remains stagnant, but she starts to move. She lifts her elegant leg out of her dress... blanket thing and raised her foot above you, just as sweaty and dirty as iris\u2019s usually were. Wait, was her foot always this humanoid? You could have sworn it wasn\u2019t. \u201cThis isprobably just an illusion made with her psychic power!\u201d Is what you were thinking before a drop of her sweat dripped down onto your face, having the same salty and warm taste to it you had gotten used to. \u201cDefinitely not an illusion...\u201d you say to yourself as you spit out the unexpected foot sweat and loon back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright slave! You have fun with goddess 2 for a while! Have fun you guys!\u201d She said happily, then she skipped off out the door of the house and left just the two of you alone.

I need to get out of here, this is way worse then I thought...\u201d you say to yourself quietly. You look back up at your gardevoir, who still had her sweaty foot raised high above you and try to get through to her. \u201cPlease gardevoir! It\u2019s me! We grew up together, we\u2019re best friends! You need to help me out of here!\u201d You yell up to her, hoping she\u2019d remember the friendship you two had formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your statement, and a long pause.

Gardevoir slammed her foot down, you prepared for the impact but it never came. \u201cHuh?\u201d You say, as you open your eyes back up and look at her. She had slammed her foot down next to you, looking like she was going to cry. \u201cGar-gardevoir!\u201d She yelled at you, tears running down her cheeks as she kneeled down and grabbed you in her soft hands \u201cGar-garde!\u201d She said to you, rubbing you against her face, still crying.

Upon hearing that, she immediately and carefully lowered you to the ground, and sat down so she could see you better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVoir-voir!\u201d She says to you in her Pok\u00e9mon dialect. Now, to anybody else, this would have just been nonsense, but after knowing her for so long, you could just about understand what she was saying.

You were shrunk for a few weeks now and spent most of your time keeping hidden and finding food and shelter. You didn't trust anyone while in this state. Who could blame ya? Show yourself to the wrong person and it could spell the end of you. You figured you'd be much better off on your own and somehow you've made it work. You were resting in an abandoned building, trying to stay out of the rain. You figured noone would bother you in there, but the sudden loud noises suggest otherwise. As your ears painfully adjusted to the rapid-fire assault, you soon recognized it as music. Or to be more specific, someone practicing with an electric guitar. Covering your ears you peeked around and saw a lone girl practicing. She looked like your typical rocker type person. Messy white hair styled into a ponytail, loose fitting blue and magenta striped shirt which almost covers up her hands, long black, knee-high boots, and.... no visible pants. You assumed that she had some shorts being covered up by her oversized shirt, but you never know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be in her own world as performed hands moving quickly to hit her notes and her loudly belting out some lyrics that you honestly couldn't hear over the guitar. You figured it might be best to find your way out and locate a new form of shelter when you tripped over a cord. Suddenly the music stopped and the girl let out a confused \"Huh?\" Turns out that cord was providing power to her amp and speakers and you just managed to knock it out of the socket. \"Shit!\" you thought as you tried to get back to your feet, hearing the punk giant approaching to investigate. You had to get out of there NOW! </span></div></div>",

Granted there wasn\u2019t a lot of dirt, but running around in boots and thick socks all day certainly gave it a powerful odor. You recoiled almost reflexively as the smell hit you. Thankfully this didn\u2019t offend your new self proclaimed landlady. She was hoping for such a reaction. It would make what came next a lot more fun for her. \u201cSince these dogs here aren\u2019t gentle in the slightest, I\u2019d say your first priority should be getting on their good side. Maybe if they like you, they\u2019ll show some mercy later.\u201d Of course Roxie had no actual intention of doing any serious harm to you.

Still, she knew the things she\u2019d have to say to put the fear of God into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Roxie lifted both of her bare up on an angle, revealing her sore and sweaty soles to you. A sudden rush of hot air escaped from the underside of her feet, hitting you almost immediately with a hot and humid gust. \u201cAfter such a long day, these boys down there could use some good ol\u2019 TLC.\u201d You were practically frozen in place, fighting a rush of mixed feelings ranging from how cute she was to how utterly terrified you were of the gigantic punk girl. \u201cOh and clean them off while your down there. I\u2019d offer you a rag or something, but you have such a perfectly good tongue that will do just fine.\u201d Your face turned pale and grim as she said this. Just standing near them was hard enough on your senses, but she expects you to press your tongue against the source and subject yourself to a whole new level of hell. \u201cYou better get started fast. They\u2019re not the most patient couple and miiight get a bit aggressive if you keep them waiting.\u201d Roxie said with a menacing grin, savoring the power she had over another person.

What the hell is Roxie gonna do to you now, since you just yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaha, oh man\u201d Roxie said laughing, throwing you around on her stomach \u201cI had a feeling you had some fire in there. Finally letting it out. Now I'm gonna tell you this, the fact that you don't want to be here is honestly the thing i like. I want to have fun with you at your expense. I want to sit on, i want to tease you. I want to make your life a living hell here under your new \u2018landlord.\u2019 So punk, what I'm saying is... whether you like it or not your staying\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and stop brown nosing, its weird\u201d Roxie added just at the end \u201cYou got something to say, say it. If you don't have the stones to say it, stay quiet. Ok\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without taking a moment to look back, you begin sprinting away from the giant rocker. If you were lucky, she wouldn\u2019t notice you running away and just assume she was rocking so hard that she yanked the cord out herself. \u201cHey.\u201d You heard the voice from moments ago. \u201cNot cool dude.\u201d Well those hopes were out the window so you started to sprint even harder than you did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected to feel the giantess\u2019 thundering footsteps and to run face first into her boots any moment now. But neither of those things happened. Instead you heard a loud thud behind you, quickly followed by a dull tap against a wall. The giantess sighed, slightly angry but mostly sounding irritated. The telltale sound of a cord being plugged into an amp sparked through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely processed this information though, considering you were preoccupied trying to run for your life. The giantess spared you only a sideways glance as she looked over the amp settings. \u201cDude\u2019s so slow that he probably didn\u2019t have time to mess with the settings.\u201d She concluded seeing how long it was taking you to make distance between you and her. Curiously, she lifted her heavy boot and stomped on the ground hard. The sensation made you trip slightly and increase your speed again when you recovered. The sight caused her to snicker. \u201cI know these are some heavy boots, but they aren\u2019t that bad. He\u2019s probably flippin\u2019 out so badly right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie\u2019s assumption was spot on. You continued to dash relentlessly towards the place you had made your home the past few weeks. It was a crummy little hole in the wall, but you\u2019ve made it a bit nicer on the inside. It was part of a waist high wall (well if you were normal size), so it was self contained and no rattatas or other small things could unexpectedly crawl into it. It was the safest place you could stay in and you were glad you had found it. Now you had to hope it would protect you from a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Roxie, she missed the amusing sight of you dramatically diving into the whole. She likely would have laughed out loud had she seen you crash onto your face. Though she guessed something along those lines happened when she saw you frantically crawl into your whole on your stomach. \u201cEither he got really lucky \u2018running from me\u2019\u201d She sarcastically added air quotes, \u201cor that\u2019s where he\u2019s been living. Who\u2019d have thought I had a tiny dude hanging out in my practice studio.\u201d  She chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of your home, you tried to catch your breath after you had sprinted faster than you thought possible for yourself. Your attempts to steady your breathing were difficult when you were thinking about the vengeful giantess probably stomping around your home, waiting for her chance to grab you. For her part, Roxie had strummed a few chords on her bass guitar to make sure the sound was still properly going through her amp. She doubted that you had managed to damage it, but she was always one to make certain that things were working right. Satisfied that everything was working fine, she set her guitar against the wall once more and made her way towards your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of doing something less startling like knocking, Roxie kicked the spot near the entrance hole, unintentionally knocking you to the ground. \u201cHey, dude, I saw you run in there. What\u2019s your deal?\u201d You naturally didn\u2019t answer her, Roxie sighed. \u201cNot comin\u2019 out huh? I can just wait you out ya know. Or I could just plug your little hole and keep you trapped in there.\u201d Smugly, Roxie leaned against the waist high wall, though without her boots on it would probably be taller than that for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally you didn\u2019t come out of your home, too terrified of the situation to do it willingly. Roxie\u2019s taunting and vague threats did not help you to calm down and trust her either. Cautiously, you try to peer outside of the hole. You didn\u2019t dare risk poking your head out, less you risk getting it plucked off or stomped flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed without you coming out Roxie huffed irritably, annoyed by your refusal to come out. \u201cDude, you know I\u2019m just screwin\u2019 around right? I\u2019m not mad at you or anything. If I were, I actually would\u2019ve chased you while you were running.\u201d She still didn\u2019t get any response from you. Even if she was telling the truth (which she was), you were too nervous to come out for her. You had been shrunken for a few weeks without any humans nearby. This titanic girl was the scariest thing you had seen over the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her irritation rose, Roxie began to drum her fingers against the top of the wall. \u201cCome on, you just accidentally yanked out the power cord. You probably just tripped over it. It\u2019s nothing for me to be mad about or for you to be worried about\u2026 so come out!\u201d The last part of her sentence came out as an angry growl, clearly showing her frustration. Her growl betrayed the laid back and forgiving image she was trying to show off, so you refuse to come out of hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie could only grit her teeth and sigh. \u201cAlright, so I guess we\u2019re going to play the waiting game. If that\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna be, then I\u2019ll keep coming up with ideas about why you\u2019re here.\u201d Roxie said smugly. She planned on making up a bunch of stories, hoping one would get your attention and have you come out. Or she\u2019d annoy you so much you surrender, that\u2019d work too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me start with the easiest one I can think of. You're totally a fan of mine! Like a super hardcore fan. I doubt you\u2019re naturally that small, so you\u2019re one of those eccentric fans that Elesa always talks about.\u201d Roxie laughed excitedly. \u201cI bet she\u2019s never had a guy shrink himself just to spy on her. I\u2019ll have to tell her to eat her heart out later. She thinks she\u2019s so popular, but she\u2019s got no one like you in her fan club.\u201d A red tinge washed onto Roxie\u2019s cheeks, having a fan like that would be pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder why you\u2019d shrink yourself though? I figure stalking would be enough for a super fan. You already figured out where my practice studio is, why\u2019d you feel the need to shrink yourself too? Oh man! Maybe you\u2019re a perv? You wanted to get a good look at me while I was practicing and getting a little sweaty. Or maybe\u2026 you enjoy being tiny.\u201d She spoke in a teasing voice now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you want to be tiny around me and enjoy every part of me on a whole nother level! Oh man, just imagine how awesome my voice and moves would look at your size. I\u2019d be like a goddess of rock! Not to mention all the fun I could have with you personally. I\u2019d imagine any fan of a celeb would looooove to be pressed against their big, soft lips. Or maybe you just want to get close to these bad boys.\u201d She said tapping the toe of her boot against the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about fans like that, Elesa and Skyla both complain about it. But I don\u2019t mind. If you want people to love you, let them love every part of you. They do get pretty sweaty, if a fan wants to be small and help clean them I wouldn\u2019t complain. Hell, I\u2019d let em be in their during a concert. Give them a seat even closer to my show than the front row.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie went on speaking for a while, going on and on with the teasing and the stories of how you got here. All of her talk had gotten to you and you were starting to blush. It\u2019d be more accurate to say that you were a tomato at this point though. You didn\u2019t really know who this girl was, but the way she was talking was starting to make you a fan of hers. Maybe you should let her grab you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Coincidentally, you ended up just outside the Nimbasa City gym, which doubled as fashion show most days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you wandered the halls backstage, finding it to be a much better idea than trying to find help in the crowds watching the fashion show. You had almost got stepped on by various models multiple times, but you had to admit that you were enjoying the view more often than not. But it was a little hard to grab someone\u2019s attention when they were walking past in the dark confined hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, one of the doors to a makeup room was open. Naturally, excited that you might have a chance to find someone to help you, you quickly entered the room. Much to your surprise, it belonged to the Nimbasa\u2019s famous Gym Leader: Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gawked at the superstar looking at a mirror in the small room, the door was suddenly kicked shut behind you. \u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Elesa gently said in surprise, looking at the door that had been slammed. She hadn\u2019t remembered leaving the door cracked, but she was much more surprised by what had just entered her room. Wordlessly, she slid out of her chair and approached you with a confused expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026\u201d You timidly said, as the model crouched down and approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Tiny?\u201d She said, holding her hand a few inches away from you, not sure if she should touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I uh\u2026 don\u2019t know how I ended up like this\u2026\u201d You said, struggling to stay composed as the gym leader\u2019s light blue eyes stared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you!\u201d She enthusiastically said, gently picking you up and holding you in front of her perfect face. You felt lost in the incredible detail of her gorgeous eyes that your small stature allowed. \u201c...But fiiirst, you\u2019ll have to help me!\u201d She said, sitting up on her haunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d You said, snapping out of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve been having trouble deciding what I should wear for the fashion show today\u2026\u201d She thoughtfully started, \u201cMaybe you can help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d You said, seeing no reason why you shouldn\u2019t help the beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, sweetie!\u201d She said, standing up and carrying you over to her makeup station. \u201cNow stay put, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She said, before dancing over to her changing room. Uncomfortably, you looked around the room before she came back into the room wearing one of her new outfits: yellow/blue shorts, top, an extended version of her headset that pointed up like ears, and an intricate yellow fluffy coat (B2/W2 Design). She hopped right in front of you, twirled around and throwing her hands into the hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Uh\u2026 You look amazing!\u201d You said, really unsure of what to say. She looked beautiful in her casual clothes, she looked beautiful in this outfit, and you were confident that she would look just as lovely no matter what she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She said, before quickly hopping back into the changing room before you could comment further. Before long, she burst back into the room wearing an old outfit of hers consisting of high heels, dark leggings, a striped half open sleeveless top, and a sleeveless yellow top that framed her undershirt. She must have been wearing a wig, that matched the yellow of her clothes, and a similar headset, but instead of the \u2018ears\u2019, she had wires dangling down nearly to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgily, she walked up in front of you on her heels and stood over you with her hands on her hips. \u201cWell\u2026?\u201d She said, smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Amazing\u2026\u201d You said, awed at the blonde beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, okay.\u201d She said, before turning back to the changing room. She tried on several more outfits, exhausting almost every non-embarrassing compliment that you could think of. Eventually, standing in the last out of outfits she wanted to try, which seemed to be an electric version of Skyla\u2019s outfit. \u201cOkay\u2026 So which outfit do you like the most?!\u201d She excitedly said, leaning down over you\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every time I model this I feel like I'm drawing attention to all the hardworking people who put their love and care into making quality products, not just the fashion designers and workers in he fashion industry, but the farmers as well,  it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\" She hugged her body and pressed her face into the soft wool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed like this for a while before releasing the coat and letting her arms drop.<br>\r\n\"Look at me,I'm starting to get sentimental,\" Elesa sniffed. \"Alright, I think I'll go with this one today Here you go bud, for all your help you get a front row ticket to the show!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully picks you up off the floor and places you into her coat pocket. The wool was rather easy to climb so you had a perfect view of the runway. You couldn't believe that you were about to go on a runway walk with a literal supermodel.

Well worse seat actually. You may be close to one of the models, but you could not actually see anything. Not that you minded in the long run, you just love being there. You hear music start, one that you would say was for the models. An announcer no doubt, and suddenly Elesa was strutting. Guess the star of the show should go first, and knowing what type of girl this was, she will probably also go last. So you get comfy in the flurry pocket. Laying down and relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, it was over. Elesa said goodbye to all the girls, as she then headed over into the room. The one where she took you first. She walked right in with a bottle of water, drinking it as it was nice. With that out of the way, she can help you like she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t going to be easy though, given your size. You are so small, and she has no idea how this happened. Thinking about it for a while, she eventually decided on not worrying about it. One step at a time, no doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to her makeup chair as she reached into her pocket. Sitting down and bringing you to her face.<br>\r\n\u2028It was a nice sight, amazing really. When she sent you her smile as well, that almost made you faint there. \u201cHello there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... nice work. Seems like the crowd was really into you out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did mostly come for me.\u201d She said taking the compliment \u201cWhen i am out there. It\u2019s my stage, and the world loves me.\u201d She said as she smiled, opening the corner of her eye as she looked at you. Seeing if you were impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t argue there you are really... anyway, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d She said quickly, that surprised you \u201cWhat were you going to say. Just then, what were you going to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... you were... beautiful.\u201d You reply to her as that was something she wanted to hear. She wore a smile. She has gotten this compliment more than any other gym leader in the world, in fact more than Cynthia as well. The woman that made her change the colour of her hair. Those flows she has, it was impossible to compete. Instead of being seen as an inferior version, she changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell good to know!\u201d She said happily with a swooning smile. She brought you forward and dropped you down. She dropped you down and placed you on the table as she talked. \u201cSo here is what i was thinking little guy, i can\u2019t help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thought not. Shrinking isn\u2019t very common. Even the Pokemon that could use Minimise can\u2019t do it on others. As well those Dynamax Pokemon. They can\u2019t shrink and use it on others so... i am lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, i\u2019ve traveled all over this Pokemon world, and i have never seen something like you. But hey, that makes you one of a kind.\u201d She said as you blush a bit. Turning back as it was amazing to hear that from her. Those simple words stunned you. \u201cSo anyway what to do with you. If you want, and i am assuming you want. You can stay with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay, with you?\u201d You question as you think about that only for a second. Just to appreciate this \u201cYes! Of course yes!\u201d You say back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, although i\u2019m not sure how. Maybe as my pet.\u201d She giggled, making a joke as you thought about this for a while. Why did you even consider that. Well she was that beautiful, she was a model after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t want to be a hinderance.\u201d You say to her \u201cI mean, you no doubt make enough money but... being this size it is a big responsibility. I can\u2019t really do anything by myself. I will need you with me for basically everything that i do. That\u2019s a lot, are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it for a second, putting her hand to her chin as she wondered. \u201cWell, it does sound like a lot, but i do think i can handle it. In fact, i am actually looking forward to it. Not only because of how cute you are, but because of what you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the cute remark, then you thought about the other part. \u201cOkay, what am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA boy!\u201d She said \u201cAnd a handsome one at that. I can test small clothes on you. See what works in private and what doesn\u2019t. This way, we can get some models to wear the clothes. Of course yours would be doll sized, but still it\u2019s genius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... glad I can help, but... when you say this, do you mean boy clothes or girl clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course boy clothes... but now that i think about it, you wearing a dress would be quite the sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid i just put that idea in your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, you did.\u201d She said with a beautiful giggle. You lay down for a while, seeing this as you suppose it was nice. You are with her, not for a little while but seemingly until the foreseeable future. Elesa is really being so nice to you, you feel like you need to offer her something in return. Not money since you have none.

You were flung backwards at dizzying speeds, tumbling the whole way before hitting a hard surface with a rather rough landing. Thankfully the wind died down. Half your body must have been aching, but at least that was over. Thank goodness you didn't harm yourself when you crashed into this... this.... oh no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a better look at the surface you crashed into you saw that it wasn't some natural structure like a rock or plant, but rather a gigantic blue boot. Looking up further you saw that this, clearly female, giant wasn't the slightest bit ashamed of her body as her choice of clothes really seemed to show off as much skin as she legally could in public. Her short shorts left most of her slightly tanned legs exposed. Above that a long sleeve top which showed from her waist up to just below her breasts while large straps held everything down. In her gloved hands was a pokeball, possibly holding the source of the windstorms from before. Looking up higher you saw her face, First off the giant had dark red hair with some sort of hair decoration that looked kinda like a flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, this titaness was looking...</span></div></div>",

Her hand knocked you against the pack in the dim light, instinctively you grabbed onto it as she quickly pulled it into the air. You clung on for dear life as the pack slammed against what you could only assume was skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin seemed soft and warm, but the impact made your grip on her bag slip, and you were falling until you managed to grab onto the back of her shorts.

After several close encounters with the wildlife earlier, even a mean giant seemed preferable to being alone in the wilderness in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer you were finally able to make out more of your possible savior. From a distance, you could tell that the giant was apparently female, and that she was wearing a cute purple dress with long black stockings and... some weird... thing at her collar. The silhouette almost made it look like a cat's face. As you got even closer you could make out her facial features, with her fairly short purple hair and her large circular glasses. She actually looked pretty cute, even though she was probably the size of a building to you. At the very least she appeared friendly, though you knew better to judge a book by its cover. Speaking of which, she seemed to be writing something into a book she was holding. She seemed pretty focused on whatever it was she was writing. Hopefully you can still get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached the camp without incident. Good thing too. You swear you heard something rustling the plants nearby, but whatever it was, it seemed afraid to pursue you so close to the writer girl. Now you were right next to the giant. While you had a good idea of what she looked like from before, seeing her features up close and clearly was really something else. Though she was focused on whatever she had written,she didn't appear to be writing anything as much as she was poking the page with her pen. Writer's block. You certainly knew that feeling. As you neared her pink shoes, you tried calling up to the woman, hoping she could hear your voice at this size. At first she didn't seem to respond, but after a few more calls she started looking around curiously. Finally she looked down and spotted something that managed to surprise her. She blinked a  few times, unsure if you were real. Suddenly her smile perked up. \"This is perfect. This is exactly the muse I needed for this story.\" Okay, not exactly the reaction you were expecting. She must really take her writing seriously.

It's possible you don't even understand what that means, so wipe that from your mind; it is of no concern.\" Without warning, the giantess scooped you up in her hands bringing you closer to her face.

Well of course you did, you were right by me when I said it. But you're still quite clever for putting two and two together. Yes, I believe that you were a servant in life. Judging by your clothing, you lived in modern times, how tragic it is that it seems to have been cut short! I can also assume that you weren't a real servant. You were something more civilized like a butler or attendant, perhaps one who was in training. Regardless, you lived your life helping or serving others.\" She concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what makes you think that, exactly?\" You ask, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess adjusted her glasses and looked to the side, smiling slyly. \"Don't take offense to what I'm about to say, but I came to that conclusion through your timid body language. The way you were fidgeting nervously at my movements was adorably inexperienced. You seemed very uncomfortable with the situation, but you weren't desperate like a person reduced in size would be. Your nervous movements reminded me of someone who served or waited on others. Now, with that knowledge in mind, I can help you overcome whatever regrets keep you tethered to our world.

I must admit that a foot rub sounds good right now, but would a task like that really be what held you out of the afterlife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I hate to say this, but you aren't even slightly correct.\" You tell the purple haired giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her to squeak in surprise. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, really. I'll admit that I'm calmer than I probably should be at my size, but I guarantee that I'm not a spirit or dead. I have nervous body language because I'm trying to get the attention of a giant woman, who's shoe is big enough for me to walk into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're not the spirit of a dead servant apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not.\" You reply deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess once again looked to the side, this time a hue of red embarrassment was on her cheeks. \"Ugh, and I thought I had just discovered something amazing. It was really going to be a break through with my writer's block!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" She sighed. \"I came here to make a scary story, and then you gave me ideas for a dramatic quest for the afterlife, now this is playing out more like a comedy. I'm not in the mood to write one of those, do you think you could play along with my idea for now. It truly was helping me get over a nasty case of writer's block. Just a little bit of pretending to be a lost spirit should get me through it. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted you to pretend to be a lost spirit of a young man who happened to have been training to be a butler? This had to be a very bad case of writer's block! \"I guess I can play along. Just as long as you promise you'll help me after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded. \"Of course! I'll do all I can to help you later, thank you for playing along. I won't make you endure anything too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what does that me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll spare you any of the theatrics I had planned when I thought you were a spirit.\" She spoke as you felt her hands move beneath you. You flinch and fall back in shock as one hand stops cupping you and moves out of sight. \"Now let's get down to business. You'll be going...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then my precious phantom inspiration, you will be going into my shoe. Your temporary tomb while I write.\u201d The purple haired woman spoke to you calmly. You could feel her trying to tug off one of her flats.  It was clearly difficult to do so when she was on her knees and holding you in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in there!\u201d You protest to the giantess. When you agreed to pretend to be a spirit of a deceased servant boy, this was not what you had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said\u2026 you would help.\u201d The giantess paused between parts of her sentence, her attention split between you and trying to remove one of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that would involve acting dramatically like you were, not getting dumped into your shoe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take good care of my feet you know. There\u2019s no need to be nervous.\u201d She reasoned, completely missing your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue! I don\u2019t want to-\u201d You were interrupted by a groan from the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh, hold that thought. I just have to\u2026\u201d Without warning, the gentle palm you were on changed into a constricting fist that held you fully in its grasp. Through the tight confines of her hand, you could feel the giantess shift her position. As she moved, so did you, and you were quickly deposited onto a wooden surface. It seems as if she had settled back on the log she was previously sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we are!\u201d The giantess said happily as her foot slipped out of one of her dainty flats. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just telling you miss that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, my little phantom, you can call me by my first name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your name.\u201d You say flatly. Neither of you had the chance to introduce yourself before you had been roped into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my! How rude of me for failing to introduce myself. I was so caught up in my excitement I must have forgotten. My name is Shauntal, it\u2019s a pleasure to be working with you.\u201d She smiled sweetly, making her look rather cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to say the same Shauntal, you seem perfectly nice, but it\u2019s hard to feel the same when you want to put me in your shoe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut whatever is wrong with that? I have already told you that I take good care of my feet. They are incapable of harming you and there will be no unpleasantries inside my shoe. It has the softest of insoles that I\u2019m sure you will find very nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, ignoring the fact that it\u2019s not nice to be inside of a shoe no matter how good it is, why do you want to put me in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting her glasses by the rim, Shauntal plucked you off the log with her other hand and explained. \u201cYou recall that I am attempting to write a horror novel correct? At the risk of sounding braggadocious, I am a very accomplished novelist. I am well adept at many areas of storytelling and world building. Furthermore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shauntal went on a small tangent about her prowess as an author, you hung uncomfortably pinched by her finger tips. You stole a glance down at Shauntal\u2019s shoe on the ground. At your regular size, it would be a petite pink flat. But at your current size, it seemed like a massive cave, her foot, with its eagerly wiggling toes, was a giant that made the cave its home. Turning back to Shauntal, you notice her smiling and gesturing in the air as she talked about her passion. You can\u2019t help but sigh. If you were normal size, Shauntal would be adorable and you would get along well. But now it felt like she was trying to make you a toy for her monsterous foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there is one weakness as an author that I have not overcome.\u201d Shauntal\u2019s words finally began to register in your ears again. \u201cI am still not good at conveying the primal struggle of living creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 what?\u201d You ask, not mentioning that you had tuned her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal sighed. \u201cHmm\u2026 how should I put this? \u2026 I\u2019m not good at writing about people\u2019s struggles with the unknown. A knight staring down a Dragonite? No problem. A farmer protecting their Milktanks from invading Clefairies? Odd but doable. A Muk or Trubish trying to live in a pristine city that despises their uncleanliness? Absolutely titillating! The fear a child feels when hearing the scary tales of ghost Pokemon? I\u2019m clueless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up on trying to understand all of her examples, you go straight to the point. \u201cSo\u2026 you suck with writing about people being afraid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s a good way of putting it.\u201d Shauntal stroked some of her hair. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d say terror is the emotion I struggle with rather than fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I get that\u2026 I guess. But what does that have to do with me in your shoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal giggled eerily. \u201cHehe. While my shoe is hardly what I\u2019d call terrifying, even for someone of your stature, it is a means with which I can simulate the feeling of terror. And by that I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal gingerly lifted her legs off the ground and onto the log you two were on. Through the dark of the night you could see that they were covered in black stockings. You felt yourself being lowered down! \u201cFrom what I have researched, horror novels are about struggling against some kind of monster. At your size, my feet should be plenty monsterous for a terrified struggle! And my shoe shall be the dreaded monster\u2019s lair. Thanks again for your cooperation! And I promise I\u2019ll do something really nice for you later.\u201d She added sweetly. \u201cNow please struggle lots so I can write some good material!~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest Shauntal\u2019s pinching fingers forced you between her nylon clad toes. Her big and second toes clamped around you like a monsters jaws. Instincts kicking in, you struggle against the assailing appendages, hoping to fight them off. Above you, Shauntal laughed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh my! I hope this doesn\u2019t start tickling. Now keep struggling my phantom! ANd if you manage to break free, expect a good chase from your \u2018monster\u2019 ehehehe.\u201d How could such a cute and dorky laugh be so terrifying now!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could focus on for now was struggling. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Confused, you managed to stutter out an intelligent thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026 Who are you?\u201d You asked, looking up at the spookily clad trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d She giggled, \u201cSo lovesick, but he never even knew her name.

I\u2019m lost.\u201d You said a little impatient, but you knew that this woman would only help you when she felt like it. <i>But that really is the question isn\u2019t it?</i> You thought, looking up at her continuing to scribble into her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I will help you, you\u2019ve wholly given yourself to me after all. It would be rude to refuse.\u201d She said, holding her pen next to her face after she finished writing, and looking at you cutely. She clipped her pen to the top of her shirt just under her cleavage window and pushed her glasses back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal leaned over and extended her gloved hand forward gently and wrapped her fingers around you. Your entire body was held between the firm yet still gentle grip of your enchanting captress. She did just capture you didn\u2019t she? She was putting words in your mouth, and now? Who knows what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you before her face, which was overshadowed by her hand from the dim light from the campfire. Which strangely cast a bluish light. It was clearly made by a Pokemon. \u201cNow I must reward your bold declaration of love\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you sank deeper, you could hear her heart beating at a calm pace. Her breasts weren't hurting you, it felt more like two pillows were squishing your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt your legs become free. You were relieved, until you realized something. Shauntal wears a dress, meaning past her boobs was her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then dropped out of her boobs and fell into her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my love, why don't wEEEE-!\" Shauntal yelled as her face turned red and her eyes shrank.

You unbuckled your pants and crawled up to the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you've reached the center of my womanhood!\" Shauntal moaned again. \"Please, my love, PENETRATE MY PUSSY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all you needed to hear. You thrusted your dick into the hole, which was followed by Shauntal load moans of pleasure. You never felt anything this good ever. You kept thrusting in and out of her cervix.

You were then lowered with the panties onto the ground. Above you was a horny Shauntal. She breathed heavily and her pussy dripped from her climax. She crouched down and picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was truly astonishing!\" Shauntal finally said as she kissed you. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and looked away, but you then looked back at her and said, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" Shauntal responded.

Not completely but enough for her to slip you under. You feel her fingers move and drop you onto the stump. Before you can run and avoid, her giant rear came down. Squishing you under the left buttcheek and the wooden stump underneath. It was immense pressure, by far more then what a girl like this should feel if she sat on you. Why did you have to be so small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal above just smiled as she could feel you underneath trying to struggle out. Of course it didn't accomplish anything, but Shauntal found inspiration over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Although he was adamant not to intrude on her private space. Respecting the honour of a woman and caring far too much. However he couldn't fathom how much she cared for him. Not willing to listen as she wanted to protect him as well\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh!

She put down more wait, intently preventing you from moving. Getting back to writing, she started going on a spree. A long spree, going on for about an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below you weren't getting hurt, instead you were just... bored. When you found her, you had no idea she was a writer who was going to use you for inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Shauntal finished her writing, getting up as she reached under her. Crossing her legs she pulled you right in front of her face. She was smiling at you very lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, i wrote so much because of you.

You don\u2019t have to decide right now. It\u2019s getting late, and I\u2019m going to need some sleep to keep writing tomorrow\u2026 So I\u2019ll have to keep you somewhere warm and safe\u2026\u201d She said, lowering you away from her face. It took you a moment to realize what was happening, but before you could even attempt to protest further, she dropped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed softly between the writer\u2019s ample breasts with your upper body was barely sticking out. \u201cHey!\u201d You shouted up, as she cutely smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, I\u2019m doing this for you, my love. You\u2019ll freeze otherwise\u2026\u201d She said before she pushed you deep into her cleavage with her pointer finger. Her tits swallowed you, and the little light from the fire up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShauntal giggled, gently pushing her boobs together as you futility struggled against her bust. She enjoyed the tingling sensation that ever small movement you made gave her. Giggling, she started to knead her breasts together amplifying your little movements as she threatened to smother what little air there was out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere fast, Shauntal stood up and bent over to grab her book and pen. As she walked over to her surprisingly tidy tent, her bra could only do so much to stop her cleavage from giggling. Every movement she made shook everything around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she laid down on her sleeping bag and the constant bombardment of her soft, squishy flesh dissipated. \u201cMmmm\u2026 I hope it\u2019s nice and cozy in there.\u201d Shauntal sleepily said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to write some more with you in the morning. You\u2019re a great inspiration little guy\u201d She said, gently hugging her breasts with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure how to respond. What could you say? It was probably best to just wait for now and enjoy the warmth. She was right, she <i>was really</i> warm. You shifted around trying to get comfortable, which wasn\u2019t easy considering how much your movement was restricted, but eventually, your eyelids started to droop. Before you knew it, you\u2019d fallen fast asleep...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a while until you woke up, in fact it took a very long moment for you to do. You were inside of the breasts, so they were comfy. Very comfy as you could sleep in there all day. The other reason is because you had such a hard day previous, you could just relax and stay there. Feeling protected amazingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, until she reacted as she moved around. She moved around and took her camp. Putting the tent in her backpack as she got moving. Shauntal made sure not to wake you up at any point, as she was happy and excited about this. A new boyfriend, one where she can easily draw inspiration off. Of course she might have to alter her story a bit, now that the size change has happened. But she was confident that it will make the story better and not to mention... make her more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the sun out, she held out her hand and covered over you. Making sure it was still dark for you so you would sleep longer. She was curious to know what you were sleeping about. Maybe one of her world famous Ghost Pokemon can figure out, since they have such tight ties with dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she did not get that chance, as you were starting to wake up. You wake up and look above you, seeing the palm of a flawless hand. It eventually moved away and you saw the smiling face of the writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my minuscule Lover.\u201d She said giving a giggle \u201cI assume you love your bed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...\u201d You say as you were waking up. Looking around you could realise where you were. Still in her breasts as you blush a bit. Although, you were high up in the air with her walking. So guess your staying there. \u201cright, Hello Shauntal. Good morning\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, i am so happy about you\u201d She said \u201cThrilled even. Having a tiny boyfriend like you, i feel so joyous, about finding you. I feel like i could write so much right now! That\u2019s why were going back to my home\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack to your home\u201d You say back to her, as you look up you suppose you have no problems with that. Better then being in the forest, as you move down. You do have to speak up a bit \u201cYou... said you were part of the Elite Four right\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Unova Elite Four\u201d She said down to you \u201cI am also a world famous writer. Really am shocked you haven\u2019t heard of me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... don\u2019t really pay attention to celebrates much\u201d You say to her defending yourself \u201cThat means you have Pokemon right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGhost Pokemon\u201d She spoke down to you, as she then smiled and giggled \u201cSo you better watch out and behave, otherwise i will have them take your soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You say to her a bit scarred about this as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry, that was a joke. Was it not good?\u201d She questioned as she saw your face \u201cSorry, not really good at telling jokes. I tried to put them into my stories but the only feedback i got regarding them was unnatural and morbid\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i can vouch for the morbid part\u201d You say as you sink even deeper into the booms. She giggled at that as she continues walking. It was weird seeing this girl out in the morning, you would normally assume she was more of a night girl. Guess she really wants to get home. You think about this for a while as you then speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...\u201d You say up to her \u201cSo... were a couple now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are\u201d She said, a clear smile on her face \u201cWe can have some real fun when we get home, and you can help me with writing. Tell me, are you a writer\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t written anything since i got out of school\u201d You say as you fight up a bit. Getting your hands and shoulders out as you relax. She relaxes of course as she was more then happy about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing! I can teach you! You have so many hats at this bit. Your my inspiration, your my boyfriend, your my fun and your my pupil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPupil\u201d You say as you frown a bit. Guess your not getting out of this too\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though he has no experience in it himself, his love pushed him. Making him determined to whatever his love wants!\u201d She said as you sigh a bit. You then see her pull out her backpack and grab something. Looking up you see her grab a notebook and a pen \u201cWriting this down! Oh we can brainstorm on our way home. This is so great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, you sigh. This girl was going to be a challenge for you. Even worse is that she has no plans to really help you, but she does have plans. So many plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but Shauntal reached the Elite Four castle. Of course having her way in and not getting stopped, she moved to her room. Walking inside as she turned on the lights. However the lights in her room was nothing but lit candles. She likes it a lot more like that, it adds great ambience for her and her ghosts. She had no responsibilities for now. Elite Four challengers are few and fair between, not to mention that to get to her, they would have to do quite the journey. So they can usually wait a couple of days for the Elite Four to organise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan i come out yet?\u201d You say, hidden into the chest as she giggles. It was a good hiding spot, no doubt about that. Right close to her heart. where you should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may\u201d As she felt her boobs shift around, you climbing out as she smiled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is your room huh... Ghost type for sure\u201d You say as she giggles loudly.<br>\r\n\u2028What does she do next?</span></div></div>",

Fast enough so you didn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, lets sort this out. Are you sure you don't have any idea how you got like this.

She didn't seem to have any malicious intent (not back then at least), so you asked her if she wanted to be part of your team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight nod was your answer and you caught the Espurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow it learned to shrink people was still a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, even when helpless and utterly pathetic, you had to do something, you couldn't leave Korrina like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone!\" you cried out, angry and scared at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Espurr ignored you, but inadvertently followed your command as she lost interest for the fainted girl she had shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she seemed to have taken a lot of interest in you, minuscule on the giant bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaze of the gigantic pokemon, staring straight at you, made you feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you started, but Espurr started moving towards your perch on top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart began galloping within your chest as you stumbled back. But you knew there was no way out of this unless Espurr willed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid pokemon reached the bed and, with a surprising agility, leaped straight onto it, her gaze now pointing downwards, right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept stepping back, but the giantess used the faintest of her Psychic to stop you and list you up to her face, right in front of huge, seemingly bottomless eyes of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see your reflection in those, and you were utterly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come Espurr, remember all the great times we had together!\" you shouted out of fear, before realizing what you had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... The last two days I mean! Weren't those fun!?\" you cried in an attempt to stop whatever the psychic-type had in mind before it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you so scared, Espurr's facial expression changed, like it hadn't in the two days she was with you.</span></div></div>",

Especially when it sent you a big and devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPurr\u201d It said to you pretty intimidating as you try to get away, doing a swimming motion in the air comically. It didn't do anything though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Espurr! I didn't do anything that bad to you!\u201d You tell her as she starts squeezing you a bit with the psychic. \u201cOkay i guess i did abduct you from your home and was going to keep you with me.... but i would of treated you nice i swear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems you reasoning and cowardly rationizing of the situation didn't accomplish anything. As Espurr had a plan and she was going to put it into motion. Scared you watch as the giant Espurr opened its mouth as your eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Espurr I'm sorry. Please don't eat me!\u201d You say to it as it slowly brought you closer and closer. Drawing it out just to mess with you as you got a good look at the inside of her mouth, the saliva coming from the roof and her wiggling tongue. You cant explain how desperately you don't want to go in there. And cant explain how more you don't want to go near her throat at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Espurr, you've made your point. Ill release you if you want me too!\u201d you say as it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPurr?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats right i can!\u201d You tell her as your plan seemed to work. \u201cI can get rid of your bond with the Pokeball that caught you and you can be a wild Pokemon again. But i cant do that if you eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked conflicted right now... She really wanted to eat you right now, like more then she originally thought she would. While at the same time she wants to be a wild Pokemon. The fact that she feels attached to you was a cause of the Pokeball and she hated it. Espurr knows some wild Pokemon in the forest which would love being captured by a trainer but not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspurr... Espurr Purr Es Es Purr\u201d It said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.... yes\u201d You reply not really sure what she was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr just rolled its eyes and brought her stubby hand to you. Hitting you in the head as she transferred her question to you via psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you want to know where the Pokeball is?\u201d You say now knowing what Espurr was saying. \u201cWell it was with me when i first found myself shrunk. It was too big to carry and i was too small to open it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr was surprised with itself it doesn't remember the Pokeball at all. She watched you from the moment you shrunk so she's really shocked she didn't see it. She didn't see it, or maybe your just lying to save your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing you weren't sure about was whether you were or not out of danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Espurr. It means-\" a second tap to your skull caused you to trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you want me to find the poke-ball?\" you parroted back the words you heard in your mind, almost like a ghostly hand had written them straight inside your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Espurr nodded, much like she had done when you asked her to join you; you couldn't help but wonder the reason of it now, but you were sure that you misunderstood her gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps she really wanted to be part of your team, but then realized she actually didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever it was, you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... If I help you find the poke-ball - don't look at me like that, I can't on my own! - you'll grow me back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Espurr shot that devious smirk you've grown familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Maybe\u2019, you assumed she was telling that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright. But you'll grow Korrina too.\" you gestured for the shrunken girl that laid on the floor of her own tent, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr nodded, before she jumped down to the floor and started walking to the opening of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped by the unconscious body of Korrina though, and the girl began hovering in mid-air, held by Espurr's psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorrina was roughly dumped on top of Espurr's other, free paw as the gigantic feline began walking again, out of the tent and back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only way out of this was to find that poke-ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure hoped this was going to be easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan beside you interrupted your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to the side to see Korrina fidgeting on Espurr's paw. You saw the blonde girl stirring, before she sat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dream...\" she muttered, before her eyes opened, and she found herself on top of an Espurr's white paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, she looked at the pokemon, then at you, seemingly extremely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't a dream. My Espurr,\" the giantess growled softly at this,<br>\r\n\"... <i>This</i> free Espurr I don't deserve to have as a pokemon followed me, because she wants to be free again. We'll have to find her poke-ball first.\" you said, and the pokemon's face returned deadpan as it was before you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorrina nodded, seeming though still extremely disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" she mused,<br>\r\n\"... What if the poke-ball is no longer where you left it? If some pokemon took interest in it and took it? You know it couldn't capture it since Espurr should be technically held in that poke-ball...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply, but swallowed deeply, like Espurr was probably going to do with you if Korrina's predictions turned out to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purr.\" Espurr broke the silence she had kept intact for a while as she arrived to the place where you were shrunken down by her own paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure of it: Espurr have an incredible sense of orientation, they could find their way out of a forest like this in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purr.\" she said, lowering herself and letting both you and Korrina down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help us at least,\" you told.<br>\r\n\"It will be easier for the three of us to find it if we search together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr looked at you with the same deadpan expression, not wanting to take orders from you, a human she had shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, she nodded since you had a point, and out of respect that these were the last instants of you being her trained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember: if we manage to find it, can you <i>please</i> grow us both back to our original sizes before I actually release you? If you don't do that, I... uh... won't be able to do it, understand?\" you tried, hoping that the pokemon would fall for your lie and didn't decide to destroy the poke-ball whenever you found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korrina, who stood silent beside you, watched as the Espurr let your words sank in, before she looked back at you and nodded her head. The message was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" you said, before turning to Korrina,<br>\r\n\"Let's search for the poke-ball, or we'll never have our sizes back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" she whispered as the both of you started wandering around, in search of the gigantic sphere that was going to decide your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorrina looked at you, and for the first time since you met her you saw the most vague hint of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was genius, y'know. This way she'll grow us back!\" she whispered, while the ground beneath you shook as Espurr herself searched for the poke-ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't work if we don't find it,\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"Let's hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Korrina and the gigantic Espurr searched around for quite a while, but your search gave little to no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you spotted something familiar, laying abandoned in the middle of the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bag!\" you exclaimed, drawing Korrina's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was your bag, now as tall as a skyscraper. You probably lost it when you shrunk down so much that you simply slid out of it. It looked intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your bag?\" Korrina questioned, like trying to convince herself that you owned something that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! This must be the exact place where I lost the poke-ball! I-\" your mind filled itself with the moments of your shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr's poke-ball rolled out of your pocket as you stumbled around, trying to figure out what was going on. You saw it falling on the ground, before everything became dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It must be around here!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for?\" Korrina asked as Espurr approached the bag too,<br>\r\n\"We need our sizes back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at you bag and hesitantly walked up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began walking around it, before stopping behind it to notice...</span></div></div>",

Espurr wasn't willing to wait anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered running away, but you remembered about Korrina, who was still shrunken and with Espurr herself. The giantess could have eaten her instead of you if you ran...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you walked back to where the pokemon and the shrunken girl were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspurr was staring straight at you, and so was Korrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the girl first, before your gaze moved on the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you reluctantly said, pausing to gulp down a lump that formed in your throat,<br>\r\n\"The poke-ball... the poke-ball is gone. I can't... release you, unless whoever has it breaks it. I'm really really sorry...\" you said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorrina gasped before her hands rushed to her mouth as she stared at you; Espurr's jaw opened slightly at your declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze lingered on you for what seemed an eternity, before her expression finally shifted, becoming that devious smirk she wore before, right when she was about to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" you mumbled, but it was too late; a psychic grip caused you to start levitating in mid-air, before you were shot across the air and in front of the face of the psychic-type giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him go!\" Korrina shouted from below, but Espurr ignored her, opening her mouth wide instead, giving you a clear view of her pink, slick insides; big drops of saliva fell from her palate and onto her tongue, each drop falling being the equivalent of a boulder dropping on your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on Espurr, don't eat me!\" you begged, but your plead fell on deaf ears; instead, you started moving closer to the slick cavern that was her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was deliberately taking as much time she could to let you in the pink, fleshy hell that was going to be your end, unless you thought about something real smart real quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Espurr... I c-can be a good trainer! I'll do anything, just don't eat me!... I could be more useful alive than dead, no!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she ignored you, and inched closer to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't his fault!\" someone bellowed from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Espurr to close her mouth to look down; Korrina, who was standing by the giantess' leg, had a terrified look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes again and looked down at the blonde girl, wondering what she was up to. What wasn't your fault? You discovered that you didn't care as long as it was enough to convince Espurr to not eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He brought you to find that poke-ball, but if it's gone it isn't his fault!\" Korrina continued, giving you a new hope as well as a new idea to cling to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's right Espurr! It isn't my fault if someone t-took your poke-ball, I don't have anything to do with it, I swear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Espurr felt conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to deliver your punishment and eat you, but, oddly, she also felt like she didn't want to eat you, which was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small, nearly inaudible gasp, Espurr realized that it was because of the poke-ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damn sphere bound her to you, made her feel bad about eating you, and she hated it! She wanted to be free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, that meant the poke-ball was still intact, and it also meant that you were still her trainer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the hesitation in the eyes of the pokemon giantess and decided that this was your chance to convince Espurr to not eat you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Espurr, don't eat me. My only fault is having mistaken you... It's really not my fault if the poke-ball is gone!\" you cried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Let him down Espurr!\" Korrina shouted from below, and you shot her a meek smile, grateful for the support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you looked back at Espurr, wanting to beg her one last time, even though it meant humiliating yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the giantess had already made up her mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself in a middle of a hallway after you woken up from your sleep. The last thing you remember was that you were walking around a forest and it was getting late so you fell asleep at a random spot and you don't remember anything else after that. Anyways, the hallway itself looks absolutely huge; so huge that you almost felt like an insect within this building. The structure around you seems to have an eastern-style architecture, almost like you are inside a Japanese castle of some sort. Thinking of that, you wonder if anyone around here can speak English around here so you find someone and tell them how did you end up in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get a chance to set one single foot on the wooden surface when your surroundings start to shake. Is this place going to collapse?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, instead you saw something that shock you more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing your left, you watch as two giant girls come into view and walk across the massive hallway. You suddenly realized the untold fact: This place is not really that huge, you were actually very small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like this building, these girls also have an Oriental look to them; both are wearing short kimono-like dresses, knee-length socks and sandals. The one on the left has orange hair and wears a blue and pink kimono while the other has blond hair tied up in pigtails and wears a white and black kimono. The duo are currently talking to each other while they are roaming the hallway. As such, neither of them noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly backed yourself to the wall as they unknowingly passed you. The stomp from the giant sandal which belonged to the orange haired one almost made you lose your balance, but you didn't fall off from your feet. You watch above as they walk away from you during their conversation. You were surprised to figure out that they were talking in English, but you didn't pay attention too much on what they were even talking about as they are now out of sight. You thought about getting their attention, but you have no idea how they going to react after they find you. After all, who ever seen a bugman before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go to the same path to where those giants came from in order to either find a way to get out of this place or find some place to hide. You go straight ahead until you went right to the only path of this hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped when you saw something on the left side of the wall. You move closer until you found out that it was an enormous sliding door which looks like it leads to an equally enormous room. You thought that maybe you can hide in that room for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards it and noticed that it was very slightly opened, perhaps someone didn't closed it completely. You carefully slip your way through the doors and into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your got inside, you discovered that it was someone's bedroom but that's not all, the room looks very fancy as it looks more like the royal chamber of this castle. Unlike what you saw inside this building so far, this bedroom looks like a mixture between eastern and western at the same time. The wooden floor was colored a nice shade of lavender, the walls are painted  pink with eastern-like designs, a large golden chandelier hung from above, and at the center of the room is a large purple rug that almost covered the entire room. There are a number of luxurious-looking furnitures of both eastern and western styles at the same time, but the most noticeable ones around here are a large cozy-looking bed and a table with sewing machine on top of it and a piece of cloth resting on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a familiar sound of foorsteps coming from outside. Only this time, it was followed by the sounds of high-heel clicking across the floor. You realized that who's ever is coming must be the owner of the room so you make a quick dash under the large bed. From the moment you leap to your hiding spot, you hear the sliding doors open and in come out the owner themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a VERY pretty young woman with long black hair and uh...a set of strange-looking eyes that looks like they could stare through your soul. Asides from her eyes, her attire is rather odd to say the least; even by eastern standards. Her pink and yellow kimono has extremely large sleeves which almost look like bird wings and speaking of that, her hair is tied by a purple ribbon that resembled bird feathers. Unlike the two girls from before, her footwear features a set of black stockings and black and pink pumps with pink ribbons on top of them that looked like butterfly wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh now that I got that out of the way, it's time for me finish that dress I been planning to do for a while.\" said the woman as she makes her way towards the sewing machine while she pulled up her sleeves, revealing her pale-skinned arms. She sat down, picked up the cloth on top of the machine, turn it on, and began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the machine and her soft humming filled up the air. You started thinking about getting her attention; she looks like a kind person. However, you still don't think she'll ever help you right away after seeing a small you; she'll most likely get very surprised. You think about going with your plan of finding a place to hide and hope she doesn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Not near the fire and not in the open tent. You take this opportunity and search for any food you can find, not only that but get into a good position so you could be found by the camper when they come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass the campfire and go to towards the tent. You enter as you were frankly amazed at how neat it was. It looked more like the inside of a House rather then a gigantic tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spent the next hour trying to find the best spot you could go in order to get spotted, and although its risky. You've decided that the blow up mattress would be the best. You've been waiting ever since as the person doesn't seem to be coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been waiting for so long that you almost go to sleep yourself, however when you hear a voice outside. You perk up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat A Lovely Night.<br>\r\nThe Stars Were Out And They Shone.<br>\r\nThey Shone And Gave A Sight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that a Haiku?\u201d You say to yourself. You watch as the person who said the Haiku came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed at the woman who came in. It was The Gym Leader Of Anistar City, Olympia. You were so memorised by the woman\u2019s beauty and the overall mystic vibe she has radiating around her, that you didn't even bother yelling and getting her attention. She closed the zipper to the tent trapping you inside, she then to your amazement started to strip. She took of her cape and start to undress herself. Opening her collar and lowering down her skin tight suit, revealing her shoulder as well as exposing the top of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were enjoying the sight, you were left in a bad situation, you cant reveal yourself now. You would look like a total creep and a massive pervert<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you amazement she wasn't wearing any underwear underneath so needless to say you were waiting in anticipation. However she didn\u2019t continue to strip, she seemed to stop for some reason. You get a feeling as you look up and it seemed your feeling was confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlympia, was staring right at you! Oh No! this is bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlympia\u2019s purple eyes stared at you until finally she spoke and decided your fate <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Given her abilities, you wouldn't be surprised if that was actually what was going on.<br>\r\n\"You are not unknown. Your arrival was foreseen. Enjoying the show?\" <br>\r\nWas that... how does she come up with these haikus on the fly like that? But more importantly, how is she not mad? In fact she almost seemed to be encouraging you given her tone when she said that. But either way you swiftly looked down nervously as she leaned in closer. <br>\r\n\"You need not worry. I mean you no harm at all. You can look back up.\" <br>\r\nSeriously does she rehearse these things? You hesitated, still a bit worried about appearing as a pervert to the  gigantic woman with psychic powers. She could possibly end you with an actual thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... wait, you knew i'd be here? And that I'd be... like this?\" you questioned. \"Small?\" she asked quickly. You nodded as you finally looked back up, seeing her skin tight suit in roughly the same position it was in before, covering up her breasts just barely at this point. \"Indeed.\" she responded. So its either the full haiku or just one word from her. This woman certainly made for an interesting conversationalist. \"Then why did you zip up the exit and start... undressing? B-before acknowledging me?\" As you looked back as the beautiful psychic and her strange mystic look and allure, you found yourself getting a bit flustered, much to Olympia's amusement. \"Just having some fun. You're certainly a cute one. I could not resist.\" Her response made you even more flustered. Did she just call you cute? FOCUS! You can't get distracted. You need to calm down and try to get some help. Maybe this woman is the key. After all she's a psychic, and a powerful one to boot. Maybe she can fix you. \"Well then, you know how to fix me. How to grow me back right?\" you asked hopefully. Olympia's expression became a bit more somber, quickly dashing your hopes before she even said a word. \"Unfortunately. That is not your destiny. Yet out paths are one.\" Greeeeeeeaaaaaat. Useless and needlessly cryptic. \"What do you mean it's not my destiny? Why can't you fix me?\" you shouted up to her. Trying to get her to take your plight a bit more seriously.<br>\r\n\"Though my gifts are great. Fate won't allow me to change you. I can't challenge it.\" You just stood at her blankly. You no longer cared about her speech patterns. You were completely awestruck as how she's just going to leave you like this without even trying. You'd probably be raging if she wasn't still towering over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not feel despair. As I've said, our paths are one. So why not have fun?\" a small grin forming back on her as she reached back for her suit and began to slowly remove it, keeping an eye on you for your response. With the entire top half of her exposed and bare, you couldn't help but stare once again. Despite your fears of appearing to be a pervert, Olympia had one HELL of a body. It truly was a breathtaking sight. She stopped when the suit was around her hip. \"Enjoying the view? We can both enjoy you fate. Release your worries.\" her tone seemed to be getting seductive, playful. As she pulled her white heels off her bare soles you swear you briefly caught her winking at you. This... this is all wrong. As amazing as this woman is, this can't possibly be right... can it? Maybe she was right. Maybe she can't interfere with whatever power did this. And maybe she's full of it and made up that crap so you'd stop asking her to change you back. For all you know, she might have been the one to do this to you... Still maybe she was right. She doesn't seem malicious. Quite the opposite actually. But what will you do.</span></div></div>",

Fate is something we can't change. Accept it like me.\" Olympia said with a calm tone. You have to admit, she's really good with those haikus (But I suck at these). Olympia then picked you up gently and raised you towards her face. You felt embarrassed at first as well as depressed, but it slowly melted away when you looked at Olympia's face.  Her face was simply breathtaking. From her Periwinkle eyes and her pillow-like lips. You felt safe with her and plus, she might be flirting with you this entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Ok, I believe you. I could get used to it sooner or later.\" You said. Olympia smiled back and kissed you on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our paths our now one. I thank you for trusting me. Now let's have some fun.\" Olympia said happily.

You immediately blushed like a tomato. You could rest anywhere on her body and she wouldn't judge you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: You asked to sleep in her boobs. You'll be able to explore her body after she falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: You asked to sleep in her vagina.

Knowing if you see her half naked you'll be lured. In hindsight however your really should of looked cause the next thing you knew was her bare foot coming squishing down onto you. You fell onto your back as you retreated your arms. No longer could you see the beautiful and alluring woman who was throwing out haiku\u2019s. Instead you saw the bottom of her foot which has been stuck in her boot the entire day. It was dirty and it was sweaty.

She slowly took off her dress, revealing a red bra and panties. You almost had a nose bleed from her gorgeous body. Drasna noticed you blush smiled and said, \"At least I know I still got.\" She picked you up and brought you closer to her pink lips and gave you a kiss. She placed you on her pillow and turned off the lamp. She looked at you with a smile and said, \" Good night, my little one!\" and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to sleep or you could explore her massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you chose?</span></div></div>",

Did you actually hear her say that. You stared with a dumbfounded expression as she simply smiled back down at you. \"Are... are you really okay with this? I... You don't think its weird or creepy or anything?\" you finally managed to get the question out. The old dragon master simply nods cheerfully. \"You're such a sweet boy for being concerned. And believe me, I've seen plenty of weird and creepy things in my life. Your little thing for my feet isn't high on that list.\" <br>\r\nShe slowly shifted her right foot up so that it would hover between you and her face. \"Honestly, it's actually quite flattering to see a young man like you being attracted to me. So what do you say, will you help me relax while I finish my dinner?\" As she asked this, the toes wiggled in an inviting manner that caused a fluttering feeling inside of you. You were almost too embarrassed to keep looking up at her. \"I.. I... I... o-of course I will. Hopefully I can do a good enough job for you at this size.\" With that, the foot lowered before you and leaned back a little, giving you a close detailed view of her sole. As you've noticed before, her feet were in amazing shape for her age. You nervously reached out to touch the bottom of her big toe, gently moving your hand along the flesh. Drasna giggled overhead as you did this; you weren't sure if you tickled her or if she simply found your actions cute. The skin was so smooth and though there was a light odor to them, it was a surprisingly pleasant one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you moved in and pressed both your hands against her sole, starting to rub back and forth in slow, rhythmic motions. The toes immediately flinched as you started. Looking up, you saw a very relaxed expression on her face. \"You're very good at this.\" she said in her usual sweet tone, lifting the foot slightly up to let you reach further down the sole. The toes wiggled a bit with each rub. After taking another peek up at your keeper, you started to relax as well, really taking in the massive, shapely, and smooth soles and their effects on every sense. It was a heavenly experience that you never wanted to end. Of course, you didn't want to push this too far with her. After all she did give you food and protection, on top of letting you pamper her perfect feet after you accidentally revealed your little interest. You wouldn't want to overdo things.... though she is enjoying this so far. Perhaps... nah This is good enough. Its way more than you would have ever expected from anyone.

It was at this point you realised that your mistake as you walked back, hands in the air and an embarrassed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm sorry, i...i...i didn't think.

You then preceded to repeatedly kiss her toes, making sure that none of the little piggies were ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for that, now would you mind doing the other one\u201d Drasna said as she pulled back one foot only to replace it with the other one. You then proceeded to give it the same amount love you did to the other one, only this time the kisses were mixed in with the rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrains was satisfied. She didn't expect to find a shrunken young man, but she was happy she did. Because now she's got a small little ______________.

Watching you at her feet made her think of a little puppy greeting his master. An adorable thought for comparison. However this put an idea in Drasna\u2019s mind. She blushed slightly at the thought, but it was too good of an opportunity for someone like her to pass up. And something told her that you wouldn\u2019t have any complaints with her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw the foot you spent the past few minutes pampering lift up out of your reach. Your head followed it befor wlooking back to Drasna\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve made a decision.\u201d The older woman announces to you in her cheerful tone. You looked up curiously, wondering g what she had in mind. \u201cI have decided to keep you as my adorable little pet. You\u2019ll get plenty of food and shelter, and in return you get to amuse me and do as I say. I trust you have no issues with my decision?\u201d You were completely taken aback by this. Just like that this woman claimed you as her personal property. A pet for her amusement. You initially wanted to speak out and tell her she was crazy for even suggesting doingn this to another human being. But then you looked back to her smile. That warm caring smile. Her foot rested back down next to you providing a reminder of the fun you were having just minutes ago. Perhaps this was the best option. It felt oddly... right being this woman\u2019s pet. Is that weird to think? But the more you thought about it, the more your past worries seemed trivial compared to Drasna\u2019s happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally nodded and leans over to kiss her foot once to signal that you accept her decision. Drasna let out a happy squeal as she watched you sign you life away to her whim. You felt a finger gently pet you. \u201cGood boy. I\u2019ll take very good care of you from now on. And in return all you have to do is make momma happy.\u201d The finger felt good against you. You never wanted this sensation to end.

Of course she doesn't know you completely yet but she does know exactly what you love. Moving her feet forward you see the be placed down in front of you. Her aged toes right in front of you as you look directly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun then\u201d Drasna said \u201cConsider this a little reward for yourself. A perk for your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Drasna, Thank you\u201d You say running forward. You jump directly onto her big toe. Landing just over her nail as you ride it like a Gogoat. Your legs on either side as you hug her toe. Drasna above couldn't help but giggle at the sight. You looked so adorable to her. You just laid there as you sniff her toe. Smelling the odors coming from it. You know its kind of weird but Drasna has shown she doesn't mind and isn't disturbed by it. Not only that but she\u2018s made you hers now. She wouldn't really care what you did right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Drasna got a cheeky idea of what to do with you. Her hands on her lap she decided to bump her toe up and down in the air. Not enough to send you flying but enough to give you quite the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u201d You say as you feel yourself get lifted off, having just enough time to get a better grip and secure yourself. You were then sent on a wild ride as she bounced you around. With a big smile on her face she even raised her foot off of the ground. Making it a bit more treacherous if you fell. She brought her leg to the other and crossed it over. Placing her foot and you at the end. Here she got a better sight of you struggling to stay on the toe. And to her absolute delight she saw that you were enjoying yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d She said still bouncing her toe. You could see her face watching as you couldn't help but feel like a child under her powerful gaze. Not to mention your around the right age to be her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts like riding a mechanical Gogoat! I bet you i can stay on\u201d You say with a smile. She decided to accept your challenge, getting a glimmer in her eyes. She then started to bounce it around even more. This time trying to get you off. With your arms gripping the edge of her toenail you seriously struggled to stay on. Before to long you found your arms couldn't hold on anymore as you flew straight off her toe. You go flying off as Drasna stopped moving, worried that your gonna be injured on your fall to the ground. But thats not what happen, cause you managed to grab onto her toe at the last second. Holding it like someone would a pull up bar. As soon as Drasna saw you she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems like i can't get you away from my feet. I knew you loved them but not this much\u201d She joked to you. You didn't laugh back however, simply climbing back up and resting your arms. They were just put though an endurance after all. Getting up you laid down. Your body facing Drasna while your back was leaning against her smaller toes. Much more comfortable then it had any right to be. Drains saw you were tired and gave you a break. She herself wasn't tired at all, but she was far to nice to keep pushing you. Although she's gonna continue talking \u201cWell i call this a successful trip. Not only is it by far relaxing but I've also won a new little guy who's obsessed with my feet, who i just adore!\u201d Drasna said as she leaned forward, patting you. \u201cIve still got a few days out here, but i might go back early. Now that i can relax back there with you and for your sake. I don't want anything happening to you out here obviously. Your far to special to lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan i...\u201d You say finally entering her conversation \u201cCan i ride in your shoes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you cheeky boy\u201d She said playfully with a giggle \u201cEven on my way back you want to be near those toes. You do know theirs more to me then just toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course but your toes are just great!\u201d you shout back as she giggles. She loves your little foot fetish, makes you even more endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Drasna say?</span></div></div>",

She giggled at this and raised her foot. Patting your head with her big toe as you felt the love she was giving you. She walked away and started packing up her tent. Her bare feet walking in the dirt as you were getting lonely a bit. Not only that but her backside was to you and you could see her glorious rump. This was the first time you realised it but she had a huge rear, like unbelievably huge. It was so big that you couldn't stop looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes she finished packing as she walked over to you, she reached down and grabbed you, bringing you up to her loving face. \u201cIt would seem that i have everything packed expect for you.\u201d Drasna said. \u201cAnd don't worry, i have my Favorite spot left for my Favorite pet\u201d\u2028<br>\r\nYou then see Drasna open her collar as you can now stare at her two gigantic mounds. Your so happy that you couldn't explain. Instead of saying something about your smile, Drasna just got to it and lowered you in. Pushing you safely in-between her cleavage. She pushed you all the way so that your shoulders were trapped completely and you couldn't escape. But then again if you could you wouldn\u2019t. Your between a beautiful woman\u2019s cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, you should be safe in there. Just try not to have to much fun down there. I don't think i can explain having a tiny man in my cleavege\u201d Drasna giggled as she closed her Collar trapping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her start walking as you assume she's leaving the campsite. You don't know where she's going or how long it will take her to get there, but then again your just a pet now.

Something a little more\u201d She said as your eyes were opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got here, you wanted help in order to grow big once again, but now you want something else. And it looks like your going to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Olivia by the way\u201d She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply telling her your name but she didn't accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, but i think I'm going to stick with Little Guy. After all i think it fits you a lot more now\u201d Olivia then looked at her tent as you followed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Serving under me. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d You shout back \u201cYour gonna make me work for your help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia giggled at the idea \u201cThats the plan, it won't be that bad. And it won't take that long\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about even more, before you can actually figure out that you really had no choice \u201cFine, just... just what do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats the spirit\u201d Olivia said happily \u201cWell i want you to... hmmm... I know! Rub my feet!\u201d She finished this by dropping you right under her and right by her ebony feet. \u201cI think thats a good start, don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing feet. Doesn't sound that hard, and while her feet are dirty they aren't rugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed them on her sides as she can now allow you to get every part. Her toes wiggling in excitement as you start away from them. However before you could lay a hand on them, she pulled them back confusing you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair, i feel like i should tell you this isn't for my help\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRubbing my feet won't contribute to me helping you. Now get along\u201d Olivia said as you still stayed on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell! Then why would i even do this?\u201d You shout back seeing no point. That was of course until Olivia raised one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for you to stay in my tent tonight. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. You can sleep outside, I'm sure you'll only get hunted by a few Pokemon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... wha?\u201d You say in disbelief. The smile she had on her face showed that she knew she got you. \u201cFine, ill start on your stupid feet\u201d You finally put your hands on her soles and push in. Planning to make her feel it, and feel it she did. You couldn't see it but above she had a smile of pure bliss as you worked. Enjoying it so much. Much better then what she usually does. She usually just steps on some pebbles to get a similar feeling. You bounce against her dark skin as you've tried to get more violent with it. Not like your actually gonna hurt her, not to mention it helps you get some of your anger out, and since you feel like you've just been cheated you have a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, who knew such a little guy could do such a big job. Not only do it but do it well. This has got to be a usual thing for us\u201d Olivia said smiling down at you \u201cAhhh... Finish this and you'll be allowed to sleep in the tent. Of course your still gonna have to work for food, travel, water, bathroom breaks, protection. Essentially you have a lot to do before were gonna get to the helping part\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe formed a full proof plan for this. Kinda impressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You are a scruffy girl and a proud member of the totally awesome Team Skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkala was your stomping grounds. The place where you got to show those high and mighty trial goers what\u2019s what. To your chagrin, big sis (that\u2019s what everyone called one of the bosses) decided to pair you up with a total wimp of a grunt for the day. As annoying as he was, you two still managed to nab some snot nose Lil' shit 's Drifloon; until some Kantoian girl with a stupid red hat that look like a Torchic's ass kicked both your asses and took it back. Bet she thinks she\u2019s hot shit after that. You reminded yourself to knock her down a peg later on. After that your memories get pretty... foggy to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That what happens when you back a defenseless pokemon into a corner lass.\" A voice cuts from your thoughts. You turned around to see a purple eyed brown skinned girl with two long and thick braid pigtails.She was wearing some farm clothes,and she was surprisingly mature for someone no older than you. \"The child's drifloon use minimize on you while me and my friend Moon were fighting your... friend. And when he lost, he just ran off and... left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t really surprised at that last part... but why are your eyes starting to water up, and your hands shaking? The girl seemingly didn't know what you were doing and continue \"I have decided to watch over and take care of you for the time being. But now you have to be punished for your act. Moon gave me an ... idea for an punishment before she ran off.\"  The girl said with a lot of uncertainty in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what she meant by that until she began to pull off her boots You were blushing, and you have devious grin that was hidden behind your skull bandanna. \"This won't be so bad after all\" you thought as you watch her finally remove them..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her feet was big, wide, and plump. Her cream colored soles was wafting their very pungent earthy and natural odor to you. \"P-pamper my feet\" the girl brashly yet sternly says while scrunching her unpainted toes. You lick your lips stealthily. It was clear the girl was not used to showing her feet, let alone having someone touch them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

But Of course you couldn\u2019t let her know that, because you don't want her to switch to an actual punishment from here.

But you restrained yourself. Despite your entire body quivering at the thought of pressing yourself against her massive foot, you remembered that this was supposed to be a punishment for your crimes. If it was apparantly that you wanted this, at least from the start, she\u2019d probably put the boot back on and subject you to something else. You had to play this smartly. But... how long should you hesitate... how do you do this without seeming desperate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while you were hesitating to move anyway due to your train of thought Hapu looked down curiously. Since she couldn\u2019t see any facial features besides your eyes, she simply assumed you were just scared or reluctant. Hapu thought briefly about how both of you must be in this boat. But still, you needed to be taught a lesson, and if you weren\u2019t going to get started like she asked, she will hce to find a way to make you get started. You were snapped back into reality as Hapu put on a frown and cleared her throat impatiently. I know this doesn\u2019t look fun and I know you\u2019re already in a rather stressful situation, but you still have to face some punishment for what you\u2019ve done. So get this out of the way now and I can get back to keeping you safe sooner. You simply stared blankly. Before you could make a move Hapu shifted forward and lifted her foot above you. Your eyes widened in awe as the sole hovered inches above you. Every ridge, groove, curve, and the slightest specks of dust were crystal clear from this point of view. \u201cIf you won\u2019t start yourself, then I\u2019ll just have to help you get started.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you could react the foot fell down on top of you pinning you to the ground. You breathed faster and heavier as you felt her sole pressing down on you. Unknown to you Hapu was blushing at the feeling of a tiny person underneath her foot. She felt an odd mix of embarrassment and enjoyment as she started to feel you squirm underneath her. \u201cMaybe... this isn\u2019t... so bad?\u201d She quietly pondered. Back on the ground, you were effectively in paradise. You squirmed against the sole, partially to convey a sense of struggling to the giant, and partially because her skin felt soooooo good against you. You started to sniff the air, savoring the powerful earthy scent that was now your world. \u201cM-maybe I can... convince her to do this again... somehow.\u201d You slowed a bit as you tried to think of a way to put yourself back in this position. Perhaps misbehaving and earning more punishments... or maybe convince her that you slowly grew to enjoy the experience... would she find that weird? Should she punish you for that? Back above, Hapu noticed you slowing up. She wasn\u2019t sure if you were tired already or just being lazy, so she gently squeezed a toe against your head before letting back up. She soon felt your tiny hands rubbing against her foot making her grin a little and let out a relaxed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe that just this morning you were thinking about how all other trainers on the island should bow at your feet. Now here you were, in the exact opposite position and enjoying every second of it.<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes Hapu finally lifted her foot up. You laid on the ground, messy hair, exhausted, and blushing under your bandanna. You swear you saw a small grin before her expression shifted back to normal. You silently prayed that this was a sign of more fun like this in the future.</span></div></div>",

And now you've been traveling the woods all small and all alone. And it has not been a good time for you. From almost being stepped on by a Bewear to almost eaten by a Lurantis, you've managed to get away every time you ran into a Pokemon. And it would seem your about to run into another Pokemon. As you hear heavy hoof steps coming your way. It didn't take long for you to see the Giant Muddle galloping your way. You act quickly and dive out of the way, avoiding being trampled by the ground type. It was only after it was passing did you realise something, Someone was riding the Mudsdale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't catch a good look at the person but you chase after them, someone to help you! Thank Arceus!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chased after and luckily they stopped not to far away from you. They stopped at a campsite hidden in the woods as you finally see the human.

She seems nice enough to help you, or at least thats your assumption. Granted she could be the worst person in the world, but sometimes you just gotta take a risk. Running forward to her boot you pound it, wanting her to actually look down. Granted your little punches obviously weren't gonna bust through her boots, and if you were thinking straight you'd realise that. But you weren't, you were very desperate. Eventually you gave up as it became clear you didn't get through her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIll have to get some rangers out here so then can pack this all up.\u201d The girl said \u201cI really can't believe the nerve of some people, leaving things . Oh well, not like ill catch them now\u201d She then start walking away. Moving away from the shoe instantly you watch as the giant dark haired girl walks away from you. If only you were a little bigger she would be able to see you. It really sucks but your gonna have to send some more time out here until you see someone else. Maybe you can form a plan with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thats not the end, as Hapu was walking away she didn't see something on the ground. The people who camped here didn't have the decency to not pick the food from the Pokemon. Eating fruits from the trees and berries for the Pokemon. Even worse throwing it onto the ground making it very easy for someone to trip on the slippery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hapu walked away she put her boot onto a half eaten Oran Berry. Unable to keep her balance she found herself tripping over. Falling down onto her rear and hitting onto the ground. She landed hard and didn't like the sudden pain. \u201cGeez that hurt, I'm really glad no one was round to actually see that\u201d She said to herself, thinking that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't, in fact you saw the whole thing. Even worse you felt it. You just watched as the girl walked away in disappointment when suddenly, she went off balance. You watch as the titan lost her balance and fell back. For a second you thought she wouldn't fall onto you but frankly you were able to realise the truth. You try to run away but your little legs couldn't carry yourself very far. You watch over your shoulder as her pants keep coming down and down. You close your eyes as the pain suddenly happened. You felt yourself get squished by her enormous (To you) rear as you get pushed into the ground. She sat down onto you with her entire weight as you really want her to get off you. You like butts but not when they're killing you. You hear her say something but you couldn't really hear anything. Anything she's saying coming muffled thanks to the massive ass onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHapu getting up from her sitting position stood up onto her legs. You were taken for the ride as well cause frankly... you've been pushed into her butt. Rising up you were nothing but an imprint. She stood up to her full height as she dusted herself off. Knocking the dirt off of her and almost you. You got free as you almost fell to the ground, but you manage to grab onto her pants as you were officially going with her. Hapu angrily calmed herself, not liking to do something that can be viewed as immature or childish. Tripping over something that she didn't even see was pretty immature. Walking away she planned to go to the rangers station and tell them about this. Hopefully though she can find the people responsible. Hapu wouldn't hurt them of course, she's nicer then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she is willing to give out a scolding that they need to here. What would they have done if a Bewear was drawn to them or their snacks. Chances are they would be in the hospital right now. Beware is a dangerous Pokemon that everyone needs to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she walked, you were holding onto her pants. With your arms holding on as you dangled like a little keychain. You don't want to fall so maybe moving around her would be smart. Although your thinking that maybe you should go to her pouch over there. Wait until she stops moving so you can get her attention safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The golfer began to giggle, amused by the boy's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess one of us is an eager little horndog.\" The Golfer snidely mocked the boy. The boy huffed, and his fists clenched in anger. Kahili let out a cold snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, someone is looking quite miffed. Let's hope you can channel that anger in something more <u><i><b>productive</b></i></u>.\" Kahili added in a tone that was colder than the summit of Mt.Coronet. With no further words, she presents her light pink colored soles to him. Her flat medium sized toes waved at him in such a mocking way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy resists the urge to make his own insult at the bitch, and walk towards the monolithic appendages. For a couple of seconds, he got a small sampling of the almost almighty odor. It is a pure stench of spoiled eggs, sour cheese, and stale popcorn. His legs became like a jelly, and his head starts to swirl around like a spinda. After a while, he soon regained his balance. And then began to breathe through his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That was unimaginably gross\u2026yet at the same time\u2026kinda sexy.'</i> The boy grimly reflects as he places his hands on her sweltering flesh...only to side on the skin likes it's a heavily greased metal. The dominant task-mistress let out quite a few surprising chortles. The boy formed a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well lookie here, the queen bitch is ticklish.'</i> The boy cruelly mused as he was about to have his vengeance. Until Kahili quashed any would be attempts of insubordination in a mere <b><i>instant</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope you aren't about to do anything idiotic <u><i><b>little boy.</b></i></u>. For this is for my own pleasure, and definitely not yours. If you so happened to go against me. Well, let's just say it won't be a joyful time for you.\"The older woman said in a too quiet voice and a sneer that almost made your heart skipped a beat. Her left light blue eye looking directly at you through the crevice between her two biggest toes. You hastily nodded your head and began frantically knead her foot. Kahili made a content and motherly smile.\"Good boy, perhaps if you do good enough job. I'll let you have a reward, and let you indulge in your desires. But it's a privilege and it's one that you have to <i>earned</i> first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy heard her words but was way more focus on his arduous task. The feet's texture was a bizarre mixture of hard worked callouses and natural softness. But despite the contradicting feel of the feet, one thing was clear. The damn things were overworked and firm as hell. It took him a good hour and ten minutes of pounding, kicking, and just plain old beating the ever loving rockruff-shit out of her feet. But by some good damn miracle of the tapu, her clods are finally back to the normal consistency of feet. Kahili was fully relaxed and almost went to sleep. But she felt your little hands stop moving, and saw you catching your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleepy half-lidded eyes inspected her feet, and give him an impressed look. She gives him a lax smirk. He was both tired and scared at the same time. Perhaps she is too hard on the boy. The perverted child has proved himself to be a diligent hard worker. Maybe with her guidance, she can teach him to control his desires. And honestly, he looks pretty adorable right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you deserve a reward.\" Kahili intoned with a coy smirk. A part of him was excited to finally play with those feet, but another part is extremely wary of the intimidating as hell woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little boy\u2026you earned this.\" The sleepy golfer gently reassured him as she\u2026</span></div></div>",

So it's best you enjoy it\" Kahili proclaimed as her eyes were directly on him. Her toes frayed and spread, a clear sign she was teasing him further. The boy's legs became like wobbly jello as his nostrils haplessly flared up. Once again, filling up his lungs of the potent odor of the golfer's peds.\"Oh, what is the matter? You were oolging them like a hungry houndor. Hmmm\u2026maybe your sense of common decency finally settled in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's teeth grinded together and his head was hung down in shame and anger.

He can't even look directly at because of the pressure she emitting. The sounds of hardened skin grinding against it each other made goosebumps to form on his skin. Sweat drip his face, and the boy's breathing hitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the steadily increasing loudness,and pace.

The closer it came, the less hope you had that you'd be able to escape it, but with one final push you've managed to pull yourself from underneath its shadow, leaving the giantess to let out a disappointed sigh, when her sole failed to bury you beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily you looked behind, cringing at the sight of her wiggling toes, the giant digits yearning for an opportunity to pummel you like a bug. You then shifted your gaze to her face, noting her smile waver for a second, the girl overall displeased with your opposition to her will. It quickly came back however, once she realized that she can now punish the unruly servant, and properly shape him into his new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, so you're trying to resist?\" Acerola mused, dragging her foot back, and putting it under the table \"Can't say I expected it. After all, who would willingly defy a cutie like me~?\"<br>\r\nWith a flash of her cat-like grin, the whole table suddenly started shaking, as the giantess started pushing at it from beneath, tilting it away from her. Desperately you started clawing at its surface, as you started sliding backward, yelling at the girl to stop.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, though\" She continued, apparently deaf to you struggles \"I'll show you the error of your ways. You will learn to love your new place at my feet. That, I promise~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to fall off, you've managed to grab onto the edge, barely hanging on. You continued to plead with her, beg her to lower the table down... Until you looked down, and saw what was splayed below: a pair flip-flops. Her purple footwear lied right underneath you, their putrid insoles as uninviting as you would've imagined from the look of their owner's feet. Looking back at Acerola, you've noticed that she held a Poke Ball in her hand... and she was about to roll it down the table, with you in its path! She was going to force you down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries intensified, but if there was one thing to learn from your experience so far, it's that Acerola really couldn't care less. With a cheerful cry she dropped the Poke Ball, and watched with glee as it rolled down. You, meanwhile, let out a loud, but squeaky shriek as you dropped down, crashing right in the center of her right shoe. Though alive, your body hurt all over, and you were forced to roll around in pain on the spongy surface of her flip-flop. By the time she made it over, you were already drenched in the residue sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcerola stared you down triumphantly, as if challenging you to try and defy her again. Unable to do so, you could only shoot her a deadly glare. The giantess found it pathetically amusing.<br>\r\n\"Oh please, don't give me that look\" she said mockingly, giggling at your foolish bravado \"This is the price you have to pay for disobeying, and we both know that you can't afford it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauntingly slow, she rose her foot upwards, and the quickly brought its heel down to its shoe, hanging the rest of her meaty sole above you. Having picked up some dirt from the floor, its surface was now splotched with dark patches of moist grime, tarnishing the once semi-clean look they had. Surprisingly, she did it on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, my feet got dirty from that short. I'll leave it to you to deal with this mess\" As she explained your task to you, she waggled her foot left and right, raining down some of that filth around you \"Ooooor, you can continue to defy me, and see where that gets you. I'm curious of that myself, since I've never had to deal with someone this disobedient before. If you push my buttons too hard, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot got dangerously close for a second, as if it was about to stomp you into the insole itself, before she slowly settled it down, carefully burying you within the sweaty folds of her sole. Giving you a couple of stomps, Acerola made sure that you were secured, and suffering underneath her dainty footsteps, before setting out to continue on with her daily routine, and leaving you to your morbid task...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, Acerola wasn't sure what she should do as she waited for the answer from the little bug in her sandals. She didn't really have any plans on what to do to pass the time, she wasn't really eager to go to any nearby city. Being around people could only entertain her for so long. She had taken to dressing in raggedy clothes in order to appear approachable to the people in the cities. Even if her clothes were unappealing, she assumed her natural cuteness would attract everyone to her anyways. And she was always right, at least one or two people from the city would approach her. But they never gave her the attention she wanted. She wanted something more subservient than passing compliments about her cuteness. She wanted a life that she could command and do whatever she wanted with. And now she had you to fulfill that wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Acerola contemplated her situation, you were down below, under her feet in a personal hell. Encased in a world of foot, dirt and sweat you vainly struggled against the spoiled girls foot. Your feelings of humiliation continued to grow as you her foot sweat continued to soak into your clothes and your body. Your hair was soaked and your face was drenched, as if you had just emerged from a pool. Except this pool was filled with a bratty girl's foot sweat rather than clean water. You could've sworn you've only been under her foot for a few minutes at most, how were you already so soaked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most humiliating thing was how much Acerola's putrid foot absolutely dwarfed you. The fold's in the adorable child's foot seemed absolutely massive to you. If some crazy person wanted to, then they could probably crawl into some of the bigger folds and hide from the outside world. You imagine that they would immediately regret it though. You dreaded imagining all of the sweat and grime that was probably trapped in those folds. The idea of being surrounded by Acerola's warm, soft foot flesh, while bathing in a soup of her grime and sweat was a tantalizing-- You stopped yourself mid thought and felt a strange sense of dread wash over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid, did you just describe that brat's foot as soft and warm!? As you were drenched in it's sweat and grime!? The foot of the same girl who had just lovingly taunted you with the delicate swaying of her foot. Once again you stopped yourself. 'Lovingly taunted'!? That cold blooded cutie was torturing you and now-and now you were calling her a cutie too. What was going on!? You were currently trapped under a little girl's foot, trapped between her well worn sandal and dirty foot and you were calling her cute and giving her foot compliments. Why were these thoughts going through your head? Was it Stockholm syndrome? No no, it hasn't been that long. It hasn't even been half-an-hour. Or maybe it has been? The sensation of being under her foot has become so familiar that time seems to have come to a slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you slowly raised your face upwards and pressed it against Acerola's foot, cuddling it like an animal. Up above you Acerola subconsciously registered the sensation of your rubbing and scrunched her toes in delight. The scrunching of her toes caused your head to be absorbed by one of the folds in her foot. As you thought the inside of her folds held a wonderful surprise. Within the fold was an amalgamation of some grime and foot sweat. Your head was quickly enveloped in it, your sense completely overwhelmed by the residue of Acerola's foot. At that moment your entire existence was defined by Acerola's foot and you loved every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole experience had apparently awoken something within you. You realized now that your situation wasn't that bad. At first you thought that being shrunk to a pathetic size was horrible, but now you knew it wasn't that bad. You were lucky that Acerola was the one who found. She was revealing things to you about yourself that you never knew. That you were actually good enough to be the servant of a princess. You never thought you were worthy of such an important position. But she saw potential in you and pushed you to accept your role. The part of you that wanted to resist Acerola disappeared. Perhaps they drowned in the grime and sweat in Acerola's foot fold, but you were alive and knew your place now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it happened, your head was released from the fold of her foot. Your spirit of resistance had been sucked out of you and was forever trapped in the folds of her foot. All that's left was a little bug ready to serve a princess. You fell back into your original position, once again sandwiched between her sandal and her foot. Pressed against your back was a swamp of Acerola's foot sweat and grime. Above you was the source of the sweat and grime. You quickly got to work. Pressing your face into her foot and letting your tongue run along the surface of her foot. The immense amount of sweat flowed off her foot and into your mouth. The taste of the sweat itself was not sweet, but knowing that you were serving an adorable princess, treating her like a princess should be, made the act feel sweet. You continued your task with gusto, occasionally switching to smooching her foot instead of licking it. You were Acerola's now and you would do whatever you could to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis entire time Acerola had been contemplating what she should do to pass the time, and then she suddenly felt your little tongue go to work. Even though she expected this to happen, a blush creeped its way onto her cheeks and shy giggle came out of her throat. \"Wow, I thought the little guy would resist a bit harder. I figured after the display he showed that it would take a while to bust him in.\" She thought coyly. She squatted and looked at the foot you were under lovingly. \"Or maybe that was just an act? That doesn't really make sense but how else would you explain such a sudden change.\" She wiggled her toes in delight. \"Is this what he always wanted? To serve and adorable princess as her foot bug? One couldn't hope for a better fate I guess.\" Regardless of the reasons behind it, Acerola finally got what she wanted. She now had a loyal servant who would do exactly as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what would she do with you?</span></div></div>",

Did... did she know you were coming here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh, i want to pick you up so bad\u201d She gushed as she bent over, bringing her hand to you as you panic. She scoops you up letting you sit on the edge of her hand raising you up to her face. She had a smile that was a mix of many things to you. A little bit of mischief, some pure happiness and a lot of adore coming from her smile at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm surprised. I thought you were gonna take a lot more time getting here. But i guess those tiny legs are faster then i thought.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait who are you? Did you know i was coming here? Were you spying on me?\u201d You say panicking. The creepy girl laughed covering her mouth before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Acerola. The Ghost Princess. Yes i know who you are and yes I've been following you. Well not lately, lately I've just been telling my ghost pokemon to stalk you and push you here\u201d She said as your eyes go open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGhost Pokemon! I didn't see no ghost Pokemon!\u201d You tell her as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean i told them not to be seen, what did you think you came to this creepy store because you wanted to.\u201d She said raising a good point. Of course you would normally not go to this creepy place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly got a child down your spine. \u201cWait, me being small. Did you have something to do with that or....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond, but instead stuck out her tongue in an adorable fashion, showing that she actually did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour in full panic now as your afraid of Acerola. You want to get away from her but you know you cant, not as long as she holds you up to this height. Which is why you think you need to talk your way out of this and stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, why would you go through all the effort to not only shrink me but coral me here?\u201d You ask her as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause i wanted a friend!\u201d She said gaining a big smile. \u201cI always have trainers come here to do the Trail but they always leave right after. Then theres the other Trial Captain\u2019s but they don't like spending time with me either i think. They probably think I'm too creepy or something. I brought you here because i wanted someone to talk to. A Friend\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl isnt evil. She's just Lonely. Very lonely it seems. And since she's a child she probably doesn't see whats wrong with kidnapping and shrinking another human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait but why did you shrink me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can never leave\u201d She said hugging you to her chest, Showing that this could be good for you.</span></div></div>",

Ill grow you in a week. but until then your small with me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged you against her chest once again and you hug her back.

She initially expected a bit more resistance. After some thinking she got an idea. Acerola bent down and dropped you by her feet, right onto the ground of the store as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm I'm not really sure what i want to play, so I'm gonna need some time to think about it\u201d Acerola said down to you.

You move forward to her ghostly foot and jump right on top of it. Acerola giggled as she felt you hug her foot. You didn't know exactly what to do so you just played on her foot waiting for Acerola to come up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd an idea she got, seeing you play with her feet gave her a fun idea for a game you two can play.

A fucking hiker high on spoiled berries? So you went with the least hazardous choice\u2026which is still pretty hazardous now that you have thought about it. But it was too late tor that because cause your goal was quite literally staring you in the face with ten chubby faces of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistant memories of the girl ringed throughout your head as you carefully tiptoed to the appendages. Ever since you and your parents moved to Ula'Ula island from central Unova, you saw a few glimpses of the girl. She was a relatively short petite girl lacking much feminine definition or curve. Almost making her look like a child in honesty. But her once small height a far cry titan no thanks to you be a measly head taller than the average doll. Even a short stack like her is like a grandiose titan out of a storybook when compared to you. Something you are made painfully aware of.<br>\r\nDespite not officially meeting face to face, the girl always seemed to be always have a cutesy smile on her face. Like she is in a near perpetual state of playful optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can hope that she stays that she stays that way even when rudely awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go to the left foot exclusively due to the fact that it is stretched out farther than it's counterpart. But inadvertently the leg connected to it was allowed to showcase it's delicately curved litheness in it's entirety. Stopping you in your tracks as your mind started to drift off the topic of survival and to a gutter. And how can your hormone ridden mind not ignore the delicate softness of her gentle sun-kissed skin. Made moist due to the rays of warm alolan sun. Even if you look past the thinner thigh than her silky violet panties was clear in your line slight. Clinging to her crotch so snugly to point where you can see a clear definite shape of her perky vagi-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n' ALRIGHT OKAY! That is enough...observing..lets get back to waking her up.' With a nervous chuckle, you quickly got your barrings back. Ignoring the now half-erected dick between your legs pulsing with blood, you scrambled to the middle section of her pudgy \"small\" foot. Sweaty palms grasped the under foot flesh in a erratic stride. Your fingers constantly clenched various clumps of what was basically a lovely mixture of sweat, sand, dirt, and plant stuff. All you breath in was a thin damp humid vapor of spoiled cabbage and crushed flowers. Making you gag ever now and again due to your small size. Despite the disgusting wet sounds your hands made with ever tug and the soggy fruity stench that just wafted off of her feet. You couldn't help but think the feel of her sole was...kinda..nice. Like it was certainly very supple and soft..but somehow wasn't overly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it retains a certain amount of firmness. In a way that simply felt...natural if that makes sense. Even the smell reflected because while it is fairly strong and intense it wasn't gut-wrenching foul. It was more like a weird perfume you buy from a farmer's market. For some reason your head start to steadily hotter like you coming down with. And your fully engorged dick that was up against your inner thigh was been attacked with dull pangs of pain. But you didn't dwell on your state of health as you felt her foot rising up a few feet. Causing you to turn your sweating head to see that her chunky toes began to wiggle in a slow up and down fashion. Showing that the nails was painted in a transparent light pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Holy crap! It's working! Just a little more and I be home free!' With hope now brewing in your belly. Your pace starts to speed up! You can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens shortly afterwards?</span></div></div>",

You instead seem to have ended up in what seems a bedroom. The second thing you notice is that everything around you is literally huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge, green bed in a corner, a huge clock resembling a Dhelmise on a wall; a lot of books placed on a colossal bookshelf; most of them seem to be about cooking, judging by the titles you manage to read on some of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door opening makes you turn your head as a gigantic green shoe steps in, a giantess enters the room.<br>\r\n\"That was delicious!\" she merrily chirps, rubbing her belly. You take a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has green shoes and two long, tanned legs. She's wearing gray shorts on a gray, sleeveless shirt with suspenders. A pink shirt can be seen beneath it. This giantess has dark green eyes; she has her long, green hair in two large ponytails. A smile is painted on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything, the giantess looks right at you. Curiously, she extends her arm to pick you up.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you a tiny guy? How did you get so small little one?\" she asks, in a mix of concern and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her about the light and that you don't have any idea of how you got here shrunken.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" she exclaims once you finish your story.<br>\r\n\"Quite the predicament you got in.\" <br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"My name is Mallow anyway. Nice to meet you.\" she says cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"And tell you what, maybe I can help you.\" she says, with an expression of someone who's pondering something.<br>\r\n\"How? You know how to grow me back?\" you ask hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly. Sorry.\" she apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. How did you even manage to get in this?<br>\r\nMallow continues.<br>\r\n\"But maybe you could stay with me... at least until we manage to find a way to grow you to your original size.\" she suggests.<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could take care of you. What about it? Want to stick with me?\" she asks with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the idea. You're alone, people would easily crush you thinking you are a bug. And Mallow seems really determined to help you, even though you just met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she seems also a bit too excited about the whole thing. She could easily hurt you... or worse if, she isn't careful enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you take a decision...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After making sure there wasn't any giants lurking around you made your move. You run up and look around. There was a tent at the back and a small beach chair next to a small fire pit. However the thing that caught your attention was the small pot near the fire. Your mouth was literally drooling at the smell coming out of it. You don't know whats in there but you want some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see any giant around so you just have to wait for the chef to come back. Considering that their not going to let their food burn. You move and hide, making sure you won't get stepped on. Finally after about five minutes you watch the chef return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a young girl, she had a slim petite frame with twin green tails. She had a denim overalls under normal clothes. She came back and went to the pot dropping some herbs in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what a sweet and innocent girl would be doing here but regardless, you want some of that food. She grabbed a wooden spoon and started spinning the meal around. She lifted it up and you saw her taste some of the golden stew. She looked very satisfied with the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, but still not my best\u201d She explained as she got up \u201cIm thinking a couple more mushrooms should fix that\u201d You then watch as the girl got up \u201cAnd if i remember quickly i saw some on the way\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl then slipped on some sandals and walked in the direction she came from. She towered over you when she passed over you. You luckily weren't found as you go to the pot, however she came back so have to quickly hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should probably move this, don\u2019t want it to get burned\u201d The Green haired girl then put on mittens and moved it away from the fire. She then went to grab the Mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you knew she was completely gone you ran up. You still couldn't see what was in there however you have a chance now. Theres a stump not too far away so you could jump in, however it might be quite hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option is waiting for the girl to come back, get her attention and hope that she will give you some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see her carrying some herbs as you wave your hands up, jumping around hoping she would look down. She didn't see you however, as her foot slams next to you knocking you on your ass as she arrives at the pot of food. Without even seeing you, she crouched down to get closer to the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this motion also led to her having her ass hover just over you as you fear what might happen. If she fell over or just simply sat down onto the ground, then you won't eat her food. in fact you won't be eating anymore Point Blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run from under the roof that was her ass as you look at her, putting herbs and stirring the pot. With the biggest scream you ever had your shout at her hoping to get her to look down. It seemed to work as she looked down to you by her foot. It wasn't very hard for her to see you at this point, having the reaction expected her to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!!\u201d She said nervously falling on her ass as she was startled by you.

Its been about 15 minutes and both of you have gotten over what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Mallow, guess i just wasn't thinking straight. I was beyond hungry\u201d You say scooping up the stew in your arms as you were far to small to a utensil, \u201cBut i got to say, This is the greatest food I've ever tasted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i am a pretty good chef\u201d She said proudly boasting. \u201cPlus I've been working on that meal for well over an hour. So i guess its good you came alone, someone to share with i suppose\u201d She said \u201cSo, what now. What are you going to do after you've eaten your food\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... i don't really know. I didn't really think that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you want you can stay with me.\u201d Mallow said with a big smile</span></div></div>",

Walking forward you arrive at the side of her body. They're you could see her breasts squished against the mat. You didn't get the sight for long as she grabbed you and tossed you onto her back. You land softly as you arrive right between her shoulder blades. Looking down you could see not only her bareback, but the bra strap she has against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it starts now. Like i said do a good enough job and ill put you near my feet\u201d Mina said as that was enough to get you started. Walking forward you lean down and massaged her back. It wasn't tense, not at all. Not surprising considering how she is. You try to get around, making sure to get every part of her back. Not only that but you try to drive into her skin as much as you can. If you want that Foot reward, you've got to show her your worth being near her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, looking back you've really fallen for this girl. Well for fallen for her feet might be more accurate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... Your doing great back there\u201d Mina said as she had her eyes closed, enjoying it. \u201cI think your doing a better job on my back then you did on my feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that you stop, what if you do too good. She won't want you near her feet but rather on her back. Stopping you slow down your progress. Making sure that she won't think your great at the back massages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Mina noticed the sudden change and realised what you were trying to do. It didn't bother her, in fact she slightly expected it. Seeing that you were so dedicated to the foot massage, Mina really doesn't know if she should reward you with it, or punish you by not getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe playfully she can stretch it out. After all.... a back makes a great canvas.</span></div></div>",

Every step he took felt like lead was inside the bones of his leg and feet. His heart is beating like he just ran over Poni three times, and his breathing is getting distressingly shallower and hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he came back her daunting feet, he simply looked at them at first. To him, her close was beyond massive and reminded him of a tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in they were beautiful and awe-inspiring to look at it in a distance, but absolutely deadly and imposing as hell once you got closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their complex and hot aroma in his lungs, and his eyes slightly watering up. His slippery palms gingerly caressed and groped the balls and toes. He let out a soft \"Eep!\" as her toes gripped his arms, and her pad gently rubbing his lower body and legs. The boy looked up and saw Mina giving him a not so stoic smile. It did ease him a bit, but this is essentially his <i>first</i> intimate moment with someone else in his life. So the expression brought little relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was also Mina's first time too, but the seventeen years old is simply better at hiding it. The older girl bit her lip, as she felt him feeling them. So many emotions start to bubble and grow in her heart. Disappointment and anger for his lackluster and cautious actions. Arousal and passion for what he is giving her.And...a growing <i><b>love</b></i> for <i>him</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these feelings continue to grow and intensify, Mina is quickly becoming fucking tired of him doing what is basically <u><i><b>foreplay</b></i></u>. She wants him to <b>adore</b> her big as hell feet and the rest of her tall body. Not treat her like some dangerous pokemon could leash out at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought of that has both insulted and hurt her greatly. As the adorable cutie continues with his mediocre fondling, Mina's stony facade is starting to steadily erode as her bottled up feelings is starting hit <i>critical mass</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Good Acreus, he needs to step it up. Because I'm going to fucking burst!'</i> Mina feverishly thought as her fists tightly clenched. Of course, the boy is blissfully ignorant of the giant girl's emotional turmoil.

She wanted you to stop, but she was enjoying this as much as you were. \"W-Wait! Let me sit down. J-Just.... Ohh! Just don't stop, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa quickly walked behind a tree to get some privacy. She then quickly lowered her shorts and undies, revealing her soaked pussy. Back inside, you were crawling deeper and deeper through her damp cave. Her inner walls were squishing and pulling you in deeper and her heart-rate increased from your pleasure. Just then, something pushed you in deeper, or in this case, someone. Nessa was fingering herself, pushing you towards the entrance of her womb. You were able to regain your balance from her fingers.  You watched them enter and exit her pussy with a steady rhythm. You looked back at her cervix, the gateway to her womb. You walked closer to it, and pulled down your pants. You begin to masturbate with one hand, the other was leaned onto the wall of the cervix. You leaned closer to the hole and began to lick the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh! R-Right there! Don't stop!\" Nessa moaned louder as she shivered with delight. Nessa's pussy was beginning to flood with her juices, but you didn't care, you wanted to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.......AHhhhh..............AHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Nessa screamed. You both climaxed at the same time. (or in this case...\"Dynamaxed.\" Eh? Eh? No? You're no fun.) Her juices pushed you out back out of her vagina and onto the ground.You were completely soaked from head to toe. You gazed up at Nessa. She was still panting from climax that you gave her. A satisfied look was on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That......*pant*......was.....*pant*...... amazing.\" Nessa finally spoke. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked you up and gave you a kiss. You smiled back and said, \"Your welcome.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should just ride on my shoulder for now.\" Nessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" You replied, but you weren't happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of resting, Nessa placed on her shoulder and continued walking. The sun was already setting in the horizon, giving the sky an orange color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a Pokemon Center nearby. We'll stay there for the night.\" Nessa suggested.  You both would've gotten to the Professor earlier, if it hadn't been from a certain \"distraction.\" (Ok, I'm wrong, a lot of people would love to have sex with Nessa if they were in a similar scenario. I mean have you SEEN the internet!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then went to the help desk and asked Nurse Joy for a room to spend the night in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be for one......and a half?\" Nurse Joy said with a puzzled look. She's never seen someone that small before and she didn't want to sound mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. We'll split it.\" You joked. Nurse Joy then gave Nessa a room key and showed them to their room. Once in the room. Nessa placed her bag on the side of the bed, placed you on top of the pillow, took off her sandals, and began to undress. She pulled off her shirt, which revealed white bra with blue and orange markings, similar to her shirt's appearance. She then pulled down her panties. A small stain was where her vagina was. You remembered why it's there, and you had no regrets.     <br>\r\nShe then walked to the bed and began to lay down, but you wanted to get something off your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nessa?\" You began. \"I know we just met, but just wanted to say.....umm....I....  I love you.\" Nessa's faced turned bright red from comment. She then smiled back and said, \"I love you too.\" and gave you a kiss on your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then turned off the lights and went to sleep. What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: You couldn't sleep, so you decided to explore her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: You had a tiring day, so you went to sleep.  </span></div></div>",

You know you have no choice, she might as well throw you in the ocean or who knows what she'll do if you don't obey! You answer: \"Y-y-yes Nessa... Thanks for willing to take me to Professor Magnolia...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then lowers you to the ground, \"look, it's really hot here in this part of Galar, so I've been sweating a lot. And all this swimming I've done made my body really warm too. She then places you onto the sole of her sandal, you can see the prints of her toes and her heel very clearly, she's been wearing these a lot. Nessa then places you on the sole and rests her sweaty foot on top of you. Your mouth is pushed against the skin between her big toe and her index toe, with your nose squished right in between them. Your feet reach abuot just to the middle of her foot. \"Ah, that feels kinda good with you down there, feels like you'll be a great support for the ball of my foot.\" You try to move, but it is hopeless, her foot is keeping you pinned to the sole completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, take a deep breath. Now.\" You hear those words and, you know your nose is right in between her toes... But you don't seem to have much of a choice. You take a really deep breath and Nessa laughs; \"Oh my, this is going to be so much fun! Did you like that?\" You got hit by a rather intense smell of sweat, though even her toes are extremely beautiful, they are extremely sweaty as well. You are still a little dizzy from the intense smell... But at the same time... You kind of enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Yes I think you will be a great insole, keep breathing like that while I walk and I'll treat you moderately well. Got that?\" You want to nod but instead you just, take another deep breath to show her you will obey, getting the smell of her toejam firmly in your lungs. \"Oh? Good pet, well done. Keep that up.\" You keep breathing in the smell of her toejam while Nessa straps her foot properly into her sandal. She seals the straps very tightly, increasing the pressure on you and preventing you to even move a single inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! We're ready! Let's go my new little insole. Oh, did I tell you yet that I like to jog there? And since it's so close I always take a long way around. Well, not like you can complain about that now anyways.\" Nessa then starts jogging, and you feel the pressure at every step, your body is being slightly squashed into her sole. However, your body seems rather sturdy, it's as if your body has been condensed into a relatively sturdy version. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... Here starts your journey to Magnolia's Lab...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nessa keeps on running, every step of the way is heavy on your body. You can still hardly move your mouth as it is pressed shut by Nessa's sole. Logically, you keep smelling through your nose, and you deeply inhale the scent of her toes with every breath. \"You like it down there?\" Nessa says with a teasing tone, she then wiggles her foot to the sides and then wiggles her toes as well, \"Hmm... I think you do! Hey don't worry, it is only going to get sweatier and sweatier... Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like you drew the short end of the stick by going with Nessa. And indeed, she is right, she is getting sweatier and sweatier. You can almost taste her toejam by now after inhaling it over and over for so long. Just, every singly breath reminds you of your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey! Look, Magnolia's Lab is right there! Well, too bad for you, but I am not even on half the distance of my usual jog, so we're gonna go alllll the way around. You wouldn't mind right?\" You inhale and try to move but, you can't move a single inch and are just forced to keep smelling in between her toes. Nessa then commands; \"Hey, it is getting really sweaty there, I want you to start licking as well, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitantly open your mouth, knowing you don't have much choice... You extend your tongue and start licking right below her toes, on the upper end of the ball of her foot. You do one big long lick and taste all the grime and sweat from the bottom of her foot. \"Oh! Hey! That feels kinda nice little one, keep doing that the entire run!\" You keep licking as ordered and clean the sweat off her sole, while smelling her toejam, a truly torturous position... Or is it? It is almost like you kind of start to like it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Yes that hits the spot! You licking down there feels really good, you know?\" Nessa says out of breath from jogging. And just like this, the jogging continues for another 30 minutes, licking and smelling Nessa's foot while being firmly pinned under her sole. However, it is almost like... Are you starting to enjoy the smell and taste of your current prison?! ...No! That can't be! ...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Nessa comes to a halt. \"Phew, nice run. I know you can't see but we are in the middle of a forest now, half of my jog is done now. I tend to take a small break and take my sandals off. Hmmm... I think I have just the perfect task for you...\" Nessa then takes off her sandals one by one, the sweat dripping from her feet. She then looks at you, firmly pressed into her sandal's sole. \"Ohhh? Did you enjoy yourself?\" You look up at her but you are too exhausted to even respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes a hairband out of her hair and wraps it around you, \"H-hey what's that for?!\" You ask, with a shock in your voice. Nessa replies, \"Just to make sure you're not going anywhere... While completing your temporary new job.\" Nessa then sits down and stretches her legs and wiggles her feet. She then places her sandals next to her and lays you face down on her left sandal. \"You see those imprints? My toes and heel can clearly be seen... I want you to lick them clean, I don't wanna see any of that grime on it. So start licking, now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, you open your mouth and start licking her sandal, once again you can taste her sweat. However, this time it tastes more condensed, like several layers of sweat are on this sandal. \"Ohh, good little pet, you've become so obedient! I think I might keep you instead!\" You are shocked hearing Nessa's words and lick faster and faster to please her, making a whimpering sound, hoping that she will let you go eventually. \"Oh? You are indeed being very obedient, almost as if you really want me to let you go eventually. Hmm... We'll see. Just keep going now.\" Nessa takes a sip from a bottle and relaxes while you are licking every inch of her sandal clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes she stands up. \"So, little pet, you've cleaned my left sandal, guess I'll put you in my right sandal now then.\" She puts you on the sole and quickly her foot enters to lock you into place.\" She then firmly fastens her sandal and you are pressed thoroughly into her sole. \"Okay pet, you know the drill, get licking and smelling. It kind of cools my foot, start!\" With that signal, you start licking and smelling again while Nessa starts to run again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step pushes into you, again and again. Meanwhile, with every breath you smell Nessa's work-out sweat from in between her toes and also taste her sporty sweat with every single movement of your tongue. However, you almost start to like it... You lick faster and inhale more intensely, Nessa notices your change in behaviour: \"Hmm... Oh? -she breathes in- Are you, actually, -she breathes out- liking this? It sure seems like it? -she breathes in- Well.. I could certainly, -she breathes in- keep you, you know?\" Her proposition is met with silence and the jogging continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, she finally comes to a halt again, all you can taste and smell is Nessa's sweat, but at the same time, you really enjoyed it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then bends down, \"Since you started to like it down there, what exactly do you want; We can go inside and then we have two choices, I can either bring you to Magnolia OR I can do an experiment on you with Sonia that I've been interested in... However, I can also go for another lap... But who knows where we end up then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it be? To Magnolia? Letting me experiment on you, or a really long walk again?\"</span></div></div>",

So you actually liked this position, didn't you?\" You are somewhat ashamed to admit that you actually loved being dominated by Nessa's feet. Nessa that presses her foot onto your body, \"kiss my foot to show me your loyalty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply cannot resist... this hot ebony Goddess is teling you to kiss her feet... You just do it. You kiss her feet and you hear Nessa laugh. \"Oh god, you are so fun to toy with... Come, it's time to have some real... Permanent fun with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are somewhat shocked to hear the word 'permanent'. You simple remain in your position as Nessa walks into the lab. You can hear her greet professor Magnolia, \"Hello professor, Sonia is in the back right? I need her for something.\" You then barrely hear and answer and Nessa starts walking again. You are still addicted to smelling her toes while she walks, still very sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then comes into a room and you hear Sonia's voice, \"Oh, hey Nessa! What are you here for? Don't tell me you wanna try those morphing experiments after all do you!\" ...Morphing experiments? You wonder what that might mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then replies, \"Hey Sonia, well, yes I am still interested in the morphing experiments, I actually brought a test subject.\" Sonia then says: \"Oh, really? Wow... Not sure where you found a willing person but, yeh, trying to get Ditto's morphing ability onto a human seems rather difficult but I think we may have found a way. I just need someone to test it on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then takes her sandal off and shows you to Sonia, you are laying there, exhausted and blissful, drooling from the pleasure you've been given by Nessa. \"This one is a willing test subject, he's small because he also volunteered for other tests so he is rather used to it!\" Nessa claims, which seems like a very convenient lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then asks Sonia: \"Hey Sonia, you mind leaving and letting me do this, he can get kinda shy so it's better if it's only me here, you can trust me I won't do anything crazy!\" Sonia frowns but then thinks nothing of it, \"Alright Nessa, good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then takes you in her hand and places you in a machine. It's a small container, which quickly fills with pink gas. Nessa didn't close the container yet and asks you a final question: \"So, with the help of this 'Ditto gas' we're gonna morph you into an object. So, which one would you want? Wanna become my own hotpants or wanna turn into my sandals? Some of your body's features will remain functional... But I will decide which ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide, do you want to turn into Nessa's hotpants, her sandals, or... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the open lid of the container... Or; Do you try to escape?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then looks at you, \"Yeh, I figured as much, you really liked travelling in my sandals didn't you?\" Nessa then lets out an evil laugh, \"Ohhh... This is gonna be good...\" she closes the lid of the container you're in and you start getting very sleepy. You see Nessa take off one of her sandals and putting it in another container, also filling with pink gas. \"I already know which body parts are going to remain functional for you... This will be great fun...\" Nessa then pushes a ton of buttons and at the sound of a lot of beeping you fall into a forced slumber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darkness takes you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up. You, look aroud you and try to move but, you cannot move. You cannot even turn your head. As you slowly regain your consciousness, you start to lookg around and see that you are stuck in... Stuck in Nessa's sandal itself! You face is still functional, you can see, smell and breathe. But you cannot move it at all. Then Nessa looks at you with a smile, gets you out of the container and holds a mirror above you. \"Behold, my new permanent home for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked! Devestated! What has happened to you?! You see Nessa's sandal, and you see that your face has been morphed into it. Your face is right at the toe section of the sandal and... You see something else, your crotch, both your balls and your penis are also visisble and you can move them slightly. They are right on the location where the ball of Nessa's foot would be. You notice they are somewhat melded with the sandal, so they are a little deeper into the sandal and don't get squashed as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nessa... How did you...\" You ask. Nessa just answers with a laugh, \"This is an experiment we've been busy with for a while now. I can't believe I found a person to test it on. This is just perfect, you will be my new permanent sandal, forever. Well, until I sell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then puts you on the floor and enters the sandal. Her big toe and index toe are right around your face, with her toejam firmly pushing onto your mouth and nose. The ball of her foot is gently pressing against your penis and your balls, instantly making you hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then fastens her foot into the sandal, very tightly. She then speaks up: \"So, you are now my orgasm sandal! You will lick and smell my feet while I walk, all day long. Meanwhhile, the taste and smell in combination with the rubbing of my foot against your crotch will make you orgasm! Over and over!\" Nessa then takes a step and presses her foot onto you, \"And there is nothing you can do about it! Whenever you orgasm I am not sure yet if I will make you lick it up or not but, we'll see about that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then walks with you under her foot and Sonia shows up. Nessa presses her toes firmly into your face so you can't say a word. \"Oh hey Sonia, yeah, the test subject didn't wanna do it! So I am just taking him home again... Too bad huh?\" Sonia then waves her goodbye with a dissapointed expression on her face. Nessa then goes outside and starts to walk around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feet her foot pressing against your crotch, but you cannot move, not even a single inch, you get more and more excited with every step she takes. \"Come on, I know you love this, start licking and smelling.\" You obey your new owner and start licking and smelling, you couldn't really resist anyways. Your mouth is firmly pressed against the upper end of the ball of her foot, right below her toes. You start licking there as much as you can. It tastes really salty and sweaty... But it's Nessa's sweat, so you love it. Your nose is somewhat pinched between her index toe and her big toe, forcing you to take deep breaths constantly, inhaling Nessa's sweat very deeply with every breath. \"Good insole! That's just like it, I love feeling you under my sole like that, it's like I have a toy to play with while running. So, let's get going my new permanent insole!\" Nessa says with a sarcastically sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then starts running and the pressure on your face and crotch increases. You keep smelling her toejam very deeply with every breath and you keep licking her sweaty sole over and over. You enjoy it so much, you love being in this position, completely at Nessa's mercy. After a step or 50 you came... splashing your load onto Nessa's sole. \"Oh? Good insole! Well done!\" Nessa then just keeps walking and you are forced to keep smelling her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Nessa stops walking and sits down. She takes her foot slightly out of the sandal and places the location where you came right above your face. \"Hmm... Something sticky and warm is on the middle of my sole now... Lick it off. Extend your tongue, now.\" You extend your tongue and Nessa whipes your own cum onto your tongue, over and over. She drags the sole of her foot across your small tongue several times. You are forced to swallow a mixture of your own cum and Nessa's sweat. However, you mainly taste Nessa's sweat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning her sole entirely, she takes off the blue strap of her sandal, and... She switches her feet! \"Yes, you guessed it, these are universal sandals for left and right. If I just change the blue strap I can switch my feet between them. I guess you know what that means right?\" Before you can react, her other foot is now on you, and she secures it tightly. You start licking the ball of this foot, it is really sweaty as well! Meanwhile, you are forced to smell really deeply between her toes. At times, she even pinches your nose on purpose, and makes you hold your breath for a few seconds, after which you start inhaling rapidly and deeply, getting the scent of Nessa's sweat thoroughly into your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, yes! Just like that! I am gonna pinch your nose every now and the so you really get my scent in your lungs all the time.\" Nessa says while she slightly wiggles her foot back and forth, \"Hmmm... Someone is getting really excited from this!\" You start getting hard again from all the sensations, the smell, the taste and the feeling of her smooth sole rubbing against your croch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa then stands up again, \"Okay! Let's go for my second lap! Ready? Let's go!\"<br>\r\nAnd so it continues, you're licking and smelling Nessa's feet, orgasming on her sole every now and then. This seems to be your new life now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For Nessa, she was looking out far into the ocean, just enjoying the sight and relaxing. Being a champion in Galar wasn\u2019t easy. It was much like a celebrity, hounded by paparazzi, fans wanting her autographs. And insane schedule that she desperately wants to put down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich makes the times like this so much sweater. She can just take time, and really appreciate life. Of course she would not take away the Gym Battles for a second, as she loves being a gym leader. She does love this more though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you run up closer to the giant girl, you got to admit you took your time and admired her beauty. She really was something else, almost godsend in a way. No doubt the size aspect makes her much more beautiful. Funnily enough it was almost like she Dynamaxed to get this big. Of course your small and she\u2019s not actually a giantess, but it was still something funny to reflect on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over to her thigh, thinking that it would be the easiest way to get her attention, and the after that your not really sure. Hopefully she will be kind to you, truth be told you couldn\u2019t imagine this woman being harsh. She was far too beautiful for that. As you move over to her dark thigh, you do the first thing that popped into your head. You went over and touched it, pushing into her skin as you hope she could feel this. Sadly though, she just kept looking out into the ocean. A conversation going in her mind that you could not penetrate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d She said to herself, causing you to stop as well \u201cGuess i should head back into Circhester. Get ready for the gym battle tonight\u201d She said to herself as you panic. Wait, she was leaving. Your not ready for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her entire body, like a Pokemon waking in it\u2019s den as you see her start to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a lot of thoughts ran through your mind, but the most pressing was a thought in your mind screaming \u2018Please Don\u2019t Leave Me Alone!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run over and try to grab her thigh, try to hold on before she gets up. That didn\u2019t work though as her skin was that smooth and that flawless and honestly, a little wet. This pretty much gave you no chance to actually get any stable grasp off her thigh, but you were not giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted her rear, you ran over and tried to grab the shorts she was wearing. Seeing this as the next best thing you run and grab. Narrowly getting your grip as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa stood up, taking one last look at the ocean as she turned, ready to go into town. She has a back way to her gym to avoid getting swarmed. Plus she has a whole night before the game. That is if they get past the Gym Challenge, so maybe it will not even happen. Still she had to be there. She got up and started to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you down below, you were gripping onto her shorts as she started walking. Due to the way you were when you grabbed, the only thing you could do was grab onto her... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Onto her rear. You were gripping onto her rear right now. Dangling from it as you knew this was gonna be a tough move for you. Each step she took sent you around. Dangling and bouncing, not to mention you blushed a bit, hanging onto this ass was something odd, but you got to admit you did not hate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you realise that you should probably move, and you do just that. Shifting your arms and start scaling her rear. The sight of the ocean being what you were seeing. You move up and scale up her shorts. This might be a bit inappropriate, in fact if she finds you there she might get angry but it was the only spot you could be safe at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move up and climb her shorts, getting up until you reach the top. You almost lost your grip right there, almost falling down and getting left in the wake of this dark girl. Something you did not want to happen really. More reason to climb in.\u2028\u2028That\u2019s right, you were about to climb into her shorts. A little embarrassing, no doubt about that, but you were gonna have to do it. To be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top and lower yourself foot first down. You kick your way in as you position yourself in. You dig your way in as you were looking at the ground she was just at. Her butt moving with each step that she took as it was really something else. Guess your staying with here for... well you have no idea for how long. She hasn\u2019t felt you though, so that was kind of good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, you just need to relax. You want to get found by this beauty, but not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time, but Nessa made it back to the gym. Going into the back entrance, she did not meet up with anyone until she arrived back at her quarters. Really the one place she could really go and relax at.<br>\r\n\u2028She goes in and turns on the lights, unaware of her little passenger that has came into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve tried to enjoy the ride as much as you can. It was simply... well amazing. Granted it was a little perverted... well very perverted, but it was logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that was what you were telling yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would seem your choice was just about to stab you in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nessa went over to a chair, ready to sit down. You notice this and instantly panicked. She turned around and you tried to quickly get out, seeing the seat right below you as she started to lower her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Pushing you onto your back as you could do nothing against the giant rear. The giant rear far too powerful for you as you get stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot to admit though, it was nice to feel yourself under a butt. Granted this was not really what you wanted to happen but... could be worse. As she lifted her feet off of the floor to relax more, the pressure became more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to deal with it though, cause her ass was too big and too powerful for you. You pause for a while, just accepting it was on you. Eventually she will have to get up, and then you will make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Nessa was glad to relax and get off of her feet, however there was something odd. She was feeling something under her butt. Weird? She was pretty sure there was nothing there when she sat down. Her curiosity getting to her as she wanted to know what it was. So after a little bit of sitting, she plants her feet on the ground and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething you noticed, and was happy about. The weight lifted off of you as you drop down onto the chair, breathing some fresh air as you were happy. You survived getting sit on, so that probably means your more dense and tough. Which is good, given your size. Now she is gonna do something and you can wait here and recover. Recover and think of your next pl-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she can see you. That works too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause right now, she turned around and had her hands on her knees. Looking right down at you as you see she was very shocked. However with the things she has seen, this didn\u2019t last for long and she seemed to be a bit... angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... another crazy fan. Even going around to shrink themselves just to spy on me\u201d She said as you panic. You don\u2019t know what she is saying and meaning pursue, but you know you have to clear things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait woah! Not like that\u201d You say standing and calming her \u201cI don\u2019t even know who you were. I have been trying to get your attention for so long. Since you were at the beach\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally...\u201d She said looking down and thinking about this for a while \u201cYou don\u2019t know who i am? Well i can\u2019t really disprove that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. My name is (Your Name)\u201d You say passing by. Something she noticed \u201cUh... where am i? I\u2019ve been on your shorts but i was focusing on not really falling down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were on my shorts? Why?\u201d She said crossing her arms over as you realise this is how it was going to be for a while. You need to defend yourself right now, and make sure she was nice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like that, i tried your legs but i was too slow. So i had to grab what i could. Just so happen to be your shorts? So... where am i?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how lucky are you for you to be there\u201d She said not believing you as you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, is there anyway i can get you to believe me... I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t given me your name\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNessa. Gym leader\u201d She said as you looked shocked at that. She was a gym leader of Galar, you have never actually seen one. You usually stayed away from the media and all of that. It was something else. It was small, but she could see the genuine look of shock on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi. My name is (Your Name) But you uh... already know that\u201d You say getting a bit more nervous about this \u201cAnyway, i got this small because... well i have no idea. Was just camping in the wild and got small. Thankfully i found you before any Pokemon found me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight...\u201d She said thinking and deciding if she should trust you \u201cWell to answer your question before. Your in my gym stadium. In my own private quarters\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the room even more, wondering and questioned as you look over. You got to admit, it was a nice room. She could see you looking and got your attention back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, listen\u201d She said \u201cI\u2019m not sure i trust you just yet. Let me think about it for a while, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, just hope you come to the right choice\u201d You say as she smiled. Bringing her hand down and grabbing you. You get pulled down and placed right down by her dark feet. Right in between as you try not to really look at it. Knowing how awkward it would be. She is already considering your a weird small pervert, so your not looking at her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around, thinking as she was pondering whether she should trust you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was really good for you, as you were hoping she might be on your side. Rather then the other side. If she is not on your side, your screwed. Either she won\u2019t help you or just let you leave, or she will punish you. At your size, you won\u2019t be able to do anything against her if she wanted to. If you run right now, that\u2019s pretty much admitting you were guilty. So you can only hope for the best, and hope she was on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the giant beauty, until she turned to you. Stepping over as she towered over you. Making you feel small, but still you did not back down. \u201cOkay... so this is what is going to happen\u201d She said as you were listening to what she was saying. She was choosing your fate right now, you just hope it is good.<br>\r\n\u2028Either she trusts you or she doesn\u2019t. One being good, and the other being bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have decided\u201d Nessa started \u201cThat i ____________\u201d</span></div></div>",

You were expecting to get relief or be filled with fear. You don\u2019t know about this option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn idea? What... does that mean?\u201d You question as she smiled wide to you. She brought her hand down and very easily, you found yourself scooped up and pulled up. Her fingers around you as she let you rest in her palm. Her dark skin under you as you feel yourself get lifted up. Almost like it was a comfy seat for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you up and wore a giant smile pointed right at you. She headed over and sat down, crossing her legs as she addressed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you could be a pervert. Or you could really be lost. I might tell you which i truly believe but that doesn\u2019t matter anymore\u201d Nessa said as you were just left confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, i\u2019ll bite. Why does it not matter anymore?\u201d You say to her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause i have decided to keep you\u201d She said simply, giving you a very beautiful smile. You were left confused and amazed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is what i wanted so... thank you? Um are you gonna set up a little bed for me in here or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at you when you said this, finding it very funny as she talked to you \u201cOkay, you clearly don\u2019t understand fully. I am not looking after you, not one bit. I am owning you. Your mine now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d You shout to her. Thinking about it for a long while as you talk to her \u201cWell i guess... that is something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhether you like it or not, i don\u2019t care\u201d She said with a smile as she reached down and grabbed you. She grabbed you and held you close to her body. She new exactly what her body was doing and how it was effecting you \u201cYou and me, we are gonna have so much fun. Your mine now, you should be happy about that. You little pervert\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said that, it sounded nice and kind \u201cI... thanks. Not a pervert though\u201d You say to her as she smiled. You were not fully against it, but you were not hating it either. She grew a smile as she shifted around and placed you in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed over and placed you on her bed as she stood up \u201cWell, i didn\u2019t really get the chance to relax, since i spent all my time with you. You wait there, until i come back. I got business\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait here? I- Okay bye\u201d You say as she looked over her shoulder. Wearing a giant smile to you. You listen as she takes her leave and goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was doing this, you were left by yourself for a long while. Thinking about what just has happened. So your her\u2019s now. Your her property. Maybe you should of said something, no would of been a good place to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t think that though, cause well her body. It was a lot and it was easy to change your opinion. Maybe being with a giant girl isn\u2019t that bad. She was a beauty and she was nice. Well kind of nice. She seems to think your a bit of a pervert, and that was something to notice. Your defiantly on the feeling out process right now. If being hers is something bad, you might just leave. Of course slip away while she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was nice though, of course you would stay with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Nessa returned. Coming back in as she stretched her limbs \u201cWell, it seems i got a challenge tonight. Crowd is gonna be loud. Sucks, i was hoping for a day off. Guess not though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry?\u201d You say back to her as she smiled down to you. She came over to you and sat down. Almost sitting on next to you as she found it very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault\u201d She said as she paused and thought about it for a while \u201cAlmost under my butt again. Only this time it was my doing, instead of yours\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make it sound like i am a pervert?\u201d You say to her as that was not okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, my little pet\u201d She said with a giggle. She brought her hand down and placed it onto her lap. Tapping it a couple of times as she told you basically to move and jump onto her lap. You listen to her and move over, moving over and jumping onto her lap. It was a bit weird to be up there, but you suppose it wasn\u2019t that bad. At least it was on her lap and not something weird like by her feet. By her glorious feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, the more you think about that. The more the pervert thing will be true. Regardless you move over and climb up, you climb up her shorts and go to her lap. Sitting down right onto her left thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNessa above was more then satisfied with the choice she made. Sure it was not perfect, and there was a bit of her thinking that maybe she shouldn\u2019t enslave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side though, you seem to be liking it. Or maybe even considering it, a life like that. She just needs to show you a good time to get you fully on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... what are thinking about?\u201d She questioned as you pause. Thinking about it for a while as you reply to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019m just thinking about what this means going forward. Now that i\u2019m yours. Man still sounds weird\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does...\u201d She said as she smiled \u201cBut hey, since i have a little bit until i have to go. Until then let\u2019s quickly do something\u201d She said as you guess this was the first thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m on board i guess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028\u201cGood, cause i have decided we will ________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was your bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>HOLY CRAP IT WAS NOT THE BED!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked to see your bed you instead noticed what appeared to be a giant gym, and in the middle of it was a silver haired girl wearing what kind of looked like a fighting outfit which made sense considering your location. However, the most noticeable thing about the flat chested girl was her abs. You had never seen a girl rock a pair of abs as well as she did. Sweat glistened down her entire body, leaving you to stare in awe at the silver haired athlete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head to get out of your daze, knowing that simply standing in the middle of the floor in a giant land was just asking to get killed. You had always heard that female martial artists are usually quite caring to those weaker then them, probably because of their strength and how women were always treated as weaker beings, and you were hoping that would shine through for this goddess. Thankfully, the girl was sitting on a bench drinking water, giving you easy access to reach her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, finding a small person climbing up her bare leg might lead to some... misunderstandings. You notice that on the floor under her bench is a duffel bag, presumably hers. This would be a much safer bet to get to her when she's more covered up or calm, either eating time or sleeping. Of course, if she found you in her bag that would probably have some of her \"unmentionables\" in them that could lead to the conclusion that you're a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there's the third choice of just staying near her but never revealing yourself so you can revel in your platinum haired goddess. </span></div></div>",

You landed on something soft. You knew it wasn't clothing because it's too soft, that girl was wearing something more for exercising than sleeping. The item you were on was soft and it smelled nice. You couldn't see what you were on as the inside was pitch black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yawn, this unidentified object was just so soft that you decided to take a nap. You got comfy and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you began to wake up from your nap. You were satisfied with the object you slept on, but now you had two questions remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Where is that silver haired girl?<br>\r\n2. What was it that you were sleeping on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your questions were going to be answered as you heard the bag zip open and came a giant hand. It was that girl from before. A smile was on her face as she licked her lips. You then realize what you were in.........A Marshmallow Bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" You thought to yourself. An eager grin was on her face. You saw her hand come towards you, but you successfully jumped out of the way onto another marshmallow. You watched as the silver haired goddess raised the marshmallow to her face with an eager grin. She licked her lips and threw the marshmallow into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm!\" The girl hummed happily with her hand on her cheek. Before long, she immediately swallowed, sending the marshmallow to her stomach. A playful smile formed on her face as she rubbed her belly(She really likes sweets! I'm serious, check out her bio.) You had to get out of here! You began to move frantically, but to no avail. The marshmallow you landed on became sticky from the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a shadow formed over you, looks like your next. You tried to break free from your sticky prison, but you were glued on pretty good. In a last ditch effort, you yelled out to the girl. She raised you to her lipsand opened her mouth, revealing her gaping maw. You felt her warm breath breathing down on you as you were pulled in closer. You yelled out to her one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, DOWN HERE, DON'T EAT ME!\" You yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she notice you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: She doesn't hear you and throws you into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: She hears your cry for help and peels you off the marshmallow.</span></div></div>",

You looked up to her expression has changed from her smiling to a more serious look. Her eyes looked at you as if they were looking deep into your soul, which sent a shiver down your spine. At the same time, she looked cute, which made you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine, just had a montage of my life flash before my eyes.\" You replied, still shaking from becoming her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\" She said, sighing with relief. \"But how did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained to her to the best of your ability how you shrank as you had no idea how and you later explained to her how you got stuck in on the marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's the best way I could sum it up....Oh yea, my name is *insert original name*.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Bea.\" She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that Bea was smiling again. back then it was a sign of death, but now it was calm feeling, as in you felt safe around her.

You climbed up the steps and discovered that the front door was wide enough for you to slide on through. The inside was warm and comforting. You sighed with relief as you adjusted towards the temperature. You were thankful for whoever owned this cabin. Now the question is, who? It didn't long to find out because of the sudden earthquake. You looked up to see a woman in snow-white clothing walking towards the door. You jumped out of the way of her oncoming foot as it crashes to the ground.

You went around a cooking pot with the fire already blown out, faint heat still radiating, a sign that it was only recently put out. That means that whoever was inside the tent was either still awake or very early into their sleeping, meaning it should be easy to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the tent you noticed a big problem. The tent was fully closed all the way to the ground. Thankfully, this problem was overcome quite easily.

The texture of the ground also shifted from dirt to fabric, a very welcome change for someone of your size. There was a second screen door to prevent bugs from flying it while leaving but thankfully, this one was open because someone was inside. Once you passed this door you saw the inhabitant of this tent. They were facing the other way but you could tell it was a blue-haired boy with a light tan, based on the color of his arms.  He was wearing a light sweater with wool trimming on the neck and arm portions and had black sweatpants on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to see exactly what he was doing but from your angle, it was a little hard to see.

You walk over to her hand and climb on, using it as a step as you move your wave to the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl above you had to hold in a giggle from feeling your small body climbing all over her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lifted you up to her face as she was amazed at you. She brought you so close to her face that you had to back up on her hand just to see all of it. It was at this point you noticed how beautiful she was. Not like a model but more like a next-door girl beautiful type of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were admiring her, The Magma grunt was also looking at you, and how small you were.

Quickly, you decide to trick her by approaching her hand cautiously, but feigning some level of trust. <br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d she smiles, closes her dark grey eyes and tilts her head slightly to reassure you of your choice. You take a deep breath. Having given yourself the best possible opportunity to escape, you run away from her. <br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d her eyes opened to the trick, \u201cHey! Get back here little guy!\u201d <br>\r\nSuddenly you feel that running may have either been the best decision or the worst decision. Being a criminal, the likelihood of her treating you as an enemy was quite high; therefore keeping out of her clutches was wise. All the same, there was a chance she would treat you decently if she was not a hardened criminal yet, but it was too late for that. Now, all you could do was run. <br>\r\nLuckily, there were only a few acorns the size of large rocks to you that were easily skirted around; however, the tremor from the girl\u2019s red boots caused tremors that tripped you up more than once. <br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t ask again! I don\u2019t like being told no!\u201d <br>\r\nShe was getting upset. You shuddered at the thought of your life ending because of a teen girl\u2019s temper tantrum.  Tears welled up as you thought of how unique and peaceful your life could have been if left alone in the woods with your pal Oddish and the abundant food readily available. <br>\r\nThe life reemerged in the form of a small opening in a tree. A chance!<br>\r\nYou sprint as fast as your tiny legs will carry you across a small patch of dirt. <br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d she cried with glee, \u201cfound you little guy! Come on, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d <br>\r\nShe was only a few yards away, and yet it was just enough to allow you to jump in the hole. Landing on your hands and knees, you scramble to the innermost part of the hole, feeling the stress of the situation subside slightly, but not the physical stress. You lean your back up against the tree wall in the back, and close your eyes. Please be enough, you thought. <br>\r\nThe girl tries her fingers, but they are too short to reach you. <br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d she was dead set on capturing this tiny person no matter what, \u201cGo! Poochyena!\u201d<br>\r\nThe all too familiar flash of light and electronic outburst of sound filled the tree hole. <br>\r\n\u201cPoochyena, use bite on that tree, but don\u2019t hurt the little person inside. And,\u201d the Poochyena looked back at its trainer expectantly, \u201cdon\u2019t overdo it. I don\u2019t want you to hurt your teeth, Ok girl? Then, make sure you catch the little guy, but don\u2019t be too rough. \u201d <br>\r\n\u201cPooch!\u201d she responded enthusiastically. <br>\r\nShe sounds like a mother, you thought. <br>\r\nHer Poochyena bit through the tree easily and tore off your hiding place. <br>\r\n\u201cGot ya!\u201d this victory dissipated her irritation. <br>\r\nThe Poochyena used her tongue to snatch you up quickly into her mouth. The warm saliva soaked every part of your body. You heart began to race as you realized the peril you were in. <br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ok girl,\u201d the Magma grunt shared your anxiety, albeit on a lesser intensity, \u201c just bring him over to me and I\u2019ll give you a treat, Ok?\u201d <br>\r\n(Very poor choice of words.) <br>\r\nAll Poochyena heard was \u201ctreat\u201d. This caused her to get excited and swallow the treat sized object in her mouth. First, you see the blue sky as she lifts her head, then the blueness begins to drift away from you as you sink slowly into the back of her maw. Finally, she swallows, engulfing you in darkness. To think, a level 10 Pokemon would be the end of you. <br>\r\nDespite the darkness, you felt the walls expand, indicating that you had reached her stomach. You sank down into the acid in despair. <br>\r\nLiterally, you thought about a movie you once saw, in the belly of the beast. The juices only reached up to your chin, so there was no risk of drowning; however, the place caused a cathartic experience unlike any you have ever had before. The certain death made you feel insignificant and melancholy; however, there was an air of peace and nostalgia. Strangely, it reminded you of a hot spring you had visited a year ago with friends. Thought you felt yourself passing out and perhaps suffocating due to the stomach vapors overpowering the small amount of oxygen, you felt grateful that your death was not horrific. You begin to drift off...</span></div></div>",

Not wasting another second you turned tail and sprinted as fast as your little legs would carry you. The gigantic Skull grunt gasped, surprised at how quickly her tiny catch could still move. You did not look back, you focused only on what was ahead and how to get away from her. The grunt was almost annoyed at first, but then a smile crept back on, followed by the cutest looks he could muster as she misinterpreted your intentions. \"Aww, how cute- ahem- I... I mean, try to run puny trainer. You'll never escape the mighty Giga-Skull, new overlord of the coolest gang on the planet.\" she tried so hard to sound menacing to 'play along' with you but couldn't help but giggle a little as her bare feet stomped after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors seemed distant enough that you felt this will actually work, but before long, you were hearing loud crashing thooms on either side of you.

You realized she still saw this as a game. This is probably the only advantage you had left. If you can find some place or some way to get away with her before she decided to end the game, you'll be golden. You looked around for any structures and saw a collapsed log laying by the path. It was too small for her to fit through, but more than big enough for you to crawl inside and fine a way to sneak away from her. Quickly turning towards it, you decided to play into her game and called up to her. \"Lets see you catch me when I do this!\" is as playful of a voice as you could manage while still being scared out of your mind.

Enjoy that reward. You earned it.\" she said in a sing-song tone. The heat and smell radiating from her soles immediately consumed your senses before you even started to sniff them. It was very humbling just how powerful she was to you. You noticed these thoughts were giving you a boner pressing against your pants which you prayed she could not see behind her foot. God damn this girl and her stupid cute sexy feet and her dominating presence. You had a few secret kinks of your own that you REALLY didn't want this girl finding out about, a desire which seemed less and less likely the more she had her fun.

Anything to push out the thoughts of this... cute... grunt and her sexy, powerful feet. NONONO STOP THINKING THAT! It was clear that you were on the losing side of this internal conflict. You shouldn't be enjoying this. You shouldn't... WANT this brat to keep you as her shrunken pet forever. W-was it the foot smell? Is it somehow affecting your brain? Is this all some sinister plot on her part? You kinda doubted that last bit, but with each sniff, you found it harder and harder to shift your thoughts to any other topic besides her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the kisses~\" her voice echoed from above. You had almost forgotten that part. Looking up you saw her toes wiggling in anticipation. The delinquent goddess sat up there blissfully unaware of the things she was causing for you. You wanted to press yourself against the sole and ... nonono you need some restraint, you can't let yourself be reduced any more than you already have. You're a person dammit... You... are better than this? have... things going for you beyond this brat's play...thing?

Hell It's fucking dangerous to be here <b>normal-sized</b>, but being tiny is practically a near-automatic death sentence. And forget about the damn kahuna, a fucking <u>snorlax</u> would be a better help than Mister Sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, you are parking your ass right here in the meanwhile. You began to walk around, and occasionally greeting the occasional Fomantis or Goomy. But on your stroll, you spot a weird pinkish \u2026wall? Once you got near it, you were greeted by the strong aroma of pungent vinegar, stale corn chips, sweet Kanab, berries, and fragrant cocoa butter. And the faded number twelve on the weirdly rigid surface proved your hunch right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just like I thought, it's a sandal. Finally, someone to help me!' The boy eagerly thought as he went to the barefoot that using it. Your jaw dropped as you stared at the vastness of pale cream-colored skin. Beads of Sweat and rain were dripping off of the appendages. Small bits of yellow grass and specks of were subtlely smeared on the surface. You shook your head, you may have your kinks and such. But this is life or death! So you began to breathe with your mouth and presses your hands against it. You blush deeply as you feel the very soft and mushy skin bend to your will. The smell itself is oddly very pleasing, and if you were normal size then it would be pretty mild in terms of potency. But to your currently little form, it was like a warm intoxicating mist that is passive-aggressively overtaking your sense of smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furiously shake your head at nagging of your second \"head', you will not take advantage of this person! It's something a creep would do! After your grand defiance to your urges, some weird sounds are starting to pop up. But suddenly a shadow is looming over your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself eh..big boy.' A sardonic female voice calmly inquired, practically sending chills down your spine. With a sweat dripping down your brow, you realize you staring at the gigantic face\u2026of Guzma's right hand..<u><i><b>Plumeria</b></i></u>. Her frown was\u2026simply apathetic. She is the one numbskull that is easily the most dangerous one. You only saw her a few times in Tapu village\u2026but you can feel her intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nineteen-year-old was kinda surprised at seeing a tiny dumbass. But what she <i>wasn't</i> that shocked her that much when said dumbass started to feel out her feet. When living with a bunch of <u>hormal</u> kids, one would find their shoes and other unmentionables going missing. Hell there times, when she wears some more conformable clothes, she can instantly feel a bunch of eyes constantly peeking at the exposed parts of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the little dummie's hands felt good on her tired feet. Much better, the piss poor excuse for massaging is Guzma known for that. And the grunts\u2026she is going to let that one be unsaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Continue with the rubbing. I had a long day today, and you so happen to ruined my alone time.\" Plumeria sternly toned as she stares at your soul. You immediately blush at the thought at rubbing those sexy\u2026big and juicy things. Plumeria only made a smirk, she got him right where she wants him.\"I don't have all day\u2026you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

Her toes were pained the same color as her hair, and there was a slight musky smell coming from them. You touch her foot and her toes twitch a little. Not the reaction I wanted. You said. You move your hand across the soft sole. Her foot twitches and you hear her giggle. Getting there\u2026. You said. You move your hand some more, but it only caused her to giggle, not wake up. Even though you were trying to wake her, you were enjoying that you got to touch her soft soles. But you had to wake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her soles isn\u2019t getting me anywhere.

Y\u2026.y\u2026..you\u2019re a person?! She said shocked. Uh\u2026. Hi. You said somewhat nervous. She poked you a few times with her finger. I\u2026..I\u2019m not dreaming\u2026..

What were you doing!? She said. You don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to tell her, but it could be worse if you don\u2019t tell her. I asked you a question! Answer it or I\u2019ll crush you!

Getting off while I slept, you sick pervert! She said. She was right. You did have a foot fetish, but you couldn\u2019t tell her. She\u2019d kill you. Disgusting! Why would I want to do anything to your feet? You said. A perfect chance for a pervert like you! She said. On a sleeping thirteen year old? Yeah. I\u2019m that depraved and want to be arrested. You said. Plumeria grits her teeth. She expected you to break down when she caught your lie. She was going to get you to admit the truth one way or another. Then she got an idea. Prove it. She said. What? You said. Prove it. If you weren\u2019t doing anything perverted, then you have nothing to hide or fear. She said. You wanted to say no, but that would prove her right. And who knows what she\u2019ll do to you. Seems like you\u2019re going to have to play her game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. What do I do? You said. A test of discipline.

She said. And if I do give in? You said. For the rest of your life, you\u2019ll be my slave. She said with a devious smile. You know it won\u2019t be easy. Especially since her feet are the kind you love. Plump toes, soft, smooth, and taken care of for as much as she\u2019s on them. Just thinking about them put you on edge, but you had to suppress those thoughts. Or become her slave for life. \u2026..Alright. I accept. You said. Then let\u2019s get started. She said, with an evil smile. She puts you down at her feet and presses them together with you in between. Under normal circumstances, this would be great and you would start kissing, but not now. Not when you\u2019re gambling with your freedom, so you kept your lips away. When you didn\u2019t do anything or show interest, she gets annoyed. Hmph. Guess I need to try something different. She said. She pulls them away and sets them on top of you. Come on. I know you want to. So go ahead and start kissing like a mad man. She said, grinning. Her plumb toes where right in your face. Just taunting you. You were so tempted to smother your face in the soft flesh and kiss them like no tomorrow, but you held back. Maybe when this game of hers is all over, you can act on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria didn\u2019t feel you do anything and was a little shocked. Must be taking every ounce of willpower to not do anything. She said. She was a little impressed with your resilience. You\u2019re not going to crack easily. Looks like I need to go all the way. She said. She said. Plumeria starts to rub move her foot on you. The softness of her foot gently rubbing against your body almost broke you. She keeps rubbing for a few minutes and moved to your crouch. She rubs her toe on your crouch and your eyes shoot open. With just a few rubs, you had a boner. Now I have you. She said, smiling victoriously. She had you right where she wanted you. She knew she could win if she kept rubbing, but she wanted her victory to be undeniable. Plus, humiliating to you. So she holds her foot over you. Want nothing to do with my feet, huh? Something tells me different. She said. You quickly tried to think of something unappealing to get rid of your boner. If it goes down, she\u2019ll think it\u2019s just from rush of pleasure, but Plumeria moves her foot just over your crouch. Don't even think of resisting! I know you're loving every second of this. I see the proof. So pull that out and start jerking! NOW! She commanded.</span></div></div>",

You draw your hand back and started to think of unappealing things to reduce the bulge in your pants. Within a minute, your lust dies down. Plumeria saw that you weren\u2019t touching yourself, and that your hard on has gone away. What!? But I felt and saw it! She said. You rub a guy like that, of course they would. But I told you I don\u2019t like feet! You said. Grrr! You\u2019re a lying, cheat! I had you dead to rights! She said. I did your test fair and square! I have my kinks, but feet aren\u2019t it! Now hold up your end! You said. The anger in her eyes were fierce. Enough to make you back up and rethink the bass in your voice. She lost at her own game and a potential slave for life. If she didn\u2019t make the challenge, she would crush you where you\u2019re standing without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Fine. I keep my promises. I\u2019m sorry for accusing you. She said. You breath in relief. You\u2019re not going to be a slave to her. But know you weren\u2019t going to be with those perfect feet of hers. You\u2019d have to play your cards right if you want a chance at them again. Plumeria closes her hand around you. You were a little scared of where she was going and what would happen. After a few minutes, she stops and opens her hand. W\u2026where are we? You said. A bathroom. She said. Why? You aren\u2019t going to flush me away?! You said. No. It\u2019s to clean you off. Don\u2019t want you reeking of feet. She said. Actually\u2026. They didn\u2019t stink at all. You said. They\u2026.didn\u2019t? She said surprise. No. Soft and smooth, but not stink. You said. You were hoping small compliments would soften her up. Which seems to work as she turns her head with a slight blush. W\u2026.well you still need to be clean. She said. Plumeria fills the sink and makes sure the water is warm. Ok. I\u2019ll be back. She said, leaving you alone. You undress and get into the water. Didn\u2019t think she\u2019d do something like this. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wash, you wonder how things will go with Plumeria. She\u2019s a skull. They\u2019re rude, mean, and nasty. Plumeria was no different, but there must be a nice side to her. She wouldn\u2019t run you a hot bath if she didn\u2019t care that much for you, right? After 15 minutes, you climb out and dry off on the towel she left out for you. You get fully dressed as she walk in. You done? She said. Yeah. Clean as can be. You said. She picks you up and walks into the kitchen where a plate with a sandwich was waiting. Here. I thought you might be hungry. She said. There was a low growl from your stomach. Which she must have heard as she smiles at you. She places you on the plate and you start picking at the sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHehe. You must have been starving. Even though it\u2019s a corner gone. She said. You notice the tone change in her voice. It was\u2026.nicer. And when you looked at her, the anger and hate in her eyes you first saw was gone. Replaced with general interest in you. It\u2019s not what you expected from her. You thought she\u2019d treat you with contempt or as an annoyance. But giving you a bath and a plate of food? This surprised you to the point where you had to say something. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do all this for me. I said I\u2019d treat you as one of my own. She said. So you treat all your skulls like this? You said. When they do good. Most of the time, I have to get onto to them for doing stupid things and failing. But it\u2019s because I want them to be best. She said. So you\u2019re like a mentor to the others. You said. It\u2019s a position I take pride in. She said. So if you\u2019re treating me as your own, does that mean I\u2019m a skull now? You said. Well, you haven\u2019t passed the requirements, but I could make you an honorary member. I-If you like. She said with a small blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Plumeria wants you join the skulls. You want nothing to do with them for what they do people and pokemon. But if you accept her offer, it could go a long way for you, and you could get back at those lovely feet of hers. Plus, It\u2019s not like you could do anything bad or harmful at your current size.</span></div></div>",

Then let me be the first to welcome you. She said. You hope that this was the right choice. Don\u2019t worry. I said you were under my care, and I mean it. I just have an even greater reason to do so now. She said. She\u2019s been keeping her word so far, so no need to disagree. But I do want to know something. She said. And that is? You said. Did you\u2026\u2026really not like my feet? She said, blushing a little. Well\u2026. I mean\u2026. They are nice, but\u2026.. You said. It was at this point that she saw through your fa\u00e7ade. If it was anyone else, she\u2019d be furious over being cheated. But she found you cute. She didn\u2019t want to say it. Yet. And she didn\u2019t want to scare the newest member of Team Skull. So she just gives a little smile. You know, someone who didn\u2019t like something would speak up immediately. And you\u2019re having a hard time. So does that mean you do like feet? She said. What? No! I just\u2026.. Don\u2019t want to hurt your feeling. Yeah. That\u2019s it. You said. Reeealy? You feel nothing when you see these? She said. She places her feet on the table in front of you. Seeing my big feet and plumb toes doesn\u2019t excite you? She said. You were close to breaking down. Not only did she place them close to you, she is using the exact words you use to describe them. N\u2026no. They don\u2019t. You said. Really? I think you need to be a little bit closer. She said. She brings her finger behind you and pushes you into her foot. So many thoughts ran through your mind as you were pressed against the soft flesh. You had let your body relax as your dream has come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria felt no resistance from you, and that was all she needed. She pulls you off and up to her face. Don\u2019t like my feet huh? She said. You know the charade is over and she knew the truth. Which means that she knows you lied to rig the bet she made. So let\u2019s run this down. You were at my feet when I found you? Right? She said. R..right\u2026 You said. And you lied about liking my feet to rig the bet in your favor, right? She said. Well, lied is such a strong word. Maybe stretch the truth? You said. Uh-huh. She said. Ok, ok. I did lie. But you weren\u2019t exactly friendly to me. You said. Maybe I did overreact a little\u2026. She said. You wanted me as a slave. You said. Ok, a lot. She said. So\u2026. You\u2019re not mad? You said. I guess I can forgive you for lying if you do one little thing for me. She said. And\u2026.what\u2019s that? You said, nervous. Admit you like my feet. She said. If that\u2019s all she wants, you were happy to oblige. Plus, she could have made it a whole lot worse if she wanted to. I\u2026..like your feet. You said. Plumeria giggled as she watches your face turn red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that wasn\u2019t so hard. If you had told the truth before, I might have been more reasonable. She said. I guess\u2026. She said. So, you\u2019re going to pick up where you left off? She said. What? You said confused. I\u2019m saying you can play with them if you want. She said. Is this some sort of trick? You said. I\u2019m dead serious. What do you think I was going to do with you if you lost our little wager? She said. You stared at the giant soles as she wiggled her toes. Something like this would only happen in you dreams. So you pinch yourself just to make sure you aren\u2019t dreaming. Ow\u2026. This is not a dream. It\u2019s real. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria notice you not moving yet. Come on\u2026..! My feet are getting lonely. They need a playmate. She said. If she was going to let you, then who are you to argue. But how are you going to do this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so she's offering her feet to you. And since she knows that you have a little foot fetish that means she's gonna be expecting the worse. So it isn't a big deal if you go all out right. Judging from the smirk that she was looking down at you she seemed to expect nothing less. Feeling like you've been given these privileges you run over, wasting no time as you dive to her foot. You reach her big toe as you wrap your arms and legs around it, hugging it as tight as an Arbok. You then played kiss upon kiss into it as you treated it with so much love. After all the teasing Plumeria has done with you, this has felt like the biggest relief. Making out with her toe, only on occasion breaking contact to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Plumeria was shocked. She just figured out you were a foot freak, but not at this level. Not that she minds honestly. If anything it kind of makes her more happy.  \u201cWow your really going to town\u201d She taunted from above. \u201cI knew you were a foot freak, but i guess you like my giant toes just as much\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking up you ran over to the the bottom of her heel, licking it over and over again. Your getting idea after idea in your mind of what to do with this situation. Just flushing in you doubt your gonna be granted with enough time to finish it all. Looking up to Plumeria she isn't mad. No she's smirking down at you, making you feel better at what your doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo lets talk.\u201d Plumeria said \u201cSo what gets you off more, the giant feet ahead of you or the giant girl attached to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess both, These feet wouldn't be as good if they were some old guys\u201d You say to her answering, then straight back to her heel \u201cHey! Can you stamp down on me with your heel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a Freak\u201d She said with a bit of surprise. Her words were harsh but her tone was playful. She followed. Jabbing her heel into your body. Letting you still kiss and rub your hands over her feet. The base of her heel over your crotch as the pressure really got to you. \u201cI guess, you like Girl\u2019s feet. Young cute girl\u2019s feet. But why feet? I mean theres parts to girls you must like more\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot more then feet\u201d You answer \u201cI don't know, something about them i just love. I love your feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria laughed at you, what a foot freak! She doesn't get why someone in your position would like it, but she totally gets why someone in her position would. Her feet dominating someone. Stomping hard on someone, showing that they belong with the dirt under her feet. Her toe having more command then a general\u2019s word. Maybe she\u2019ll make the new grunts bow to her feet. Show them where they start on the ladder. Maybe step on their face a bit and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.... Plumeria\u2019s face went dark. As she just realised that she might have just grown a foot fetish. Well good thing she has a boy who has the biggest one. And he doesn't care how they treat him. Smiling down at the situation much more lovingly again. She raised her foot off. You were a bit heart broken seeing them leave, however they didn't leave for long. Coming back as they ensnared on your torso. her big toe and her second toe squeezing your guts out. She raises them up as she crossed her legs over. Not even bothering to grab you from her toes. You could do nothing but struggle. Her toes and foot stopping your motions, you can no longer have fun with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaning you can calm down a bit \u201cIm sorry, i guess i kind of got a bit too far into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a bit, your cracking a little boner right now\u201d She said pointing \u201cAnd just from being near my feet, your pretty bad you know that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, guess you could say that\u201d You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut i got to admit, seeing you get dominated by my feet so much. Kind of turned me on a bit\u201d Plumeria said leaning forward, waiting for your reaction which she had no doubt would be of delight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt Did!!?\u201d You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, guess you've given me your little foot fetish infection. Still unlike you, I'm not gonna get trampled because of it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cId love to get trampled by your feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u201d Plumeria said as she got an idea.

I think I know how you can help me.\"<br>\r\nYou give her a fearful look before she drops you between her legs. \"Alright you little pervert, if you don't want me to kill you then you better do a good job of pleasing me!\" You realized your position and ran over to Plumeria's vagina and started rubbing and licking every inch of it, it smelled like a combination of musky sweat and exotic fruit. As you were trying to please her, you hear her start to moan. \"Ohhh.. you're REALLY good at this tiny! You might just make it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her praises, you double your efforts. You were so busy trying to please her, you didn't notice her finger coming towards her pussy, pushing you in!<br>\r\nIt was like a sauna inside Plumeria's vagina, you felt like you were going to melt. All of a sudden, her finger comes back in, pushing you further and further into her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to grab on to her finger so that she would pull you out, but when you got a hold on it, she just started pushing you in, then would pull you back out. <br>\r\nIn and out, in and out, it just kept on going and going, you were being used as a sex toy for her, and it didn't seem like she was stopping any time soon,<br>\r\nThen you felt the \"cave\" start to shake violently, \"She's about to orgasm!\" you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n\"AHH! AHH! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!\" She screamed in pleasure, covering you in her cum and crushing you with her powerful vagina muscles. Somehow, miraculously, you didn't die, although you think your leg might be broken. Suddenly, you hear Plumeria start to talk to you.\"That was the BEST session I've ever had!

I got hear on accident, I swear!\" You plead, but plumeria isn't having any of it. \"You're gonna lick my feet or I swear to arceus I will fucking CRUSH YOU, UNDERSTAND PERV?\" She yelled in anger, asserting her dominance. Just the look she gave you was all you needed to know that she was completely serious about this; you don't even say a word, and get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the soles you start to realize how small you really are. You can see every last detail on this thug girl's feet. You could see the small amounts of dirt and dust trapped between the skin wrinkles, you could see the gunk between her toes and you could even see the sweat baring down them; and that's not even mentioning the horrible smell. \"Well?\" Plumeria asked as she was beginning to get impatient \"yes my lady\" you say \"that's GODESS to you punk\" plumeria shouts whilst wiggling her toes in a somewhat seductive manner \"I will start right away...my goddess\" you say, extremely embarrassed and angry; you are not just some toy this punk can do anything she wants with. However, you comply to her demands anyways out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue out for the first lick, already disgusted by the smell, only to have your senses assaulted once again by the awful taste of her sole; you nearly puke because of this. \"Hey bug, you're not giving up already, are you? Because if you are, I'm not gonna need you anymore\" Plumeria says, raising her left foot above your body \"No no my goddess, I'm sorry, I'll do a better job\" you plead, she puts her foot back down, right in the same spot where a sweat puddle had started to form \"ok fine, but that was your only chance, you got that?\" \"Yes goddess\" \"what was that, bitch?\" \"Yes my divine goddess! Thank you for this opportunity\" you say, hating every second of it. \"Good, now get to work\" she said. You begin to lick her sole once again, this time knowing what to expect. You make sure to lick off every drop of sweat and piece of dirt on the sole and toes of the giant poison trainer'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before you finish the left and move on to the right. Suddenly, from across the bed you hear plumeria's voice again \"y'know, a girl could get used to-\" she was suddenly cut off from a banging on the door, and from the other side a familiar tough yet kinda dumb voice is heard. \"Yo! Plums! Open up! It's the boss!\" He yells, still banging on the door. \"Damn, looks like the rest of your punishment will have to wait till later\" plumeria says, she then looks down at her discarded panties and shoes. \"Or maybe it doesn't!\" She says with a menacing grin. Plumeria then picks you up in her tight grip and drops you in...</span></div></div>",

Then with out another word she drops you into the shoe and you land on the damp insole, nearly oozing with foot sweat wherever you applied pressure. \"LET ME OUT OF HERE!\" You shout as you bang on the damp walls of the shoe. Suddenly, without warning, plumerias giant bare foot slams into the shoe, trapping you face up under the ball of her foot. You then hear her saying something and although it was muffled you could still make out the word \"lick\" and so, not wanting to anger her anymore then she already is, you listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up above, Plumeria had her own problems to deal with as she unlocks the door and sits back down on her bed, leaning against the wall. \"You can come in now\" she says with a bored tone. The door is quickly kicked open followed by the familiar phrase \"HEY WHATS UP, ITS YA BOY, GUZMA!\" The leader said as he entered the room \"Do you really have to say that every single time?\" Plumeria asked \"well yeah! Of course I do, it's ya boy Guzma is my catchphrase, it's totally never been used before\" he says while sliding down his sunglasses \"ok, what do you want guzma? I was trying to have some alone time\" \"ok ok, I'm sorry plums, but we need ya on the front lines, the fate of the entire team rests on your shoulders!\" Guzma said, this got plumerias attention, making her jump up onto her feet immediately, putting immense pressure on you in the process.<br>\r\n\"What is it!? Are the cops here? Is it one of those fucking trial goers?\" She asked, concerned for the team \"Even more important then that! I need you . . . . . To get our food from the pizza guy!\" Guzma said, complete seriousness in his eyes. Plumeria face palmed \"really? REALLY GUZMA? You interrupted my 'me time' for THIS?\" she shouted, getting very annoyed and stomping her foot down, once again putting pressure on you, nearly breaking something. \"But plums, its meat lovers!\" The Skull boss exclaimed, still 100% serious. \"I mean, it's not like you really got anything else goin on right now\" Guzma said with a shrug.</span></div></div>",

You almost began to enjoy the parts where her foot was off the ground, as it gave you much less pain, almost. Overall this was not just painful and disgusting but humiliating as well, this punk girl can do anything she wants to you just because you're smaller then her. Hell, if you weren't shrunk you could have probably taken out this team of childish thugs by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually plumeria gets what she set out for and heads back to the mansion after paying for the teams food, and gives you another painful walking experience beaneath her sole. \u201cAlright grunts, here\u2019s your food, go crazy\u201d she says as she kicks open the mansion\u2019s front doors with the foot you\u2019re underneath. She then throws the boxes onto a table nearby and takes one slice for herself, as she knows she won\u2019t be able to after the grunts get to it. Plumeria then sits down on the large foyer staircase, finally relieving you of some pressure in your damp prison. As plumeria is about to eat her food, she thinks about was what the next thing she\u2019s gonna do to her bug will be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly the surface you\u2019re standing on begins to flip until it\u2019s all the way upside down and you fall out. You look up at the punk girl once more, seeing her still with the cruel expression of anger, lust and enjoyment. \u201cEnjoy the little trip bug?\u201d She asks, chuckling to herself. \u201cNow listen here girl!\u201d You scream up to her in anger, only to be immediately pinned down by her big toe. \u201cShut the fuck up bug!

You will never speak to your goddess like that again, got it?\u201d She says, adding more pressure by the second \u201cyes, of course my divine goddess, I deeply apologize\u201d you say fearing for your life.

Plumeria then takes out a large (to you) bottle of nail polish labelled \u201csalazle poison\u201d and throws it near you along with the giant brush \u201cok bug, you have 1 hour, do not disappoint me\u201d she says, then takes out her phone and begins to scroll through something , probably a social media page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scramble to get started with your work, spending longer then you would have wanted opening the polish bottle and then struggling to lift the brush. Finally you manage to get some paint on the brush and drag it towards the same feet that had been tormenting you throughout the day, still keeping that smell, but at least the smell of nail polish sort of covered it up.

However, this sudden burst of emotion was short lived as your hour was up and the giant punk looked down at you to inspect your handiwork. \u201cHmmm... not bad, I guess\u201d she says, actually liking how well you did but not wanting to admit it. \u201cIt was an honour my goddess\u201d you say trying to impress her \u201cyeah, yeah don\u2019t push it, bug\u201d she says, moving her sweaty toes over your face.

Suddenly her massive hand grabs you once more and holds you above the opening to her black sock. \u201cHave fun, bug\u201d she says. Plumeria then let\u2019s go if you and you tumble down to the toe section, screaming the whole way down. When you land, the first notice the same stale smell her feet had, and then you noticed the dampness of the fabric. It was strange, you were almost used to it at this point, and while you absolutely despised it still it wasn\u2019t as bad as it used to be. Then the real bad part started as she placed her foot back into the sock, giving you that same experience you had before, but at least this time there was a bit more air filtering. \u201cHey bug!\u201d You heard her say, much more clearly this time \u201cthat foot had better have no more sweat on it in the morning Alright?\u201d She said as she laid down in her bed \u201cyeah, whatever bitch\u201d You mutter under your breath \u201cwhat was that fucker!\u201d She shouted, stomping on her blanket \u201cof course my beautiful, divine goddess!\u201d You say, making sure she can hear you this time. \u201cGood, that\u2019s better, I\u2019m goin to bed now, you better be quiet\u201d \u201cyes my goddess\u201d. Plumeria then quickly drifts off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already been a few hours, you kept trying to lick up all the sweat, but more just kept dripping out, so much so that you began sliding down the sole. You let out a disheartened sigh \u201d I\u2019m never going to get out of here, please lord arceus, if you exist PLEASE give me a way out of here\u201d you pray, and as if the poke god could her you, you keep sliding down only to find a small torn hole in the heel part of the sock, only about the size of your hand but still easily tearable. You think that maybe your prayers had been answered, however, this could also be a curse, if plumeria were to find you trying to escape, you might go up her behind after all, or maybe even get killed, is it worth the risk to try and escape this punk girl\u2019s sweaty foot?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And after a few minutes of clawing at strings and fabric, you finally managed to escape. This freedom was one of the greatest things you\u2019ve ever had, you even kissed the ground, but you forgot that you\u2019re still next to her feet and just got a mouthful of stale foot sweat. You then realize that you still have a long way to go, as you still needed get off this bed, get out of this room, get out of the mansion, get out of this thug town and find somebody to grow you back to normal size. As you think about how you\u2019re gonna do this, you begin to heat rustling coming from behind you, as plumeria seems to be waking up. Fearful, you jump down from the bed onto a stuffed nidoqueen toy and began a mad dash for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumeria lets out a huge yawn and has a sip of water from the glass on her bedside table, she then remembers her little pal and begins to squeeze him with her toes, except he wasn\u2019t there.

To have your last moments be under a dirty foot of a girl while she fingers herself to it?\u201d She asked, breathing heavily. As she said this, she added more pressure, making some of your ribs begin to crack, making it harder to breathe. \u201cP-please\u201d you plead to her, even licking her sole once more to try and convince her to let you live. She does feel this though, but she doesn\u2019t even care this time \u201cit\u2019s too late for that now bug\u201d she says, getting much deeper in herself and breathing even harder, even letting out small moans now \u201cmaybe if you had just stayed -huff- and listened -huff- this wouldn\u2019t be -mmmmmng- happening she said, getting deep into her own pleasure. Meanwhile down below the pressure is still building on top of you, cutting out your hearing and most of your air, besides foot stench of course. The sweaty wall of flesh continues to descend, one of your legs finally gave out, splattering across the pink-haired titaness\u2019s sole, you try and scream, only to get your mouth forced to stay open and foot sweat be poured into your mouth. \u201cOh, ohhhh, yyesss\u201d Plumeria moaned up above feeling your leg give out, making her in some of the greatest pleasure she\u2019s ever felt but of course she\u2019s not done yet. Your other leg is mashed under the foot, being reduced to a puddle of blood and sweat. You think to yourself \u201cwell, this is it, crushed under the filthy foot of some punk chick from a gang all because I accidentally saw her finger herself, I guess it\u2019s one way to go\u201d and without warning your entire body explodes as plumeria\u2019s sole hits the ground, reducing you to nothing but a smear; at the same time plumeria also exploded, but with pleasure as she climaxed harder then she ever had before. She takes a moment to catch her breath \u201cwow, that was the best thing ever\u201d she moans as she twists her foot in your remains, spreading you across the floor. \u201cI gotta find another one of those some time\u201d she says at she gets back into bed, not even bothering to clean the mess you created all over the sweaty, dirty sole. She never did find another shrunken man, but definitely used the thought of your explosion beneath something as lowly as her foot to climax more throughout the years. She then simply fell back asleep, leaving the stain on her sole as a reminder to this day.</span></div></div>",

You were riding on her shoulder while you were paralyzed with fear so she quickly figured out that you were scared. Grabbing you, Lusamine comforts you with a hug, her motherly embrace melting your fears away. \"I'm sorry for putting you in a place that scares you my child, but it is the quickest way back home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is wrong,</i> you thought to yourself, <i>I was just kidnapped by some crazy woman who says I'm her new child but.... I couldn't feel safer.</i> Lusamine's chest was so soft and warm you could feel yourself start to get tired, like you actually were a baby on a trip back home. But your mouth was dry from how scared you were earlier, there had to be something to drink on this helicopter. \"Ummm... Miss?\" Lusamine raised an eyebrow, clearly displeased by your statement. \"Uhh.. Mom?\"<br>\r\nLusamine smiled, \"Better. Now what do you want my child?\" \"Well,\" You started, \"I was just thirsty and I was wondering if you had any--\" Lusamine silenced with a finger, (which covered your entire face) and then said: \"Now now my child, I'm your mother, you only have to ask if you need something.\" <br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, \"<i>It's good she actually cares about me.</i>\" You look back up at Lusamine and almost fall in shock. She had taken her other arm out of her dress and had undone her bra. Her breasts were out for the world to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you--\" You were cut off by Lusamine shoving your face into her nipple, clearly wanting you to suckle on it. \"Come now my child, you're thirsty aren't you?\"<br>\r\nYou look up at her face, she gave you an encouraging smile, not wanting you to feel nervous about drinking her breast milk. Remembering her rant on ungrateful children, you start sucking on her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk had a strange nutty sweetness to it, almost like coconut milk. It satisfied your thirst quickly, but it didn't lessen your embarrassment at the fact you were breastfed by a woman that just kidnapped you.<br>\r\n\"There my child, you have quenched your thirst I hope?' Lusamine said, petting your head with her finger. \"We've finally reached home\". You hadn't even noticed the helicopter landing in front of some mansion on an artificial island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLusamine put you on her shoulder and started talking to you as she walked towards the mansion. \"Now let's get you cleaned up my child, you seem filthy.\"</span></div></div>",

But then there was the part of you who felt safe in her embrace.

It was demeaning and yet you... didn't exactly mind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, as promised, she took you into a bathroom. The room was utterly massive, even for a normal sized person. Like everything else here, everything in the room was a bright white. As the woman set you on the sink, you watched her twist the knobs causing steaming hot water to rush into the massive tub. \"Um... mi- MOTHER?\" you quickly caught yourself and corrected your statement before Lusamine noticed, \"Isn't that a bit large for me?\" Lusamine simply gave you a smile. \"Well maybe for you to use alone. But you won't be alone in here.\" Your eyes widened as she started to casually undress herself. Was she really going to... oh god she was. You felt your heart racing, partially out of fear and partially because this woman was drop dead gorgeous and now naked before you. Without even realizing it, you started to get an erection from the sight of Lusamine's naked body. By the time you realized what your body was doing and covered it up, Lusamine had noticed her new 'child's' reaction to her.

The woman only flashed an mirthful smile as she opened the door leading to the mansion. A luscious sigh escapes the woman's mouth as she freed bare feet to touch the cool floor. Her long toes wiggled excitedly as she neatly places her lovely heels on the floor. Causing beads of sweat off of your chin as you looked at the darkly imprinted in the shoe's interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother\u2026\" You gasped as she sat on a white couch.

The sight caused a strange warmth to simmer in your body. On both feet, the middle toes were glinting rings of platinum embedded with clear jewels. The slender things quietly fanned their hot humid air directly at your face. It was a curious thing, on the surface, it was just an innocent if not thick perfume. The high-quality oils she used for them smelt of various berries and flowers.

But your more immediate concern was the iron grip her toes held you in. Such flawless and immaculately treated toes. You almost couldn\u2019t imaging such things subjecting you to this hell. But you were far too weak to break from their grip. Too futile to escape their vice like hold on you. And that eerie smile she wore as she looked down at you.

You had to flee. You had to get the hell out of there while you had the Inkling of a chance. But before you made 5 steps, lusamine\u2019s massive bare foot stomped down in front of you causing you to crash into the side of it. Looking up you saw a stern look in her eyes.

But I can see that we will have a lot to work on before I can really trust you. You tried to back up, only to move into her other foot. You were trapped with no escape.

What could you do now that she had her eyes on you? All you can do is stand on edge, waiting for her to finish deciding on your punishment for disobeying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel something pinch your torso from behind and lift you up. Fortunately, it wasn't the work of those stuffy, delicate toes from earlier; instead, Lusamine had bent over slightly, grabbing you and raising you up to chest-level. You can't stop yourself from sneaking a peek at her modest rack, soft and shapely, drawing your gaze like you were under a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know just what my child needs to understand his mother,\" she smirks, cradling you firmly in the cushy grip of her palm. Her free hand homed in on you, eager to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you feel a large, smooth mass push under your white t-shirt and force it off, leaving you half-naked in front of the crazy, motherly stranger that just kidnapped you. A warm buzz spreads from where she touched, causing you to lean into the pseudo-embrace despite the positioning of a long, colorless fingernail the size of your head; you obviously haven't been this physically intimate with anyone but your close family. Next, that same finger poked itself under the waistband of your navy blue khaki shorts and casually slipped them off your tiny legs. All of her attention was on you; she was acting like a child playing with their new doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prodding digits of her hand caress your body in soothing, yet unwanted touches, running across your chest, massaging your sides, and curling up comfortable against your neck. You accidentally moan as a digit brushes firmly against your thigh, presses against your penis, and pins it down before continuing up your torso, repeating the motion several times. You try to close your legs, but they\u2019re forced open, spread eagle from the sheer power of the plush, firm pad of her thumb. Lusamine's green eyes stared down at you with some unearthly mixture of lust, compassion, and cruelty, making your heart race like a bullet. You could only stare into them as she casually molested you with just a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh-hmm,\" she purred, \"Your perversions have rubbed off on me, my dirty little son. I hope this bonding exercise helps us become much\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thumb and pointer finger grasp for your member, embracing it and stroking your shaft ever so gently.

Unluckily, it's apparent that her hand is also picking up one of her bizarrely-designed heels. Looks like you're not done with her feet just yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand holding you maneuvers so that you\u2019re grasped between her pointer and thumb once again, the latter finger squashing your member flat against your waist. You groan at the alluring touch, erection still aching from the sexual frustration you\u2019ve experienced. Once Lusamine has the unorthodox footwear in hand, she moves it just below you. That same complex aroma of fruity lotion and natural sweat rose up tainting your breathing space once again; this time, the latter was far more powerful than before, and a faint scent of worn leather chipped in, too. Reluctantly, you look down. A deep imprint of her foot which you only caught a glimpse of beforehand is now readily apparent in the black fabric of the insole, an impressive accomplishment, considering how pristine the shoe looked from the outside. She must have used these heels quite often\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the grip that held you precariously over the edge of the musky shoe was loosened, and you plummeted towards the worn-down insole. You land face first, arms bracing your fall. When your face touches the ground, a warm, moist sensation envelops it, and a little hint of the salty excretions from the blonde CEO\u2019s soles grace your lips. You instinctively move to spit it out, but the motion only lets more into your mouth, splashing onto your tongue. The taste is surprisingly normal, for the amount of lotion you\u2019d guess she uses. It\u2019s just\u2026salty, with a slightly amplified taste of leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what you just did, you quickly turn around, not eager to start pondering why you didn\u2019t immediately recoil in disgust when the sweat first touched your face. Instead of a plain of damp, grey fabric, you are greeted to the smug face of your parenting-obsessed captor, her eyes almost as piercing as they were when you were inches from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be going back to my room. In the meantime, you should try to show some\u2026<i>appreciation</i>, for your mother dearest, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts a leg, and the visage of her soft, immaculate sole blocks out your view. Her toes wiggle, and her foot begins to lower towards the opening. You run down the incline of her heel, hoping the toe area had enough space for you to not be crushed when she put it on. She didn\u2019t intend to <i>kill</i> you, right? She wouldn\u2019t have said anything if she wanted you to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breathtaking sight of Lusamine\u2019s foot is mostly blotted out as it fits snugly into the shoe. The only light you get is from between the extensive toe cleavage that these heels show off. Fortunately, your body is resilient enough that the grasp of her warm, pudgy toes doesn\u2019t squeeze you into paste, even with the pressure of her full weight bearing down on you. Or maybe it was the softness of her skin? Even the way these smooth, pale behemoths embraced you was unusually dainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you go again, thinking about this blonde psychopath\u2019s feet <i>way</i> more than a nuisance. You really need to get your priorities straight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of that, you need to consider what she said while she dropped you into her footwear. Should you show her your \u2018appreciation\u2019? What did that even entail?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost pure and beautiful in a sense.\" She said as she started to gently pet you. \"Now I know this may seem harsh at first, but it will be for your own good.\" You had no clue what she was talking about as you saw her grab a weird pair of high heeled footwear. She slid her foot into one of them, securely keeping her toes and heel into it before returning her attention to you. <br>\r\n\"This time, since you've been so good so far I will be more gentle on you. However take this opportunity to recognize my lack of tolerance for disobedience and ungratefulness.\" Her eyebrows seemed to furrow slightly, though she kept the smile on her face.

Otherwise I'll punish you for real.\" Her face flashed a threatening stare for a moment causing you to stop your futile attempts.

Afraid of making her wait you quickly got to work rubbing the toes and licking up the dirt. The taste was awful and sweat burned your eyes. And yet, her feet were so soft and firm to the touch.

Professor Kane is finally back with you. With still being in the lab. You say \"Professor we gotta go, before any other of those Cipher people show up. I don't know how much more damage my Pokemon can take at this point\" you say this to the professor who is taking a moment to gather his notes and paperwork into a briefcase. It really seems like being trap here still hasn't convinced him that we are in a rush situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now I have to grab my paperwork this kind of research can help in studying these dark Pokemon. I doubt any other of those cipher will be showing up after the beating you just put on them\" He says this while finishing up closing the brief case. \"There now I just need one more thing... then I will follow you right out...\". You watch as Professor Kane grabs a remote device thing. Then gets behind you. Ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curious about what that remote thing is was there really isn't any time to talk about it you think. You and Kane run towards the elevator and take it down. Making your way to the outside one of the elevators opens in front of you. You freeze in there seeing a woman with long pink hair in pigtails walk out and block your path of escape. \"Oh my what do we have here, like its a man and my professor. So you must be the boy that toke out all the peon's. (ignoring the fact that the professor is with you she asks) Well good work, I expect that you want to join our organization. You as the great admin Lovrina which is who I am. I can make you start off as pretty high in the rankings so what do you say?...\". After hearing this, you get sick of the way that she is talking to you. Plus there is no way your joining these criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is no lady. Now if you could please move I have to save the professor from you people...\" Lovrina cuts you off with a loud *giggle* \"ugh what a shame, so professor may you do the honors...\". You were so confused about her reaction that you didn't realize at first that the professor joined Lovrina on her side \"Yes madam...\" a ray of light hits you. And you watch as the whole world seems to grow around you. When your able to see again, you notice a white wall in front of you that you touch and notice that its rubber. Looking right against the white wall you see specks of dirt,red specks, and giant grass blades? Upon seeing that you look up and see Lovrina giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you are at the side of her shoe, being no more then 2 inches tall. \"*Giggles* hmp guess I should tell you what just happened or you know what instead I'll let Professor Kaney over hear tell you himself\". That is when you turn and look up to see Professor Kane at his full height.\"I would be glad to, now (your name) I can't hear you all the way down there but I can assume what your asking right now and so I'll start at when i got kidnapped. So the cipher peons toke me to this lab and were trying there best to get me to help them. After refusing a bunch they got into a forceful mood, which led me to start getting to work against my will. I was taking my time, to buy you enough time to come save me. But the admins eventually gained notice of this. So they sent Ms.Lovrina to come in and talk to me about my performance. She told me to hear her out and if I refuse again I could leave. Sounded fair to me, so I listened. But after hearing her out, she sort of convinced me, plus I mean look at her, to cute to turn down. *cough* *cough* So not only did I do there research fully committed now. But I also made this shrinking device by accident in the process. Unfortunately for you it doesn't grow yet and even if it did here's a news flash for you. Your stuck like that for life. So that catches up to speed...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there in shock with what you just heard the professor say, you toke all this time coming to save someone who was ready to just stab you in the back. Lovrina just turned to you with a *giggle* \"So that is the story tiny guy, there's just one more thing to get out of the way now. What do we do with you?\". You watch in fear as the question leaves her lips. And the you see her come up with an idea as she is starring down at you by her dirty platform blue boots.\"Hmmm... I think I can manage to keep you alive if you swear your loyalty to me. And since  can't hear you down there I think it's only right that you answer with licking my boot clean. So I'm waiting....\" She says this looking down at you with a impatient look in her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what do you do?</span></div></div>",

And what you can gather, you can safely assume that the previous inhabitants were absolute slobs. You slumped pathetically to the ground as and accepted your fate. As your eyes about to watered up, you heard the laughter and playing of children. For good few seconds, you felt so dumbfounded, briefly wondering if you have gone mad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"WimWiWimpod...\" </span>A nearby annoyed wimpod sighed as it's pointed to a few bushes. Causing you to jump in fright and surprise, was it there the whole time? And it seemingly had a look that reeks of 'You are really stupid.' Like a mad man who is possessed by a haunter, you ran through the bushes. The wimpod rolls its eyes as it follows after you. On the other side of the plant was....a school playground with a bunch of kids. Who in the fuck makes a camp near a school? After a half minute of pondering, your face paled at the <i>implication</i>.Maybe...it was for the best that camp was abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeve the less the closest one was a cute kid with tan skin and black hair. She looked at least five or four years younger than yourself. The girl was absentmindedly reading a pink book, with her kicking those light brown bare feet occasionally. They look kinda big for a kid. Your cheeks became pink at the sight of the lighter colored soles. As you stared, the wimpod scurried to her, a sign that it was hers. You quickly shook your head as walk to her face. You came to too far to let your baser desires to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me miss\u2026\" You loudly said to ear, once again thanking the tapus she is laying down.\"I was wondering can you help-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to. But I got to take some notes for an upcoming lesson. So can you please wait for abit?\" The lass dismissed you without even turning her head to you. Sure the kid's tone was very nice and polite\u2026but it still seriously <i>pissed</i> you off. But you complied to young giant's wishes, and you waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you that did. But after <b><i><u>forty fucking minutes</u></i></b> with her nose still in that journal of hers, your patience is starting to get wee bit thin. Your right eyebrow twitch and your first clenched. The girl's wimpod give you an half-hearted shrug, which adds fuel to your burning fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith anger growing, what happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't know how did that happen, but it didn't made the whole situation any better. Now you were off, trying to find someone or something that will either take you back home, grow back to your original size, or both. You thought that this trail might lead to a local town or something so you decided to follow it, but you didn't know it would take hours and probably days to get there (well since you're small, obviously).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of sore legs, you finally found a giant bench in the horizon. \"Thank god, my feet are already killing me right now.\" You compliant and plan to climb up the bench to rest. As you got closer, you began to realized that someone was sitting there because you can see a giant figure on top of it. \"It looks like there's someone there.\" You said. Wanting to see who it was despite your sore legs, you make a run to the bench. When you got there, you can finally see what the person looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a young girl with medium-length blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears a red jacket over her white shirt that was tied up by a red necktie with a pink stripe over it, a grey skirt, and a pair of matching tights and black shoes. With all of that attire, she appears to closely resemble a British schoolgirl...and a rather cute one too. Right now, she appears to be reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finally made it to the bench, you take a long look at this young lady. You could try to get her attention, but you will probably have no idea what would be her response at seeing a tiny person right before her and besides...that would be waste at an opportunity. You don't know why, but you would love to poke around her body while she isn't looking. She looks occupied in her reading which is giving you a chance for something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe being so small isn't so bad after all....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets even better when you see her face and notice that looks rather tired. Occasionally, she slowly closes eyes before trying to open them again. Maybe you could stand there and wait until she falls asleep which gives you an opportunity to play around her while she naps. You seriously have no idea what's gone into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You tried your best to struggle and yell up at her, but she could not hear your tiny squeaks, she also could not feel your tiny struggles from her pocket. After realizing that this wasn't working, you were given no other choice but to try and escape this pocket which was much easier said then done. On top of the fact that there was no way you could get the button to snap off from the inside. The girl was skipping around which made you fly around on the inside of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually became apparent to you that in order to escape and convince this girl of what you are. you needed to wait till she arrived at her destination. Which only took her about a few mins to do. The girl hurries into her home and rushes straight towards her room. You were then instantly taken out and finally shown light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home poke-doll\" right before you were able to protest the girl grabs you again and carelessly jiggles you around while looking you over. \"Wow what a strange design for a toy\" the girl says before tossing you on the ground to get up and go grab some doll things. You hit the ground with a thud and started rubbing your head vigorously.\"I gotta get her to notice I'm not some doll\" just then the girl comes back and grabs a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being tightly in her grasp she tells you \"i think you need a new outfit\" that comment instantly made you shout \"NO\". this caught the girl off guard. But not enough to stop her from what she wanted to do.\"Wow your a talking poke-doll that so cool\" she then continue to try and remove your clothing. \"No stop right now I am not a doll. I am a human man\" the girl then looks at you with a confused look and her head turned to the side. \"A man? no no no your way to tiny to be a man, silly doll\". The girl then pokes you in the stomach, which causes you to fall over.\"See most men are big and strong. But your tiny like a doll, so that must be what you are\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis attitude makes you mad,\"I am a man, just one that shrunk somehow. listen I have no idea how I became this size but I saw you and requested that you help me. Now will you help me?\". The girl looks at you and gets a mad face on as well. She doesn't like the attitude that her new doll is giving her, but even with that thought she also considers that maybe the doll is a man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what does she say?)</span></div></div>",

You tried your best to struggle and say that her grip was way to tight. But But she ignored your plea's. And as you were brought up to her face you can that the expression on her face isn't a happy one. She looked at you straight in the eyes and said \"Bad doll, I can see that I am going to have to be a bit more forceful with you. And I don't want to hear any kind of argument out of you or you can join the other head less dolls in my trash can. Is THAT UNDERSTOOD DOLLY?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at her for a second before answering, you know that life as a doll is something that you want no part in. But this girl is probably serious about ending your life, so you just give her a nervous nod. This seemed to her turn her attitude around as her hand with nothing in it comes up behind you. And gives you rough pets on the head that she thinks you enjoy with saying \"Good doll, now I think it's time to get out of those rags that you call clothing and get you changed into (she grabs the doll cloths off the ground) these\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even waiting for a response from you she strips you down to your underwear herself, being more forceful like she said that she was going to be. You were complaining and struggling the whole time as she continued and to redress you. There was nothing that you could do this young girl's tight grip on you made it impossible for you to move. But easy for her too ignore you as she had her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishing up with dressing you and being satisfied with the new outfit you have on,  she sets you on the ground \"There my Polly-Pocket clothing fits you perfectly. Awe you look so cute. I bet my other dolls will be so jealous on how cute you look...\". You can't take this kind of treatment anymore, these doll cloths were itchy, and this girl was nuts and clearly doesn't have any chance of helping you. So as she was talking you attempted to run for it. But as soon as she stopped talking she gained notice of your attempt of escape and you ended up running head first into her hand, which hug you tightly in her grip. \"Hmp...

She is a bit bossy, but I bet she would be glad to see someone shorter then her *giggles*\" all you heard was other talking doll, you were curious when you heard this. But then thought to yourself that there is no way there is anyone else that is like you. Suddenly you are being swung through the air as the giant girl is skipping over to her giant toy chest. Then to not drop you on the ground she put you in her front shirt pocket without saying a word to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peaked your head out of the front pocket, confused to whats going on and you see as the girl is leaning into the toy chest a fully made doll house that is the only thing in the chest. This was strange to you since it was such a big chest why did she only keep the doll house in there. So she grabs it and doesn't even realize the amount of pressure she puts on you for a short moment as she presses the doll house against her chest that you were in the pocket of. It was painful but you had to ignore it as the girls giant hand came back into the pocket to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped you in front of the dollhouse, and the first thing you notice is that your even to small for a doll house. The door of the plastic home was a little more then 3/4 your size.\"Tammy your owner needs you to come out now...\" The giant picnicker girl says to the door of the dollhouse. You then suddenly hear loud noises, followed by the dollhouse door swinging open. You see a very tall girl at the doorway. She had to be a little more then a foot taller then your height at 2 inches. She had green hair and a red tank-top. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tammy_\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a>(EP249) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to approach the giant girl that you were next to. As she got closer you began to notice that you came up to a bit above her ankles.You stood there and wondered if she knows how you got to size, or even why are you so much shorter. right before she stops her shoe lands on you, but not enough pressure for her to notice \"So what do you need now, you know this is my relaxing time\". During this time the picnicker girl didn't say anything but instead gave a little laugh, the green haired woman had no idea you were there. Feeling the bottom of her shoe on your body and even though she was shorter then the girl. You still found it hard to get her off. But she did notice your struggling. She removed are shoe and looked at you in shock \"Oh my, is this what you called me out for. Wow he is a real man..\" She was cut off by the giant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggles* Yes, he is my new doll and strangely enough he thinks like you that he is a real person. But I gave him the talk. But now that introductions are out of the way. Its time we play dolls and I am thinking we play...\"</span></div></div>",

Needless to say you were mesmerised by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm sorry but can you please wait a little longer till were in my room\u201d She said as her voice sounded just as angelic as she looked. She covered you again and moved forward as you finally have some more context. Your being carried by this beautiful girl! Her hands on each side of you to hide you from others. She's walking and you can hear her two footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you should be more panicked about whats happened to you. But something about her was just so mesmerising for you, you just cant be panicked with a soothing girl right near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more walking you hear a door creak open, as she then walks into the room and shuts the door. There was a moment of silence until the hand came off of you and you saw the girl again. This time her entire body on show as you can see that she was in a pink and purple Furisode. Her perfectly shaped body complementing the outfit as your confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d You ask her as she smiles. Seeing that your not as scared and fearful as she would of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy names Blossom, and you rin the Battle Chateau if you were wondering\u201d She said as you ask her why. \u201cWell, i found you outside passed out and small. Knowing that if i don't get you in here then another person might grab you and harm you, you know considering your the size of a Floatte.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I'm in your room\u201d You say looking around as you didn't think you'd ever be here, you've heard of the Battle Cheauteu as well as the Furisode girls. You never thought you would of actually tread foot in here, and more importantly meet a Furisode girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ci hope you don't mind me asking, but why have you gotten so small?\u201d She asked you as you couldn't really give her a clear answer. Last thing you remembered you weren't the size of a doll, you were pretty tall. probably taller then Blossom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don't know, thats quite worrying for you. But don't worry ______________\u201d</span></div></div>",

But simply hearing Blossom's voice seemed to have a calming effect on you. Regardless of what she was saying, she seemed to put your mind at ease. \"You have nothing to worry about.\" she said as she ran a finger gently along your back. \"I'll take very good care of you. Even if you end up stuck like this, I'll make sure you don't have to worry about food, shelter, or other people taking advantage of you.\" Her tone made it clear that these intentions were genuine. You couldn't believe your luck. Even if most would consider the whole mysteriously shrunken bit to be extraordinarily bad luck, you ended up being found by someone who isn't just incredibly beautiful, but is also one of the kindest and most caring people you've ever met. You almost considered your new size to be a blessing seeing as it was what lead to you being under Blossom's care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you hugged the darker colored finger that was rubbing you. Wrapping your arms around it tightly as you tried to wordlessly thank your new caretaker for everything she was doing for you. She smiled at the sight of this, struggling not to audibly coo at it. \"I'm glad you're happy with your living arrangements. I'd imagine most people would still be terrified of being tiny and in the room of some stranger.\" She pulled her finger free and smiled down at you once more. \"Tell you what, you must be hungry. I'll be back in a bit. I'll let you explore around your new room while I'm away. Just be careful while I'm gone.\" And with that, she placed you on the floor of her room and exited, making sure to shut the door. You spent the next few minutes looking around and seeing the furniture and decorations. They all looked so elegant. Probably very expensive as well. As you wandered around you soon found a decent sized closet next to a foldable dressing screen. Taking a quick peak, you saw that most of her wardrobe was more furisodes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something caught your eye. Near the entrance of the closet you saw some socks and a pair of panties laying on the ground. Judging by their shape and the way they were carelessly let out, you assumed she wore them recently and haven't got around to getting them cleaned yet. Your mind quickly filled with a few shameless thoughts about your beautiful caretaker. Imagining her in just these. Soon you quickly shook your head trying to ignore such fantasies. Blossom was doing so much for you, you couldn't possibly just perv on her like that. Though your eyes looked at the socks once more, curious how they would smell and feel if they really worn recently. And those panties... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows for the next minute was a battle of willpower as you tried to fight off such urges. Though, maybe you could sneak a quick little moment for your fantasies. Just have a little fin before she gets back. It's not like she'll find out if you're careful about it. Right?</span></div></div>",

Beautiful as she was, you could not bring yourself to betray her like this. Even if she most likely wouldn't know about it. You suppose you're a gentleman after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your back on the closet you soon notice a massive wooden chest against the wall and decided to head towards that. The chest itself had elegant designs painted onto it which made it pair very will with the rest of the furniture. But you were curious what could be inside. It most likely wasn't clothes given all the things she fit in her closet. Outside you saw a couple dolls laying on the ground before it. 2 were plush dolls of some cute pokemon and the other was a wooden figure of a human. You looked at them curiously when suddenly you heard footsteps. Within a few seconds, Blossom opened the door and entered with a small bowl of fruit in hand. After closing the door she looked around for you, not even daring to take a step until she knew exactly where you were. Finally her attention moved towards the chest and she spotted you next to a Clefairy doll. Sighing in relief, the dark skinned furisode girl walked towards you. Before long her sandaled feet were in front of you and her smiling face hovered overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're still doing well. So do you like your new room?\" Blossom got on her knees to get closer to your level, hoping to see and hear you better, as well as making herself look less intimidating to you. \"It's very nice. Thank you. I really can't thank you enough for letting me stay with you.\" you spoke up as you leaned against the clefairy plush. \"By the way... I was curious, what exactly do you keep in this chest?\" you asked her causing her to blush slightly. \"Oh... nothing important. Just some silly things.\" she seemed oddly reluctant to talk about it, but you noticed her trying to sneak the other dolls into it as she was talking. So this was a toy chest. Seems like Blossom has a secret attachment to her childhood. That or she has a hidden playful side. Either way, you chose not to dwell on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right I brought you these.\" Blossom said as she placed the bowl before you. She placed an apple slice and a couple grapes in front of you as she started to pick some food out for herself. \"Hope you like it. I wasn't sure what you'd be able to eat at your size.\" You thanked her again and started trying to eat the large fruit. It was certainly a bit more of a challenge compared to doing this at your original height, but the juicy reward was more than worth it. You barely put a dent in it when you were full. Blossom smiled and finished them off herself. \"Well now that that's taken care of...\"</span></div></div>",

I can understand if you don't want to and want something else\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo its fine, ill gladly play a game you want.

Maybe its because you've admittedly fallen for this beautiful girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh really, thank you so much. Okay then were gonna play Hide N Seek\u201d She told you as you understood why she picked that game. Lot of places for you to hide when you factor in your size. \u201cIm assuming your familiar with that game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, okay you start counting and ill start running\u201d You tell her as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, i want to put up a wager before we start\u201d She said as you didn't expect that \u201cIf i win you owe me a favour, anything i want.

She does know this room better then you do and she does feel slightly confident that she will win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run around trying to figure out where you can go. Not some place obvious like under the bed and not someplace out in the opening like right by her drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then suddenly got a brilliant but terrifying idea. Under her mat. She has a little circular mat in the circle of her room that would be perfect for hiding, you could get stepped on but not hard you imagine. After all Blossom would tread carefully with a tiny guy around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop under the mat as she gets to Sixty and the game begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the tiny opening you allowed for safety reasons, you watched her head straight for the dresser, looking around it and behind it. So far so good. Not wasting a beat she went straight for the bed. Definitely smart of you to exclude that spot right away. As she leaned down to inspect the other side you peeled up at a clock. Not even a minute was by and she already checked your first two ideas. Hopefully your minds don\u2019t continue to think so alike or this will be over really soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom was honestly surprised she didn\u2019t catch you under the bed. Then again it was a rather obvious place. Clearly you\u2019re a bit more clever than she expected. But there was still plenty of time left so she wasn\u2019t too worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to watch as she checked around the furniture making sure you weren\u2019t hidden under or behind anything. 2 minutes went by as she had a somewhat frustrated look on her face. She checked everywhere that she noticed and still no sign of you. Were you just a really good hider or did you leave somehow? The shut and locked door seemed to throw out that possibility but where could you have gotten to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thankful she didn\u2019t consider the mat in the center of her room, but this relief soon turned to fear as you saw her feet moving towards your position. You thought your luck had run out, but then she took a step onto the mat and paused. You remained motionless underneath, waiting for her to pull it back slightly and win the game. But instead you just heard her grumbling up above. Peeking out slightly, you saw her looking around the room from the middle trying to figure out if she missed anything. One of her feet came dangerously close to you as she did this, almost unknowingly winning her the game... or ending it in another manner. You both looked to the clock at the same time. 30 seconds remained. Her comfortable time advantage had worn thin. Now she had to think and think fast. But nowhere came to mind. Where else could you have ended up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time finally ran out she sighed in defeat. \u201cAlright little guy, you win. You can come out now. Proud of your ability to outwit the giant you quietly climbed out form under the mat and poked her foot. She looked down, surprised how quickly you made it to her. Were you right under her nose the whole time?</span></div></div>",

It smells like the natural, cheesy smell one would expect from feet this sweaty, but it also carried a sweeter smell mixed in, more perfume-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties were a different story, they were white cotton with a pink bow on the front, and a sylveon's face stitched onto the back. But what really caught your eye was the damp spot on the crotch. You can only guess she had a hard time controlling her urges when she wore these.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You just finished checking out of your hotel room and have been given an hour to remove your stuff from the room. The last hour of a vacation is always the worst knowing that after you finish the last of your packing and get your stuff into your Poke-Uber. You have to get on a plane and return to your normal life of 9 to 5. So as the that final hour was coming to an end you were walking around your hotel room and checking everywhere for things you might have forgot. Given just a few more mins left you laid on the bed for a moment wishing that you didn't have to leave your vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that thought you were seemly put to sleep, and in your dream you heard a voice \"Hello there human my name is Jirachi and I am the wish maker. I heard your  wish through my psychic abilities. And it's your lucky day because I have decided to grant your wish of never returning to the dull lifestyle of 9-5. To instead be on a 24/7 vacation. Enjoy your new life....\" the voice disappears and without waiting for you to respond, it disappears. You begin to wake, It's where you wake and all see 3 waves of light. The surface your on feels like carpet but its much to big to be carpet \"Ugh my head hurts for some reason. What a strange dream, .... wait oh no I fell asleep. What time is it and where the h*** am I?\" you say this to yourself as you begin to get up and head towards the direction of the closet wave of light. But right as you were about to out through the wave of light a bus size mary-jane heel slams down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of dust flies off it and the carpet that it landed on, into your direction, causing you to fall over. As easily as it appeared in front of you it had easily disappeared, leaving earthquakes with each step it was making. You couldn't believe what you just saw, But then you heard loud talking that sounded female (that was loud to you, but really just normal volume) \"Okay bathroom is all done and bed is all made. This is great I finished just in time. I hope this tourist appreciates the work I do..\". You still hear the voice talk to herself, and while that was happening you needed to see where it was coming from and as you made your way past the wave of light you were in complete dismay, as you noticed that you just walked out of underneath the hotel bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had your problems, but being late to your Poke-Uber wasn't one of them anymore as you looked around and notice that everything was huge. Since you somehow tuned out the now you noticed maid, you were shocked as you looked above you to see the maids underwear \"...okay well time to go to my next room...\". The maids foot slams down again near you and the earthquakes that she leaves as she walks out of the room made it impossible for you to try and get her attention before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back up onto your feet and dusted yourself off. Then you started to think \"Okay I somehow shrunk, this is so unbelievable (you try slapping yourself awake). Ow, okay I am for sure awake, but still unsure about how I ended up like this. There has got to be a way to reverse this, I just need to get help somehow\" And as if it were on cue when you thought that the hotel's room door opens. And you see a giant brown boot with a bow on it enter. Looking up past the boot you see a girl with short brunette hair carrying a suitcase, wearing a brae, short dress, and sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes right in your direction, obvious to the tiny man below her. you dive back under the bed right in time as you hear the bed above you creak when she lays half her body on it and the suitcase to the side of her. All your able to see is the heels on the brown boots in front of you. Seeing the dirt and a dead ant on them really help you see just how small you really were now. \"Ugh what a long trip that was. I think I'm going to take a nap before doing anything...\" You hear the giant woman say this and then notice that one of the boots is out of your sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                     <b>*Thump* </b>followed by <b>*Thump*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see one boot fall from the sky, followed by the other. The opening of one of the boots was even aimed right at your direction and you smelled the toxic foot odor from her wearing them all day at the airport. The smell of her sweaty boot forced you to come out from under the bed, in-which you were then greeted by a falling sock landing right on top of you. Ugh and you thought her boot was bad, The sock was well lets just say that the sock was definitely doing its job in soaking up her foot sweat. The only good part of the sock was just how soft it was. You did your best in struggling to get out from underneath the smelly crusty sock. But you found it difficult to move, it toke you some time to get out from under it. But once out you were grateful to breath in fresh air again. Looking back at the sock you thought to yourself if worse comes to worse that might be the best place to sleep since it was soft. But the odor coming from it made you hope that you don't ever turned to that as an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention back to the situation at hand. You look up and could see the woman's feet laying at the edge of the bed. Since they weren't really moving, you assumed she must have just fallen asleep. You know that you have to find a way to get this woman's attention since it might be your best chance at surviving and becoming big once again. Looking around the edge of the bed you try your best to find something to climb to reach the top of the bed. And while scrolling the side you see the girls other tall brown boot sitting up normally and not on its side. With a string that is coming off of the sheet and extends down to the opening of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it there makes you a little hesitant on using it as a way to climb up. You already know the smell that will be blasting out from the top of that boot and having to tolerate it while climbing is going to be a struggle to you. But seeing as it's the first real way in reaching the giant above, it might be your best chance....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do you decide to do?)</span></div></div>",

You see that your best option in getting to this girl, is sadly by using the sheet's string. So you make your way over to the giant brown boot. Once you arrived at the boot, you look around it for the best spot to start climbing it at. along the side of the leather boot you see specks of dirt, tiny dead insects, drops of water, and wrinkles in the leather that could be just what you are looking for to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore climbing, you do your best to brush off dust and piles of dirt that are going to be in your way as you climb. Then you start climbing up the side of the boot, some water made it a little difficult but you were able to manage to keep climbing up. Taking your time, with each pull up, you were able to make it to the top of the boot in a good amount of time. You could feel the humid air bursting from the top of the brown boot. And the smell coming out was from the woman's foot sweaty boot was undesirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmelling the toxic aroma of the woman's stinky boot made you forget what you were doing for a sec and you slipped. Luckily you were able to grab onto the side of the boot's edge. And even with the sides of the boot being slippery from the woman sweating in them, you were still able to manage to pull yourself up. Thinking to yourself how close that was, you look for the sheet string and see it on the other side of the boot hanging down into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you shimmied your way across the edge of the boot and grabbed the sheet string, you gave it a good tug to test it's strength. You noticed that your pull had loosen on top slightly. And even though that worried you slightly. You decided that climbing it was your only option since you were already up here and you didn't want to spend anymore time smelling this woman's stinky boot odor that was emitting like a volcano from the top of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the string, you begin to pull yourself up. With each pull you could feel that the string was starting to stretch and weaken against the sheet that it was attached to. To even make matters worse you toke a sec being half way up the string to look down and all you could see was the dark abyss of the woman's boot below you. So turning your attention back up, all you kept hoping was that the string would hold long enough to make it to the top....</span></div></div>",

You had arrived at the airport near Lumiose and decided to go to the hotel room you had rented out for your trip, a full month of sightseeing. However, your kind of sightseeing was different then what everyone else would describe theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong ago as a child, you had met a Jirachi and it gave you a wish. You had wished for the abilities of Durant-Mans suit   (Ant-Man if you couldn't tell) because you thought it would be cool. Fast forward a couple of years and instead of it being cool you had instead started using it to perv on all kinds of people. Your favorite person to perv on was your childhood friend, but she had moved away recently to pursue her dreams of being a scientist which then led you to Kalos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about just finding a new favorite person back at your home in Unova, but you decided that you wanted to try some different nationalities of people. Immediately upon entering your hotel room, you left all your bags on your bed and immediately went to the washroom. The reason for this being that you didn't want any cameras that may be lurking to see you shrink. You immediately shrunk yourself down to a mere 3 inches tall, probably your favorite height because it combined a decent size and pretty good hiding places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of shrinking felt very uncomfortable at first but you started to get used to it. Some things you had learned about the suit was that you were completely invulnerable to damage or harm while in a shrunken state but at the same time your body didn't flatten, kind of like an army man doll. Once you had learned this you had taken your perving to another level, ranging from getting yourself sat on to going in someone's shoe as they go for a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though Jirachi was your friend and added something to your wish. Basically, all smells were enjoyable to you but still kept their intensity. Being in a normal room with light smell smells slightly good, but being in a sweaty shoe felt the same as smelling fresh apple pie. If was this ability that pushed you to climb inside shoes and old clothes in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had brought all that to mind you then thought about what to do. Obviously, you were gonna start perving on someone, but it was a matter of who. You walked out your door and decided to go ________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Right (Super active tourist, very sweaty)<br>\r\nB: Left (Triplet Tourists sharing the same room)<br>\r\nC: Different Story (If ya want it lol)</span></div></div>",

As you approach the door you can instantly tell that you aren't going to get through at your current size. With that in mind you shrink yourself to a minuscule size to fit under the door frame. Once you successfully get through to the other side you immediately grow yourself again. Last time you stayed this small you were eaten by an ant and getting bitten, while not painful is still very uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish growing yourself to 3 inches you look up and see 3 girls, presumably triplets, watching TV on their bed. Their suite was a suite with a very large bed so you didn't doubt they could all sleep together in one bed. It seemed that not only did they share looks, but also fashion sense. They were all wearing the exact same clothes with the exception of their little beret's, each of which were a different color. In order from left to right there was orange, blue, and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trio of tourists seemed to be entirely focused on the TV, leaving their bodies completely unguarded. Of course normally, they wouldn't have to be reserved in their own hotel room. You start to walk to them _____________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: and successfully reach them with no interruptions!

Same can be said about her somewhat plump hips and curvy legs. Although her...um \"<i>traits</i>\" are no way near \"big\" and \"thick\" yet. It's clear she's going to be a <i>very</i> alluring and beautiful woman once her puberty comes to past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Quick...look at something e-else'</i> You mentally chided yourself as you tried to force such thoughts out. Trying to think of a distraction, you quickly and seemingly on reflex looked away from her features and down at her feet... Her..wide and meaty sized nine and half feet,and her bright jade colored wedge slides. And her cute chubby medium sized toes that are painted in a adorable hot pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh come on!'</i> you angerily thought getting even more hot and bothered just from the sight of this dark skinned beauty\u2019s feet. Desperate, you quickly looked the other way. Unknown to you, the Rising Star gained a smug ninetales-like grin, as she saw the <i>little</i> boy looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear me,I guess the heat was playing tricks on me.\" The brat sighed in such fake yet the same time believable disappointment. Hearing this you quickly turned back to her to get her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a min..\" you were about to say to the girl, but to your shock the rising star was looking directly at you. You started to sweat a little as you saw the coy and smug look on her face as she looked down at the shrunken person. As your eyes diverted a bit you noticed that she was playing with her left sandal. She had the footwear gently slapped up against her very soft looking sole,and juicy and fat heel. And the sandal has an deep gray imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared agaped while your face turned a shade of red that was probably visible to her. The Rising Star\u2019s trick had worked perfectly. The rising star giggled in sweet victory and walked to her little new friend. Her soft hands gently picked you and brought you to her face. You stared at her nervously when suddenly she leaned in. She simply kissed you passionately. Her moist glossy lips unwittingly touched your groin, making you even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have some fun!\" The rising star prudefully cooed at the cutie. You simply nodded, knowing full well that no way in hell you can directly fight her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rising star grinned in victory as she places you</span></div></div>",

The Rising Star simply left her attention away from you as you rest in her breasts. That was terrible, your body feels all broken. Broken by two flesh mounds of a girl who\u2019s barely hit puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, your here too\u201d You say to yourself as you can feel your tiny prick more erect. It was turning you on so you shouldn't be surprised, your just thankful she decided to stop before it gets too bad and before you were at the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Rising Star continued grooming her Pokemon.<br>\r\n\u2028What happens next?</span></div></div>",

At least her attention has been off of you, but you feel like thats on going to last for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it only lasted for so long, Since the time she's put you in her pubescent cleavage, she done a lot. She's groomed her Pokemon, she's returned them to her Pokeballs. She's made the journey home and she's greeted her parents. All of a plan to get to her room and have some alone time. Walking inside, she locked the door behind her. Seeing her medium sized room she walked over to her bed, smiling as she closes her eye. Focusing on your small boy in between her breasts. You aren't struggling but you are occasionally moving. She could just leave you in there all day, but she's got plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening and unbuttoning the top, she reached into her cleavage. Grabbing her prize as she holds you right in front of her face, once she gets a good look at your slightly saddened face. She then placed you down onto her big leg as she smiled down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you had fun in there, you felt great for me\u201d The girl said as you looked around, you don't think you can get down safe but you might just try. \u201cHey answer me!\u201d <br>\r\n\u2028Her voice was so commanding \u201cOf course i didn't like it.

Just let me leave and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thats not gonna work. I want you here\u201d The Dark skinned girl said as you knew you were in a lose lose situation right now. With no other option your being forced to be this girls slave. Unless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and try to jump off her thigh and onto the ground, trying to escape she caught you without much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, but what would you have done if you hit the ground. I would of caught you easily\u201d The girl laughed at your pitiful attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way My Names Nicki\u201d The girl said to you \u201cAnd that will be the only name your gonna need for a while.

Running up to her torso you step on her clothes. Running to her stomach you pull your hands up close to her clothes and pull yourself up. Her slim stomach made it very easy to climb up, and you kept going up. Your reached her breasts in no time and instead of climbing in you kept climbing up. Her smiling face looking down at you as she loved seeing you climbing her body. The one thing she loves most about you is the size difference. So much fun things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you gave up your resistance so quickly was her second favourite thing. You reach her collar and pull yourself up onto Nicki\u2019s shoulder.

Her mouth looked so scary and so dark that you of course took a while to actually go in.<br>\r\n\u2028Only after you convinced yourself that you had to, to truly be her slave. Closing your eyes you take a big breath in. Then with no stop you dive into her mouth. Jumping over her teeth you land on her big soft and slimy toungue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicki smiled as she felt you land on her tongue. She did have her doubts, but she was happy to find that you truly wanted to be her slave. Closing her mouth she decided to reward herself for... well honestly she just wanted to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. i did your test, can you let me out\u201d You say, looking around at the closed mouth. nothing about it was fine.

Who does that belong to? You said. Your question is answered when you hear humming. And the source of the humming was coming from a blonde woman in a white mini dress and open brown shoes. She was holding a mirror and brushing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned at how beautiful she was. Her flawless, tan skin, deep drown eyes, luxurious hair, and ample chest and her feet; Which had to be at least size 10. You were drawn to her. You eye her up and down multiple times. You were so enthralled by her. You just had to go to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of your hiding spot, you make your way to her. Halfway to her, she stops brushing her hair and look your way, causing you to stop dead in your tracks. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s looking right at you or past you. But she\u2019s smiling for some reason. S\u2026she must notice me. Why else would she be smiling that big? You said. You were about to start moving again when she put down the brush and mirror and got up. You stared in awe as you watched her rise to her feet. She started to walk towards you. You didn\u2019t know if you should run or stay still until you saw her step over you and walk a few feet past you. She knelt down and parted the grass like she saw something. Hm. I could have sworn I saw something. I guess it was the wind. She said. She pulls her hands back and rises to full height. And here I was thinking it was a pokemon. She said, walking back. Hey. I\u2019m no pokemon! You said. You immediately cover your mouth as you realized it was a ploy. The beauty stops, smiles and turns around and looks down at you. Gotcha. She said. She comes back and stops right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look her up and down in awe. Your legs felt weak, but not out of fear. Out of being close to her stunning presence. You try to talk to her, but you can\u2019t find the words. Aww. Delcatty got your tongue? She said, giggling. You become more flustered as she giggles at your nervousness. I saw you peeking at me through the grass. Couldn\u2019t take your eyes of me, could you? She said. Wait. She knew this entire time. She knew the second you looked at her. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see you looking at my feet. I thought you were going to start drooling over them. I bet you'd love nothing more than to kiss each one of my toes individually, huh? Or maybe lick them like there's no tomorrow? Pervert. She teases. She pushes you over with her foot and giggles. Just when you thought you couldn\u2019t get anymore embarrassed. Now hold still. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. She said. She reaches down for you and her tree trunk sized fingers wrap around you firmly. Hang on, little one. She said. Her hand rises up to her smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god\u2026. You\u2019re even cuter up close! I could eat you up! She said. Your eyes go wide at the thought. Oh! Don\u2019t worry, little guy. I wouldn\u2019t do that to you. She said. She rubs your head gently with her finger. Can you speak, little one? Or are you too awestruck? She said.  M\u2026my name is (your name). You said. I\u2019m Delila. How\u2019d you get all tiny and cute? She said. W\u2026well\u2026.. Would you believe me if I said I woke up like this? You said. I\u2019d find it hard to believe, but here you are in my hand. And cute as can be! She said. She brings you close to her mouth and kiss you. She holds you there for a minute before breaking it. You stutter to find your words. Hehe! You like that, little guy? There\u2019s a lot more of those waiting for you. She said. You were still stunned after being kissed. Now\u2026. How about we have some fun? She said. You nod your head in agreement; knowing there was no point in fighting against her.</span></div></div>",

But i really want to see, so if you don't mind\u201d Delila then placed her feet down, each toe lining up. \u201cCan you please kiss them Cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell your not gonna say no. Moving closer to her right foot you lay a lip on her pinkie toe. Right before her toenail. She could feel your small lips on them, and you could feel her toe wiggle, even by the slightest movement. \u201cGood, now can you please move on the next one. And make sure you give the same amount of love to each one. Wouldn't want one to feel left out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mam\u201d You say as you did just that, kissing her next toe, and then her next toe. You kept going until your lips touched all ten of them. Her feet were so amazing, and considering that she's been traveling thats saying something. Her feet while beautiful was still dirty, very dirty. You can only imagine what they would look like after she came out of a shower. Clean, clear, hot and slippery. Those are feet you want to be near. And... now your thinking of her naked in the shower. Hopefully you can get there with her. Maybe if you give her enough of your devotion and love. You don't care if she ends up making you her boyfriend, pet or even slave. But honestly you want to be her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter kissing her tenth toe you back up obediently. Ready to take your new orders if she will give it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, standing up right. Your like a little pet, i could just eat you up right now\u201d Delila said with a smile, bringing her finger and rubbing against your face. \u201cNow that you finished with kissing my feet, i think you can_____________</span></div></div>",

Is she really giving this to you, man that is fantastic. Your mind just being set free you do whatever first came to your mind. You just recklessly jump not her foot. Laying on it and holding it as the beautiful girl laughed. \u201cOkay, not what i expected. Having fun down there cutie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you straighten your leg!\u201d You shout up to her as Delia decided to listen. Let you have fun, your so cute when your happy and excited. Delia then lifted her foot up, pushing it straight out as it became more like a bridge. Looking at the smooth leg in front of you and the blonde beauty further ahead. You wanted to move further. Standing up on her foot you can feel her flesh under your feet. Her foot was harder then any ground, not to mention much much sexier. Moving off her foot and across her leg, you hold you arms out to the side. Trying to practice not falling off. Sure your not that far from the ground but you still want to stay on her foot. Delia as much as she wanted you to stay on her leg, she also really wanted to mess with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig smile on her face she started wiggling her leg around, causing you to fall around and almost trip over. Delia laughing as you stumble and catch yourself on her calves. Delia stopped shaking as she laughed, your looking so cute to her. Standing back up on her leg, you move forward. Moving onto her knee as you stand on top. Your making distance but you don't know when Delia\u2019s gonna start shaking her leg \u201cBe careful, it could come out of nowhere\u201d Delia said teasingly, almost like she was hearing your thoughts. Although she's picking on you, you still had a smile on her face. Looking at her beautiful face how could you not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving pass her knee you run up her thigh. It was tight, but still had a little fat on it. Something that you had to admit was a bit sexy. Delia started shaking her leg as you dropped down onto the fat. This time making sure she's not gonna shake you off. With a teasing laugh she stopped \u201cCome on, thats no fun\u201d She's not gonna throw you off, so she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forward you run up to her thigh, and instead of climbing up her torso like she was expecting you did something she didn't expect. You climbed under her white one piece dress. Wiggling under the tight dress and across her thigh. She could feel you wiggling across her thigh as she had to stop herself pulling you out. She didn't say anything, but she surely didn't expect this. She thought the worse you were gonna was play with her feet or maybe her breasts. She surely didn't expect downstairs fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wiggled in you consider wiggling back out, is this crossing the line? She did give you free reign but maybe your doing something that you shouldn't. You stop as you really consider going out, Delia\u2019s voice stopped you though as you turn your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy'd you stop, keep going. I gave you free reign, if you wanna play down there then go ahead\u201d She said as you didn't expect that. Well if she's really giving you the chance why stop. Wiggling further through her thigh you get closer and closer to her waist. Her dress tighter and tighter as you go further and further. \u201cHave you fun for now, later though. Im sure you don't mind if i have free reign too\u201d She added ominously, making you wonder what she's going to do to you. Wiggling further you see her underwear. Grey and tight just like her clothes. She clearly wasn't expecting anyone to see her underwear today, which kind of makes you lucky a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into the clothes you reach her grey underwear. Gripping it as you consider what you should do. Maybe you can climb in there and get more personal with her personal area. She wouldn't mind since she doesn't mind you being in here. But then again climbing behind her and seeing her massive rear would also be nice. Then again once again you can climb her body inside of her dress. That would be very fun as well and also kind of erotic. Just like all three options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Capturing Pokemon is something that has always come easy to you. Ever since you were little if you saw a Pokemon that you wanted, it was already yours at that point. This is what made the best job for you when you did get older was a Pokemon hunter. People from good to bad to just flat out rich and bored hired you to go out to catch Pokemon. Sure there have been some times where the Pokemon was a little difficult to catch but with true persistence you were always able to get the job done. No matter if it was a rare or even a legendary, you were able to catch them to deliver to your employer. The best catch that you have had to this point was a Mewtwo which helped put you on top list of best Pokemon Hunters and most wanted. But there was nothing the police could really do since it's not illegal to catch Pokemon just stealing them is and that is why you have always had a rule against catching Pokemon outside of the wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you were approach with what could be your biggest challenge yet, Team rocket has hired you to capture the god Pokemon known as Arceus. They offered you enough poke-dollars that would be impossible to spend in 10 lifetimes next to your 1. Which turned you onto the challenge even more. Sure at this point you didn't really need it cause you had enough to last the rest of your life and more. But it's all about the sport now and this challenge was way to good to give up on. And so you accepted there offer without any hesitation. Then you packed and headed straight towards what you believe to be your destiny. To be the first to capture a God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Rocket apparently found where Arceus is calling home, and so with there map you were easily able to find the location and done into a deep cave you went. The place was filled with danger and Pokemon that clearly didn't want you here but were easily beaten by your might. It took you about 3 days to reach Arceus domain, but you were finally in the den of the god. Looking around at first no such Pokemon were around, just a huge bedding nest that clearly look like it belonged to a big Pokemon. You chose to setup camp and wait, but as you were doing so and had your back turned. A hove liked thing grabs the back of your shirt and lifts you up. You turn and see Arceus face looking you in the eye, the Pokemon then touch your head and started to speak \"Listen human I am speaking to you through telepathy. Now I ask you to tell me why you have come to my home\". Arceus looks so menacing to you and even though your scared out of your mind, you think of a lie to say to try and calm down the god Pokemon \"Oh great Arceus I have come to you with a request. I am trying to gather more information on you to spread across the region. And was wondering if you would be so kind as to allow me to ask you my questions\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus can see into your mind and knows right away that you are lying, but instead of freaking out. The god Pokemon puts you down and without reading your mind any further tells you to ask away. This forces you to think on your feet, but luckily that is something that your good at \"Of course, just give me a moment as I grab my notebook. It has all the questions that I have written down\" You say this and Arceus allows you to search your bag for a notebook that is probably not there. With a bow to the God you run over to your bag, and with a sneaky grin on your face a gun is taken out. Then with as much speed as you can muster, you aim the gun and fire. Hoping the electricity inside of the net is enough to take the legend down. But to your bad luck today the net is broken up by a hyper beam that was blasted by the huge Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have really anger the God Arceus, the Pokemon blasts the remains of your bag into oblivion. \"My stuff, hey that was...\" Arceus silence you with his god like abilities. At this point true fear was coming over you, this kind of feeling is something that you have never felt before. As Arceus approaches you and with the god's psychic abilities, you are forced onto the ground to kneel before the God. \"Human you have angered me, and I was honestly going to just let you go. But this trickery is not to go unpunished. Your Pokemon are now set free (you check and see your poke balls are gone). I will only allow you to keep your clothing but the punishment does not end here. Now tell me, before I decide what to do with you who are you\". Arceus ask this to you in a demanding way, gives you back your ability to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that you might have more to gain then lose by telling the god Pokemon who you are. You gain the confidence to strongly say \"Arceus my name is (Your Name) and I am a Pokemon hunter. But not an ordinary hunter,  I am one who was blessed by the gods with the ability to never allow a Pokemon to escape me. I am the biggest deal in the Pokemon world. And even being stuck in this ...\" Arceus cuts you off by saying \"ENOUGH!! Human I have heard enough out of you. Let me tell you that you are not special, just lucky and luck has a way of running out eventually. Now I have decided your punishment, I think its time you learn just how small you truly are in this world and I have the perfect person in mind who could really teach you, just how little you really are...\" With that said you were teleport-ed you out of Arceus sight and into a dark place that kept bouncing you up and down. Without ever giving you a moment to catch your footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bouncing slow and turns into a more manageable bouncing. You here what sounds like a door closing and then followed by light pouring from the top of the confined darkness space you were in. Then a giant hand with a pink fit wrist band on enters the space and scoops you and a couple of other big things into its grasp. Once out you see before you a small town that just look small because of your distance away from it. the hand then dump you and the other stuff into the town, which felt normal size to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the side of you and finally got a good look at the other things near you, two big trees that seemed plastic, a person who was about twice your size who also looked plastic, and a car which you know was plastic. What is going on you thought to yourself as in that moment you then begin to look up to see a beautiful woman's face taking up the sky. She was smiling down at you and the other objects around you. She then started walk away for a moment to put away her key and get something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice then pop in your head as your sitting there confused out of your mind. \"Well hunter this shall be the last time we speak to one another, so you better listen good. I have shrunk you down to a tiny man. And have gifted you to a woman cyclist who has a kink for feeling giant and powerful. So she collects miniature figures and sets them up as her town that she looks over. Now she has no idea who you are and thinks your just a toy she found out in the wild. To her your nothing but an object. But maybe you can change that or maybe not and you will live as her favorite little miniature for life. I don't care or even want to know. So good luck Hunter your going to need that...\" with that said Arceus voice disappeared. And the stomping noise that was coming in from the distance meant that the woman was coming back to play with her miniatures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you blindly wandered through the towering vegetation, you suddenly heard screaming coming from up ahead. The scream sounded like a girls, but it didn't sound like screams of pain or danger. More like the kind of screams some people do when they try to get themselves pumped up before physical activity. Regardless, this was your first sign of life since you shrunk and you weren't going to pass this possible opportunity up. Running as fast as your little legs could carry you, you pressed onward, pressing the plant life out of your way as you tried to find the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally reached a clearing you saw the source of the screaming. Standing in the far end of this clearing in the middle of the woods was a lone girl dressed in orange, though not in a lot. She seemed to be wearing a top and short shorts and nothing else. Kinda understandable since she was in the middle of some intense physical training, practicing kicking on an old tree. She probably would want an outfit that granted her more movement. You quickly identified the person as a \"battle girl\" type trainer who mostly seem to dress in identical styles to this. You faced a few of them before in Pokemon battles. Seeing some of the things these girls could do on their own made you very relieved that the Pokemon were the ones doing the fighting and not the trainers. Almost on cue with this thought, the girl let out one loud scream before kicking the tree with everything she had. You stared with your mouth open as you watched the tree crack and finally snap and fall over from the point that she attacked it. You were both amazed and terrified by the sight. Even if you were normal sized, seeing someone do that, even if the tree was already in fairly poor shape, would be enough to make you question approaching them for help. And you're MUCH smaller than normal size. You're less than dust compared to her power. Still you didn't have any other options. You swallowed hard and made your way towards the resting giantess, hoping that she was friendly. You tried to calm yourself with thoughts of someone who could do THAT being your protector. Of course if she wasn't feeling so nice, you dreaded your chances of survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you were at her. The battle girl was sitting down on the ground, legs crossed. She was panting loudly, recovering after exerting herself so much. She didn't seem to notice the tiny person by her leg just yet, though it would be pretty hard to miss you if she starts paying the slightest amount of attention. Standing so close to her, you saw just how fit this girl was. Her legs were well toned, her revealing wardrobe showed off her muscles very well. Despite this, her form was still rather feminine, albeit one that could clearly kick your ass with no effort at all. You stood in silence. Your mouth was open, but no words came out. Fortunately, no words needed to as her eyes finally seemed to notice the tiny person standing there looking half scared to death. She shifts a bit to get a closer look at you inspecting her find curiously. Though you still couldn't talk, she figured out your predicament rather easily. The question is, what will she do?</span></div></div>",

Don't mess with this chick\u2019s workout sessions. \u201cOk, ill wait a couple days\u201d You say to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah you will\u201d She said happy that your backing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then why aren't you training now?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm taking a break, i just did several hours straight\u201d She told you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, you must really like training\u201d you say to her finding it hard to believe someone can be this obsessed with it. \u201cI mean, i don't think i can do it for even half an hour. Let alone more\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then got an idea. She grabbed you with her huge sweaty hand and deposited you onto her finger.

You just stared in disbelief as you hung on for dear life. \"Oh don't give me that look. Keep in mind, I don't have to do anything for you. I'm the one being nice. All I'm doing is making sure you earn your portion of the food and water.\" You really really wanted to argue about basic compassion and empathy with this girl, but she was right about one thing, so long as you were getting food, water, and protection from this girl, she was the one in power to decide the terms. At the very least she's doing this.... somewhat fairly... you hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how many do I have to do?\" You said finally resigning to her whims. The battle girl pressed a finger from her free hand to her cheek as she thought. \"Hmm, lets start something simple like 30.\" Wait WHAT? \"Twenty? I... I can't do that many!\" you argued hoping you can convince this girl to lower the reps down to something more your speed. \"Not with that defeatist attitude.\" she retorted bluntly. It's clear that her expectations are a teensy bit skewed by her own abilities. \"I... I don't work out like that so much...\" you started as her free hand poked your stomach. \"Yeah I can see that.\" Well that was just mean. You might not be like this workout nut, but you certainly weren't out of shape. You swear she had a playful grin when she did this. Is she intentionally doing this? Before you can continue she speaks once more. \"Fine you just have to do five for now. But they better be perfect form.\" This was a huge relief to you. Even though you were a bit tired from your traveling, five seemed doable to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to work quickly, pulling your body up from her finger. As you reached the top, you heard her begin her count \"One.\" Ok, off to a good start. You slowly lowered yourself to pull yourself up a second time. But she didn't count as you lowered yourself back down. You looked to her only to see a somewhat disappointed gaze. \"I'm not counting that you. You have to pull all the way up.\" Crap. Maybe this won't be so easy. You tried again pulling yourself up quickly. \"Nope. Not that one either. Your motion's all jerky. Your muscles won't get anything out of this if you keep taking shortcuts.\" Damn, she really wasn't kidding about the form. And you were already feeling tired from the three you did. \"You really are a hopeless case aren't you? I'd bet if I was shrunk and came across you at normal size, I could still kick your ass with no effort.\" Harsh. Still, you couldn't complain now. You had to save your breath to get the 4, PROPER pull ups done. You feel your muscles aching as you tugged yourself up \"TWO.\" her voice echoed as you lowered yourself back down. \"Now keep that up.\" Unfortunately you managed to mess up another 2 or 3 times. You weren't sure you could keep up with this deceptively difficult demand. Her reasons for discounting your efforts seemed to grow increasingly petty and you were getting really tired as you finally reached the fourth. Do you manage to pull through.</span></div></div>",

And then you don't have to workout anymore, ignoring the giant girl watching you try, you notice something. Your hands, are slipping!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, all the sweat from your efforts and from her workout before is coming back to haunt you. You just need to stop yourself, you so close to the top that you just need to hold on and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nope lost grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip off of her fingers and fall down, you panic thinking that your going to fall down to the ground. However a quick look down made it obvious that you weren't falling to the ground. She held you over her body so you fell down and landed on the edge of her training bra. Or more specifically the breast under it. You land on her training bra as you panic and grab the fabric, You didn't really want to fall anymore then you've already have. You look up and the see the girl with a disappointed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn't even make 5\u201d She said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to, then i slipped!\u201d You yell back at her as you didn't even want to look down at the ground underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey those are just excuses\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuses!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, if you really were dedicated you wouldn't let something like a little sweat stop you. Then again it probably wasn't a little to you.\u201d She said getting the thought of how big her sweat looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, i think you might of fell on purpose. I mean i don't think it was by chance that you landed there.\u201d She taunted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, clinging onto the edge of your Bra and trying not to fall down, this is exactly where i wanted to be\u201d You say sarcastically back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyway, I think since you slipped away from finishing the pull up. You should have to do something else\u201d She said to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, so your not finished. \u201cFine, but thats the last one. After it I'm taking a break\u201d You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then i suppose ill have to make it extra hard\u201d She said as she ran some ideas though her mind. You pull yourself up off and on top of her breast. You look at the girl above you thinking as you didn't want to find out what she's going to make you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I've decided\u201d The girl said \u201dYour going to _________________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Face first you rammed between the Battle girl\u2019s tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, trying to pull your upper body out from between her boobs, but one of her fingers pushed against your ass until you were well into her bosom. As you struggled, you could feel yourself slightly slipping deeper between her breasts. Suddenly, the soft fleshy walls around you began to compress as the Battle Girl started to squeeze her boobs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm, soft, but albeit sweaty embrace of the girl was dominated by intense pressure as she massaged and squished ber bosom together. \u201cAll you had to do is try, now I\u2019ll have to do all of the work for you.\u201d She boomed from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Right, it\u2019s my fault that you put me between your boobs.\u2019</i> Somehow, she seemed to think, or at least tried to make you think that this was all your fault and that she had no alternative. But you were confident that was a load of bull. Not that there was anything you could do about it, at least at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle girl continued to mash her tits around, almost crushing you from the pressure as she continued to knead the flesh around you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You suddenly saw the Battle Girl smirk down at you as an idea entered her mind. Maybe you should have tried your luck looking for someone else, anyone else, when you had the chance. At first she seemed kinda apathetic, but still helpful. Now she seemed like she was really starting to enjoy the power she held over you. Looking back up at her face, you saw an almost menacing look in her eyes which seemed to be contemplating ways to torment and humiliate you for her own twisted amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, the Battle Girl's intentions were nowhere near so sinister. She didn't have any malicious intent for you, at least not right now. Just a bit of fun for this once in a lifetime opportunity. From the moment you chose to reveal yourself, this muscular titan knew that your presence was about to make her routine workout a lot more interesting. Of course she takes her exercise and training very seriously, so if you were going to be staying with her, you were going to have to get in on it yourself and earn your stay. Obviously your size and inexperience meant that she would have to get a bit more creative with you which she clearly didn't mind at all. After all, messing with you like this was a fun little bonus for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you clung to the fabric of her training bra, drenched in a combination of sweat from the both of you, the strong giantess finally outlined the terms of your new workout. \"I'm going to go for a run. All you have to do is hang on.\" You felt mixed about this one. \"Hang on where? And how long will this be?\" She looked at you with a face that just screamed 'DUH!' and responded \"Where you are now. If you can stay on there for the entirety of my 10 mile run, then you'll be done for the day.\" Wait ten miles?! Even in her shape that will still take over an hour to complete. She seemed to grin at the shocked, pleading look you were giving her. \"Oh come on. I can't let up on my own training just because you're being a baby. Now get yourself ready. I'll be starting after I finish my drink. Knowing you didn't have time, you climbed up and held on to the top, sticking your arms in to get a better grip. As she finished her drink, she poured a little water into a cap and held it in front of you, offering you a small drink before the ordeal began. Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, you quickly lapped up what she gave you. Arceus knows you definitely needed that. But you didn't have time to thank her for this as she immediately began her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl did not pull any punches. Her body shifted as her arms and legs pumped, moving as a quick pace. You held on tightly as you were jerked around, feeling like you were about to be launched into the air several times. But you managed to hang on. looking up, the Battle Girl didn't even seem to notice you anymore. Her mind was 100% set on running right now. All other things were just pointless distractions. Thankfully her breasts didn't shake around as much. Her tight clothes and training bra managed to keep it secure for the most part. There were a couple instances, but thankfully nothing too big. After about 15 minutes or so, the girls pace slowed a bit. She was simply pacing herself before the terrain got rough, but it was a break you were most thankful for. During this time she finally glanced down to check up on you. You couldn't really determine any emotion or intention from her face, but you figured she was still mostly focused on her running. As you looked back to the path, you saw what she was pacing herself for. The trail was about to take a steep incline with some large rocks scattered about. \"Hold on tight.\" she said as she picked up the pace once more and began her ascent. You were rocked about violently as she made her way up the rough terrain. Though most people would eb slowed down by this part, the Battle Girl seemed to make it her mission to sprint up this incline as fast as possible. Her arms pumped faster and you heard her panting as she continued. You barely managed to keep your grip, but as she neared the top You were finally sent flying, flailing desperately to grab back onto her. Any part of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy sheer luck, you caught the very bottom of her training bra. Unfortunately it was drenched in sweat and you were exhausted. As you felt your grip slipping, you tried calling up to her, pleading for help before you lose your grip and fall.</span></div></div>",

Your arms getting more or a workout then the pull ups before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I've fallen can you help me!\u201d You say between breaths trying to get her to notice you and help you up. However you knew for a fact that she wasn't hearing you. She was to focused on her run to hear you. You know this for a fact cause she would of told you off from yelling so much during the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep panicking, you don't how long she's been on the run for. Maybe she's halfway through the journey, maybe she's about at the end. Or maybe she's at the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you've got to hang on for the rest of the journey. Its defiantly going to be a lot harder then before. but you feel that you have to do it, because otherwise your falling down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that won't be a bad thing, but you think the impact to the ground will hurt you so you decide to hold on.<br>\r\n\u2028After about five minutes later your arms couldn't take it anymore, the impact from the run hurting on your arms as you couldn't hang on anymore. You try as much as you possibly can to not fall down but you arms gave up eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall down off of the bra as your free falling for a short time. Luckily you didn't fall that much as you hit her bare abs. Falling down you move down to her training shorts. This time you landed on the top and you react quickly. Pulling yourself into the waistband and securing your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief and rest you arms. After all the holding on you did, you can finally just relax and take a break. Your also happy that you didn't fall down to the moving ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't be more happy resting here, however you don't know how she's going to feel finding you near her private area. She's been kind of playful so maybe she wouldn't be that angry. <br>\r\n\u2028But still your wondering if you should move somewhere else just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pondered your options very carefully... or about as carefully as your exhausted mind could process the information. Though you might end up in some hot water once the giant Battle Girl notices where you managed to relocate yourself to, you felt there was a pretty good chance that she wouldn\u2019t really mind. After all despite her fairly indifferent attitude she\u2019s been showing towards you, she\u2019s been more playful than malicious towards the tiny being asking her for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to your alternatives, you looked down at her shoes hitting the ground as her long legs took big strides ahead. It would definitely be a much less awkward position to be found it but there were two problems with that that you could immediately identify. First off it would be significantly leas comfortable due to the constant motion. There was a decent chance that her running motions may end up harming you or even kicking you off if you were to try to rest there. Second and probably more important was the fact that, for very similar reasons, it was unlikely you could even safely make your way to the shoe in the first place. It was in quick, constant motion as the Girl was focused solely on her sprints. She was not letting up and as a result there was no safe steady way for you to make your way down. On top of that your arms were completely worn out, to the point that you couldn\u2019t even shift yourself over to a slightly less awkward position on the side of her pants\u2019 waistband. It was pretty obvious that you were going to have to stay put if you wanted to stay under the battle girl\u2019s protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the jog continued you started to think about your gigantic guardian. She didn\u2019t seem to hate you, but she seemed surprisingly indifferent to the plight of the tiny person who found them. Admittedly it could have been a lot worse, but you couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how she felt about you. Are all of these physical trials she\u2019s been putting you through just her trying to help you? Does she just want some company with her typically solitary workout? Is she just having some fun with you? Does she take some twisted joy in watching the helpless bug struggle? That last one seems a bit overdramatic, but the truth was, you knew very little about this girl and her overall intentions with you. It was a rather scary unknown to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point the Battle Girl had worked up one hell of a sweat. She was starteg to breathe heavier as her pace slowed slightly. You lost track of how long this has been going on though clearly quite a while if even her indomitable endurance was starting to wane. You could feel her body expanding and contracting a bit with each deep breath she was taking, pushing and pulling you back and forth slightly. The sweat which flowed over you from above had coated your body enough that your top half was now sticking to her firm stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the giantess returned to her camp, clearly worn out from the long sprint. As she panted in exhaustion, she smiles, satisfied with how well that went and how much she exerted her self so consistantly. These training sessions were clearly paying off. She soon remembered her tiny passenger and felt around her chest for him, but nothing was there. Her eyes widened as she feared that she lost you during the run, but then she started to feel something. Something gently squirm close to her... immediately she turned bright red as she looked down and spotted you in your new position, also trying to catch your breath. You sok. Get a few massive fingers pull you out from the waistline. There was a fairly gross noise that echoed around you as you were finally pulled free from her sweaty stomach allowing a rush of refreshing cool air to cover you. You never felt more relieved... until you remembered where you were and the position you were currently in. Timidly looking up you hoped that she would be understanding of your situation.</span></div></div>",

But while I was working my ass off, you were having a rest in my shorts!\u201d She accused, \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that you have one more exercise while I\u2019m taking a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew better than to try and argue with her at this point, she was never wrong, and it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to defy her if you ever wanted her to get around to helping you. \u201cFine, what do I have to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle Girl smirked, \u201cYou\u2019ll see in a minute. I think it will be perfect for you.\u201d She said, before closing her fist none too gently around you and moving around. Eventually, she dropped you on her sleeping bag that she had set out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting you down she started to rummage around through her pack, \u201cI\u2019m to get some firewood to start a fire to heat up my dinner. Then you\u2019ll finally get to have your workout while I\u2019m taking a break. \u201d She said, not even bothering to look at you. She seemed to be intentionally cryptic as to what this exercise for you was going to be, but you were too tired to ask. Plus you doubted that she would tell you until the last minute before she shoved you into your next torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you got back, you looked around the Battle Girl\u2019s camp. She only really had the sleeping bag that you were on, her pack, and a campfire that had gone out hours ago. Looking at the charred cinders of the campfire made you realize that you really had no idea what time that it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you didn\u2019t even know what time it was when you wandered into the hands of the Battle Girl, who was eager to have a new training partner. But the sun was still out, and in the clearing, it was hard to look to a horizon to see where the sun was. It was clearly well into the afternoon, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be long until the sun started to set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid on your back and closed your eyes\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re that tired already!\u201d The scolding voice of the Battle Girl roused you from a surprisingly deep sleep. When did you fall asleep? You could hardly remember shutting your eyes. Snapping back to reality, you sat up to see her kneeling over you with a steaming plate of some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Sorry, I didn\u2019t even realize that I nodded off to sleep.\u201d You said, but she didn\u2019t seem to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her plate of food, which seemed to be some sort of reheated casserole, on the other side of her sleeping bag. \u201cYou should be well rested for your next exercise then!\u201d She said, sitting with her legs crossed beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally going to tell me what this exercise is then?\u201d You asked, and the Battle Girl smirked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wriggle out from under me after I sit on you.\u201d She said to your shock. She couldn\u2019t be serious. You couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom how much more she weighed than you and glancing at her massive butt gave you even less hope. The thing looked like a freight train of muscle! \u201cNow I honestly don\u2019t expect you to manage to get out, but if you do I might take it easier on you tomorrow. But as long as you put in a good effort you\u2019ll be done for the night, okay?\u201d She said, putting her hands on either side of her, clearly getting ready to move on top of where you were sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too shocked to say anything before a moment, but realizing this was your only chance to reason with her you quickly shouted out. \u201cI, wait! You can\u2019t be serious!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \u201cI\u2019m one hundred percent serious. And besides, you seemed eager enough to get up and close with my shorts earlier. This is a fitting exercise for you!\u201d She said, lifting her backside into the air, scooting over, and hovering over top of you. Her orange shorts did little to contain her ass, actually, it looked like her butt was devouring her shorts. Wedging them in her crack, and probably leaving more skin exposed then they actually covered. Needless to say\u2026 Little was left to the imagination. \u201cNow remember, give it a good effort and you\u2019ll be done for the night.\u201d She said, before plopping her mammoth ass crack right on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey! Waaiii\u2026\u201d Was all that you could manage to blurt out before getting completely covered by the Battle Girl\u2019s sweaty shorts. Your nostrils were immediately assaulted by the familiar smell of her stale sweat. She swayed her hips from side to side, flattening you against her crack as she got comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you were firmly wedged beneath her, the battle girl grabbed her plate and began to eat in the dimming light...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was dark and smelled of the Battle Girl\u2019s sweat, which after how long you\u2019ve spent with her already you were surprised that the smell barely bothered you anymore. But that didn\u2019t compare to the weight! It was like nothing you had ever experienced before. And the heat! Her ass put a hot, humid day in the dead of summer to shame! And she seriously expected you to try and crawl out from under her? You could barely move, let alone get any traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you shuddered to think what strange and oddly creative exercise she would come up with for you if you didn\u2019t \u2018put in a good enough effort.\u2019 You tried to wriggle against her, which the physical exertion and the heat already started to make you sweat like mad. And to think you had just cooled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you can do better than that!\u201d The muffled voice of the Battle Girl said from above you. \u201cI\u2019ll never let this down of you don\u2019t get out of there! Beaten by a girl\u2019s ass? Hah!\u201d You\u2019re sure that your face was probably flushed with embarrassment right now, but that didn\u2019t matter because with every movement you made you got a face full of ass. And to be honest, despite her scolding you for having a defeatist attitude, you knew that you weren\u2019t going to get out of here until she wanted you to. The best that you could do was try...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to writhe and squirm against her, she seemed to continue to pay you no mind. Unbeknownst to you, she had a giant smile on her face. She was enjoying herself, and not just because she was relaxing after a long day of exercising\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an hour, but was probably scarcely longer than ten minutes, your entire body was slick with sweat. You stopped to catch your breath for longer than you thought you would have to. The air was so thick! \u201cHey! No breaks!\u201d You again heard the muffled voice of the Battle Girl say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately started moving at a breakneck pace out of fear of failing to appease your captor. Was she your captor? If you decided that it wasn\u2019t worth the effort and decided to leave\u2026 Well, after she was done putting you to work, would she even let you leave? Would you even find someone else who would agree to help? Was she even going to help you in the first place, or did she intend to keep you as a permanent workout partner? All of these thoughts coursed through your mind as you continued to squirm around to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I at least hope that she\u2019s enjoying this.\u2019</i> You thought, which drew your attention back to the Battle Girl\u2019s behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>was</i> enjoying this. Even if she wouldn\u2019t admit it, you knew that she was. She only agreed to help you in the first place if you worked out with her. Not that she really gave you much of a choice. She didn\u2019t even give you her name, or properly introduced yourself. You were just drafted into the Battle Girl\u2019s exercise camp, or starve with no food or water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I'm doing is making sure you earn your portion of the food and water.\u201d The Battle Girl\u2019s words echoed in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grew harder and harder to think about anything but the immediate task at hand. You feel like you\u2019ve probably sweat a gallon of water at this point, and were probably covered in ten times as much from the Battle Girl. You groaned in frustration. You knew this was unfair, but you also knew that you had to accept it. And after all of this you couldn\u2019t just give up and have it be for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your strength waned. Your muscles screamed in protest as the pushed against the cushiony surface pinning you to the ground. Yet again, you stopped catching your breath. Suddenly, her ass shifted around on top of you, rubbing you around against her. \u201cCome on, this is pathetic! I can barely feel you down there when you are moving. You can\u2019t just stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in protest, you forced yourself to keep moving even though every muscle in your body seemed to be content with crashing. The pressure on top of you increased immensely as the Battle Girl started to lightly bounce up and down on top of you. \u201cMaybe we will have to do this again\u2026\u201d She taunted, your growled in protest and forced yourself to push forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, you don\u2019t seem to have actually moved at all from the original position that you were on when she sat on you. Actually, the only time anything felt different was when the Battle Girl was rubbing her butt around. Despite the fact that you were physically spent, you doubted that you were anywhere close to where she thought that you should be. But she did have unfair expectations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you couldn\u2019t go on any longer. You tried to force yourself to continue, but your body refused, and you fell limp. You honestly thought that you might pass out from lack of clean air, but you couldn\u2019t exactly tell if your vision was getting any darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on little guy, you can do better than that!\u201d She said, resuming her bouncing motion on top of you. But you were spent\u2026 You wanted to keep going but your body refused. After bouncing on top of you for a good minute, the Battle Girl realized that someone was probably wrong, and she sat up off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area that her butt had been moments before left a dark outline, with you sprawled out on your back in the center. Your chest was heaving like mad now that the pressure had been released, and the air was fresh. After sitting cross legged across from you and observing you for a few seconds and determining that there was nothing seriously wrong with you, she picked you up and placed her on her palm. \u201cWell\u2026 You\u2019re covered in sweat.\u201d She said, shifting her hand so she could rub her thumb over your body. \u201cMost of it is probably my sweat though.!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d You managed to wheeze out in between breaths. \u201cI, wheeze, worked, wheeze, my, wheeze, ass off.\u201d You struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle girl eyed you for a few more seconds, before coming to a decision. \u201cFine, you\u2019re done for the day. You did a good job even though you didn\u2019t even come close to managing to escape.\u201d She said, almost sounding proud of you. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned your dinner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set you down on the plate she had eaten from and had the cap of water and small scrap of bread for you. Even though you were starving and thirsty it took you a few minutes of catching your breath before you even approached what she had set out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle Girl eyed you with some concern before you crawled to your feet and drank your fill. \u201cDon\u2019t drink too much or you\u2019ll throw up.\u201d She said, trying to act uninterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you ate and drank your fill you collapsed back down, and a few seconds later you felt the Battle Girl\u2019s fingers wrap around you. \u201cI\u2019ll let you use my pair of old shorts from yesterday as a blanket.\u201d She said, and you didn\u2019t even bother to argue. But she just stared at you for an uncomfortable amount of time, until you looked up at her. \u201cOh, right.\u201d She said, setting you on her pillow, the pulling out her shorts from yesterday. And setting them in the dirt about a foot from the head of her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and gently picked you up and set you on her old shorts, lifting up the massive thigh hole and tucking you under it. \u201cNow make sure you have a nice long rest, because we have a full day of training still tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and looked at her, causing her to giggle. \u201cCome on, you\u2019ll be thanking me when this is over anyways. I\u2019ll help you get a lot stronger, and find out how you got shrunk down to this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 Goodnight.\u201d You said, ready to pass the hell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d She simply replied, before getting under her covers, and laying on her side looking towards you. You felt her eyes staring at you, but you were too embarrassed to acknowledge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually the Battle Girl rolled over onto her back and seemed to nod off. You looked over at her, admiring her admittedly somewhat messy blue hair. Although as pretty as she was, you were too tired, and laid your head back down and closed your eyes. Before you knew it, you were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you awoke in the darkness. The fire had died down to a few embers, and you felt cold. The pair of discarded shorts were designed to be airy and provided very little insulation. You looked over to the Battle Girl in the dim light, who was facing you on her side with her eyes closed. She seemed to be out cold, judging from her breathing. She probably wouldn\u2019t notice if you were to climb up next to her\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that was a terrible idea. If she found you nuzzled up against her in the night she would probably never let it down. Assuming she was feeling generous, it would probably be an excuse to call you a perv and make you have to work harder tomorrow\u2026 But you were starting to shiver a bit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Fine, but I really hope I don\u2019t regret this.\u2019</i> You thought, throwing off the sweaty shorts and stumbling towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the edge of the sleeping bag, you looked up at her. Her eyes were closed, and her face was relaxed. Her mouth was slightly agape, and her chest heaved gently as she drew breath... You climbed up the sleeping bag and tried miserably to walk stably across the soft surface, almost blundering straight into the Battle Girl's neck. Her neck protruded out from under her blanket and you could faintly see the outline of her breasts beneath the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated, <i>\u2019She didn\u2019t seem to have any problem having me hang onto the top of her bra earlier.\u2019</i>You decided that it would probably be fine, and feeling the heat radiating off of her, there was no way you were going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimidly, you laid against her shoulder nervous that any slight movement might awake her, but she was still out cold. Eventually, you half buried yourself, covering yourself under the side of her shoulder. Your foot gently brushed the top of her breast, but you felt that you kept a safe enough distance for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter warming up quickly, your eyelids drooped in the heat and you were out before you even realized it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly started to come to your senses as you slowly awoke, your remembered yesterday\u2019s drastic turn of events, and you remembered where you were. You could see the blurry light coming in the whole between the Battle Girl and the blanket, but something was wrong. Something <i>felt</i> different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand was right on top of you! You stiffened, terrified that she had found you but nothing happened. Was she still asleep? Had she unknowingly placed her hand on top of you in her sleep? You realized that you were no longer against her shoulder, but you were between the top of her breast and her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after staying still for a while, nothing happened. Had she grabbed you like this in her sleep? Or had she woke up, noticed you, and pulled you into this position? Either option had rather pleasant implications, but whether or not the Battle Girl would take this well was a different story.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt anxious, but what could you do? If you could even manage to try and wriggle out from her hand she would undoubtedly notice you. Just like everything else that had happened, you would just have to take it. There was nothing else you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm\u2026\u201dYou heard the Battle Girl hum as she gently awoke. Her hand flexed around you, \u201cHmm?\u201d She rubbed her finger around you, which was probably a familiar shape by this point. She seemed to think for a few seconds before her fingers wrapped around you as everything started moving. You were held in front of her as she sat up, but much to your surprise she had a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it that you slept well!\u201d She said, holding you in her fist so that you could only really move your head. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t keep your hands to yourself huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not the one who grabbed my against their boob, I just moved under your blanket so that I wouldn\u2019t freeze.\u201d You said, accusing her of being more guilty in this scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle Girl\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment, and for the first time since you stumbled into her camp, she didn\u2019t seem to have something to say immediately\u2026 \u201cI\u2026 I was asleep.\u201d She slowly said, \u201cI must have just felt you and\u2026  Wanted to hug you I guess.\u201d She said, clearly struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you felt kind of bad, her confident demeanor was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d You reassured, \u201cYou\u2019re only human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d She said as if calmly accepting something. \u201cAnyway.\u201d She said, shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a full day of training ahead. So let\u2019s have breakfast before we set out.\u201d She said, throwing the covers out of the way and standing up, still holding you in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the Battle Girl was back to normal. You sighed as her hand clenched around you as she got up. \u201cHmm\u2026 No sense waiting for you to start\u2026 After how poorly you performed yesterday.\u201d She said, lowering you to the top of her bra just like she had during your run yesterday. \u201cNow make sure you hold on when I get breakfast ready.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t bother to argue as you grabbed on to the seam on the top of her \u2018shirt\u2019 and began to hold on. With you secure, she rummaged through her bag and pulled out what you assumed was a protein bar. She unwrapped it and promptly inhaled it in less than a minute. You watched dumbfounded at how quickly that she managed to eat it, only saving a sliver of the end for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed you and set you down on a log next to her back, and set the piece of the protein bar and her water cap out for you. Wordlessly, you ate and drank your fill. Watching the Battle Girl bend over and root through her pack for something. You couldn\u2019t help but stare at her well-toned backside, which was supported by her thick muscular thighs. It was no wonder that you gained no ground trying to escape yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle Girl looked over her shoulder at you, causing your heart to jump into your mouth as you avert your eyes from her ass. But she just looked back into her pack, seemingly unaware of your ogling. Finally prying your eyes in a different direction, you noticed that she seemed to be putting some stuff into a smaller gym bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stood up and walked back over to you with her gym bag slung over her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hike down to the beach and start our workout for today.\u201d She said before grabbing you and dropping you back on top of her shirt, which you quickly grabbed ahold of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off at a brisk pace down a trail through the forest, you swayed along continuing to bump into her chest as she jogged. Your arms were sore from yesterday\u2019s exercise, and this made you realize that your entire body was pretty sore. She really did give you one hell of a workout\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what was probably only about ten minutes of jogging, the trees parted and you could see the familiar sight of the beautiful Hoenn sea. The Battle Girl jogged across the sand before stopping in the middle of the beach. She knelt to the ground and unslung her bag from her back, and pulled out a beach towel. She calmly leaned over and laid out the towel sideways as you dangled in the air helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand snatched you from your precarious position as she sat down on her beach towel. \u201cI have tons of ideas for exercises planned out for today. It took me a while to fall asleep last night because I kept thinking of ideas for you. I almost felt like I should write some of them down.\u201d She said, clearly excited for the long day ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your actual kissing left a lot to be desired. It was pathetic honestly. But your equally pathetic whimpering and squirming though!\" Her already frightening expression started to unnerve you even more as she remained silent for a few seconds mentally reliving those few seconds. That feeling as she felt your helpless body wiggling against her lips. The whole experience was euphoric to her and to think this was only the beginning. The beginning of a long a wonderful relationship. And she just knew that you felt the same way. She saw all the signs. Sure you looked terrified, but clearly the fear you felt made you long for her even more. Thats how she was reading this series of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, after all the squirming and grinding, your body was providing this maniac with just the proof she needed to confirm these beliefs. With nothing to hide or cover it up, your dick, betraying your actual feelings on the situation, stood at full length. It only got worse as she started to poke and rub the erection with a hunger in her eyes. \"Oh my, someone grew.\" You realized what was going on, but were unable to move your hands to hide it or push her finger away. \"Thought I COULD make it grow more.\" she thought back to the idea of having your tiny body struggling to hold the comparatively massive normal sized dick. But she decided to hold off on that idea for now. Plenty of time for cute hex shenanigans later. For now, she had other ideas of what to do with you. Your faint and adorable struggles putting one particularly good idea in her mind. </span></div></div>",

On top of that she was really pretty. Almost disarmingly so despite her towering stature. You noticed her face shifting toward you, clearly hearing you and noticing your gestures.

This has been your first year at this job and you were already sick of it. The only plus side about working at this office was being able to sit next to the beautiful Kristen (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/4/44/Spr_SM_Office_Worker_F.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/4/44/...</a>) who started at your firm 3 months ago. You had the biggest crush on her. And the only things that you really knew about her was that she was quiet and kept to herself for the most part while being at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even recent talk going around that she didn't have a boyfriend. This gave you more then enough of a reason to just walk up to her and ask her out on a date. But there was one slight problem, you were bad at asking out woman. You even tried working up the courage to just talk to her and every time it seemed that you would always chicken out. But that may change in your mind as your friend Cody (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Spr_SM_Office_Worker_M.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a>) gave you an ultimatum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting in the break room you and Cody were talking about the struggles of having to work this boring job. But it seemed like out of no where Cody brought up Kristen and ask you about her. In which like usual when the topic is brought up you try your best to just change the subject. But this time Cody wasn't having it. Instead he said \"Hey man you got to admit that Kristen is pretty cute. And I am pretty sure you have a crush on her. Listen though if you don't ask her out by this week I think I might take my shot at asking her out...\" Cody was then cut off by our female boss (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ab/Spr_HGSS_Teacher.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/ab/...</a>) who came in and told Cody that she needed him on the sales floor. And with that Cody got up and patted you on the back, heading back into the work force. Leaving you to have his last words ring in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to go to the bathroom and get a hold of yourself. Upon arriving in the bathroom you notice that no one else was in there and you start to lose it. Hitting the walls and yelling stuff to yourself that went like \"Just do it... go ask her out... come on just man up already...\". This went on for about a couple mins, in till you said your last sentence \"I wish that there was some life or death situation where I was forced to ask her out and her to say yes..\". This was just some stupid thing you say to yourself to give you a dumb reason not to ask her out and get rejected. Since your life wasn't really in any danger to ask her out and her saying no wouldn't for sure kill you. This phrase seemed to always convince you. But to your surprise a light started to appear below you and you see a yellow creature faze through the floor below you. You immediately recognize the Pokemon as Jirachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi opens its eyes and just stares at you for a moment, and then gives you a child like laugh followed by saying \"Your wish has been granted\". With that everything around you seemed to turn big and you were ever so tiny. At this point you were to scared and frozen to say anything. So Jirachi gave another laugh and then continued speaking \"Now your in a life or death situation, if you don't ask her out and she doesn't say yes. You will be stuck at this height for the rest of your life. And since this is a strange wish I am going to give you a better starting position..\" You were then teleported, and ended up right underneath Kristen's desk. With Jirachi no where to be seen and you were left there tiny and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing confused out of your mind, you start to feel earthquakes from below you as you see two giant brown heels walking in front of you. And then they become seated at Kristen's desk. The Heels slap the ground in front of you, causing dust to spread like a wave all over you. This gave you the wake up call that you needed. And while brushing off the giant dust specks, you start to tell yourself that you need to get control over yourself. Standing around and asking questions to no one won't do anything. You need to get back to normal size and your best way of doing that will be to play Jirachi's game...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do you do next?)</span></div></div>",

Her short fat toes made soft wet sounds with every wiggle, heavily suggesting they wet with water....or probably sweat. Her feet were shaped like a broad paddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shrunken girl felt herself getting hot and bothered. The bigger girl blushed and smirked as she read her book.

At first, she was very <i>confused</i>, but after she felt her attraction and her hapless mind the psychic feels...weird in a <i>great</i> way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet began to slowly rub together in a nonchalant way that made the poor girl look the other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic silently snicker to herself.

The little girl\u2019s face flushed red as she was unable to contain herself from getting aroused by the situation, which she would have thought was a dream if it weren\u2019t for the pressure of her toes gripping her\u2026 The soft skin of her sole pressing against her\u2026 And the warmth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Psychic smiled to herself as she felt the tiny girl squirm against her toes, and scream against her soles. It felt a lot more empowering than she thought that it would. And the girl seemed to be enjoying it too. She grinned harder as she started to slide her foot back in forth over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo amount of screaming and squirming could wrestle her free from her toes grip, but that didn\u2019t stop her from trying. She wasn\u2019t even sure why she was squirming, to get the psychic\u2019s attention? Surely she knew that there was a tiny girl gripped between her toes, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the psychic released her from the grip of her toes, allowing her to fall panting to the ground. She looked up only to see her foot descending on her again. She screamed for a half of a second before her voice was blocked out as the psychic\u2019s warm sweaty sole pinned her to the ground.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even the ropes and stakes that held it in the ground were an even brighter shade of pink. And you swore that you could see some small amount of sparkles on the tent. Whoever owned this tent must really like sparkly pink things! You tried to take this information and use it to make the situation seem better to you. Maybe if the owner liked sparkly pink, then they liked cute stuff? And small stuff is pretty cute. Well you're small as could be so maybe that's a good thing... at least for getting this person's help. You knew that you were stretching it, but you wanted some self assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move closer towards the tent, you notice that the campsite had mostly been cleared away. It seems like you had good timing, if you had come later than the person at the camp likely would have been gone. The more you thought about the situation the more you were convinced that you had gotten a bit lucky. You found someone that seemed like they would help you and you caught them just before they would be leaving. They could take you to help right away! Your optimistic thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the tent unzipping. You look towards the opening of the tent, eager to set eyes on your savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you see slip out of the tent was a massive brown mary jane! Even from far away you could tell that the shoe absolutely dwarfed you in size! You didn't want to think about it, but if you even wound up in there you'd probably have a good amount of room to move in, even if you were at the tip of the toe section. Whoever this shoe was attached to had to be absolutely massive! Suddenly, your situation felt slightly less optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to the shoe was a leg covered in white stockings and that leg rose up into a big voluminous pink dress with some frilly pink bows on the bottom. This person definitely did love pink. Finally the face of your captive came into view. The massive being who's shoe was like a hotel to you was... only a little girl! A little girl with big, fluffy brunette hair, an unsettling pair of eyes and a large pink bow on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were astounded by the situation you were in. Somehow a little girl was absolutely massive compared to you! You weren't even sure you could consider yourself a bug before her. You felt closer to a speck! Even though this revelation served as a punch to the gut for your optimism, you were still eager to get this child's help. Sure this child wasn't the best source of help, but she would still be useful. After all she couldn't be a bad person to get the attention of, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling your nerves, you begin jumping up and down and yelling to get the girl's attention. Your luck seemed good as she looked towards where you were! You continued to call for her attention with greater gusto. Did all of your effort get her attention?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you continue to call out to the massive little girl, she seems to gradually register your voice. At first her face kind of shifted a bit, like a bug landed on her face but she didn't notice. Then she reacted a bit more, her eyes wandering a bit half looking for something. After dodging her massive shoe, she seemed to finally recognize something was calling to her. She stopped in her tracks and you stood next to her shoe. It towered over you, not as much as you initially thought, but you could definitely fit in there; and with room to spare for her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was standing right before you and she was clearly looking around, a perplexed look on her face. She had clearly heard you and now was the time to get her attention. Desperate for her attention, you run to her shoe and begin banging your fist against it. And with one deep breath you shout with all your might, pleading fort the girl to look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a tense moment of you holding your breath, the girl finally looked down at you! Her eyes bore into your tiny frame and you felt strangely... unnerved. You hadn't noticed before but this girl's eyes were unnatural looking. They seemed to lack pupils and were overly shiny. At first it made you very nervous but then a realization hit you. The girl was already wearing a very frilly, pink outfit and had a equally frilly and pink tent. Her odd looking eyes were probably some kind of contact lenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who had first looked at you with a confused expression, seemed positively overjoyed! She giggled gleefully as she reached her hand out towards you. You flinch and your instincts tell you to run, but you stay put. You needed help badly, and letting the girl pick you up was the quickest way to get it. Her hand gripped you in a strong, yet gentle grip that held you securely in her grasp. When you attempted to move your arms, you noticed that you had complete control over them. So you quickly take your arms out of her grip and wave at the girl, causing her to squeal happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! I can't believe I actually found one of you guys!\" She spoke. \"I was beginning to wonder if you actually existed.\" She brought you towards her face and happily began to snuggle you against her cheek. \"Ah you guys are as tiny and cute as I imagined.\" She giggled to herself  as she enjoyed cuddling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the girl cuddle you against her cheek as you think about what she was saying. Why was she referring to you as \"one of them\" and what does she mean she thought you didn't exist? Were there other tiny humans running around? Was she some kind of witch who dressed like an innocent girl but secretly shrunk and enslaved people!? You quickly dismiss that last idea. It was simply to crazy and she wouldn't be so overjoyed to see you if she did this to you in the first place. You figure that it would simply be best to ask the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why are you reacting like this? I'm a shrunken human, I thought you'd be more shocked and confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stops rubbing you against her cheek and brings you in front of her face, shooting you a sly smile. \"Oh really? Just a little human who happened to end up near my camp? I don't think so! You are obviously a fairy who was attracted by all of my pretty stuff!\" She laughed. \"I'd been trying to find one of you guys for so long and had no luck. But then you just wander over by my shoe and call out to me! Now I can learn all about you guys and play with you!\" She begins snuggling you with her nose and laughing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately start panicking. This girl thought that you were a fairy trying to trick her! If she kept thinking that you were a fairy, then you would never get help like you needed. She'd just keep you all to herself as long as she thought you were a fairy. And you doubted she would give you a chance to run away and find someone else. You immediately try to tell the girl that you are not a fairy and are, in fact, a small human that needs her help to get back to normal. You to try to point out that you don't have wings as proof that you aren't a fairy. You're not sure if that'll convince her but that's the best idea you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the girl believe you?</span></div></div>",

Though you knew you were much weaker at your new size, you were still a bit worried about accidentally harming or angering this woman. Still you didn\u2019t have many other choices. You needed to get someone\u2019s attention immediately. Making two fists you started to punch at the large sole looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d The older woman was caught off guard by this sudden sensations at her feet. At first it startled her, but she quickly noted how good it felt. You kept on hitting the feet, at first you thought she was going to investigate, but she didn\u2019t seem to react beyond that first sound so you continued not noticing that she was simply laying back and enjoying this strange sensation. She was still curious about the source, but right now she didn\u2019t want to interrupt the free foot massage she was receiving. She quietly hummed to herself as she tried to picture what could be causing all of this pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes you needed to stop to rest for a bit. \u201cMan, how weak have I become that she didn\u2019t feel any of that.\u201d You asked yourself. But the truth would soon reveal itself as the feet would quickly move back and the older woman\u2019s face would lean closer to investigate. With the wonderful sensation finally over, she decided to see who or what was causing it. And imagine her surprise when she saw a tiny person under where her feet were, trying to catch their breath after what must have been a long workout for them. \u201cOh my. I can\u2019t say I was expecting this.\u201d She said in a surprised tone. You stared up, somewhat nervously as her face moved closer. \u201cI have to say, that was the best massage I\u2019ve ever received. You have some natural talent there little guy. And all that for free too. You must be really popular around these parts.\u201d Though her compliments on your unintended talents did flatter you a bit, you had to get to the point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you but...\u201d she quickly interrupted \u201coh you didn\u2019t bother me at all, silly.\u201d You simply nodded and got back to the point. \u201cWell anyway, I was mainly trying to get your attention. I woke up this tiny in the woods and have been trying to get help for the past hour. Would you be able to take me to someone who could help?\u201d The Madame listened to your pleas and considered the options. She could certainly try to help, though who exactly could help with a person who shrink in the middle of the woods. Perhaps it might be better to simply keep you with her. After all, she had more than enough money and resources to keep you safe and cared for. But then another thought crept into her head. The thought of having her own personal tiny foot massager ready to give immaculate services at her beck and call. And at your size she could certainly think of a few other uses for you. But what would she do with you?</span></div></div>",

You got along with her very well, so asking her out was going to be no issue. But you had your reasons for not asking her out.  which were one that she had boyfriend (being the guy breeder from x and y), this reason didn't seem to brother you to much since they were in a on and off relationship. But there was one reason that was really big to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour crush on this girl wasn't exactly normal. You see whenever you and Emma hangout she was usually playing and cuddling up with the small tiny Pokemon, calling them cute and stuff. Seeing this after a while sort of gave you a crush on the thought of being shrunken and her pet to have her do some naughty things to you.You even went as far as to finally talk to her about it that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Emma were alone talking it up. And you had the strange thought to hear about what you have been thinking about. But you didn't want to look to strange so you said \"Hey Emma, so I just had a strange dream last night, that I was shrunken and living happily as your pet\" Upon hearing this Emma gave you a strange look and then said \"haha that is strange, I don't think you would like life as being my pet\" That comment made you turn to wards her and you had to ask \"Why do you say that? would you crush me?\". Emma just turned and couldn't believe that this was the conversation  you guys were having but did you the honor of answering \"No, I just don't think you would like life as my pet very much, but hey it would be your life haha...\". The conversation was quickly changed after she said that. And the night quickly ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you were assigned to work with the psychic Pokemon with Emma. Emma was cleaning the area up where they slept, while you went around the room putting food into there bowls. While the thought of last night was in your head you didn't even notice that you step down hard on an Abra's tail. In an instant it you were starring up at the Abra as it got up and walk away.  Emma who didn't even know what was going on turned around and saw you tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god your tiny\" Emma came up to you and grabbed you while bringing you up to her face. You start to think that this is what you wanted in the first place. And you said \"Yea this is great now I can become your little pet...\".

What caught you off guard was the setting. When you fell asleep, you were resting by an abandoned campsite in the woods. Now you\u2019re in a room of some kind. Did someone find you and bring you here? Did you just... show up here kinda like when you first shrank? A lot of questions flooded your head as you looked around. Whoever owned this place seemed to collect a lot of stuffed dolls. There were many scattered all around with a ratty looking clefairy doll sitting on the bed. You also noticed a door open, leading to rather large looking closet with a countless variety of clothes. Though the clothes looked like they were designed for a girl to wear, you couldn\u2019t really gather much more information on whoever lives here. Just her gender and that she collects dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon heard footsteps approaching and quickly hid behind a Cherrum doll. Sure enough a girl entered what you assumed was her own bedroom. She was fairly short, with green hair styled in spiky pigtails and... was dressed exactly like you were... that was... kinda weird. Did she find you and do this intentionally? Whatever the reason she seemed to be looking around for something or someone. You just stuck by your hiding spot, debating if you should try to escape or not.</span></div></div>",

How did you get like this\u2026 No, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me all about\u2026 Later.\u201d She said, lowering you away from her eyes and towards her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed you once, shocked you looked up at her as she moved you towards her lips, which parted and almost wrapped around you. Her massive lips pressed against you like soft, warm pillows, and her tongue quickly began to rub against you. Your face was covered in her saliva as she pulled you away for a second. But before you could try and clean your face off her head tilted back as she flung you onto her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinnia giggled, \u201cAhhhhh.\u201d was all that you could hear before her tongue shot into her mouth and everything turned dark as she smothered you against the roof of her mouth. You writhed around and screamed, but these were only pathetic squirms and whimpers to Zinnia. \u201cMmmmmm,\u201d She moaned as you were drawn uncomfortably close to the back of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mouth opened and she pinned you between her fingers as she pulled you out. This girl was crazy! She giggled, \u201cMy you taste good, but enough of that\u2026\u201d She said, standing up and pressing you against her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking to her bedroll and sat down with you still pressed against her boobs, she giggled and smothered you against her chest for a few seconds. \u201cThey\u2019re twenty times bigger than you easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely you felt that she didn\u2019t intend to hurt you. Well, at least intentionally for the moment. But your options were fairly limited, as you were quite literally entirely in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinnia finally dropped you back to her hand and looked down at you, deciding what she would do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just put me on the ground\u201d You ask her as she just laughs, laughing at the idea as your hopes are dashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me, your too much fun to just let you go. After all I've got plenty more ideas running through my mind. And i think I've got a good one.\u201d She said as she then placed you down onto the ground right in front of the log. Without even stopping the momentum you start running away from her, figuring that you don't want to be anywhere near her anymore. You didn't make it that far however as she stomped right in front of you, her dark skinned foot blocking your way as you run into them.<br>\r\n\u2028\u201cNope not that way, keep running\u201d She teased as you did exactly that. Trying to get away from her, only for her other foot to block you again. Your not getting away form her thats obvious. So your just not gonna try and not play her little game. That way you can beat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor at least you thought until she stomped right down onto you. Pressing her sole onto you as you get a face full of dirt.

She seems to be having so much fun teasing you and playing with you. A miserable thing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her foot slightly and started to roll you around in the dirt. Rolling you in the dirt as she stopped you when you were on your back. She then brought her foot down onto you once again, this time her foot right in your face as you have to turn you head to avoid the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow since I'm being nice right now I'm going to give you an ultimatum\u201d She said as you were shocked. Being nice! She's trapped you under her ass, threw you in her mouth, smothered  you against her breasts and played with you with her feet. thats her being nice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Ultimatum, is to kiss my foot. not once, not twice. But as many times as i want. In exchange ill get my foot off you.\u201d Zinnia said as it sounded like a good deal, if not for the fact that you knew when she gets the foot off of you she's gonna play with you in some other fashion. Then again you don't want to be under her foot any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, cause if you don't pick soon your gonna get something much worse then my foot. After all theres a little place behind that no one would want to go\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs... is she threatening you with anal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Getting a close view of her beautiful face. Gazing at her wondering eye. She looked so familiar to you. Like you've seen her before somewhere.

She dropped the book to the side and moved her now free hand under you. Dropping you down onto her free hand as you could now move. She smiled at you \u201cI am, but i think your the one who's more special right now. Are you sure you don't know how you got this small. Maybe you can think about it some more\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried, but you couldn't get anything really. \u201cSorry, nothing\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i suppose its no big deal\u201d Cynthia said with a smile, shocking you how she doesn't seem disappointed or sad \u201cAfter all i can think of multiple ways to grow you back to an average size. Magic, Science, Pokemon. It will be a simple trick mister....., Im sorry i forgot to ask\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... when i said i didn't know, its not because i didn't realise what shrunk me. Its because i have Amnesia\u201d You explained to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that defiantly a big deal.\u201d Cynthia said to you \u201cSo you don't remember your name, but you remember me. I must of left quite the impression on you\u201d Cynthia said as she smirked to you. Suppose she did, if you remember her but not your history. You gain a blush as Cynthia smiled even more. This is an opportunity she's been given. \u201cWell since your small and by yourself, i think its only suitable i take you in\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, seriously\u201d You say with a big smile. At first you think its because she's caring about you, but it might be because your spending more time with Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't just leave you here or drop you off to someone else. Plus i wouldn't mind, i could really use the company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Cynthia.\u201d You shout to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can leave later, after all i came to this beach to relax. Im sure you won't hold it against me if i keep enjoying my time\u201d She said. You answered back with a simple of course not. Cynthia dropped you near her rear. Onto the blanket she was laying on she grabbed the book. Holding it up she giggled to herself. \u201cAlthough i suppose going back to reading might be a bit mundane after this encounter, not to mention it would be a bit rude\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mind, I'm the one that intruded\u201d You say to her, however she was having none of it. Putting the book to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts fine, after all i think i might just have some fun with my new little friend\u201d Cynthia said. She then brought her finger to you, bumping into you as you almost trip over the hit. Her finger was dainty and slender, but to you it was like a heavy branch. Her finger came at you against hitting you in the back, you couldn't keep your footing this time as you fall down onto your stomach. Cynthia laughing at the situation. You didn't think she would be this playful with you, but if your being honest you don't mind being toyed around by a beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, guess my fingers are stronger then i thought\u201d Cynthia said keeping at her playing. She brought her finger down to you and scooped itself under your stomach. Lifting you up back to your feet. After dusting yourself off she pulled her hand away. She didn't take her eyes or her smile off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just realised what we can do\u201d Cynthia said as you were curious. What is she going to do?

Holding it Cynthia thinks it might look a bit tight for her. Something she can stand, and something she knows you will love. Speaking of you, she turned her head to spot you turning your head too. Swiftly moving it so you wouldn't get caught. But Cynthia did catch you, and she loved that you peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd well... so did you. You couldn't help yourself as you peeked at the giant blonde. Her back was to you so you didn't see any of her front side, but you did manage to catch her giant sexy rump.

Two straps over her shoulders and a window V into her cleavage.

She stood over you, her bare legs towering over you. Not only that but her you could almost see her cave hidden behind the white cloths. Cynthia smiled as she reached down for you, grabbing two fingers as she raised you up to her face. She held you up as she smiled, then frowned, then smiled once again. Reaching her long and slender fingers to you she tore off your shirt. Leaving you in just your shorts. \u201cThere, now your ready for a swim. Now i could put you on the sand and you can make your way to the water, but honestly that might take longer then ill like. So ill just carry you there\u201d She said. Now in your mind and honestly mosts you thought she would just carry you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats not what Cynthia had in her mind, with a smile she brought you closer to her large chest. Holding you there over her canyon. She then dropped you down into her cleavage. Your feet gets trapped as you feel her fingers adjust. Dropping down onto your shoulders. She then roughly pushed you deeper into her canyon cleavage. You get pushed deeper until your shoulders were deep in her breasts. Her white One piece being perfect, letting you still see out of her clothes.

Im sure you don't mind being in between them? Do you?\u201d Cynthia said as she didn't even wait for your answer. She knows what it is. Walking closer to the beach she was ready for a swim. Of course she's not going to keep you in there the whole time while she swims, but for the early portions of course. Walking forward she finally reached the water, her feet in the cold water. Running forward she dived into the water. Scaring you as the water came. Luckily you held your breath just in time. Cynthia after about five seconds remerged. Completely wet. Her hair now hugging her body as she felt the sun shining down on her. This is gonna be one fun swim, she can feel that. Looking down at her Cleavage she saw ______</span></div></div>",

She then checked the rest of her suit, hoping that you had mearly slid in too deep rather than getting knocked out of her chest into the water. \"Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cynthia's dive, the water had sent you flying into the sea. Despite your diminished size, you were able to resurface no problem. What was a problem is that there was no land in sight for what seemed like miles to you. The only thing you can see is Cynthia frantically searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to swim for her, but the ocean was too strong and pulled you around effortlessly. You had to kick and splash just to stay afloat. Just as you start to think that all hope is lost, you feel something rise up from under you. You look down and see a hand lifting you out of the water. Sure enough, the arm followed and led straight back to Cynthia's fine body, now sporting a concerned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little one! I'm so glad I found you.\" She presses you into her cheek and starts to nuzzle you. \"I was so worried that I thought I lost you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Cynthia. Just please, don't do that again.\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Maybe swimming in the ocean is a bit too dangerous for you right now.\" She cups her hands around you and carries you back to shore. \"Maybe we can just do something right here on the sand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" You ask. </span></div></div>",

Her white one piece nearly merged with her extremely pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her swimwear, she turned around and, before you, dropped the swimsuit, which fell to the ground, revealing you her bare butt-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was naked in front or you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed furiously while she turned her head slightly, a sly smirk on her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'll need you for something,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"You see, I need to apply sunscreen. The rays would go way too hard for my skin otherwise. But you'll understand that I need you to apply it on my back, which I can't reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, you could only mutter a 'Sure' that made Cynthia's smile widen before she reached to her side, digging into a beach bag you haven't noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still giving her back to you, so the only thing you could see was her bottom, that however did a good job in making you aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sure was one beautiful giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, without turning once, Cynthia picked up her sunscreen and removed the lid before she proceeded to lay down on the sand; she turned her head, still carrying that smile that gave her a mysterious charm, and brought her free hand to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climb on.\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obeyed and climbed onto her hand as she brought it to her back and placed the sunscreen right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do my whole back, if you don't mind. I'd love a massage.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" you replied, thinking that this was the least you could do since she was offering to take care of you in these conditions you found yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, walking over the tube, you experimentally jumped on top of it and watched a a thin white river came out, staining Cynthia's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold lotion made the giantess giggle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began rubbing the sunscreen over her back, doing your best to fulfill her request of a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde goddess moaned softly as she felt your tiny hands sliding across her back, pleasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear you have a certain talent doing this.\" she praised, causing you to smile awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo massage such a beautiful woman, what more could you ask for right now? A few perverted thoughts managed to find a way to penetrate your mind among other thoughts, but you shook them off to focus on your task, telling yourself that you would never do such things such as trying to sneak to her bare breasts to a giantess who was helping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short amount of time, you had managed to cover half of her back and had to walk back to the sunscreen tube to refill your hands with the white lotion, which you carried in your cupped hands after squeezing the tube the best you could to get it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began applying the lotion to Cynthia's lower back as well, doing your best. However, at some point, you noticed the lack of praising and pleased moans, so you simply had to ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cynthia, am I doing good?\" you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moments of silence that followed your question, you ears managed to pick up on a familiar sound: snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia had fallen asleep. How much of a good job were you doing if you could help relax so much that she even fell asleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with yourself, you continued your work, deciding to get this over with before deciding what to do while Cynthia slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you managed to rub the champion's whole back with the sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of your earlier thoughts came back and, deciding this wouldn't be much of a big deal since Cynthia was asleep, with a blush you climbed up on her left butt-cheek to observe your work from above... and to enjoy the feeling while you were at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's butt was so soft, and smelled heavenly. This woman was at the same time a warrior and an angel, and you couldn't like it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you decided it was time to get off from her bare butt and moved to climb down, walking dangerously close to her butt crack, wishing to see what was between her cheeks before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you catch a glimpse, something happened...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't on account of a perverted wish, you merely wanted to admire this giantess in all her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could never tell you were about to have more than you asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the moment you stepped to the edge of the champion's butt-cheek, Cynthia happened to sneeze in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole back shook and your perch jiggled, causing you to lose your balance and, inevitably...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you screamed as your world became dark all of a sudden while you found yourself falling down a dark pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit a smooth surface and opened your eyes, wondering what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you was darkness, albeit a feeble light shone from above, illuminating your surroundings for you to see that you were surrounded by pale skin that carried a mostly good scent which was, however, covered by a musky smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to figure what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Cynthia sneezed, you had fallen down her butt and into her crack, right between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own flared up as you blushed, wondering how could you end up in such situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling yourself that this was bad, you looked down and did a quick estimation of how deep you fell... literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were halfway stuck in Cynthia's butt crack; the wrinkled anus below pulsed in a sinister manner, as if eager to meet your acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really tell the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you immediately started wiggling, trying to get back from where you came, but the only thing you accomplished was to slide further into Cynthia's bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou halted the moment you stared descending, telling yourself that struggling like a caged animal was pointless, dangerous even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a plan to get away from the sleeping beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle you did know that the sleeping beauty wasn't so asleep anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, Cynthia had woken up feeling you squirming in her butt and had figured out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to herself, she had moved her head just slightly to glance at her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Why, someone's in for some naughty fun...</i>' she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, the giantess had been hoping you'd do something like that, though she would have preferred if you did it while she was awake; you weren't the only one that would enjoy that, and that's why she thought it would be a fitting punishment if she left you be, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, staying still, she pretended to be still asleep and waited for you to keep moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you soon did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea sprang up in your mind and you decided that you should try to climb Cynthia's cheeks to get back on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, placing your hands on one of Cynthia's cheeks, you attempted to climb. However, you lacked any surfaces you could hang to and, the moment you tried to push yourself up with your feet, you ended up sliding back into the crack, deeper inside of it, sinking where darkness was more evident and light shone less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned; Cynthia let a silent moan escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that one. She enjoyed that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Hmm... perhaps I have found quite a fine companion...</i>' she thought, stifling a giggle: your squirms within her crack tickled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were left alone with your thoughts once more. What to do to escape this giantess' stubborn butt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea came into your mind. It wouldn't hurt to try, you said yourself, but it would hurt awfully if you failed and happened to slide in even deeper: the dreaded hole waiting below you was now closer and you feared that, if you slid down one more time, you wouldn't be seeing sunlight for quite a while, at least until Cynthia woke up, and that was assuming she remembered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise... what a great way to go, you sarcastically thought. Being forgotten in a big beauty's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to your plan, you spread out your limbs and tried to push the cheeks around you aside; when you managed to get some leverage, you tried to climb up, slowly and carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, halfway up, your hand slipped and you ended up sliding down once more; luckily, the butt-cheeks snapped back in place around you, saving you a close encounter with the butthole, but keeping you stuck in place, unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cynthia felt you stop moving and pouted. It had been a great sensation while it lasted, but it looked like it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the little guy was no match for her booty or the latter was so tight he couldn't move anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Cynthia pondered what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she get you out? Or perhaps try to enjoy you some more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, if she didn't get that, she would be kind of abusing you, and she didn't want that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Cynthia moved a hand to her behind and, with a light though clear blush on her face, inserted two fingers in her butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her tiny captive, you were still trying to free yourself from her butt when you fell the cheeks loosening their grip on you; you fell for a moment and feared an imminent impact with the giantess' butthole, but it never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, two fingers halted your fall and lifted you up instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you found yourself being brought out of Cynthia's crack and into the light again as she took you away from her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you traveled to her face, you wondered if she was awake the whole time, and such line of thinking made you blush and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was awake, that meant you were in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to rethink the moment you were brought in front of the champion's smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back.\" she calmly said to you once she had your small body in her field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face wasn't displaying anger at all, which left you confused. Some women get angry whenever someone barely even stares at it, after all, but Cynthia seemed to be okay with that you just went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cynthia...\" you stuttered, offering a meek explanation, <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" she interrupted you,<br>\r\n\"You're a boy, and a young one too, I know you have... certain needs. 'Making new experiences', am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed even more furiously - she got it all wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! N-Not at all!\" you protested,<br>\r\n\"I was just applying the sunscreen and I tripped and fell... in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's expression didn't change, but you could swear you saw her lips growing in a smirk before returning to that enigmatic smile the giantess wore in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asked with a giggle, with you nodding at a rather fast pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia tilted her head slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I can believe you, then. Too sad, I was kind of hoping you'd do something like that.\" she shamelessly admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your turn tilt your head in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely wanted to test you, see how far you would go. And that...\" she shot a brief glance to her behind, before looking down at you once more,<br>\r\n\"... Was pretty far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung your head, though her tone didn't carry any anger whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident...\" you repeated, your blush deepening as you thought that you ended up back there because there Was a perverted wish in you when you first walked to the edge of the giantess' butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I said I do believe you. That means you didn't mean to take advantage of me while I slept, which means you are trustworthy and won't do something like that on purpose,\" she said slowly, before wearing a grin for real this time,<br>\r\n\"... Unauthorized, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the giantess simply teasing you? Was she in reality angry and was humiliating you?... Was she serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to think, you just stared at her incredulously while she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see from your face you didn't expect that,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"And... well, yes. I would like to explore this side of our... friendship,\" she explained, before throwing her hair back a bit with a motion of her head, <br>\r\n\"Within certain limits, of course. But I do believe it would be an amusing experience for the both of us, wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really serious? This giantess wanted you to explore her in all her very naked glory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, your crotch was doing the thinking instead of your head and it made you nod your head in an eager fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd see things my way.\" she simply said, leaning forward to place a light peck on your face, before pulling you back,<br>\r\n\"Now, since we are already like this, let's start right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even ask what she was planning, you found her hand moving as she moved you along her body... </span></div></div>",

However, she did not stop there; her hand released you, but her finger was pushed on top of your head as Cynthia moved you deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe champion smirked to herself, choking back a moan despite the great feeling that was spreading throughout her already. What came next was going to give you plenty of reasons to squirm, and that was going to please her endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with her finger, Cynthia pushed you in her crack until your feet hit something hard, something that felt wrinkled to the touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, your feet were pushing straight against Cynthia's butthole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her objective fulfilled, the champion happily removed her finger from your head and plucked it out, the two butt-cheeks above closing back up, sealing you in a tight, hot darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic sent chills running down your spine as you immediately began squirming, not wanting to end up in the dreaded hole you were pushing against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, not really sure what to do, you began squirming like Cynthia previously suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a moan came muffled from above. Cynthia enjoyed your struggles to get free from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about five minutes you achieved nothing but please Cynthia. But then, as time drew on without your struggles seeming to have any effects, Cynthia grew a bit bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, your squirming and struggling felt really good, but the feeling was starting to grow less and less exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why the champion, who has shown to be way more mischievous than she appeared, decided to spice things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a bit of focus, but she managed to clench her butthole successfully; by doing so, her hole opened just slightly and your feet sank inside a bit as a result, as if they were in quicksand, before the hole closed up again with your feet gone inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you really began panicking while Cynthia gasped from the spontaneous trauma, having felt your tiny feet slide inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she soon found pleasure in the sudden insertion and wondered how much more pleasure she would get if she got all of you inside of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smirk appeared on the champion's face as she decided the experience was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, with a bit of focus, she clenched her butt; this time, the hole took in your ankles, causing an ever struggling you to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Cynthia!?\" you called, startled, your earlier fears becoming a reality, <br>\r\n\"I'm kinda stuck, can you get me out like really fast!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response you received was a giggle mixed with a moan coming from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I think I'll leave that up to you.\" she eventually replied, not sounding sorry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the hole opened once more and, this time, it took you in up to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, you tried to free yourself by bringing your hands to push on the hole but that only ended with them being sucked in the next time the hole opened, while you got sucked in waist-deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, there wasn't much more you could do and could just squirm as the hole took in your torso, shoulders and eventually neck, leaving only your head out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong smell began to rise from it. No wonder, given what the orifice was. Still, you tried to free yourself without giving up. After all, even if it seemed that all hope was lost, it didn't mean it was, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your hopes did, however, fade away when you noted a glimmer of light entering your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia's finger came down on your head once more and, with measured force, pushed on your head which followed the rest of your body inside of the champion's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia gave a deep moan while the last of you disappeared in her behind, which closed above your head with a sickening squelch, sealing you in a hot, smelly, tight and slimy darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you got in there, you tried to get out the way you came in, but you were surrounded by tight muscles that didn't allow you to move like you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this mixed with a strong heat and an as well strong smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you didn't have to share your space with some... unwanted company, but it still was pretty unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia didn't agree with such line of thinking, because she was truly enjoying herself with your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down onto the sand with her eyes closed and her arms under her head, the champion sighed contentedly, when she felt all of the struggles ceasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she thought you were just resting for a little bit, but she didn't realize that a combination of the intense heat and the exhaustion caused from your struggled was enough to put you to sleep within the confines of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you felt like hours had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you saw upon opening your eyes was Cynthia, staring down at you with a concerned expression which turned into one of relief when you opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What happened?\" you asked, trying to recall what had been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed out, dear.

She looked like a true goddess, worthy of Venus herself. She had her bare bosom covered by thick strands of her blonde hair while her crotch was covered by her hand instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this giantess enjoyed teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you've lost your clothes, I thought it would be fair if I 'lost' mine as well.\" she teased with a gentle giggle, causing your cheeks to flare up at indescribable hot levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, stunned, as the giantess walked back into the water, which soon engulfed her whole form but her head, tickling her privates (and yours), causing her to giggle at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde giantess swam back to you with a satisfied smile on her face, noticing your own visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm flattered,\" she said upon catching a glimpse of the stunned expression you were carrying,<br>\r\n\"You must like me really a lot, be it because you can somehow remember me or because you like my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right on both counts, especially the second. Your own body agreed with your musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia giggled once more as she neared herself to you, causing the water around her to send you backwards a bit; it may have been a gentle motion of water, but to you was an average wave knocking you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes, nothing was said or done. You just kept staring at Cynthia and, vice versa, the blonde goddess stared back at you with the same mysterious smile she had kept for so far, almost like she was studying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed you could understand, you too would be interested in a shrunken person popping out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to be this close and this naked with such a beauty nearby made you feel flustered, no matter how kind her intentions were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you contemplative like that, Cynthia gained a smile. Evidently, her tiny catch was still uneasy being around her. No doubt since she had taken things a bit too far by undressing right off the bat. But, instead of taking a step back, Cynthia decided that her best shot now was to take things a step further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you're looking quite silent, little one,\" she said you, keeping a gentle voice,<br>\r\n\"That's not the right mood. After all, I'm here to have fun. And, while I understand you're scared of your situation, I think you should try to enjoy yourself before we actually start to work on a way to help you regain your size. A calm mind can work miracles in such situations, didn't you know?\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and swam back a bit, still uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you admitted, looking down at your reflection in the water for a moment, before looking back up with a meek smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, perhaps you shouldn't focus on your size and memories right now, you would have all the time to worry for yourself later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, you began lazily floating in the sea, letting the calm waves drag your negative thoughts away with their relaxing motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Cynthia said, noticing your sudden shift of mood,<br>\r\n\"Now, take a dip, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom relaxed, you were shot right back into embarrassed - what!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on ahead. I have seen all of you after all, so it would be fair if you saw all of me. That'd make things even between us.\" she joked nonchalantly, showing nothing against the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and gave a shaky nod, deciding to do as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it's not like you wouldn't like that. Thinking about it, you could see her nipples peeking from the water already, so might as well see the rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a mouthful of fresh air, you followed the champion's orders and dove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, your lungs were greeted by water and your eyes by the glorious sight of Cynthia's nude body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of bubbles escaped your closed lips and you swore the water around you was growing warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lingering on Cynthia's front for a while,  on her perfect bosom and crotch, you decided to take a look at her backside before your air ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle you did know that Cynthia was watching you from above, able to keep track of you thanks to the crystalline water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched you swimming towards her butt-cheeks, the Sinnoh champion got a mischievous idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while you were stunned by the sight of her bare butt, you failed to immediately noticed a hand joining you underwater and reaching in the middle of her crack, spreading a butt-cheek and letting you see the hole that lingered at the very bottom of the champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it could, your crotch would've left the rest of you behind to join that luscious form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, you nearly failed to notice that, finally, you were running out of breathable air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when your system started to protest, you attempted to swim to surface. However, before you could, Cynthia's other hand joined the other, though this one grabbed a hold of you as Cynthia...</span></div></div>",

The sensation was quite a pleasant one, and it became even better when you started squirming to try and get out. Here there was little water, so you could go back to breathing, even if it meant inhaling a lingering musky scent that surrounded the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this situation didn't feel so nice to you as it would otherwise do: you were pressed right halfway in between Cynthia's butt-cheeks, which held you in place; straight in front of you was her hole, something you wanted to avoid at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with your face crossed by a bright red shade that spread from cheek to cheek,  you squirmed in order to get free from the grip of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Cynthia giggled at the sensation you were giving her as it rapidly spread throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place where she trapped you was a very sensitive one, after all, but that didn't meant the champion wasn't enjoying it; it was quite the contrary, the blonde titaness was truly enjoying herself. Even she wondered where this 'naughty side' of hers came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, letting out a small moan triggered by the 'massage' you were giving her, Cynthia lazily floated in the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit that, when she came here the morning to take a break from her researches, her duties and the battles with champion wannabes, she wasn't expecting to meet a little person. And she wasn't expecting to have said little person to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia giggled again as she felt you squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she was doing didn't mean she wasn't going to help you anymore, but she decided that she would also enjoy your... company in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the giantess decided it was time for something new: her skin was beginning to form wrinkles from her stay in the water, so the blonde giantess thought this was the perfect time to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guessed you were safe from the water where you currently were, but she wasn't sure, and she didn't want to discover it when it was too late in case it turned out the water could still reach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your constant squirming to get out suggested that you were still very alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, quietly, Cynthia swam to the shore and gracefully walked out of the water, giving her hair a quick shake to let it send droplets of water everywhere. A breeze blew past her, tickling her exposed nethers and causing her to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gust of wind didn't reach you, who were still tightly pressed in between the giantess butt-cheeks and couldn't really do anything aside from squirming and wiggling, trying to pull yourself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no luck doing so, and you actually believed you had only managed to push yourself further into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" you yelled, wondering if you were still underwater and if she could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, but pretended to remain oblivious to your cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Cynthia slowly caressed her butt with a hand while, with the other, she retrieved her white one-piece swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later...\" she whispered to her behind, before rising her leg and fitting it through the suit's leg hole. She did the same with the other and slowly pulled her swimsuit back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her bosom first and, giving her backside one last, mischievous glance, she adjusted the swimsuit to cover her buttocks, thus trapping you even further in her butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you couldn't see what was happening, but your prison grew tighter all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell why, but you didn't care: it was only another motivation to try to get out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you doubled the efforts to push yourself away from her butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it working? Was it not? You really had no idea as you seemed to be stuck in place despite you having done nothing different for the past ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came to the point where you managed to tire yourself out and had to stop, feeling an ache in your muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of rest, and you were back into squirming to try to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for for your giant host, she just casually walked along the shore, feeling her new little friend struggling in her butt, enjoying every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly wondered how you were doing and debated whether she should get you out.</span></div></div>",

This spot was simply perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you were left to your own thoughts as Cynthia sunbathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that your attention wasn't focused on the gorgeous giant, you could think a bit about your situation, which had suddenly come back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tiny, incredibly, helplessly, pathetically tiny; you couldn't remember anything but the same giantess who had found you. And you... were in giant, beautiful woman's bos-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, ridding it of the incoming line of thinking. You had to focus right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began wondering what happened to you, who you even were, since you seemed to have forgotten your name as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia promised she'd help you grow big, also mentioning a few ways she could do that, but you wanted to try and remember,  if not how you shrunk, at least who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused really hard, trying to recall events occurring prior your awakening, when you discovered you were shrunken. However, you managed to find nothing but a fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't figure it out, as hard as you tried, which was kind of sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to lay off for a moment, you simply laid back, your head bumping into Cynthia's soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, you stared forward, at the crystalline sea shining brightly under the warm sunshine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the waves that came and went seemed to wash away all your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as salty water came crashing in the sand of the beach before retreating, all in a hypnotic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trance got broken when you noticed movement around you; Cynthia had rolled onto her side, your body hit by her right breast while you found yourself staring at the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia?\" you called out to her, trying to get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou received none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome soft snoring reached your ears from above, and you realized that Cynthia had managed to doze off under the sun. Not the 'brightest' thing to do, but you supposed it was fine as long as she was resting in shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, now truly left to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing better to do, you decided to go back to thinking about the reason of your shrinking. Or you could at least try to recall something before your awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you had no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to focus harder, you closed your eyes in an extreme attempt to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat way, you were able to recall a bright light, but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to cling to that single memory to try and figure out the rest, but you couldn't find anything else, no matter how hard you searched your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all the thinking you were doing managed to tire you out. Your already closed eyelids never went back up, and your breathing started slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in the middle of thinking, and didn't even notice when you slipped into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, you were awakened when you heard a noise that bothered your sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you saw that you were still where you fell asleep in the first place, buried in Cynthia's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference was that the champion was very awake now, not to mention fully dressed; the noise you heard was her zipping a bag close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, it was no longer daytime, but instead the sun was beginning to set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Cynthia?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde giantess stopped for a moment, then smiled, her face adorned by that enigmatic though gentle smirk she often carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I wake you up? Sorry.\" she politely apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" you said, before remembering what you had been doing before falling asleep; since you were in her care, and since she was offering to help, you thought it was only right to give Cynthia a clue, the only one you had,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I've been trying to remember,\" you began while she stood up with her bag in hand, looking at you, signaling she was listening,<br>\r\n\"And I can't seem to remember anything, despite how hard I try. I do remember a bright light, but... nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Cynthia replied,<br>\r\n\"May be a clue, but for now, look.\" she said, pointing to the sea: the sunset casted yellow-orange shades on the endless blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was somehow... nostalgic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly a beautiful sight, huh?\" Cynthia stated, and you couldn't help but agree, making her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the champion turned around and began walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she said,<br>\r\n\"I'll help you figure this out as promised... just, not here. We need a more... fitting place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia distractedly replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're going...</span></div></div>",

I mean of course you would look nice in it! But seeing you in it is not the reason i chose it.\u201d You say as you felt like a complete idiot saying it. Something Cynthia on the other hand found very adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i guess the black one then\u201d She said throwing the white one piece to the side \u201cNow since theres no rooms around here, i guess ill just change right here. No one around to see me, expect for you\u201d Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIll uh.. ill close my eyes\u201d You say covering them and turning around. Cynthia giggled to herself, loving how shy you were being around her. She of course knew she was attractive but she was more use to men googling her then blushing at just thought of her in a swimsuit. Its a nice change of pace, not to mention it makes her feel slightly more playful and teasing. Cynthia at the empty beach wasted no time, getting changed out of her casual clothes and into her underwear. Every now and then she would turn her head, hoping she would catch you in the act of peeking to her naked body. Though to her surprise and a bit of disappointment. You remained a gentleman and didn't look. By the time you were allowed to turn around, Cynthia was fully dressed in her two piece black bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around she made sure to get as close to you as possible for the reveal. \u201cOkay, I've finished changing. Turn around if you wish\u201d You followed her orders, turning around to see her massive bare feet right in front of you. Your eyes trained up to her big beautiful bare legs. Stretching out for miles it seemed as you marveled at the size. You then reached the first article of clothing. Her Bikini Bottoms. Black and hugging her waist you were finally able to see her assets more clear. She was very round in that area and you couldn't help but picture what would be hidden behind her black bottoms. Both the front and the back. You mind went further up to her bare stomach making you realise she had an hourglass figure. Its like this woman was perfect. Speeaking of perfect you eyes went further up to her breasts, barely being contained by her bikini. They were so massive and so huge they looked like they were ready to burst out right now. Admittedly you spent more time staring at this then you feel comfortable to admit. Eventually you moved pass it, staring at her beautiful face and her blonde hair. She was looking down at you and you hoped she didn't realise all your staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you look... wow...\u201d Was all you managed to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIll take that as a complement\u201d She giggled, loving how speechless you were. \u201cAlthough I'm surprised you havent taking off your shirt. Your going swimming too\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh right\u201d Was all you could say as you followed suit. Taking off your shirt so you were only in your shorts. Your body didn't look as impressive as Cynthia\u2019s but your pretty sure even a model\u2019s wouldn't look as good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia reached down and grabbed you, scooping you into her palm as you felt like you were being kidnapped by a goddess. Cynthia held you close to her breasts, almost baiting you to just stare. With her face being so close you have no doubt she would see you looking, you don't know what she would do about it though? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell lets get swimming. We will stay in the shallows for your sake\u201d She told as you felt like that was smart. Cynthia walked to the beach, stepping into the water as she got further. Far enough till it was up to her knees. She stopped as she laughed \u201cSorry, always have trouble getting into the water. I can never just dive right in. Have to gradually move in\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm the same, can't just go from dry to wet\u201d You told her as she got an idea. She tilted her hand in one sudden twist. You feel yourself fall from her hand and down. Your far up and its gonna be one bad collision when you crash. You just hope she's gonna catch you beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your falling down Cynthia watches with a smile, happy as she watches you fall down _________<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take you long to figure out that you were currently sitting in her expansive cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! You're certainly forward. You're just a little pervert, aren't you?\" She says with mock surprise in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was going five different shades of red at both her words and your current position. \"N-no, I-I I-uh-I, I mean, I didn't mean to, I- aw man.\" You stutter out, trying to justify yourself. Cynthia, meanwhile, was doing her best not to laugh at you tripping over yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. You aren't in any trouble my little friend. I dropped you in there intentionally to mess with you.\" You feel your speech start to return and some of the blood leave your face, only to start heading south of the border. \"Plus, what better way to keep you from drowning than giving you your own floatation devices?\" She jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a few steps further into the water until it was closing in on her thighs. Then, she leans back and takes a seat in the water, letting it come up to her chest. You can feel it start to splash your feet. \"Aaah.

She has purple hair, a beautiful dark olive-coloured tan and grey eyes. She wears black open sandals with pink straps and some very short denim hotpants with a white top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stumble towards her, through the grass and into the open, she spots you. \"Hmm... What kind of Pok\u00e9mon is that? I should let Professor Sycamore know about this instantly!\" She then stands up and walks towards you, \"wait a second...\" she says, with a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout while walking towards her: \"Wait! Please! I am a human being, I got shrunk!\" Sina looks at you with a funny face, \"wait... You got shrunk? Pff.. Pffwhahaha!\" she attempted to hold her laugh but couldn't resist making a bit of fun of your predicament. \"Sorry, sorry, that was rude of me!\" She says, while her voice calms down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down, \"so, do you need some help with anything?\" You look up at her and reply, \"well, I don't really know how to solve this situation really... Maybe a Pok\u00e9mon Center could help me out?\" Sina then looks at you, \"hmm... They might but, the closest Pok\u00e9mon center from here is almost two days of walking.\" She then stands up again, \"we're really out in the sticks here you know! I was sent here by Sycamore for some investigations on Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon... But, how did you end up all the way here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"I don't know... But, if this place is so desolate, could you please take me with you?\" You bow your head, hoping to gain her sympathy. Sina then smiles, \"sure, little one! I'll take care of you...\" She then looks at the ground with a smirk, she continues:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But you'll have to obey all my rules, is that clear? If you wanna travel with Sina then we're doing this my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What do you decide?</span></div></div>",

She sits down and unties the pink laces of her sandals. \"Don't worry, there is a village nearby, let's get some supplies there and then we'll walk to the nearest Pok\u00e9mon Center.\" She then puts her sandal in front of you. While looking at the sandal, you can see the black insole with clear marks where her toes are, she must use these a lot! They also seem rather sweaty already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSina then speaks up: \"So, this is your ride, I want you to lay down on your back, right there...\" She picks you up and lays you down on her sandal. \"That is a nice place to lay on isn't it?\" Sina says with a smile. Unbeknown of her plans, you spread your arms and lay your head on the toe section of the insole. You relax, and say: \"Yeh, it is pretty comfortable, although I can kinda smell that you use these a lot...\" She laughs, \"well aren't you straighforward?\" She says, with a smirk on her face. She continues, \"anyways, yeh, that is true, these are my favorites! I've walked for hours before getting here. Now, let's get you ready for the journey, shall we? Spread your arms as wide as you can!\" Sina says while slowly stretching her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what Sina is up to, you spread your arms and legs and then her foot suddenly comes down upon you and she presses you firmly into the insole. \"Don't move, I have to get you properly restrained there, I don't want you to fall out ofcourse!\" Sina then proceeds to firmly tie the laces of her sandal, pressing her sole firmly into you and effectively restraining you between her foot and her sandal's insole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms and legs are spread and you can't even move an inch! Then, Sina starts wiggling her toes, which are directly on your face. The rest of your body is under the ball of her foot and your feet are somewhere near her ankles. \"So, this is how we travel for now, I will sweat a lot but this is the safest spot for you!\" She then starts walking and you feel the pressure on your body every step of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moist toes are dripping sweat onto your face and then she stands still and lifts her toes, able to see your wet face as she bends down. \"You like the smell down there?\" You cough and reply: \"N-no, please! Just let me sit some-\" She then interrupts you, \"nonono! My rules are MY rules. Now be silent for a second.\" Sina then grabs something from her bag; A bit of tape and a scissor. Within a few seconds she has a thin but long piece of tape and her hands move towards you. She taps your head with her big toe, \"keep your mouth shut tightly.\" You obey and then within a second she puts tape over your mouth, With your hands restrained under her foot you cannot even attempt remove it, you simply lay there at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now back under my toes and by the end of this walk I hope that I trained you well enough to love the smell of my feet.\" She then lowers her toes onto your face, your vision darkens again. Now, you are imprisoned under Sina's feet, God knows for how long, forced to smell her toes with every step of the way. While walking, you can feel the pressure on your body with every step she takes, causing you to breathe in more deeply. Though, every breath you take is filled with the scent of her sweaty feet. She wiggles her toes a lot, unleashing the stench from between her toes constantly. At times her toejam is directly being rubbed onto your face. She even giggles when doing that, as if she is enjoying playing with your face with her sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start get a little numb, but you also start to enjoy the smell of her feet... You start taking deeper breaths everytime, trying to get more of her delicious scent into your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the ride? Don't worry, you have a lot of time to get acquinted with my foot, this is going to be a long walk!\" Sina says. </span></div></div>",

All of the furnitures in this room were big as they can be and it makes you wonder if this is how it feels like to be a bug; having to be in the shadow of giants all the time. You walk around this room while feeling the carpet under your feet. The room itself looks like it belongs to someone very wealthy, perhaps a celebrity or something.

The person appears to be a young woman but not just a woman, a VERY attracted one indeed almost causing to just stand there and stare at the giant beauty without moving anything. She has short light blue hair and wears a large blue dress, black gloves, and gery tights; her attire gives the impression of a dancer of some sort. Right now, she appears to be resting on her bed, probably from all the dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at her and thought to yourself \"Hmmm....perhaps being small is not a bad thing after all.\" You then gave out a smile and got a mischievous thought in your head. \"I wonder if I could go and have some fun on her while the pretty woman sleeps.\" You laugh to yourself as you go take a few steps to the sleeping giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got extremely close to the bed, you smiled again to see how blissly unaware she is at the moment. \"It's perfect!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The tent itself was kinda large and oddly shaped. Almost like the ones you see the Aether researchers use but differant somehow. But aside from that, there was the lone inhabitant you saw by the campfire. She looked like she would be fairly short under normal circumstances, granted this was not a normal circumstance. But aside from that she was dressed in a strange blue and white uniform with a visor covering her eyes. Though you did see a long, bright red, braided ponytail poking out from her helmet, you also noticed that her skin was a light shade of blue. Just what the hell is this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered wether or not this strange looking being would be safe to approach, but the growls of wild animals seemedto speed up that choice. At the very least this mystery person seemed to be humanlike enough to see you as something other than food. Wether or not that somethingwas preferable to hiding in the woods remained to be seen but she seemed to be your safest bet right now. As you made your way to her, she was jotting notes of the local fauna and flora down into a device. You pondered how you could even get her attention like this, but that issue seemed to solve itself when her head suddenly looked down to your position. By amazing luck she spotted you on your approach. Though you couldn\u2019t see her eyes, she clearly seemed confused by what she was seeing. You stopped as she walked towards you to take a closer look. Seeing the blue skinned giantess so close did make you shake a little, causing you to reconsider the running option, but her hand soon removed that possibility as she quickly scooped you up to get an even closer look. \u201cIt\u2019s like... but only... huh?\u201d She mumbles these little fragments to herself. She was as confused by you as you were by her. \u201cUm... excuse me... miss?\u201d You finally speak up causing her head to back up a bit. \u201cYou can talk?!\u201d There was some shock in her tone. \u201cWell... yeah I\u2019m a person... just... small for some reason.\u201d You replied givingm her the most basic explanation of your predicament. \u201cWooow. This is so amazing!\u201d She squealed with childlike glee. You were less than amused and shot her a dirty look. \u201cOh don\u2019t give me that. Think about it. Think about all the scientific implications of something that can cause a person to end up like this. Doesn\u2019t that sound awesome?\u201d You could see where this was comming from, though it was hardly your top interest at this moment. \u201cDid you see what caused this? Or notice anything weird before?\u201d She hit you with questions with little reguardless for your facial expression. Still this could be helpful. Thinking back you tried to see if anything came to mind. But nothing out of the ordinary really jumped out at you. \u201cI can\u2019t really remember anything weird happening. Just waking up in the middle of the woods like this a few hours ago.\u201d The girl gave an intrigued look. \u201cHuh... odd.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the giant staying still apparantly in deep thought. You had no clue what to make of her. Then she reached up for her visor and slowlyremoved it revealing a... surprisingly cute face of a blue skinned girl with red and blue eyes looking down at you. Her smile was oddly calming to you despite her strange features. \u201cOh and my name is Zossie. I\u2019m from the Ultra Space if you were wondering about the colors. As for you...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Slave!\u201d you say to her as she hugs you closer. Right to the chest as she looks down at you with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep slave, I've always wanted a slave! but I've never been allowed to have one, mainly cause... you know its a slave.

Those rules in place to stop people having slave doesn't apply to you! Which means you can be my slave!\u201d She said with a huge smile \u201cOh i cant wait to take you back with me, later of course. I need to finish my work here and then report to the others.

It looks like water (Thankfully). She tips it upside down and drains the water, she then placed you into it.<br>\r\n\u2028She placed it onto a table nearby that she has set up. She smiles as Zossie sees you trying to climb up. However due to it being completely wet you had no success. Eventually you gave up as you sat down, angry and with your legs crossed. You watch as Zossie continues with what she was doing, as you ignore her and sulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Timeskip-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thats all the flora sorted, as well as samples from the surrounding springs and the flowing river. I've also got these... i think its Pokemon droppings but I'm not sure which Pokemon\u201d Zossie said as she was finished with her work, and just as the sun was going down. She could sleep right now... or she could go into the hitech tent that she rests up... with her little slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ0ssie looks back to see you completely asleep. Smiling she decided thats exactly what she's going to do. After putting all her stuff away she grabbed the jar, waking you up as she raises you up to her smile. \u201cI hope your ready, cause I'm restless and i could use some good slave work before i go to sleep. And hey maybe if your good enough ill let you sleep with me. Okay\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she make you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a bed, a closet, a mini fridge, a television, a generator to charge her equipment. It was ridiculous<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u201d She dismissed to you \u201cI needed to be prepared, just in case i saw something that needed more studying\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that explains the Tv doesn't it\u201d You snark back as she just pouts at you, then ignoring your words she walked over to her bed. Opening the lid as you could see her hand come down for you. She grips you with her glove then placed you down on her bed. looks like she's got a good spot to place you, cause you cant jump down without getting hurt. Zossie sees you look around as she grabs the pillow on the top of her bed. Placing it down onto you as you get buried under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You say to her, trying to lift of the pillow, but ultimately be unable to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, ill take it off of you when i change.\u201d She tells you as you guess that makes sense. Her whole outfit didn't scream casual to you, it said business. You think you should climb out but you wait, the pillow wasn't hurting you. It was heavy but it wasn't breaking your body.<br>\r\n\u2028After a while, Zossie lifted the pillow off of you. You could see that she changed into a casual sleepwear outfit. Pyjamas. Blue just like her skin, but slightly lighter. Her hair no longer tied but instead was wide and open. She looked down at you with a huge smile as you just now realised how young this girl was. The Getup she had before made you think she was just small but no... she's actually pretty young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think? I got it while i was in this universes. Does it look good?\u201d She asked doing a spin in front of you. The girl in front of you, it would be hard to believe she was enslaving you. But she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you cant deny it \u201cYou... You look cute\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha! Oh I'm cute!\u201d She said with a huge smile. She then reached down and grabbed you, holding you up to her face. \u201cYour cute too!\u201d She waved her finger in front of you patronizingly as you swat it away \u201cAnd your gonna be so much more cuter when your giving me a footrub\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped you onto the bed as she wiggled on to it. Your then met with her giant feet right in front of you, the blue digits wiggling above you as you back up. How could such a little girl have such big feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Giggle). Sorry did my feet scare you\u201d Zossie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... i wasn't scared\u201d You answer back standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you weren't\u201d Zossie said not believing you \u201cAnyway, get to it slave.

Maybe you should offer a massage, it could help her relax and let you get at her feet. The problem is you might seem too forward, she might think you're some kind of weirdo.</span></div></div>",

Honestly she looked pretty cute even from your current point of view, though her apparant age did make you question wether or not she would be a safe choice to ask for help from. Maybe she had a friend or older sibling who was out here with her. Of course, looking around and only seeing supplies for one person you realized that this girl was out here by herself. Just how the heck did she manage this on her own. Are you close to her house? Or maybe this girl is just really good at traveling on her own? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of bird Pok\u00e9mon outside the tent stopped you from pondering these possibilities and cemented in your mind that like it or not, you were going to be stuck with this girl if you wanted to live through the night. You considered hiding in her supplies while she was eating her candy bar. But as you watched her mouth bite off more of the chocolatey rectangle you heard your own stomach start to growl. You haven\u2019t eaten anything all day. You were too scared to stop and try to earlier.

Afterwards, she began talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch. My feet are hurting so bad, all that walking really didn't do me any favors.\" She stopped rubbing her feet for a moment as she looked to her side and picked up a pair of pink shoes that appeared to be shot to hell and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's worse, i ruined my shoes walking all over the place like that, all on my own too.\" At that moment, the girl tossed the shoes towards you as they bounced off of the tent flap and landed around you, causing you to cover your head and duck out of fear of being crushed. Then the girl turned around and laid down on her belly before sighing once more and saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe my brother was right. Maybe I'm not ready to go out on my own adventure just yet. Maybe i do need more training and understanding of the outside world before i can reliably take care of myself out there. *Yawn* Maybe.\" And within moments, you could hear the young girl gently breathing as she drifted off to sleep. Now you had time to decide on your next move. From what the girl said a few moments ago, you could tell she was inexperienced, and went off on her own to explore the outside world. Which means there are most likely other people who would be looking for her. She did mention a brother, so perhaps he would come to help her back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what you should do right now, you had a few options. The first was to approach her and wake her up, hoping she would be kind enough to help you. She seemed nice enough when she was talking to herself, and perhaps she could use a friend to keep her company until help arrived, if it even was coming in the first place. Another option was to remain hidden until you were 100% positive she could be trusted to take care of you, or until she brought you somewhere or to someone you knew could help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the third option, which wasn't really an option to help you as much as it was an option to get you into trouble. For some odd reason, your eyes were being drawn to her feet. You couldn't understand why at the time, perhaps you felt sorry for how badly her feet were hurting and you felt like doing something to help her relax, or perhaps you had a reason that a lot of people would deem sick and disgusting. Whatever the case, you had your options. Which one would you choose?</span></div></div>",

Your mind was drawn to something other than getting her help. But what was it? Before you could realize it yourself however, Bonnie pushed both of her feet together, pinning you between them and shocking you in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! What are you doing?!\" Bonnie looked down at you with that sly expression yet again, but this time she had something interesting to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? I'm helping you live out your fantasy, just like you wanted when i shrunk you. Don't be shocked or anything, it\u2019s not hard to guess why someone would want to be so teeny tiny like you are. And don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you against my foot earlier when you entered the tent. I was just pretending not to notice you then. I figured you were just having fun or playing a game at first, but when you tried to get my help instead, i knew something was wrong. And so, here we are.

As you drew nearer a powerful smell rushed over you. Seems she wasn\u2019t kidding about her little rant earlier. Judging by that odor she must have been on the move all day. No wonder she was so exhausted. Although the smell would repulse most people, you didn\u2019t seem too bothered by it. If you gave it any thought, you\u2019d probably question why you weren\u2019t. After all, it was a pretty powerful stench hitting you. Perhaps your current situation was too fantastical for you to really care. Perhaps it, mixed with other factors made the whole thing oddly enjoyable to you. Triggering a sense of adventure and exploration maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally reached her feet you noticed that, when sideways, they still almost beat you in height. Going off this you estimated your current height at about 4 inches tall. Not the best, but it could certainly be worse. Looking up at the resting titan, your left hand leaned against the large sole before you. Though this was just to lean against to rest, you quickly noticed the warmth and texture of her sole. Despite your situation the feeling of her soft yet firm sole, even with the layer of filth and sweat was oddly entrancing. Bringing your other hand to it, you began to lightly rub the wall, making sure to not wake her from her slumber. The feeling of her feet felt strangely relaxing to you. As if it was helping you forget the whole ordeal you went through earlier today. You must have zoned out a bit because you were suddenly knocked back by her foot shifting and unknowingly kicking you. The kick and the landing didn\u2019t hurt you thankfully, but now you ran the very real risk that she felt you and knew you were here. Granted that was your goal in the first place, but actually being in it felt a LOT more awkward. You heard some curious sounds coming from her, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice you just yet.

Still, now wasn\u2019t the time for that for a number of reasons. Remembering your current situation, you decided that your only real option right now was to try to get her attention. Though you knew next to nothing about her, she seemed like she was nice enough. And really you didn\u2019t have too many other options. You\u2019re out in the wilderness with this girl. Chances are if you don\u2019t get any help, something will eat you. As you prepared to grab her attention, you saw her lay back down and fall back asleep, making your task a bit harder, but thankfully less awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully moving along her body, you don\u2019t have to travel far before reaching the sleeping face of the giant. She looked so cute, so peaceful like this, even though she was towering over you while laying down. Someone like this couldn\u2019t possibly be a bad choice. Right? Well not like it matters now. Moving close to her ear, you start to call to her. She shifts a bit as your voice enters her ear, but she stubbornly tries to remain in the realm of dreams. You call again, this time a bit louder. Success! Her eye starts to peak open as she groans a bit. Moving quickly, you ran back so she\u2019d see you easier and wave about wildly to draw more attention. Her sleepy eyes seem to shift towards you, taking a few seconds to try to process what she was seeing. At first, Bonnie thought she was still asleep. But as the moments passed she realized the dream was over. This was real. You were real. Her eyes seemed to shoot open as she eyes you curiously. Not saying a word. Finally her hand carefully plucks you up to hold you near her face. As cute as she was, it was a little scary seeing the billboard sized face inspecting you like this.

Will she help or just leave you by yourself, or worse is she gonna treat you like nothing but a toy. Finally she opened her mouth as you see her gain a huge colourful smile, one only a child can give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour.... Your so Cute~! Im keeping you!\u201d She said as you get pulled right in front of her eye. Looking over you inspecting you \u201cI cant believe it your a tiny guy! What was a tiny guy doing in my tent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... i was trying to wake you up\u201d You say as she brings you in front of her face. All the movement making you slightly sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk too! Ohh your gonna make the best pet!\u201d She squealed as she brought you close for a hug, hugging you against her collar bone with both arms wrapped around you. Inside the hug you were surprised. Pet? out of all the things she's making you her pet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no no, this is good! You can use this! Sure being a pet\u2019s not the best, but its better then being in a giant forest by yourself. She pulled you out of the hug as she introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Bonnie, whats your tiny guy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Your Name) you tell her as she looks at you funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn't really fit you anymore, how about Tiny. I like Tiny\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say Bonnie\u201d You say as you couldn't help but smile at the girl. She was cute, even if she was able to squeeze you dead in her fingers. \u201cI found this tent when i was walking around the forest floor. Are you by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie looked away \u201cYeah... Im by myself, i wanted to go on an adventure out of the city but my brother told me that i wasn't old enough. But i showed him! I even pitched a tent!\u201d Bonnie said that last part very proud of herself, like thats something she's never managed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonnie, how old are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm 8\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonnie, i hate to admit thats way to young to be by yourself in the woods\u201d You tell her \u201cIt would be better if you were safe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I'm not by myself. I have my tiny pet!\u201d She said with a smile as she drops you onto her lap, smiling down at you and petting your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but do you have any Pokemon, that can you know... defend you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN..No\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would you do if a Pangoro or Diggersby came for you, you wouldn't last a second\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cId last longer then you!\u201d Bonnie said as she clearly didn't want to hear this, but she needed to. You have to get her to safety, she's just a little girl. Granted you also want to be out of this forest yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm not arguing that, but you need to be safe. And if you think you'll feel like a failure if you go back, don't. I mean.... You got... A...

You look around and notice weird looking green trees around you, but you realize there not trees, it\u2019s a bunch of grass, now most people would hyperventilate at the thought of being small enough that grass looks like trees but you were different, you had always wanted to shrink because deep down, you had a giantess fetish, but you wouldn\u2019t get ahead of yourself.

Luckily, the two young giantesses pay you no attention as they keep playing with eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath a sigh of relief as you manage to completely sneak past them completely unseen. You're not sure of how your now fragile life would end up with those two. Maybe they would just mistake you for a toy and treat you like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale at the thought, but quickly shake it off as you focus on your task: getting the attention of the older giantess, who is currently fishing in a nearby stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise your gaze to take a good look at her. She has blue hair and blue eyes; she wears a white, sleeveless shirt, large, blue pants and purple sandals. Also, she appears to be wearing some sort of crown-shaped hair circlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take notice of the focused expression on her face as she holds her fishing rod, waiting for the proper moment to pull up. She must know pretty well how to do it, you judge. And you can't help but think that she also looks kind of cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. There's no time to think about this, you gotta get help first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you start walking once again towards the giantess. Soon, much to your relief, you manage to reach her and stand before her blue pants, not sure of how to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new question forms in your mind. Would she even notice you? Would be she able to see or hear you? And, above all... would she mistake you for a bug and crush you flat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself going pale again as you realize that this giantess might be even more dangerous than her sisters. Maybe you should just turn around, walk away and try to find someone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you shake your head. This giantess might be the only one who could help you. Without her help, you would never be able to get out of this forest alive. And then again, she doesn't have to be necessarily mean, does she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you make up your mind. You decide to get her help. But one major problem remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How to approach her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate just decided to lend a hand, the girl suddenly starts to pull her fishing rod.<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" you hear her exclaim. You jump back startled as she pulls the pokeball-shaped fishing hook out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to discover that she caught nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! It fled!\" she cries with a dejected sigh.<br>\r\n\"Hey, big sister! Caught anything?\" you hear one of the two kids crying from behind the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her smiling a little.<br>\r\n\"No, Harper, nothing yet,\" she replies as she gently sets her fishing rod down, next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, more accurately, in between you and her. Great, just another obstacle to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt train of thought as you take notice that the pokeball-shaped fishing hook laying there. An idea forms in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you just could climb on it, you'd be able to get the girl's attention when she grabs the rod again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly run to it, and immediately start climbing on the fishing hook. Soon enough, you make it and stand on the giant, fake pokeball.<br>\r\n\"Uh... Hey! Down here!\" you cry at top of your minuscule lungs. As you feared, the giantess doesn't give any signs of having heard you as she doesn't even move her head to check whoever made that faint sound that was your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I need help!\" you cry again. Again, the young giantess completely ignores you. But you hear her mumbling to herself:<br>\r\n\"Well... might as well try again,\" she says, reaching out for her fishing rod again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Could you help me please?!\" you cry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, this time, the girl's gaze shifts on the fishing hook where you are standing.<br>\r\n\"... What...?\" you hear her mutter as she leans down, her face inches from you as she examines you up close.<br>\r\n\"A tiny person...?\" she asks, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n\"Yes! And I need help!\" you say again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stares at you for a moment, before nodding slightly. Suddenly, you discover her hand coming to grab you, enclosing you in her fist. The other gets a hold of the rod as she stands up.<br>\r\n\"Harper, Sarah, I'll search for a better spot around here! Stay there, alright?\" you hear the giantess say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Yes, big sister!</b>\" both her sisters cry in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you feel the girl starting to walk, while keeping you in the safety of her closed fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you are released from your dark, tight prison as the blue haired giantess lets you sit on her open palm. You discover her staring down at you with curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi?\" you try.<br>\r\n\"How did you get so small?\" she asks you, going straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right... er... I don't know! I woke up, and I was like this!\" you cry out.<br>\r\n\"Dear. My name is Lana, by the way,\" she introduces herself.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you tell her your name.<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to meet you!\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeling's mutual. Now, would you happen to know a way to help me?\" you ask, not bothering to conceal the hint of hope in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the giantess drops her smile.<br>\r\n\"Er... no. I'm sorry, but I never had to deal with a shrunken person before, so I really have no clue of how to grow you back...\" she admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a frustrated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great. Just great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smiles.<br>\r\n\"That said... I may be able to help you anyway,\" she says. You look back at her with curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Well... I may not know about your shrinking or how to fix it... but I can look after you... at least until we figure this out!... If you want, that is.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- really?\" her smile grows wider.<br>\r\n\"Of course! What do you say?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider this. You're shrunk, alone and helpless and this girl is the only living being who offered her help. And so far, she hasn't shown any malicious intent, just genuine concern for your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you can really give one logical answer to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your affirmative response, Lana  speaks up:<br>\r\n\"Alright then! You'll be staying with me from now on. I promise I'll be taking good care of you, trust me!\" she kindly says as she starts to walk back to the campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lana instructed, her little sisters are still where they were before, playing tag.<br>\r\n\"As you may have guessed, those are my younger sisters, Harper and Sarah,\" Lana whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, as if they heard that, the two stop simultaneously as they notice their older sister being there.<br>\r\n\"<b>Hey big sister! Got anything this time?</b>\" they excitedly cry at the same time while rushing to Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, images of you being used as a toy by the two little girls flash across your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you have little time to think about it as you notice Lana...</span></div></div>",

You could have simply slept on and none of this would have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is <i>your</i> fault.

Or at least, you try to start squirming, as the inside of the girl's swimsuit is  very tight, and it leaves you almost no room to move or breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after several tries, though, you manage to move a little. You let out a sigh.<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Come on, you can do it.</i>\u2019 you think to yourself as you resume squirming, trying to move once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not an easy task as you have to struggle in order to move within the tight swimsuit. And only after a good while of squirming and crawling you finally manage to get off Lana's nipple and reach the soft, somewhat sweaty flesh of her right breast. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's already something, but you're not free yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a few minutes resting, tired after struggling to move from the giantess' nipple. The texture of her breast is actually very pleasant. It's like you're laying on a very soft mattress, under a very tight blanket. You can even distinctly hear Lana's heartbeat from this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost kind of soothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up as you hear someone yawning loudly, making the floor beneath you rise. You open your eyes a little, finding yourself in a weird chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stare at your surroundings, confused. You can feel the 'ceiling' keeping you down against something warm and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where are you...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForum a few moments, you struggle to remember, before finally regaining your memories. You remember shrinking down, meeting Lana, then how you... had fun with her feet, then the nighttime meeting with her little sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you remember of how those two mischievous little girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind quickly processes where you are right now and your eyes shut fully open as you realize what is this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're still trapped in Lana's swimsuit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes adjust to the darkness and you notice that you're indeed still trapped within the dark confines of the blue haired giantess' swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have gotten asleep, you guess. It must be morning now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that means that Lana could wake up at any moment! And if she finds you here-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily resume the work that you had started in the night and you start crawling upwards again, trying to reach the opening of Lana's swimsuit before the girl wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you have to struggle in order to move within the dark blue mass that pins you against the giantess' right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm, trying to do it as gently as possible, trying to not wake Lana from her slumber. Of course, the girl could always wake up by herself, in which case you'll probably be very sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep struggling for a while... and it seems to work as you inch closer and closer to the top of Lana's breast, where you could open up her swimsuit to get out, find your place beside her again before she wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if wanting to help you, Lana scratches her breast in her sleep, lessening the pressure on you, making it slightly easier for you to crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your heart seems to melt in relief as you finally arrive on top of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get out, you immediately try to lift the fabric of the swimsuit. Just a little, so you can get out. But the fabric doesn't even move of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you try with all your might to pull it upwards. Only to get the same result as before: the swimsuit doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering some incomprehensible words of annoyance, you try again. And again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every time, you have little success as the swimsuit remains sealed. At one point, you fall down on the smooth surface of Lana's breast, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How can you get out of here if you can't lift her swimsuit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as you feel the breath of the giantess slowing down, a muffled yawn escaping her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perfectly know what this means, she's going to wake up soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting anymore time, you push your hands against the 'ceiling', trying to pull it upwards. And your heart seems to freeze as you...</span></div></div>",

You began licking her foot and thrusting yourself against it attempting to get off as quickly as possible so you don't get caught. You see Lana's toes a few feet away from you flex slightly, you wondered what it would be like to be caught by her toes and squeezed by them... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Lana mutter an unintentionally intimate sounding \"Mmmhhh...\" from the opposite side of the bed and it drives you over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were finally finished with your \"business\" you laid back against Lana's foot to catch your breath. You didn't want to leave it, but you supposed it was for the best. Maybe you could ask Lana if she wanted a foot massage or something later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your hands and body, you realized just how covered in her sweat you were. Hopefully it wasn't too noticeable. You glanced over at the giantess' sole behind you and stand up to wipe your evidence of any wrongdoings off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to do so, however, you realized that the giggling from earlier had stopped, and it was now eerily quiet in Lana's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly turning your head you saw two pairs of giant blue eyes peering at you from the side of the bed! The giggling immediately resumed as the little sisters Harper and Sarah pluck you off of Lana's bed and hold you in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big sister, wake up!\" Harper called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah big sister! Wake up, wake up!\" Sarah shouted, nudging Lana's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared petrified and unable to do anything as you hung pathetically in the air from the little girls' fingers. The older sister groggily woke up from her relatively short slumber and stared annoyed at her two loud little sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...w-what are you two doing in here, and why did you wake me up? And...why do you have him?<br>\r\n W-what did you do to him!?\" Lana said worriedly as she snatched you back from their grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't do anything to him big sister! He was doing something to you!\" said Harper. This was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah! He kept licking and kissing your feet, and hugging them over and over!\" added Sarah. This was <i>really</i> bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my feet? Hugging? What...?\" Lana looked at you puzzled for a moment and then, once she wiped the sleepiness from her eyes, realized that you were indeed covered in what appeared to be her own sweat. The blue-haired giantess' face went red. She peered down at her right foot only to see what you were trying to wipe off before you were caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flustered young girl's face turned from confusion to seriousness very quickly as she brought you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....thank you girls. Can you please leave us alone for a moment? I need to talk with this little guy for a second.\" Lana said, putting on a fake calm face for her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Sure big sister!\" said Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh! You're in troubleeee!\" added Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two little sisters ran out of the room giggling even more than before. All that was left was Lana staring daggers into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then....\" Lana began....</span></div></div>",

To him, it was just a light rain so far. But to his tiny new companion this must be like a hurricane. \"I know.\" He goes back into his bag (just how much does that bag hold?). He pulled out an iron pan. \"I'll use my trusty frying pan...\" he puts the pan over you and your spoon of soup upside-down, \"as a drying pan.\" You hear his muffled voice say. You hear him moving around, you assume to set up his camp. With nothing else to do, you get back to your food, using the smell to guide you in the darkness under the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your belly was full and your body warm from the soup. You can hear the rain outside hitting the pan, it was getting heavier out there. You see a sliver of light as the pan is slightly lifted, and from that light came a hand that swiftly snatched you and the spoon before quickly moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand opened to show you were inside a tent with Brock. He hands you a small towel to dry off. \"Thank you.\" You say as you begin to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Someone must have used it recently, but aside from the remains of a campfire, there we no signs that anyone would be coming back. You sighed and pressed on, not even passing the campsite when you started to hear some sort of commotion nearby. Almost like a city or small town. Was civilization actually so near? Without missing a beat, you quickly ran off towards the noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you finally saw a building on the edge of the woods. This was perfect. No you no longer needed to worry about being captured or eaten by the wildlife. As you got nearer, you noticed that the structure appeared to be a contest hall. By now almost everyone was already inside to watch the coordination competitions that were taking place. Well all except for one girl standing near a tree just outside sulking. She had a dark pinkish colored hair styled in drill-like pigtails.Judging by her somewhat elegant blue dress with the white coat over it, you assumed that she is a coordination. And judging by her current activity, she most likely just suffered a rather big loss. <br>\r\n\"Stupid Judge. I had that contest in the bag. She grumbled as she tried to vent her frustrations alone. You were a bit reluctant to get near her while she's in this mood. Lord know how that could end for you. Then again, maybe something like you will clear her mind from whatever's bothering her... or maybe she'll see you as the perfect stress release toy. Maybe you should stay back and wait for her to calm down.</span></div></div>",

But I've never seen someone going to such \u2018small\u2019 measures\u201d She teased. As you look around, hoping someone else will come.

You can tell she really needed this today. It did sound like she was very angry about whatever happened in there. She reached down at you and picked you up in her massive grasp. Thankfully she wasn't holding you by her fingers but instead let you wonder around on her open palm. A lot more comfortable and a lot less scary. Being this close you were able to make out her face even more and the conquering smile she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell no duh. Of course you want to stay with me. I am kind of amazing\u201d She said \u201cAren't you lucky, getting to serve under your favourite coordinator Ursula\u201d She said giving you her name and showing you her arrogance. \u201cOk, i need to take you somewhere, so no one will see you. But i don't have any pockets on me... Hmmm....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could drop me in your clothes or something?\u201d You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say she got a bit angry at the idea \u201cYou little perv, I'm not gonna put you near my body. Another idea like that and ill put you under my sock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing near her foot, not that you hate that option. But then again you want to avoid getting stepped on in her shoe. Thinking some more you tried to think of other options. She doesn't have pockets on her dress and she isn't carrying a purse or bag and she doesn't want to drop you in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drawing a blank, but Ursula got an idea. Reaching down into her dress leg, you watch as she pulls out a small Pokeball. Expanding it into a bigger size. It was slightly bigger then you. Her Pokeball opens up as she brings it close to the hand you were on. Holding it open near her hand as you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, jump in\u201d She told you as you weren't sure you wanted to. Ursula saw your momentary stop as she told you her way of thinking \u201cLook, its the only way i can carry you. Its not like I'm gonna shrink the ball and its not like your gonna actually be caught by me. Now jump in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell when she puts it that way you can't really complain. Moving over you walk to the edge of her hand, then climbing down into the Pokeball, it wasn't comfy as you sit down in the Pokeball. Ursula looking at you with a big smile. It seems your not being that obedient. Something Ursula wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, your gonna stay there until I'm in my room. Then you can serve me however i want.\u201d Ursula said, cracking off into a big laugh as she couldn't hold back her happiness. \u201cSeriously, Dawn might have won the Contest but my prize is way better. Half of me wants to find her and shove you in her face, show what I've got and she doesn't. But then again half of me knows she would make such a big deal about helping you and all that so ill just keep you a secret.\u201d With that Ursula closed the Pokeball and left the building. Leaving you alone with your thoughts and leaving Ursula alone with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, most of the time you were thinking about how uncomfortable the Pokeball is. Hunched over and the ground being hard, no wonder most Pokemon want to get out. Well their converted to data so chances are they don't actually know the feeling of being cooped up. A part of the way you also thought about if you made the right choice. Ursula is planning on enslaving you and thats bad, but undoubtably a part of you is kind of making you look forward to it. Which is why you said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside walking, Ursula was just thinking about all the things she can do to you and what she can make you do. Out of all the ideas that was rattling through her devious head, the one she was really thinking about was being treated and pampered like a goddess. The Goddess that she really is. Or at least considers she is<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more walking, Ursula arrived at the Pokemon Centre. Planning to rent a room.</span></div></div>",

With pure adrenaline running through your vanes, you kept charging forward. One thing you quickly notice is an ant that is about your size in front of you. But in a blink of an eye it was obliterated out of existence by a giant black leather heel that you ran into and fell straight on our butt on the concrete walkway you were running on. It only took Ursula two steps to chase your tiny forum down and stop you in your escape. Now you were staring up at this giantess, scared out of your mind and in to much pain to try for another escape attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one naughty little man, how dare you try to run away from me. Your gorgeous new owner. Lucky for you I am willing to forgive you and not stomp you out of existence like I did with the small bug. (She grabs you into her hand with little to no effort)  Now to thank me for sparring your life I expect you to be a good tiny man and be blessed that I am your goddess. Is that understood?\". Once the titan size woman has said this, fear was being strike into you by watching something that was about the same size as you get crushed like it was nothing. So you just nod your head yes, fearing to what is to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now, as your goddess I will punish you for your little escape attempt. So I decided that the best fit punishment for you is when we arrive home for you to clean my heels that I am now wearing. I expect you to clean the disgusting remains of the bug and every inch of dirt off the bottom of my heels. No buts about it little man. Now I don't have any pockets to carry you in and just walking around with a tiny man that looks like a doll sounds way to embarrassing. I will give you a reward, to show that I am also a fair goddess. You will ride in my ass, lucky you.\" Ursula then without even checking for your response opens her dress/panties back and quickly shoves you into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure alone of being in between her ass cheeks was such an awful feeling but to make matters worse she also slip in some undetectable farts on her way home. They made the environment around you smell terribly and temperature rise in humid. Ursula just took her time skipping all the way to the hotel that she was staying at. The feeling to her felt incurable, never in her life did she think having a tiny man in general would be great but also squished in her butt. The sensation was indescribable to her happy self. Some time passes and she then arrives in the hotel. Taking the elevator all the up to the floor she was staying on. She then opens the door to reveal...</span></div></div>",

Ever since you were 14 and invented your first great invention that changed the way doctors worked, saving more life\u2019s in the process. After this you essentially had your childhood taken away from you. So, you could join other great minds in a lab, you spent five years working there so far and even though it sounded bad being young and having to work. There were moments where you got to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you had to produce great inventions in such short time frames and having fun didn\u2019t always happen. But you did get moments of free time in which you spent watching your favorite show Pok\u00e9mon. Upon turning 20 this year you had gotten a new idea for an invention that would allow you to have fun all the time. This idea was sparked from essentially loneliness. Since you weren\u2019t able to make too many friends your own age, you had fallen or more so had a crush on a girl you saw in Pok\u00e9mon named Dawn. Ever since you saw her in gen 4. You couldn\u2019t stop feeling a certain way towards her. You were smart enough and in the right mind to know she wasn\u2019t real, but still couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you made up your mind that you had to have her. And being the great inventor, you were, you thought that there had to be some way to transfer your life out of this world and into the fictional world of Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you some time, but you had finally cracked the code and had an invention that just might work under certain conditions. The invention hooked up to a TV and only worked for live time TV programs where whatever episode was on the air that would be where you would end up in the show. Which means in an example if the episode where ash lets his Butterfree is on you would end up right next to him watching his Butterfree leave. You were only really able to test it out 3 times, (since cartoon network announced it was doing a random assortment of Pok\u00e9mon episode marathon that night) and each time on an episode of friends with a plastic ball, the ball ended up in random spots each time, which meant that even if you enter the right episode you wouldn\u2019t know where you would end up in that episode, you could even land outside a window. And since you didn\u2019t test it on anything living you could end up dead or worse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn\u2019t care, all you knew is that you made it, so it\u2019s got to work. And since this was your best chance at seeing Dawn you had to take the chance. That whole day you spent getting ready, picking out an episode that Dawn was in, setting a self-destruction timer to the device so no one could follow you in and also finishing up some last farewell messages to the people of the real world. And you ended up finishing in good enough time as you saw that it was 7:48 and the episode started at 8:00. You ran around getting everything ready, you were just going to jump in as soon as the clocked struck 8:00.  (But something you didn\u2019t know or count for is that the network was running behind and so the episode that was currently on \u201cAll fired up\u201d was going to continue to run for an extra 10 mins) \u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock struck 8, you jump without even looking, and a goodbye to your old life. Lights flashed everywhere and you feel your body become more animated. Then in a matter of a second you slammed with a bang against a huge thin metal flat surface, you then fell into an opening that had zig-zags of metal around the roof of it, and finally hitting a soft but hard cloth flooring. You were fortunate not to pass out. Then you got up and dusted yourself off, looking around with minimal lightening you saw walls that felt like cushion, giant sticks that looked like giant pens, a flat surface that almost reached the top of whatever you were in that looked like a giant notebook, and then you turn to see a shocking thing giant poke-balls. Seeing this was making you come closer to figuring out where you were and what happened to you. But as you were coming to this realization of figuring out that you had shrunk and enter the Pok\u00e9mon world an earthquake happens followed by a loud female voice (it was normal to normal people).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear 2 loud thuds and then more as the earthquakes begin to slow down, but the loud female voice keeps rambling to herself. The place your in then suddenly moves and then your met with what puts all the pieces together as you look up to see a giant face (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/9/9d/Female_torchbearer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131229154458\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/poke...</a>). Then with the girl completely unaware of your existence, you are greeted with two titanic track shoes being pushed into the backpack that your trapped in. And then the zipper is shut with a tiny hole in the top, which isn\u2019t big enough for you to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around you starts to become toxic smelling, as you look up you begin to realize the bad smell is emitting from the sweaty dirty track shoes. You start to then feel the bag begin to move with the girl carrying it. You try to keep your balance and think that there is no way this could get any worse being trapped in an enclosed space with basically this unaware girl\u2019s smelly sweaty foot sweat shoes to keep you company. And as that thought enter your mind, a clump of dirt that was stuck to the bottom of the girls track shoe lands on you causing you to lose your balance and bounce around the bag till she gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

This gigantic girl had no idea the level of torture that she was unknowingly putting you through with each average step that she took. The smell and bouncing around had made it impossible for you to think about your situation and just focus on trying to survive. Luckily or maybe unlucky for you it was only an hour trip which felt much longer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl walk up a flight of stairs to enter her apartment, she carelessly tosses her bag onto her bed as she enters her room. And with a free fall for you. You landed safely on top of the girls worn down laces on her shoe. With being fortunate enough to not have anything inside of the bag land on top of you. As you begin to get up with feeling of some painful bruises, still noticing the foul odor coming out of the giant track sneakers.You hear a shower turned on that seems to be a good distance away. Looking up the bag or in front of you. In the distance you can see the small hole where the two zippers met. Seeing this you thought that you should take this opportunity to get out of this bag and just collect all your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your starting to climb across the dirt covered laces, your foot gets caught by the last lace. And then to make matters worse the bag begins to move. The zippers begin to go to either side, with your foot still stuck in the laces you brace yourself as you look up at the opening and seeing only the familiar face of your unaware enormous captor (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/9/9d/Female_torchbearer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131229154458\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/poke...</a>). But with even just the face in your view, you noticing right away that she is not wearing any cloths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour speechless as you hold on tightly to this giant girls track sneakers. And without taking any notice of you, the girls titanic size hand comes towards your direction. As the girl grabs hold of her track shoes, pulling them out of the bag and then carelessly tossing them beside her bed. As the shoes hit the ground, you are sprung out of the laces and thrown underneath the giants bed. Only to be stopped by a giant poke doll. Taking a moment to get back up you see the giants feet appear at one of the openings under the bed and with *STOMP, STOMP STOMP*. Your last sight of the girl is her bare ass rounding the corner as the giantess leaves to go take her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has given you the first moment that you have had to just think, since you have been in this new world. In your thoughts -<span class=\"cmaroon\">There must of been something that went wrong with the machine. I was sure that my calculations should of equal to me making into this world with nothing going wrong. But I guess I didn't factor my height changing into the formula and/or maybe an off TV schedule that would probably have caused the location error. Well I guess with all that to the side I need to figure out a way to get to a normal height, since what I know about Dawn is that she likes tall guys. And I think the best way to do that is to either invent a grow ray or invent a way back to the normal world to recalculate and do a new jump. But all that will depend on what I can find for parts. And the best way to search..</span>.-.</span></div></div>",

To the Torch girl chapter written in the side characters section. These stories can intertwine since there based on the same timeline. But don\u2019t worry, if you don\u2019t want to read that chapter this one should still make sense. The torch girl chapter would just help make the events clearer.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing 23 years old and entering your 5th year as a clerk for a grocery store. Doing your best to stay as a full-time student at college while still being able to pay your apartment bills. Life has just been a journey for you living on your own.<br>\r\nIt was about 4:00 today when you arrived home from work. Fumbling around with your keys trying to just get your apartment door open, you hear a loud crash and looked down the hall to see your neighbor a 20 year old who you recognize when you met him a while back as the genius 14 year old from the news. All he does is wave at you as he carries some huge device into his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really thinking anything of it, since he does that all the time, you just waved back and walked inside your own apartment. After working a tough shift at work all you wanted to do was lay down to go to sleep. But you knew you had to finish homework first beforehand. So, after about three hours you end up finishing. Thinking to yourself that you can finally rest, but then your interrupted by loud sounds coming next door, it felt like the entire building just shook for a moment.  But then everything went to rest and all you could hear is this annoying beating noise coming from next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of trying to get to sleep, you realize that your going to have to go next door and see if the genius can turn that noise off. So, one fell swoop you got up and headed towards his apartment door. You knocked a couple times and just waited there. You tried screaming through the door but heard nothing for a straight 20 mins. At this point you were to tired to care and just barged in \u201cHey sorry for just coming in but can you\u2026\u201d. There was no one in front of you except that device hook up to the genius\u2019s TV and a show that was playing that you recognize as Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cOf course, this nerd watches Pok\u00e9mon\u201d you say this to yourself. And after searching around the different rooms, you didn\u2019t see any sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought that maybe he left, but then thought that would be impossible since the doors here are so loud that when they close everyone can hear them no matter what and know for sure you didn\u2019t hear him leave. Upon thinking that you remember the beeping noise coming from a computer that was hook up to the big device on the Tv, then say to yourself \u201cOh well maybe he somehow closed it quietly I mean he is a genius. But I need to get that sound off I hope he doesn\u2019t mind me messing with this thing to get the sound off\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the computer screen you see a count-down timer that seemed to have froze at 19 secs due to a pop-up that reads \u201cWarning!!!...\u201d over and over again. You click to close the pop-up and the beeping stops as the timer begins to count down again. Then you think that it\u2019s probably best to get rid of the other sound that is his TV volume, by just turning it off. But as you got closer to the TV you tripped on a wire laying on the ground causing you to go into the TV.  With not even knowing what was going on you fell into the episode \u201cBulb and the Hidden Village\u201d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights were forming all around you as you began to feel more animated. Then with a hard *Thud* against a wooden wall you fell to the hard-wooden flooring. Luckily you were just fine, only in a bit of pain from hitting the wall so hard. You manage to get yourself up and dust yourself off. And once you start to look around, you are immediately scared out of your mind. Because everything around you was gigantic and then you hear a loud noise by a door opening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie the giant who has just opened the door. Was waving goodbye to Ash who just caught her Bulbasaur and his friend\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarthquakes begin around you as you watch a giant woman (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/a/ad/Melanie%27s_full_appearance.png/revision/latest?cb=20140212235807\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/poke...</a>) enter what you assume to be her huge home. You stand there at your tiny size under her dresser. Standing there you notice that the layout of the house is just one big room and a smaller room attached that contains the bathroom. The woman just walks in and closes her door. Walking over to her titanic fridge and pulling out some food to cook with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust still standing there you wonder how all this could be possible. Seeing this giant woman cooking you sort of recognize her but need some confirmation before thinking that she is someone you know of. The earthquakes continue to happen as the woman is frantically playing around causing dust to fly about under her dusty flats. While she is enjoying her cooking, you begin to thinking to yourself that just standing here wont accomplish anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So, what do you do next?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One who just shrunk you out of the blue, with no warning whatsoever. Behind her was three happinies, each carrying your pokeballs in their little hands. Being extra careful to not damage the devices and the young Pokemon that dwell from within them. Your apparent destination is\u2026the local poke center?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute...these Pokemon are part of the center? Just what the hell is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grew to widen as the Chansey and her crew places you in the breakroom. There a tall but young member of <i>enormous</i> sized joy family. She shakily pets the Chansey, causing it to lovingly purr. As she turned to you, and walk forth to you, making you reason that it was Joslynn Joy! A newbie nurse.  She has always been an awkward and clumsy girl who tends to stutter. Her being tall for her young and being more...\"lank than curve\" hasn't certainly helped her those matters.<br>\r\nIt still didn't deter you from making her one of your closest friends. Almost like a sibling to you,and..than somr. Using your loudest voice possible, you call out to her. \"Jojo! What the hell is going on around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl blushed an uncomfortable pink as you used <i>that</i> nickname for her. It always makes her feel <i>bizarre</i>, like a weirdly dressed clown. But nonetheless, she answered.\"W-while first of all...I um..told them to shrink you. Sopleasedon'tbemadatme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...DID WHAT <u><i><b>NOW</b></i></u>?!?!\" You quite understandably shrieked at the giant. Almost causing her to cry right on the spot. Making your heart ached a little, but you stood firm. \"... And why the fuck would you do this to me anyway Jojo?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...because Mom a-and h-her sisters have b-been really hard on me lately. Making me do so much work and studies. I needed someone to help me...relax and stuff. So naturally..you.\" A blushing Joslynn told you her reasoning, making your anger dulled somewhat. They have been quite frankly unfair to her and running her up the wall. But it still didn't give her right to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ruefully sighed at as she sat down on a couch. There she places her big clunky feet on the table you were sitting on. They were lengthy in shape, and the toes were long. The heels and balls were hard and have a few slight cracks. The litty soles were stained with dust and sweat. The perfume that was wafting off of them was a pure cheddar vinegar that felt like a right hook to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just got so shamefully turned by it. Soon your red face met with her pink one. \"Joslynn...what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you tend to stare at my family's feet at times. I simply thought you would want to rub mine. Consider it a win a win for the both...of us.\" Joslynn gave you terrible mockery of a smile, complete with some awkward toe wiggling. But to her horror, you simply turn your back to the nervous wreck. You can't even look at her right now. But thanks to her little show, you just so damn hot and bothered. And not to mention that look on face.Well..too bad, she thought about that before doing all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minutes were battle of wills for the two..kinda. But what happens next in this \"great\" battle?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't expect this to be so tiring for you, she thought it would be easier. She felt bad, but she did see a little smile on your face. Showing that you did enjoy it. She always thought you had a foot fetish, what from the multiple times she caught you looking at girls feet. Maybe she can late you hang with her feet next time, enjoy it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank... thank you\u201d She said still being thankful. You didn't respond but just breathed. Jojo feeling like she should repay you decided to do that with a little massage. Completely catching you off guard, her fingers came for you. Lifting you up into her palm as she raised you up to the sky. She brought you in front of her face as you tried standing up, only for her fingers to quite powerfully pin you down onto your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJodi, whats the big idea\u201d You say to the nurse. Not knowing whats going through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, i just want to pay you back.\u201d She said to you. She noticed how her simply fingers pinned you down completely. You couldn't even move right now. The surge of power did get to her. \u201cAlthough we mostly work on Pokemon, our family does know how to treat humans. For example i think i can do an alright back massage\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack massage! That sounds... actually pretty good right now. Okay just be careful\u201d You say as you stop struggling, ready to take the massage. Jocelyn happy raised you up to her face, trying to get a better sight at the back she was going to work on. You expected some pressure on your back. Not for Jojo to grip your shirt ad yank it over your head. It took a little while but she pulled it off, leaving you shirtless. \u201cAt least warn me if your going to do that!\u201d You shout at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, this will just make it easier for me to see what I'm doing\u201d Jojo said as you went back to laying down. Jodi brought two off her fingers to you and went to start. Since your so much smaller then most of the people she's given massages to, she realised she should be careful. So she just gently drummed her fingers over you back. 1, 2, 1, 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever for you it was more like tree trunks coming down and ramming into your back. You screamed in pain as she stopped, not the sound she was expecting. \u201cSorry let me try it again\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to protest but she went at it again, this time much softer and a lot better. \u201cWow...\u201d was all you managed to get out as your body went numb from the fingers. She went to pushing as her fingers worked wonders for you. Above Jocelyn was happy, this is the first time she's worked on someone so small, but this isn't the first time she's gotten someone to bliss. A state where the person in question is just too relaxed to care.... and too relaxed to care what he agrees to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, isn't that much better.\u201d She said in a very soothing voice \u201cIm pretty good at massages, and you seem pretty good at taking them. You know i didn't think you'd be so angry at me kidnapping and shrinking you. I just wanted you with me, thats not so bad is it?\u201d She said manipulating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it isn't\u201d You say being manipulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats what i thought. And being small isn't that bad, you get to be near my feet. You like my feet right?\u201d She said pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, i do\u201d You say as the words that came out of your mind was just natural. No thought into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, so if you think about it you being small isn't that bad. In fact its pretty great for you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it is\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats right it is, so maybe you'd be okay with staying this size for a little while with me. Maybe forever even?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah maybe forever. Wait... Forever? What not forever!\u201d You say snapping out, only for her to massage you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJojo bit her lip, she really thought she would get you there. \u201cWell, we can discuss that later. For now we should play around some more. Now that i got relaxed and you just got relaxed, you want to play with you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure?\u201d You say little bit snapped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJojo smiled as she stopped the massage and __________</span></div></div>",

Please tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust that your ready to have fun with me\u201d Jojo said \u201cSo lets have fun\u201d She then brought you closer to her breasts, before bringing you even closer as she rammed you against one of her boobs. Pressing your head against it as you try to tell her. Although it only came off as mumbles due to your face being pressed against it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJojo above you blushed at the situation. It was kind of embarrassing to a degree. She's known you for so long and well... loved you for so long. Of course she was happy to finally to start doing this but it is a little awkward. Not like she's gonna stop though and of course she is still gonna enjoy herself. She heard you mumble some more into her chest as she giggles. \u201cSorry but I'm having fun. I hope you don't hold it against me, i really do. But I'm not gonna stop. In fact I'm thinking the clothes are holding you back a bit. Ready to go diving\u201d She then dropped you a bit, letting you hit her lap. Getting a fresh breath you look up to Jojo. Only to see her take off her top and reveal her two breasts underneath. Being held together by a tight pink bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u201d was all you could say. The sight was amazing but you don't know if you should look. This is insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see\u201d She said as she teased with a blush on her face \u201cWell your about to feel what you see!\u201d She then threw her nursing top to the side as she reached down for you. You could do nothing as she brings you up to her face. Smiling and blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs... is it weird that I'm starting to enjoy this too\u201d You say to her. With that one sentence she lights up beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Are!! Oh that is great! I was a little scared that you were gonna be angry with me for doing this but no! You love it as much as i do\u201d Jojo pretty much cheered. \u201cAnd your gonna love this\u201d Jojo then brought you down straight into her cleavage. Not letting you fall gently no she plunged you into it. You find yourself squirming between both of her melons as her hand retreated. Both of her flesh orbs squeezing the life out of you. They were pretty much making you skinnier with how close they were. As your in between them you notice a little something poking out from below. Which makes sense. After being near the feet, the amazing back massage and now being jammed between Jojo\u2019s Tata\u2019s. It would quite frankly be weirder if you didnt have one of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJojo above fell back, loving the feeling of you in between her tits. Never in her life would she actually think this would happen. The feeling she's having right now is probably the first of its kind. No one else has their best friends in between their breasts. Smiling slyly she grabbed each side of her breasts. Holding onto the outside as she plans to make this as fun and well.... Erotic as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her breasts spread apart, giving you some room for a second. You don't have a pair yourself but you are pretty sure boobs are not suppose to do that. Suddenly they came in close as you found yourself squished between them even more. Feeling like you were between a very sexy rock and a erotic hard place. She then brought them apart as she brought you closer even more. But once again she then brought them in. Getting faster with the speed every time as you didn't know getting smushed would be so great. Jojo was enjoying it far more then you were though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Yes! That feels so good!!!!\u201d She shouts closing her eyes and speeding up. Feeling your body in between them, completly at the whims of her movements. Jojo continued to rock back and forth getting even faster with it. her twin peaks getting erect as she noticed this. She wants to stop, thinking that it wasn't fair or nice to you to keep smashing you between her breasts. But she can't stop. Not right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Not trying to stop as you know you don't want to get caught. It was just a simple job, or at least thats what you thought. Your behind on your rent, its just a small store steal. You'll be in and out before anyone will even know. With darkened clothes and a mask on, you went in confident. Only for that to disappear when you started mugging the register. Your not a criminal and that was obvious. It became more obvious when the clerk hit the notice button to the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even grab anything, you just left. Running away which brings you to now. You can't deal with the Police, you don't have any combat skills, you don't have any Pokemon to help you. Thats why you plan to run away and hide. You round the corner and see one of the local police officers. Not only one, but THE Police Officer. With her famous outfit and her blue hair, it was the Officer Jenny of this town, with her Growlithe at her side. She was famous for how good she was, which was bad for you. And even worse she's spotted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop Criminal!\u201d She said loudly directing it to you \u201cStop and give up, you won't escape!\u201d<br>\r\nHer words and her tone scared you more then calmed you, causing you to sprint away. She gave chase but with the numbers of people on the street, she struggled. You gained distance thanks to your speed and the people. You also knew how far she was thanks to the Growlithe Barking at you. It grew further and further as you ran further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your far too tired to run forever, your mind wanting you to stop as you run into an alley. Hiding in the corner or a dumpster as you try not to make any noise. It only took you a second to mentally slap yourself. Why would you hide! She's got an expert Pokemon that can easily track you! You know this is the end, you might be able to outrun Jenny but defiently not her Growlithe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing right next to you, teleporting in an Abra. It looked at you as you hold your breathe. It looked at you curiously as you couldn't help but stare at it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBra?\u201d It said back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrow!\u201d You heard the Pokemon say as Jenny got closer and closer to you. Your mind trying to think of what you can do to run away and avoid. Then your mind went to the Abra. This random event might just save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Abra, you can Teleport right?\u201d You say to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbr?\u201d It responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well teleport me away Okay. Abra Use Teleport\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbra use Teleport!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Abra, do something!\u201d You shout to it annoyed. Then it did something, with a big flash of light it disappeared. You wanted to shout in anger, but then you noticed something. Everything was... bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dumpster was now a building. The walls now went to the sky and everything was bigger. It shrunk you! It was at least something but now you know your not escaping officer Jenny. Which was obvious when Jenny and her Growlithe came around the corner. Seeing the giant officer run in as she towered over you. Her boot stomping down near you as you marvel at her size. Her Growlithe behind you and not spotting you. It was smaller then Jenny but still a huge beast. Size of the biggest Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Growlithe you sure his scent went this way?\u201d Jenny said as she was surprised. It was a Dead End, but this was where Growlithe followed the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLithe! Grow Grow Lithe!\u201d It said to the trainer. You couldn't tell what gender it was right now, but what you do know it hasn't seen you yet. Which is good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it apparently can't see your right now or smell you it became quite obvious. That Abra was the gift from Arceus that you needed. Granted your small and that could be a problem when you escape but maybe its temporary. Go back to normal size when you escape Officer Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which the Officer and the Pokemon walked further into the dead end alley. Taking your chance you sprint away. Running away from your pursuers as you just hope that neither of them will find you running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

And with no hesitation she rushed into her car to head home. After about 20 to 30 mins of driving she arrives home, you awake from a sound of a door slamming and shoes hitting a tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you feel a little better and know you can start moving at any time, but choose not to since your still in her breast pocket. The next thing you hear is the sound of a bathtub faucet being turned on, followed by a TV being turned on to the news. \" I need this bath more then anything right now\" Jenny says this while striping away her cloths and you just feel yourself slammed to the ground but still inside of the officers uniform pocket. Then you hear footsteps walking away followed by a *slam* sound of what you assume to be the bathroom door being shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then start to realize that this is your chance to escape this pocket prison and you notice that the only thing holding this pocket closed is one button on the outside, leaving you enough room to just squeeze your way out of the top flaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right as you are half way out of the pocket, knowing full well that you can easily get in and out of it with no issue. The true thought finally enters your brain, where would you go next? Your tiny now and don't even know where you are from the city. I you choose to escape you might end up in a worse position being this tiny. But if you choose to stay who knows what will happen if Jenny figures out the truth about you. And as that last thought came in your head, you hear a sound of candles being lit with a splash of a person entering a bath tub. Which gives you a pervy thought that might be to hard to refuse, you could sneak into the bathroom and see Jenny naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what do you decide to do?)</span></div></div>",

Jenny was quick to move only her uniform to the dryer as she got a call that the police needed her right away. She let her cloths, including the pants that you were in dry for 10 mins. You were still in a unconsciousness state of drowning at this point. The heat of the dryer and getting constantly pounded against the metal walls of the dryer while being inside the butt pocket of jenny s pants. Had made your body paralyze and complete shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut It seemed that Jenny has opened the dryer door right in time as she whip her clothing on the sudden impact of her butt squeezing against her tight pants made it so you could cough up the water. At this point you were stuck inside of jenny's pants as she went on with her life. And even though you wanted to die, each time you were given a chance to keep living the next day you did. Having to smell her farts, feeding off things that she put in her back pocket, And drinking water when it rained on her pants. The worst part about the whole experience, other then this being your life now, was that every time a guy hit on Jenny and she let them. You would feel there hard privates each time they hugged her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole experience was humiliating and you were basically lint to her at this point. A week even passed by and Jenny just kept forgetting to put her pants back into the wash so the smell was just unbearable from inside the pocket. But it wasn't till the end of that week where you would finally get what you wanted. As Jenny was running through the forest chasing a criminal, The guy who she was chasing got lost from her vision. As she stood there thinking she stuck her hand into her back pocket and felt something. It was you and you thought that this was your chance, that staying alive all this time wasn't a mistake. Maybe she can find a way to fix you. But Jenny's soft elegant hand just grab you and some crumbs and whip them out of her hand. Not even taking a second look as you were left like trash on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly though your journey didn't end there as you were dropped with the crumbs onto a berry. Where groups of Pokemon were gathering around getting thee last meals for the day. A Gardevoir grabs the berry that you were on and without even looking at it, the Pokemon devours it whole. Leaving you to drown and digest inside the Pokemon's stomach.</span></div></div>",

But you were nowhere in sight, she considered for a moment that you could of gotten crushed by some unaware lass.

This is your own fault after all, you just had to be good and act like a baby last night and maybe I would have just let go today. But instead you were a brat and tried to tell me someone who is ten times your size what I can't do\" she smiles and looks at me finish with dressing you.

You are just so little and tiny that being my baby is just an overall better place for you. So I say again whether you like it or not, your adult life is over, for now on its bottles and diapers so get use to it. Plus it would be really bad if Todd comes over tonight and the baby suddenly disappeared. So now I'm going to take you to a daycare because that where baby's like you belong during the day\". Just like that she unstraps you, forcefully picks you up, and walks out to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at a mall and Joy carries you in, you try your best to struggle out of her arms but her giant arms strength that if your were big could easily break out of but due to your size it was to much for you to even budge an inch. You were then carried straight into a daycare center and you instantly saw kids running around playing, having fun. Then a daycare employee approaches Joy, She look beautiful and was fairly young she introduced herself as Penelope (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Penelope_\" target=\"_blank\">https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/...</a>(XY013)) \"Hey, how are you mam? is this the little guy we have to look after today, he is just to cute\" Joy nods (yes) and then gives me a motherly kiss on the head while heading me over to Penelope. \"Now you two have fun\" Joy says this and leaves right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little guy I have to finish changing some diapers, so you go have fun and if you need me I'll be right over there by the changing area\" Penelope says this to you, pulling out your pacifier and puts you down very quickly, without even giving you a chance to argue and say your not a baby. She just scurries off in hurry to get back to changing a child...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what do you do now?)</span></div></div>",

Wait if I leave now how will I ever find that Abra being so tiny, you know it might be a big risk but getting help from this giant might be worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do you take the risk, decide not to, or maybe you thought to much and she is heading right for you?)</span></div></div>",

To Dawn being completely unaware of your direr situation.

She steps into a small puddle but thinks nothing of it as dirty puddle water splashes into your face. Dawn then hops onto her bike and heads into the direction of Pallet town to visit Ash. The ride was long and messy with Dawn feeling the need to ride through the dirt causing it to fly up and hit your face every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally arrives at her destination and walks up the walkway towards the Ketchum house, you hope to yourself during this time that less walking happens from here on out so you can find a way to get unstuck and off of this h*** of a ride that your being unknowingly forced to be put through. Dawn walks up to the door and you notice the brown strange flooring below you that realize is the door mat. As you hear the door open wide and greeting are made between Dawn and Delia K.

But at least it presented you with the opportunity to escape her. Run from the law and live your days at this size. Now you've wasted that chance and your eyes are being locked at by this woman. Hopefully your small enough for her not to be able to recognise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, is this a tiny man\u201d She said showing that she sees you. You watch the Growlithe move around her owners legs, seeing you as well. It moved around and you couldn't help but stare at the giant beast of a Pokemon. Much bigger then an Arcanine as you fear its gonna end up eating you. Your fears were countered though as you feel a gloved hand reach down and grab you. Two fingers on each side of you. You get lifted off of the ground and up to her face. You stare at it as you really couldn't understand how every girl in the Jenny family not only looks the same, but looks dead drop gorgeous. You didn't get the chance to appreciate her before when you were running from her. Up to her beautiful face, you really hope that there is no chance she will be able to recognise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second\u201d Jenny said as you watch her face move as she puts pieces together \u201cYour that Criminal i was just chasing! But a lot smaller\u201d She said gaining a sudden smile which did scare you \u201cWell i guess that makes my job a lot easier. Your under arrest right now by the Saffron City Police. Anything you say or do will be used against you in a court of law. Id put the handcuffs on you but it seems they would be far to big for you\u201d She was almost playful with her final teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease miss, listen to me. or at least help me grow big before you send me to prison!\u201d You shout to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey if you can't do the time, then don't the crime. Your going.... to.... prison?\u201d She said as she questioned herself. In her mind she was having a debate. She wants to send you to prison but she can't do it while your this size. You'd be teared apart on the first day. She can't take you in right now. Hence in her mind she needs to do something. \u201cOkay fine. Tell me how you got this small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted you to talk about the size, but your taking this opportunity to tell her something else \u201cWell miss, I'm not really a criminal! I had to try to rob that place. Im behind on my rent and i really don't want to be homeless. If there was another way i could earn the money fast i would of. Promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, that confirms that. Jenny\u2019s seen a lot of hardened criminals, and she was easily able to tell that you weren't one. Still she had to be tough \u201cThats not the question i asked. I asked how you got small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she knows. Thats whats important \u201cWell how i got small. Lets see i was running away from you, then i was hiding, then an Abra teleported in, shrunk me, then teleported out\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked at you for a second, like it was hard for her to realise what you were saying was true. \u201cSo your telling me, a random Abra came in just to shrink you and then left\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know, its weird!\u201d You admit to her as she glared at you, trying to determine if you were telling the truth to her. As you retreated under her glare she came to the conclusion that you wouldn't lie to her. Especially since your literally in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, since I'm assuming this is your first sentence and you are remorseful about it. I doubt the system will go to hard on you.\u201d Jenny admitted as you were happy about it \u201cBut like i said, i can't take you in until we find this Abra. If it shrunk you so I'm willing to bet it can grow you back\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, uh how are you gonna find it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, i don't know\u201d Jenny admitted returning her Growlithe back to her Pokeball. \u201cRegardless I'm off duty as of this moment. We can start the search tomorrow. Im sure you don't mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo of course not\u201d You say, figuring time with the officer can't be all bad.</span></div></div>",

Shrink you down to a size which would make a Joltik seem like an intimidating Pokemon. Still it could be much worse as the Psychic Pokemon just let you go, letting you roam the forest at such a small size. Luckily you seem to be to small for Pokemon to find you. And even better you found a campsite in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late at night so there was a campfire going on as well. Letting you see the owner of the campsite. Sitting on a log was a very cute girl. She had blonde curly hair, a nice stylish hat and a face which you found adorable. She looked about your age and you have the feeling she's nice. At least that's the kind of atmosphere she's putting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run towards the campsite and get close to the girl. She was sitting on a log so she was elevated a bit, however you hope she's low enough to hear you. You run up towards her sneaker and start yelling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, down here. C'mon! Please look down here!\" you yell up at her, hoping that she would look down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work as she glanced down and her eyes went wide when she realized she was staring at a small person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" she said unable to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I'm (Your Name) and I'm so glad I found you. I thought I would of been eaten by a Pokemon in this forest.\" you joke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, you just ran into one of the top officials in the criminal organization Team Rocket. Domino. She was currently in disguise mode so that's why you didn't recognize her. Domino didn't know how you got so small, but one thing was for sure.

She helps you and puts you down on her palm. There you take a break and take a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well I was just exploring the local forest, you know watch the Pokemon eat and stuff. Well I saw this Pokemon I haven't seen before. I followed the Pokemon and I may have annoyed it. I'm not really sure why but it was angry. Anyway It shrunk me and I've been wondering the forest all day, trying to avoid any Pokemon. That's when I found you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Weird story, do you know what Pokemon shrunk you?\" Domino said wanting more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell you it's name, but I can tell you what it looks like. It was a green Pokemon. It had a head kind of like a seed and if I had to bet, I would say its a Psychic Grass type\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomino eyes go wide. She knows exactly what Pokemon this is.

Domino seemed satisfied enough with the response and had you lead the way, lifting you high above her so you could get a better vantage point. After giving her directions here and there, the two of you eventually found yourselves back in the same spot where Celebi had shrunk you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cplum\">\"So you're absolutely sure that <i>this</i> is where you had encountered Celebi?\"</span> Domino asked you. You replied that you were one-hundred percent positive that this was the exact spot that Celebi had shrunk you down, and after Domino gave you what looked like an intense glare she reached for a black tulip she had hidden behind her back. You observed as she pressed an almost invisible button on it and watched as it grew several feet long, and you could see Domino plant the false tulip into the ground to watch extra appendages spring out from it. They took root into the ground and the black petals of the object crackled with weird energy. A multicolored aura soon sparked to life around the petals but not much else seemed to occur. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Hmm\u2026 Well, from what I can see, there was clearly some sort of psychic power at work here, but I'm not getting any strong readings in any direction. You\u2014keep watch of the area while I look at this more closely.\"</span> Domino's hand pushed your waist above her thumb and index finger to allow you a little more movement but kept her grip tight on your legs to keep you from escaping. Sighing quiet enough so Domino couldn't hear it, you responded with \"Yes, Miss Domino\" and did your part. It wasn't too long, however, that after peering into some trees you caught the sight of the target pokemon; Celebi was hiding in between some trees in a way that would make it difficult to spot right away, but by pure chance you managed to spot it eating some berries. Looking back at the device Domino pulled out, it still wasn't giving any indication that a pokemon was in the direction you found Celebi\u2014likely due to Celebi hiding its power from predators perhaps. This gave you a bit of pause at what to do next: you could just tell Domino that you found the pokemon and direct her to it, but then you briefly remembered that you were in the hands of a Team Rocket operative\u2014an elite one even. For all you knew Domino could easily dispose of you afterward since by then you would no longer be of any practical use to her despite her declaring to make you her \"little helper\", and you clearly wanted to make it out of this ordeal alive and well as well as back to your own size again. You didn't have much time to decide before Celebi decided to leave the area, so you knew you had to make your next decision quick and make it count.<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Interrogate the little victim of Celebi, of course, to discover the location of the legendary, make sure it stayed where it was (at a safety distance, of course!) and wait for backup to come and capture it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the little man she found... he was going to make a great pet or plaything, whatever she preferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, the blonde girl decided to play it dumb for a little while longer; that way, she quickly figured, it'd be way too easy to obtain the answers she was seeking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she revealed herself to the little guy now, he'd be scared and would probably lie to her... not that she couldn't make him talk anyway, but figured it'd be still easier if he was unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, adopting an innocent grin on her face, Domino made her way back to the camp and, more specifically, on the stump where she had left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, upon reaching her destination, the look of fake confusion she wore became one of actual confusion and one big question formed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt afraid. Very afraid. Afraid for your life, which was literally in the hands of the giant currently holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had found you again and was back to finish the job? It wanted to got with you like the doll you looked like?... It wanted to grow you back to your original size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never found an answer to these questions, because the green titan that had snatched you from the camp where Domino left you suddenly stopped its flight to lay its eyes down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Biii...</span>\" the Celebi mumbled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know the pokemon, but the Celebi recognized you much like you recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, this female Celebi was wandering through her forest when she had bumped into some random human - you - who knocked her back by accident, startling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when said human reached out for her, muttering an apology, she was quick to shrink you down to size with a recently developed power before fleeing, leaving the human to fend for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after wandering around for a bit more, she found you again, sitting on a stump all by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking you by surprise, the giantess had quickly scooped you up before leaving the camp where you were waiting for Domino's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bii...</span>\" the green titan muttered again, causing you to gulp in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now...\" you stuttered, cursing your not-so-firm tone,<br>\r\n\"D-Don't do anything you might regret. I d-didn't mean to scare you earlier. So please, just grow me back and I'll leave you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi cocked her head, taking in the flow of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fairy simply ignored you and went to sit down at the foot of a tree, wanting to examine her little victim from up close.  After all, it was not every day a pokemon got to hold a tiny human in their hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like some sort of role reversal, given how humans usually treated pokemon like pets, keeping them in those weird, dual-colored spheres of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin crawled across the Celebi's face - maybe she could do just that to this little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, keeping a human as a pet seemed not only intriguing, but enticing too: a tiny companion who could possibly escape her and would join her during her occasional trip through the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the unknown green titan pondered what to do with her latest catch, you were left staring at her in absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scenarios were much scarier than the ones she was thinking about; she could easily eat you, crush you like an ant, snap your body in half like it was nothing more than a twig fallen from a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were thousands ways this relatively little pokemon could make you suffer in, and you were completely powerless to stop whatever thing she wanted to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... let me go...\" you tried begging, but the Celebi completely ignored you... or maybe she didn't, because the only response she offered was a low giggle which made you understand what she was thinking about: no way she'd let you go, you were hers and hers alone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in fear, before remembering about the girl you met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sliver of hope penetrated your heart like a feeble light piercing a dark abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Domino return to her camp, noticing you weren't there anymore? Was she searching for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your hopes, Domino was actually searching for you, but not for the reasons you believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout you, she thought, she couldn't know the location of the Celebi. Afterwards, she could also crush you if so she wished, but for now you were necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she had to find you at all costs before Team Rocket agents showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that would take a while, allowing her to search for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was just as she searched for you that she spotted something green and small sitting against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart made a leap within her chest as she rushed behind a tree several feet away from the Celebi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Bi?</span>\" the legendary cries softly, having heard a noise; but, seeing no one, the small legend turned her attention to her own paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomino peered from behind the tree; she had found Celebi! The little guy wasn't necessary anymore after all... too bad, she mused, she'd have loved to keep him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the disguised Team Rocket Elite only had to wait for the agents to come and help her catch the Celebi; she was a good fighter, but there was no way she could catch a legendary without pokemon or backup along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomino only had to make sure to not lose the Celebi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the small legend, she seemed to be holding on something, Domino noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that looked much like-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDomino had to choke back a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018thing\u2019 that Celebi was holding was actually the shrunken guy she had found earlier, and the very victim of Celebi himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Domino felt a strong urge to get out of her hiding spot and try to stun and catch the Celebi, and by extension the little guy, by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it'd be the equivalent of committing suicide, she quickly reminded herself... or maybe not?</span></div></div>",

Not really sure how you could mix it up... but instead it was a giant suburban house. Accompanied by a little garden out the front and a little path way below that. Your not really sure where you are exactly and as much as you want to go and inspect the house, maybe set up camp and live inside that house. But you really want to inspect and see who lives in the house. You don't want it to be a crazy person or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep waiting for someone, anyone to come to and eventually someone did. A Mr Mime! It came out and walked up to the door, setting everything up to start working on the garden. A watering can, some gloves and a little spade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMime Mime!\u201d It said as it looked like it was satisfied with what it did. Then suddenly you watch as another thing comes out of the house, this time human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman, with brown hair done into a ponytail, a beautiful face and a slender figure. \u201cThank you Mr Mime, you can go inside and relax now\u201d She said as the Pokemon enjoyed being thanked. She started to walk to the garden and started walking on, crouching down and humming to herself. The Mr Mime no longer being needed went back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl now by herself and you start questioning whether you should and get her attention. At first impression she just seemed like a nice normal woman, if not a little hot. You should get her attention but you don't know if you can trust her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more debating you decide to just go for it. Running up to her you plan to get her attention. You run pass the walkway right in front of her house and arrived just behind her. After a little marvelling at her size, you continued. The marvelling was expected figuring she's the biggest person you've seen yet. So far you've just seen on your small travels were some low leveled Pokemon, a couple bug trainers and a couple of Lass. You run up to her and start banging on her foot, planning to get her attention. Luckily for you she was wearing sandals so her foot as completely exposed and she was able to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down your way as she dropped the watering can from shock. She surely didn't expect to see a small man while gardening as you swallow something in your mouth. You've already made this deal, hopefully it will pay off and she will actually help you. She seems like a nice enough lady but you know that she can just peal that back and reveal she's nothing but a horrifying wench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that you've revealed yourself, you know you could do absolutely nothing if she decided to make you her little slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut will she though?</span></div></div>",

Thank You! Take your time miss!\u201d You say as you really feel like she's this nice. Score! You back up a bit as she grabs the watering can. With another look she got back to her garden, watering it as you wait. The way she crouched down gives you a good view of her rear, which you try to ignore. If she's really officially helping you, you don't want to tarnish it by peeping on her. Instead you just kept your eyes on the road, just incase someone came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one did. And after about 15 minutes Delia was finished, she left everything in there as she yelled out \u201cMr Mime! The Garden\u2019s finished. Can you please put away the tools while i go inside\u201d She didn't need to wait for her Pokemon to answer cause she knows he will do it. Looking down she saw you patiently waiting, reaching down she grabbed you. Her fingers surrounding you as you feel kind of uncomfortable being inside of her grip. She stands up and walks inside, holding you tight as you panic. You don't like being this high.\u2028\u2028Delia enter her room and you saw a pretty typical house, nothing out of the ordinary. Delia walk around before dropping you on the coffee table right in front of the couch, then she sat down on said couch. Crossing her legs as she relaxed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo (Your Name), will you tell me how you got that size\u201d She asked very curiously, leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up on the wood as you start talking to her, you tell her that you don't remember, well you remember not being this size but besides that its all a fog. How you got small? Why your near her house? Where your from? You know nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that sounds troubling\u201d She told you as she didn't know what to do \u201cWell if its anything, you can stay here with me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre... are you serious Miss Ketchum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, call me Delia\u201d She said modestly, although really liking the nickname \u201cand of course you can stay! In fact I'm glad to let you, i haven't had anyone stay with me since my son left for his big adventure. it will be nice to have company\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... so your a mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes i am, so you know when it comes to caring that i cant be beat\u201d She says nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Whatever you can cook up will be gourmet cuisine compared to that!\u201d As if you'd be able to eat much anyways. You'll live off table scraps if you can get your size back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked you over to the dining table. Nice dining table. She kept it pretty clean and tidy. Youre kinda scared of heights though, so youre a little reluctant about standing on it.<br>\r\nYou were almost spooked out by the short Mr. Mime helper polishing the hardwood (short to Delia, still frighteningly huge to you!).<br>\r\n\u201cOh!

He's very reliable and pretty much the only other companion I've got at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMiiiime...\u201d Mr. Mime scratched the back of his head and blushed with flattery. He didnt seem to notice the slight hint of sadness in her voice. But you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Delia walked down the hallway, you glanced over at the family photos. Among all of them were mostly of Delia herself and a black haired kid with a cap and the world's most determined smile. There was also one or two pictures of the kid and several of his friends. A brown skinned slanty eyed boy, a red haired tomboy carrying a togepi, a young brunette in red with a red bandana, a blue haired girl in a white beanie\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the photos you glanced at, one particular person was missing in all of them: The father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my son's room, the bedroom of the greatest pokemon trainer in Pallet Town!\u201d Delia broke your train of thought to show you a young boy's bedroom, \u201cit's normally not neat and tidy, but after he left, I've taken the liberty to keep it that way. Still\u2026 no matter how cleaned up I make it, it just feels so empty without him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou miss him, dont you?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cDoesnt every mother?\u201d she sighs, \u201cbut I know he's doing fine. He's got plenty of friends looking out for him. Every time he comes by, he brings a brand new person traveling along side him.\u201d Good. Her darling boy sounds like he's doing pretty well for himself. Still, you cant help but think about the family photos. And what's missing in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, she brought you over to the next room. Another bedroom. This time a bit more mature looking\u2026 not counting the frilly pink drapes, the pikachu alarm clock, and the really cute Azumarill slippers aside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is my bedroom,\u201d she said with a bit less glee in her voice than earlier. And that was the entire description. Nothing else. Not even a single comment about how her alarm clock was modeled after her son's prized pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's\u2026 very nice,\u201d you say something to break the silence.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d but your titaness caretaker just wasnt in the mood for it. It's official. The dad is not present. Youre not sure whether you should ask about him to her out of worrying you might reopen old wounds that still havent properly healed yet. For now, it's best to keep your mouth shut until you could feel the appropriate time to ask about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you might as well attempt to fill the void that her son and missing husband left behind. Thinking THAT way, you start to feel less bad about checking out her ass earlier! Maybe she'd be flattered if she knew you appreciated her figure!<br>\r\nEr, anyways! Back on the subject!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, um\u2026. Delia?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, [Y/N]?\u201d you snap her out of her emotional silence.<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d you asked, \u201cwhere will I be sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia smiled again as she answered...</span></div></div>",

Very Hot!\u201d You say as you didn't like the sudden transition. Above Yellow took off her hat, planning to get naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gonna just swim there and perv on me\u201d She said to you as you turn around. You really shouldn't since she saw you naked and you were just about to have a bath with her but you couldn't help it. You stayed turned around when suddenly you feel the water start shifting around.

So you just settle for watching her from safety. You figured it would be best to see if it was deemed safe to do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just continued to collect many logs of different sizes. You continued to gawk at how her mighty body would subtly flex and shift as she carried each log to the pile with shockingly little effort. When there were no more logs and she appeared to be finished with her activity, the older version of Hapu sat down near the pile and shut her eyes, apparently falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured this was as good a time as any and slowly came out of the bush. You took a moment to just look at Hapu. Despite this woman\u2019s\u2026.<b><u><i>everything</i></u></b>, she had a soft and gentle looking face that had subtle hints of retained youthfulness. You looked around quickly, seeing if anyone or thing else was around. Upon seeing nothing else, you sighed as an urge grew in you. This woman is beckoning you like Carnivine would to a bug pokemon. The risks of this were screaming in your face. Hell, even by your most concervstive estimate, she easily towers over your normal size. Aside from that, her incredible build and prior feats of strength make it clear that this woman could also quite easily break you in many ways even when you were At normal size. But still\u2026you have to do this. You NEED to do this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the shrunken person, Hapu always knew that you were watching her. She had previously seen similar expressions like the ones on that that bright girl and those young ruffians she encountered at Akala. She never knew why people often give her that look. But something is...<i>different</i> about this one. He seemed to be up to some type of mischief. So her right eye cracked slightly open as she subtly stared at you with a mixture of curiosity, naivety, and a strange stern playfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her very sweaty body and sighed. She must have been working hard all day and was intently sleeping or resting. She didn\u2019t seem to be reacting to anything so you assumed it would be safe for you\u2026hopefully. Your eyes locked on her huge feet. They were so imposing and massive, but they also are the closest and easiest for you to..to..um \"explore\".

First of all her muscle structure was a lot more apparant close up than it was from far away. You suppose it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising by now, and yet actually seeing it up close was enough to make you pause. The other thing that hit you was the effects of her hard labor. This girl was coated in a pretty thick layer of sweat from both her work and the hot tropical sun bearing down on her as she did. You really hoped this girl kept hydrated given how much was caking her skin and clothes. A powerful smell was also radiating from the hardworking titan. Although it wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant, you could not deny how potent this mighty salty stench which you would compare to a dry fish left out in the sun. As you got closer to her soles, a cheesy scent was added to the vinegary mix. Your eyes and nose seemed to burn as you got next to her. And yet... part of you found her rank cocktail of musk and odor to be... oddly appealing. \u2018God what was wrong with you?\u2019 Flashed in your head for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the sleeping giant. Her body, her smell, her power, her subtle motions all seems to once again call out to you, trying to draw you in.

It feels oddly very soft with few very hard but smooth patches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHapu gained a small blush on her stony face. This is the first time she has ever gotten one of them fancy \"foot rubs\".

You just silently awaited for his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I'm <i>very</i> flattered by your looking...\" Hapu reassured to the tiny guy with the tone of stern mother.
