Jogging down the empty hallway she knew her homeroom teacher Mrs. Sanchez was going to write her up. She never needed an excuse regardless. nearing her class room Mariah felt a tickle at the back of her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively she reaches back and swatted what she presumed to be a bug. Unfortunately she was right. As her hand landed the unknown bug bit down on her skin. \"Ouch!\" She hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug bite burned horribly, worse than anything Mariah felt before. Breaking out into an immediate swear Mariah felt like passing out. Her legs wobbled as she was forced to hold onto the lockers for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to move down the hall and into the girl's restroom. Sliding into a stall Mariah slumped down over the toilet with the urge to puke, but not the ability. Despite the unsanitary nature Mariah rested her head on the cool toilet seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body began to tingle as if a million ants were walking across her skin. She tried to push back to a kneeling position, but failed. Unable to keep her eyes open Mariah passed out on the restroom floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as she passed out Mariah popped back awake. She felt so strange, and realized the entire world looked strange. To her horror she had some how turned into.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am not a roach!\" She screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protests Mariah now had the form a small german cockroach. Her body was long, flat, with three legs protruding from each side of her abdomen. Mandibles replaced her once pouty lips. Long Antennae rose from the top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking frantically around the restroom floor Mariah realized her clothes were missing. She wondered if they somehow transformed with her. She didn't begin to understand how that was even possible. Thought five minutes prior she would have thought turning into a roach was impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. How am I going to get help ?\" She asked herself outloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to stay a bug forever. She hoped that somewhere, someone knew this happened to her. That there was some way of turning back Into a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, calm down Mariah. You can figure this out.\" She said trying to give herself a pep talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that her first action had to be leaving the restroom Mariah start moving towards the door. As she approached the towering door she felt tremors running through the ground. A moment later the door swung open as......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
