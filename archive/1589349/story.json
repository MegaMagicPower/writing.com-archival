As you stare at the picture, it brings a smile to your face and then tears to your eyes. You still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had been dating for about a year. She was your best friend and first love. Then, she died in a car accident a few weeks ago, and your heart has been breaking over and over ever since. However, you\u2019re even more worried about her family. Her mom, Dawn, lives with Emily, Megan\u2019s sister. On the other hand, her dad is by himself now, since Megan lived with him. So, you\u2019ve decided that you're going to go stay with him for a while, to keep him company. Your parents accepted your idea, happy that you were willing to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name is Tony and he has always liked you. He\u2019s usually a pretty fun, laid back guy, but ever since the accident he just hasn\u2019t been the same. He doesn\u2019t smile, he doesn\u2019t laugh, and he hasn\u2019t been to work since it happened. You\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re going to do yet but hopefully some company will make him feel better. With that in mind, you wipe the tears from your eyes, put the picture away, and leave your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He smiles and instinctively looked to the passenger\u2019s seat, but his smile slowly fades to a disappointed grin as he sees that she was not there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he mutters, \"Yeah, that figures\". It was plain obvious how hard the loss was to him. He could only imagine how Megan's family must be feeling, given how Tony and Dawn were divorced. They probably felt like, if they weren't divorced, maybe things could have turned out better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he then changes the channel and continues driving down the road. Right now, it was in the dead of night, well after dinner. However, he felt that Tony needed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019d been there so many times that he could almost see her sitting there on the front porch waiting for him. However, after a few moments, he snaps out it and walks to the front door. He rings the doorbell but no one answers, to his surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with that?\" he asks himself. He then knocks on the door but still no reply. Looking around, he see's his truck so he knows he\u2019s home. He then tries the doorknob and notices that it is unlocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks inside and can hear the TV playing in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tony, you in here?\u201d he says, hoping for an answer. He hears someone bumping around in the living room. With that in mind, he follows the sound to see Tony sitting on the couch looking through a photo album. He doesn\u2019t notice Alex, almost like he\u2019s in a daze. Alex lays his stuff on the floor, and walks over to sit down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Smith?\" Alex asks as gently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony's eyes widen and he snaps out of it, like he was waking up from a dream. He then turns to Alex and gives as small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Alex. I didn\u2019t hear you come in\u201d he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiles and responds, \u201cIts cool, the door was unlocked. How you been?\u201d He gives a weary sigh, and looks down at the pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I guess. Just hanging around the house\u201d he says. Alex then looks down at the pictures. He could tell that Megan was included extensively in these photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure go ahead\u201d he says as he hands the book to Alex. There were pictures of Megan when she was five or six. He smiles and laughs to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she was so cute. Where was this?\u201d he asks, pointing to a specific picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was when we went to the mountains\u201d he says with a smile, making Alex smile as well. It was good to see him smile again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d he asks, pointing to another one <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that was her eighth birthday party\u201d he resplies, still smiling as he was going through the memories of his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this one?\u201d Alex asks again. The two of them ended going through the entire book, talking and laughing. Well, Alex was laughing; Tony was smiling and occasionally chuckling to himself. It was an improvement over the more recent days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turns to Alex and says, \u201cHey, thanks for this. I know everyone\u2019s worried about me. I\u2019m actually kind of worried about myself. I just can\u2019t believe she's gone. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll never get to see her again. I\u2019ll never get to talk to her again.\u201d He was acting as though he was about to cry. Then, he turned up to Alex and said, \"but having you here makes me feel better. It means alot, Alex\u201d. Alex smiles and put his hand on Tony's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for\u201d Alex says to him. He smiles and lets out a loud yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what time is it?\" he asks as Alex looks up at the clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, its already 12:30\" Alex says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it\u2019s been fun, but I\u2019m going to try to get some sleep. Good night\" he says as he walks to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night\" Alex says as he lays down on the couch and goes to sleep. He felt happy that he was able to make Tony feel at least a little better about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hopefully, there will more that I can do' he thought to himself as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just feel like everything is my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to say something, but he puts a hand up and says \"Please Alex, let me finish. Things were so good for a while, we where a happy family, just the four of us. But things when downhill really fast. The divorce ending up being really ugly. In the end I wanted nothing to do with Dawn and Megan, since Megan was always Dawns favorite. I got Emily in the custody hearing, she got Megan, and after that I broke all ties with either one of them. I thought I didn't need either of them in my life, and I am so ashamed to admit that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen carefully, remember that when you first met Megan she was living at her mothers house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the longest time, whenever Megan would mention \"Her family\", she was just referring to herself and Dawn, since she never saw either of me or Emily. Eventually, Dawn wanted to move to California to start over, which Megan was admittedly against. By this point I had began to feel sorry about how I treated Megan through all of this, and I wanted a second chance. Me and Dawn came to an agreement were she would get Emily and go to California, and I would stay here with Megan. The switch went without a problem. However, Megan still didn't see me as part of her family. To her, the only people in her family were herself and her mother. It was not uncommon for her to refer to the four of us as \"my family, Tony and Emily\". I knew it would take time but I wanted her to think of me as part of her family again and to call me Dad again. And our relationship was steadily improving, especially when you would come over. But then the accident...\" he begins to trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks sadly at you, \"Listen, I didn't want anyone to know about this, but when Dawn moved to California, she went crazy. She began to neglect her responsibilities as a mother, unable to hold a steady job and spending all of her nights partying. There were rumors she was involved in heavy drug use. Then one day she went out and never came back. Police don't know what happened, but she is still missing. Emily was sent to live with Dawn's parents. I tried to get custody of her, but they refused to have anything to do with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fall from his face as he says \"Theres no hope of our family getting back together. I thought I didn't need Dawn or Megan, but I miss them more than anything right now. I just want my wife and daughter back. I would do anything to have Dawn and Megan in this house again. Anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I need to be alone\" Tony says, as he leaves the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned of all the revelations, you do the only thing you can do: finish breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to give Tony his space and spend the rest of the day at your friends house. You go back into the house later that evening and fall asleep on the couch.</span></div></div>",

I can only communicate with you, but I can't change you physically in any way. Those sensations were just the effects of me establishing a connection to you, not changing you in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" she says more seriously, \"I still need you to take my place. I need you to dress like me, look like me, act like me, BE me in any way possible. I want you to be me to the best of your abilities. I want Alex to go away eventually so that Megan will walk the earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her ghostly appearance, you say, \"Megan, I love you, and I know I said I would do anything to make you happy. But leaving my life behind and start living as a girl, living as you, is too much to ask. I just can't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \"You say that you can't do it now, but don't worry. I have a plan that will make you much more susceptible to the idea over time. Eventually you yourself will make the decision to live life as me and believe it is the best choice possible. You have the whole summer to get to that point. My family is going to be healed and happy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to remember what Tony said earlier. \"By family, do you mean the four of you or just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuts you off. \"Oh yes, when I say family I am still referring to just me and my mommy. I like Emily but I never saw her that often, and things between me and Tony are well, complicated. Perhaps if I had lived I would have thought of him as my father again, but right now I only consider my family to be me and my mommy. And soon we are going to be a family again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you exclaim. \"Your dad says your mom was missing and no one could find her. There is a good chance she is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfazed, Megan says \"Dawn, my mommy, will come back in this house. She may not be in the same body, but she is coming back, without a doubt.  <br>\r\nAnd once she is back, you'll want to live as me so that I'll come back. And then Dawn and Megan, mother and daughter, the only people I consider my family, will be living in this house again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and says, \"I have to go now. Don't worry, everything will become clear very soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel tried and fall back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Before he could say anything, he found himself back in Megan's bedroom.  As Alex looked around to get his bearings, his tucked a loose piece of hair behind his ear just like Megan used to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex walked back downstairs to the kitchen a short time later; having put on a skirt and top with a pair of flip flops.  He'd also put on a little makeup and placed his hair in a pony tail.  Tony was sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee; looking up as Alex walked into the room.  Catching a glimpse of Alex's outfit, Tony said, \"Alex, why are you wearing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Tony, in the same way that Megan used to speak, Alex said, \"I'm not Alex anymore...dad; I'm Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you talking about?\" looking at Alex, Tony said, \"Did you just call me dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex quickly explained everything that'd happened while in Megan's room; keeping an eye on the time.  Once he was finished, Alex said, \"For all intents and purposes, I'm Megan now; I've got her personality and all of her memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see if I understand this.\" Pausing, Tony said, \"You sacrificed your life in order to fulfill Megan's...destiny; only you don't know what that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Getting up, Alex said, \"I'd love to explain it some more; but I've only got a little while to say goodbye to Alex's...err my family before they cease to remember that he...I'm still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex quietly walked out of the kitchen; leaving Tony to watch as he left.  As he watched, Tony couldn't help but see that Alex was already adjusting to Megan's mannerisms and the way she walked.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, his thoughts came back and he realized that he still had Megan\u2019s body. He slowly grabbed between his legs and confirm that nothing is there anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? And why am I in Megan\u2019s body?\" Alex thinks to yourself. Confused and hoping that this is all some twisted dream, he gets in the bed and goes back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sleeps another full night and, as he wakes up the next morning, he looks in the mirror and gets the confirmation that it wasn\u2019t a dream. He is still Megan. Sighing, he quietly headed down stairs, not sure what is going on or how people will react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Megan\u201d he hears. It was Dawn, Megan\u2019s mother. However, this confused Alex. She doesn\u2019t live here. Megan\u2019s parents were divorced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh morning...\u201d he replies, walking into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want for breakfast?\u201d asked Dawn. Alex was about to say a bagel, his favorite, but then he suddenly started thinking about trying something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI'll just have some Cheerio\u2019s\" he says. As he sits down at the table, he remembers that Cheerio\u2019s were Megan's favorite cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, box is on the table\" says Dawn. Alex pours himself a bowl and, oddly enough, they taste better than he ever remembered them tasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finishes, he tries to decide what to do about all this. For some reason, Dawn is here and she wasn\u2019t surprised to see you. Did she have something to do with this or does she really think Megan is still alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the kitchen wall phone rings. Alex answers it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he asks. A woman's voice speaks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Megan. It's Aunt Maxine. How are you today?\" said the voice. Alex paused for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I am fine, Aunt Maxine... How are you?\" he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay sweetie? You sound strange\" said Aunt Maxine.</span></div></div>",

It was nothing dangerous, as he instantly regained control of his car. However, something felt different. It was like his body was tingling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" he asked himself, to no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps driving but something was still off. Alex couldn't put his finger on it, but he just knew that something was way off. Then, he notices that the steering-wheel cover was different. Actually, to make things wierd, Alex never used a wheel cover before. This cover was violet in color, which happened to be what Megan had in her car. However, Alex didn't really make a connection between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he didn't think much of the cover when he realised something else. His hands were different, as they looked a little softer than usual with the fingers being a little longer now. A little confused, he looked around and noticed that the whole car had changed. It had changed to a black Dodge Charger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex started to freak out and slam on the breaks, which caused a long strand of hair to fall in to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed his hair to the side, wondering how he knew how to do that by instinct. He took a deep breath and looked down to see two soft mounds on your chest. A lovely pair of C-cup breasts forming underneath a violet tank top. Feeling some off restraints on your chest and shoulders, he knew that there was a bra on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking further down, he saw a wide pair of hips with a pleasantly big rear on the seat. Both were clad in a tight pair of jean shorts. Looking further down a pair of smooth legs, were Alex's feet. They were smaller now and clad in a normal pair of white socks and dark blue tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex then looked into the rear view mirror and saw Megan staring back at him. He was in Megan\u2019s car, and in her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What just happened?!\" he yelled, perfectly in Megan's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart started beating faster and faster as a million thoughts run through his mind. Suddenly, he heard a phone ringing. He looked around the car and saw that it was coming from her purse. Tentatively, he then reached in and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he was afraid to answer, but then he looked and saw that it was Tony. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do I know if you are 'Alex?'\" You whisper, frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He sighs again before speaking. \"I used to wet the bed around 4 through 5, I used to watch Naruto up until I was 8.

You again after a few seconds realize what you are doing and blush as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry me, or you. This is confusing!\" You rage, annoyed with the circumstances. He stares at you. \"So you are telling me you, I mean Megan was dead, you were coming here, then the car changed and now you see me, or you? This is hard to believe but I guess I will trust you, or I mean me. Let's just call you Megan and I, Alex because this is confusing.\" He says frowning and unknowingly your hands move to hug him. His face in your chest as you play with his hair, like how Megan used to do with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few minutes, you regain control and jerk back, blushing heavily. \"Sorry... this body is just strange...\" You say, turning your head to hide the embarrassment from yourself. He chuckles and grabs your hand and leans you in. \"I'm sorry Alex but I can't see you as me. I only see my lover although you do act like me too.\" He whispers in your ear and your cheeks are coated red with embarrassment. You push him off. \"W-well, I see you as me! A-and its not my fault this body reacts w-weirdly!\" You shout and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, you feel something weird happening down there. 'Please no' you think. You hold your stomach and moan. 'This is unbearable!' you want to shout but you calm yourself. You try to move but you fall and Alex catches you. \"Are you okay? Did it start?\" He says worriedly and you nod. \"T-this is embarrassing but could you perhaps carry me to the bathroom?\" You pleaded and he nods and picks you up bridal style. \"C-can't you carry me normally you idiot!\" You shout, red all over again. You felt like a girl. Well you were one at the moment. You hide your face embarrassed. He chuckles and you have the urge to kick him but it hurted to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Never experiencing this before, you felt so horrid. Your eyes started watering and you started crying. You missed her and it hurt more and more every second being in her room. He pet your head as you covered your face with your hands, those tiny hands that looked like hers. You sobbed her name and cried even more. \"It's okay Alex, it's okay. How about I bring you Caramel ice cream and some jalapeno chips?\" He says softly and you nod, trying to wipe the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You reach the bathroom and he puts you down. You wait for him to leave and sit on the toilet. Your stomach ached as you bend to put on the pad. After doing it to Megan when she once had terrible cramps, it was pretty easy to put on. You used the toilet then flushed. Slowly getting up, you pulled the clothes back up and washed your hands. He opened the door and picked you back up to the bedroom and placed you on the bed. On the food tray was some ice cream and chips. You smile softly and say thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the Tv he puts on \"...\" and sits down with you as you both watch it together slowly.

Since you can\u2019t sleep you switch it on and are happy that you can go in the internet as well, you are not looking for anything in particular, but see your surfing as a killing of time, and you think it is better than nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure that Tony would have nothing against it that you will surf the internet and use her old notebook. As you attempt to check your emails when the screen suddenly begins to flicker uncontrolled and you think, \"Damn, I see why she bought a new one, this one here is broken!\u201d you shout at the computer\u2026. <br>\r\nBut then it opens some strange webpage\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this seems to be the last website that Megan was on before she replaced her notebook which was just a few days before her terrible accident. The page you now looking at is actually an online female clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally you think, \"This seems interesting. I should look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to look through the website you find that you actually really like a few of the dresses. Not realizing that they are the type of dresses that Megan always liked to wear. All of a sudden the phone rings. You pick it up the phone, which is right next to the computer, and says, \"Hello\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's voice speaks up, \"Oh, hey Alex. It's Karen! I need to see you ASAP!\u201d and she sounds worried. Alex was now really tired and told Karen, that the first thing he will do after some rest is to meet her tomorrow\u2026.? And they agreed to meet at 8.00 in the local park nearby.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm only here by request to see if you wanted to do something for me\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything Megan, There's nothing I wouldn't do for you\" you say, which brought a smile to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet of you. It's also what I feared you'd say\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, there was a mistake\u2026 It was not my time, so I still have unfinished business on earth.\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So you can come back? What's the problem then?\" you ask. Megan looked you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't come back myself. Once a soul has crossed over it is unable to return in physical form, so someone has to take my place, to \"fill my shoes\" so to speak. And you have been chosen to fulfill my destiny\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked in confusion. \"What do you mean by that I would \"fill your shoes\"?\" you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that you would become me and do what I was supposed to. However, I don't want to curse you with my life, I don\u2019t know how long it would be or what I am supposed to do. You've been so kind to me. I had hoped that one day; you would become part of my family. However, I didn't want it to be like this\" said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought about it. It was stunning. Megan could come back but he would have to become her and live her life. He didn't have to do it. Then again, he wanted to help the Smiths as much as possible. He even said that they could think of you as her to make them feel better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You say goodnight to Megan's family and begin heading to her bedroom. As you do so you begin to think about the past couple of summers. Even when her parents were divorced Megan's family always decided to spend summers together in the beach house. You would often travel over yourself for a week or two each summer. You remember always having a great time. Her family always included you in their activities when you were there. Todd enjoyed having another male in the house to talk guy stuff, watch football and he even included you in the poker games he would often have with his buddies that lived in the area. And you spent every other moment with Megan. You shed a tear as you remember the dates you shared, riding bikes along the countryside, holding hands walking the beach, and of course the end of summer formal held at the town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach her room and notice how strange it looks, devoid of anything that was Megan's. You assume that her family has her stuff put away in the attic. Still, you can somehow still detect her presence, like she is still here somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your PJ's and get in bed.

You hope that your suggestion to have them think of you as Megan will cause them to cheer up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for them throughout the day for them to start treating you differently, like if you were Megan. However, that never happens. Instead, as the day passes they continue to treat you like they always had, like when Megan was still alive. As the day ends you realize that they aren't following your suggestion. You decide they are still trying to get used to the situation, and that eventually they will begin treating you like their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept two weeks goes by and nothing changes. The family treats you like regular old Alex, like they have been doing ever since they have known you. You manage to keep yourself preoccupied during this time, but you begin to grow frustrated that they have not done what you asked them to do. You notice that they begin to act more and more depressed around the house, even poor little Emily. Eventually, it was decided that Emily should spend a month at her paternal grandparents house just to get her out of that house and away from all of the memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride along with the family as they take Emily to her grandparents house. After they drop her off, you begin to ride back home. During the ride back you can no longer contain your frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I've know we've been through a lot\" you say with concern \"But why haven't you been doing what I've asked you to. I asked you all to treat me just like Megan, and you just treated me like you've always have. You know it would make you feel much better about everything, so why haven't you done that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looks back at you with a sad expression. \"Look Alex,\" she says, \"We really appreciate your offer. But we just can't look at you and start treating you like someone else. We've known you for years as Megan's boyfriend, and its hard for us to start looking at you differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn is right,\" Tony says from behind the wheel \"I just can't treat anyone like my little princess. Megan had so many things that made her her-the may she acted, moved, talked-that I just can't take anyone and treat him like Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that they are beginning to get upset so you decide to leave the subject alone for now. But you know that Dawn and Tony really need to treat you like their late daughter. You've seen how gloomy they both have gotten, their spark of life is gone. This may be the only way to get it back.

By late evening there's only one room left, the room you've both been quietly avoiding for the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the end there's no avoiding it...you both know what needs to be done and, without a word being spoken, you set off up the stairs together. When you push open the door to Megan's room you're surprised how serene it looks. You don't know what you'd been expecting but somehow it comes as a surprise to see everything laid out just the same as it was when you were last here. Being in this room again you can almost believe that you could turn around to see her coming through the door behind you, like nothing was wrong at all. But the only person beside you is her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my poor Mei Gan\" he whispers under his breath. He looks like he's only just holding back tears. \"I'll do it\" you say. He hesitates for a moment before nodding his approval and leaving the room. You feel like you could stand here forever, just staring back into the past. You felt like you loved her but you can hardly imagine how much worse it must be for her father. You decide that it's best just to bite the bullet, get this over with quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly you shuffle into the room, the empty cardboard box trailing from one hand. You gaze at the photos plastered on her wall, photos of her family which will never be whole again, photos of her with friends at the Southern Ridges and of course photos of the two of you together. You'd known she'd be going back home with her dad in a few months but the two of you had agreed that this was worth preserving. \"We'll stay in touch\" she'd said \"there's the net, you can come visit me in Singapore once your year's over and, if you're feeling really romantic, you could even write me a letter!\" she laughed. No letter will reach her where she is now though. You take down the photos one by one, trying not to examine them too closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stack up all the papers scattered across her desk and drop them in the corner of the packing box. All the odds and ends go in there too, the accruements of a lifetime. A huge life crammed into this tiny box. Finally you go to the wardrobe and begin to load her clothes into the box, this at least, can be done quickly you think as you sweep them all up together. As you drop the bundle into the moving container you hear a dull thud as something falls out and strikes the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down you realize it's a diary. Carefully opening the clasp you flick through the record of your girlfriends last year on this earth. A substantial mass of the journal is in dialect but there's some English in there too. You begin to read one of the entries made in her last few days before the accident.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe there's nothing to the rumors, they seemed happy. Went to see The Kingdom and ate at the food court after. Jess and I decided to go out to Selton on the long weekend. Still a bit worried for her so will be nice to get some time alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subsequent scrawls are unreadable. You're tempted to continue in search of more English language entries but times short so instead you grab the box and journal and head downstairs. As you step onto the ground floor you see Megan's father slumped down in one of the armchairs, his eyes are closed and breathing shallow. You don't know why, but in that split second before he lifts his head, a single terrible impulse flashes through your mind. He's dead your thoughts silently scream before they can be rebuked. But no, he opens his eyes again to stare into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry I must have dozed off\" he says, blinking slowly in the evening light. His gaze drifts down to the box in your arms. \"So that's it?\" he asks. \"Yep, last box\" you reply. He pulls himself up from the chair and takes the final box from your arms. Together you walk to the back of the moving truck in silence before he slides those last remnants of his daughter\u2019s life into the back amongst the property of the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for everything\" he says \"I really mean that, my...my daughter\" he pauses for a moment, slowly searching his mind for the right words \"I know that my daughter was very lonely here before you came along. I want to thank you for everything you did\u201d. He said \"I didn't do anything\" you murmur, not quite sure how to respond to this \"I mean, it was a pleasure to be able to spend time with both of you.\" He smiles for a split second and the awkwardness of the moment is broken. \"Well my plane leaves in a couple of hours so I'd better get on the road\" he exclaims, clapping you on the shoulder \"Be sure to stay in touch\". You wave him off as he climbs up into the cab and starts the ignition. As the truck disappears around the corner you're left standing in front of the now deserted house feeling very alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night you lay awake in bed reminiscing. You think back over the past two years, all the ups and downs, the joy and the pain. Once you open yourself to one memory it leads to another and then another. They flow onwards in a never-ending procession. You think that it would be easy enough to go insane on a night like this. They torture you, but at the same time a part of you doesn't want to let these memory's go, to forget even the slightest detail of Megan's life would seem to be the ultimate betrayal. After tossing and turning for a few hours you know you can't go on like this. You climb out of bed to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A less responsible women would have ended up partying all the time and getting into the drug scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex goes on his walk, taking in the scenery around him. All he can think about, though, is breakfast. Why did he have Cherrios today? He always had a bagel for breakfast. What made him suddenly change his mind? He realized that they were Megan's fav breakfast item. Good lord, was he being altered in some way? Was Megan's ghost still in the house and trying to change him into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was no need for him to have these thoughts. They were very silly thoughts. In this storyline, this universe, there are no such things as ghosts. People cannot be changed physically or mentally by supernatural forces. Everything is their decision. Nothing supernatural made Alex do what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to his senses, Alex begins to think again. He knew that Megan loved Cheerios. He must have saw them on the counter and they reminded him of her. So the reason he decided to eat Cheerios was so that he could feel closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered how much he had liked them and how he wanted to have them more often. He felt really happy while he was eating them. He remembered after Megan died, he had been in a funk and couldn't seem to come out of it. Even agreeing to accompany Tony on this trip didn't fully bring him out of this mood. Eating the cereal was the first time in a while he felt truly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped dead in his tracks. He suddenly realized he was happy because he was doing something that Megan did instead of himself. He knew what this meant. It meant doing things that Megan would do made him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what to do with this realization. But he had to speak with someone about it.</span></div></div>",

I was happier than I had been in a long time. Then I realized that they were Megans fav breakfast food, and that by eating them I was doing something Megan would normally do instead of myself. And I could only come to one conclusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That for some reason doing things that Megan would do makes me happy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn pauses for a moment, then gives Alex a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her, he says \"You don't think thats weird? I've always been fine being a boy. Now I'm probably getting enjoyment out of things that Megan, a girl, would do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no dear\" she says, \"This is all perfectly natural\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't take a genius to see that you two deeply cared about each other. Most love I see between two young adults is simply puppy love, sweet but not made to last. You and Megan I could see had something deeper. This was true love. I could definitely see her as soulmates, meant to get married someday. And when she died, a part of you died as well. I could see that when you arrived at the house. Inside you are yearing to be with Megan again, trying to find someway to feel close to her again. So its no surprise you wanted Cheerios today. They made you feel close to her, and when you ate them, something that Megan always did, you felt really close to her. Thats why you were so happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt a little better. \"I can see your point, but what should I do now? Do you thing I should stop this before it gets out of hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gets a puzzled look on her face. \"Now why would you want to do that? Why would you stop doing something that makes you happy. No, I don't think you should stop this. In fact,\" she says with a grin, \"I think we should take it to the other extreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex now is puzzled. \"Other extreme? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stands up \"Think about it. You're in a place were no one really knows you as Alex. We can safely assume that everytime you do something that Megan would do you are going to feel happier since her death. So why not take it all the way? Why not spend summer doing <i>everything</i> that Megan would have done? Why not spend the summer being Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stands up in shock. \"BE Megan, are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know its going to be a big change\" Dawn says, \"Spending the next couple of months living as a girl 24/7. But think about how good you felt when you were eating those Cheerios. What if you could feel that way all the time over the summer and not be in that funk anymore. Wouldn't that be wonderful? And don't worry, I'm fully certain that Tony and Emily will be supportive about this, as well as anyone else we tells. This is a way to feel close to Megan once again, to have her in your life again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's head was spinning. Spend summer as a girl, as Megan? This would be a big change, every part of his life would be different. On the other hand, he couldn't deny that eating like Megan made him feel better than he did in months. It would be wonderful to feel that way all the time, and to have Megan in his life for the summer, even if he had to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a bit nervous about this\" Alex said, \"But lets just do it and see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid!\" Dawn says happily. \"You won't regret this. Now we have alot of work to do today. We need to go upstairs and run you a nice girly bubble bath to put you in the mood of being feminine all the time. Megan was such a girly girl. And during the bath we'll need to shave all the nasty boy hair off your body. Megan would die before she showed any body hair! Then we'll go to one of Megan favorite salons down here, and have your hair, nails,<br>\r\ntoes, and eyebrows done so they are exactly like Megans, and we'll even have then do a makeup makeover so that you can get used to having a girls face. Then we'll come back home and I'll dress you in one of Megans favorite outfits, including the underwear, shoes, jewelry and accessories before we introduce Tony and Emily to the new Megan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever needs to be done to make sure that I'm happy\" Alex replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you will!\" says Dawn. \"You are going to have such a fun summer. You are going to do so many of Megan' favorite things, including shopping, salon days, girls nights out, chick flicks, sleepovers and more. And lets not forget about the formal at the end of the summer! You know how much Megan loved that! I just can imagine how beautiful you'll look in your gown! Well, lets get upstairs, run your bath and start your new girly life!\"</span></div></div>",

He first puts on a pair of gray sweatpants which are a little big (especially around the hips and butt) but strangely fit. Then, he sees a black workout bra, he then rolls his eyes and leaves it in the bag, he finished with a tight white shirt. Satisfied, he exits the changing room to meet Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so, Alex and Karen do various workouts. Strangely though, on the weight machines, Alex had difficulty with what is usually easy for him. Both he and Karen couldn't figure out why but they went on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they have had enough, they return to the changing room. Inside, one of them asks the other a question?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho asks?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he did though, he started to change. First, he stripped off all of his current clothes. He went to the dresser and picked out some boxers. As he put them on and rested them on his waist, they turned pink and shrank into a pair of frilly panties. Inside, his penis disappeared and was replaced with a vagina. Then, he put on a black undershirt. With that, the sleeves disappeared and the hemline started to rise. The sleeves became a pair of straps while the bottom focused around his chest. A pair of C-cup breasts shot out of his chest, filling out the new pink frilly bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he put on some jean shorts. With that, his legs became smooth and slender. His hips shot out and locked in place while his butt inflated to a huge size. The leggins merged to form a short jean skirt. Next, he put on an overshirt. This one also turned pink and tightened against him. His stomach became slim and thrusted forward and his waist slimmed, giving him a perfect hourglass figure. His arms also became slender while his hands became delicate. His nails extended to an attractive length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put on his white socks, which then became pink ankle socks. Next, was his sneakers. They changed into a pair of white girls dress shoes and then a 3 inch heel appeared. Then, a pink headband appeared on his head. His brown hair grew out to his shoulders and turned black. His face softened to an older form of Emily's. His eyes turned from blue to green. A pair of diamond earrings appeared in his ears. </span></div></div>",

Tell Emily I love her.\" he says before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put down the phone and go to the living room to watch eat and eat your sandwich. You think about the fact that all of Megan's things are now in your garage. Again, it is kinda weird, but at the same time a part of you wants to sometime look through the boxes.

He's been a 'little' depressed. You get out your favorite videogame, the one with the aliens, and make him play it with you. Even though it seemed to lift his spirits it still seems like he could snap into a deep depression at any time. <br>\r\nIt ends up getting really late though, so you go to bed. And he has work tomorrow, after all, and you don't feel too excited about being down here by yourself, seems how you and Megan spent so much time together down here. Then you recalled the time you and her were making out for the first time on the couch. When that memory came to you, it was almost like a stab in the heart. <br>\r\n\"Night, John.\" said Tony. \"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to the guest room, and were about to go to sleep. But somehow you just couldn't let it go; you had to find something of hers for you to keep, because she never really gave you anything other than candy, and flowers. As funny and reversed as it seemed, it was an inside joke between you and her. You recall specifically telling her in a jokingly manner, \"Hey, I'm not that kind of guy! I'm quite old fashioned. If you ever want me to make out with you, you'd better get me some candy and flowers first.\" You smiled at that memory; even the thought of it brought tears to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up at the door to Megan's room. There are stickers on it, specifically one of her name and another of a dragon with a princess riding on it. The rest are silly little cartoon animals, for the most part. You grab the door knob and feel a chill go up your spine. You turn the knob and open the door; it seemed as if you had opened a portal to the past. Her room was exactly the same as the day she had left and gotten in the car accident, from the book on kitty cats to the shirt and jeans on the floor. The moon light gracefully entered her room and illuminated her dark blue bed. You walk in, trying to be quick about it though. As soon as you are in though, you see a letter on her desk that piques your interest. It appears to be the love letter you had first sent her to ask her out on a date back in 8th grade. You end up spending a few hours in there, and before you know it, you fell asleep...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You decide to get the heck out of there, but as soon as you jump off of the bed and try to start running, the door slams shut and you trip over something that moved in front of your foot and then disappeared. The room begins getting darker and you begin to get horrified out of your mind. You barely manage to gasp out \"What\u2019s going on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something begins to come out of the floor in the middle of the room. At first glance it appeared to glow white. When it fully came out of the floor, you noticed that it had a human form. A female, and upon closer look, you realized that it was your Megan. Even though she was glowing, she looked as if she was dull. With every passing second, she became less and less transparent until she might as well have been a living person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout out \"Megan! You're alive!\" She then lifts her head up and looks dead at you, and you are immediately thrown by an unseen force onto her bed. Then you are forced down. She looks angrily at you and says \"It's your fault I'm like this! You're the reason I'm DEAD!\" You respond \"Megan, how could you think that?!\" She responds \"Because, you were the one who was supposed to give me a ride, and maybe then I'd still be alive! I fell asleep at the wheel only because you kept me up all night because YOU WANTED ME TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR STUPID ISSUES!! YOU SHOULD BE DEAD NOT ME!\" It creeped you out when she yelled because she sounded just like a demon from the movies. Aside from that, you were appalled that Megan would ever say such a thing to you. Megan was very kind as a living person, and she loved everyone especially you. Your heart breaks. \"What do you want from me?\" you say. \"Your life would be fine.\" She scowls at you and her eyes turn completely black. \"I would do anything for you, so why do you hate me now?\" you whimper. Suddenly she turns completely regular looking and the force that is holding you down is lifted. \"Oh sweetie, I don't hate you at all. I'm not even mad.\" She says as you start to sit up. She gets really close to you and before you hug her, her eyes turn completely black again and the room turns cold. She smiles and says \"But I will make you pay for it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are both surprised that you would be willing to spend the entire summer with Tony. However, they know you get along well with him and that you were devoted to  <br>\r\nMegan, so they can understand it. Since all of your family members have pretty erratic schedules, you decide than rather to figure out some times for everyone to come together for you to visit, you will just spend the entire summer at Tony's and not come back home until after the summer is over. However, you will call every week to let them know that you are alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you spend the next few hours hanging out with some of your friends from around town. Although Tony doesn't live too far away, he lives just out of the way enough that it would be a pain for your friends to constantly travel back and forth from their house towards Tony's. So you decide to spend time with them now because you won't be seeing them until after the summer ends. You try to make the most of your time with them, as you really don't know anybody were Tony lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it begins to get late, you realize that Tony will be coming home from work in the next couple of hours. You quickly go back to your house and pack all of your things into several boxes for the summer. You put them into your car before driving off towards Tony's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrive there you begin to bring all of your boxes into Megan's room. You bring the last box in just as you hear Tony come home from work.<br>\r\nYou are pleased when it seems that he is in good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening goes by pretty quickly. You help Tony make dinner as he tells you how his first day back at work went. After you eat, you once again spend several hours playing video games. Not wanting Tony to not get enough sleep, eventually you decide to go up to Megan's room for the rest of the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went up the stairs you planned to unpack, and put Megan's things in the closet so that you would have room for your own. However, once you enter your room, you decide not to do that. The room was exactly like it was the day she passed away. He didn't want to disturb it. He wanted to leave it the way it was for the time being, almost like a shrine to her memory. He decided to leave everything in the boxes for now. He then put on a pair of his pajamas, and fell asleep in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know too many people around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it time, you'll get to know the people around here. By the way, I noticed you still haven't unpacked yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and said \"Yeah, I know I need to, but not just yet. I want to keep her room the way it is, you know? It's kind of like a portal to the past, <br>\r\n like she is still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand John. I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to do. You can unpack whenever you feel ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tony. Say, you don't think that Megan's spirit is somehow still in her room, and that she was the one who made me decide to leave my things in the boxes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony finished his breakfast and stood up. \"John, my boy, I know its nice to thing that our dearly departed loved ones are still floating around us somehow. But that's all it is, a thought with no evidence to back it off. I know you may want to believe that Megan caused you to feel that way. But believe me, the decision not to unpack came from no one but yourself. You are the only one responsible for the decisions that you make. I gotta go, see you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tony left, you realize that was a silly question. You knew that deep down inside you knew it was you only that made that decision. You feel that if spirits existed, they wouldn't work that way. And although you don't know it, in this universe you are correct about that. Spirits can't effect you mentally or physically. You will be the only one making any decisions in the future.</span></div></div>",

After he leaves, you then begin to do some chores around the house, like washing dishes, taking out the trash, and doing laundry. Tony didn't say you needed to help out around the house, but you feel you owed it to him for allowing you to stay here, even if it was his idea. And he was thankful for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you usually decide to explore the surrounding area. You either go for a walk, a drive or you borrow Tony's bicycle. Tony lives in a pretty good-sized town so there is quite a bit to explore. You haven't really met any new friends yet, but Tony said it would take time and not to rush it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you usually have lunch, and then you watch TV, a movie, or play a video game until Tony comes home. Then you have dinner and hang out for the rest of the night before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are enjoying yourself. There's enough to do so that you won't get bored, and Tony's attitude is becoming more positive every day.

Sure, you sleep there, but with the exception of that you really don't spend much time there.

Now was a chance to really see what Megan saw every day when she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you've been meaning to stop by the movie theater.

And yet, there is some part of you that really wants to explore Megan's room in-depth right now. Eventually you figure that her friend should be there for the rest of the week, and that you can always visit her later. You walk upstairs to Megan's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again stand before her door with the stickers of her name and the dragon-riding princess. You open the door and once again you are amazed about how everything is still the same from the day she died. You are standing in a living photograph. The only thing disrupting the image is the boxes containing all of your stuff from home. You resisted unpacking because you didn't want to move any of her stuff around and disturb this memory. But now you feel that just having the boxes in the room is disturbing her memory, and you can't have that. You decide to put all of the boxes in the closet in the hallway. You don't mind having to go there to get something of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the boxes out of sight you walk back into her room. Now everything in the room belongs to Megan. And you realize that this room indeed reflected who Megan was. You first see the shirt and jeans you saw on the first night you came here. The sneakers of hers that you accidentally put on are here as well. However, the rest of her clothing was neatly organized in her closet and dresser. You remember that Megan was always into fashion and cared about her appearance, even though you always told her she would be pretty in anything. Next to her closet is her vanity. Underneath its large mirror is a table containing her various makeup and beauty items. She was always into name brands. Only the best for her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room you see several posters of pop bands and young male actors. You glance back to her dresser. On the top you see her camera. Photography was one of her passions and she always talked about going into the field in the future. Behind it was her yoga mat, and the tights she wore to her ballet classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the bookcase next to her bed. This is where you saw her book on kittens. Looking further you see several fashion, beauty, and style magazines. You also can find a number of romance novels and books of advice for young women. But what you most notice is the large photo album.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick it up and look through it. In it are a number of pictures of Megan, taken in your room by what you assume is one of her friends. The pictures are all of Megan in various cute and flirty poses, some standing, some sitting on her vanity, some lying on her bed. Megan not only liked photography, she also like being photographed. Even though she wanted to go into the photography field, she also always talked out wanting to be a model due to her love of fashion. This was undoubtably an album containing her amateur modeling shots. Perhaps she was planning on taking them to an agency to make her dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put the album back, you feel a familiar feeling. You feel</span></div></div>",

You figure it must have come from staying up late last night watching the late show. You decide to just lay down for a while. You climb onto Megan's dark blue bed, lay on your back and close your eyes for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a little bit you open your eyes and look around. You look at everything in Megan's room and are so glad you left everything the way it is. As you thought before, everything is the same from when she died. Its like she is still here. As long as the room is the way it is, her memory is still alive. That makes you really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's when you realize something else. Megan wasn't a tomboy in anyway. Everything about this room screams girly, from her clothes to her makeup supplies, to her decorations, her books and magazines. Even the colors in the room were feminine. You are staying in a room were there wasn't anything you had in your own room back home. And the thing is...you kinda like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel there's just something...nice about looking around the room and seeing items no boy would ever own. There's something about this difference in the items that's just so...mysterious and exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, back home you never even though about having a room like this because the desire wasn't there. And the desire wasn't there because you were a boy and you knew boy's didn't need any of this stuff. So you never even thought about it because there was no need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time you had an excuse. You wanted to keep the room the way it was so that you could keep hear memory alive. And because you had an excuse, you felt you now where able to enjoy the feeling of being a boy staying in a room meant for a girl. You allowed yourself to take pleasure in the fact that everywhere you looked in the room was different than your room back home, as if you were staying in an alternative dimension. It was like going to another reality. You realized you were in a situation that few men ever got a chance to be in, and you took pleasure in that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you looked up at the ceiling. \"I'm going to love it here.\"</span></div></div>",

Tony told you that he found out he was indeed going to have to work the next weekend as well, so you were going to have to wait before you two could do any guy things. Because of all the work, he was feeling more tired when he would come home from work. Although he was happy because you were here, you felt bad he felt so tired. You hoped he would get a break soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour days followed the same routine they had before, with one main difference. Each day, you would make sure to spend an hour or more in Megan's room, lying on her bed and taking in the unique feelings of being a guy in a situation were he would live in a room that only a girl would be in. You didn't have to worry about his gender identity or sexuality because you didn't actually buy the items yourself. You just happened to be in a room full of items by a chain of events not entirely in your control. It wasn't your fault that moving anything around would disrupt Megan's memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo because of this your worry about anything are free to enjoy being in a place completely different from your home. These new and exciting feelings soon cause you to think of the time spent in Megan's room as the best part of your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days go by in fact you begin to think of the items in the room not as Megan's items, but rather your items. Okay Megan was the one who bought the stuff and primarily used it. But Tony offered you her room to stay in, effectively making it your room for the foreseeable future. And since her items have to stay in here for now, technically they are YOUR items because they are in YOUR room. This just increases the pleasure of it all, as you realize you are now a guy staying in a girls room who owns a bunch of girly items. This is another change from your home life, and the thought of it makes you even more happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, as you are lying on the bed taking the the enjoyment of being in the situation, you decide you want to shake things up a bit. You want to try something different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You haven't looked through the photo album since that fateful day when you first decided to really look at the room. You decide to take another look at one of her passions. You look through the pages remembering just how beautiful Megan was inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when an idea pops into your head. Its a thought you would have never considered in the entire life, but after the past couple of days it seems like the most exciting thing in the world. You almost can't believe what you are going to do, but the idea just seems so damn pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the beginning of the photo album and look at the first picture of Megan. It shows her standing in the middle of the room, blowing a kiss to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get off the bed and stand in the exact same place in the room that Megan was standing in the photo. You make sure your legs are together, you slightly bend over, you place one hand on your hip and the other in front of you with your palm out, and you blow a kiss exactly like Megan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingle begins to run all over your body as you fully realize what you have done. You have just stood in the exact spot Megan once stood in, posing in the exact same way Megan once did. Not only are you using her room as your own and having it full of her things, but now you have just performed an action that Megan once did herself. You took Megan's place in that moment, and it gives you a feeling unlike any you have had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need more of his. You look at the next picture in the album. You go to her vanity chair and sit down. You make sure to have your legs crossed as you place one hand on your knee. You then take the other hand and use it to place one finger on your cheek, while you put your mouth in an \"o\" shape and look slightly upwards. Just like Megan did in that photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the next photo. This time she was laying on her bed. You get one of her magazines and lie down on her bed on your stomach towards the foot of the bed, away from the pillows. You then bring your legs up at the knees and cross your ankles over your butt, while pretending to read the magazine. Again, exactly like Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go through each and every photo in Megan's album. You make sure that for each photo you are in the exact same part of the room she was in, doing the exact same pose she was doing. Hours pass by but you are so into all of this you barely notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish recreating the final pose. By this point you are breathing heavily. The realization that you were doing something EXACTLY the way Megan did it gives you a rush beyond anything you have experienced in your life. Its almost a high, almost. Simply put, it is an eutrophic feeling, and you just want to start all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize how much time has passed and that Tony will be home any minute now. You quickly put the album back on the shelf and go downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Tony is so exhausted from all of the overtime that he just goes straight to bed after dinner. You hope he can get a free weekend soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later you decide to go to bed yourself. As you get into bed you see the album and remember the delicious feelings you had earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly without warning you give a girly giggle. Wow. Where did that come from you wonder? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you put your worries aside. This was not an unusual occurrence.  You were remembering the girly modeling you did today, and you decided to choose an appropriate girly response. Again, everything you do is done my your choice. You giggle again, this time deciding to enjoy the feelings it gives you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you read through it, day by day, its exactly as you suspected. Its a commentary on the last year of her life. She goes through each day in the diary. She often mentions her desires to be a model and photographer, and also mentions her love for you.<br>\r\nAs far as the information goes there is nothing shocking. There are no major revelations or secrets of her life. Everything in the diary are things that she has told her friends, family or you before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, what was surprising was the way it made you feel afterwards. You were worried that reading the diary would make you really depressed that she was no longer there.<br>\r\nBut you didn't feel depressed. Far from it, in fact. Reading that diary allowed you to get a firsthand look at Megan's thoughts and emotions during that timeframe. You were able to get a sense of how she felt and what she thought during those days. It was almost like you were able to absorb all that information into your own being, and you were able to make those thoughts and feelings your own. In a sense this was not just her diary, it was not also yours. This gave you a warm feeling almost like being on a cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many things have happened over the past couple of days that have fundamentally changed who you are as a person.

I mean, think about it. Here I am in Megan's room. For the past number of days I have been living here. No one else has used it, I am its sole occupant. I am the person that is using the room. This is MY room. This room, that has Megan's name on the front of the door, that contains every single thing that defined Megan when she was living, is MY room.

These are things I would never have done as John, but Megan did them all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever I'm doing something exactly like Megan would have done, I am essentially taking her place in this world. I am basically recreating her.

It felt kind of odd yet good at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, that morning, you had a usual breakfast with Tony, but there was a surprise this time. The weekend was 2 days away (today being Thursday) but he thinks that he might be able to spend some time with you then. Granted, the key word was \"maybe\" but that was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it,\" you smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Tony said appreciatively, giving you a small rub on the shoulder before he left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done, you decided to get the morning shower out of the way as usual. You went back upstairs, heading to the bathroom just across from Megan's room, the one she always used. Granted, up until now, you had still been using your own shower products, but once you got inside the bathroom, you thought of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....I wonder if...\" you pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be alright to use Megan's shower products? Perhaps so, as you were already doing stuff like looking at her diary. It felt like another way to get immersed into her world, so it sounded like a good idea. As you stripped your usual clothes off though, you couldn't help but notice something as you looked into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...looked kind of thin. Granted, you were never buff to begin with, but here you looked a bit thinner than that. Especially around the waist. Putting your hands there, they seemed to dip just a tiny bit. Not nearly enough to say it looked like a girl's, but perhaps the beginning. You didn't seem to mind though, as it was likely just a coincidence, though it did make you recall how much you liked Megan's lithe body. There was a small other thing though. Your hair...seemed to be a bit longer now, now covering over your ears. You had blonde hair like Megan did, though this was a bit more like hers, straight with no curls or anything. You pulled at your own a bit, seeing that many knots you had were gone, straightening out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...maybe I need a haircut soon,\" you shrugged as you got the shower ready.</span></div></div>",

You never looked forward to a shower before, but now you feel a strange excitement about this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turn on the shower, wait for it to get to the perfect temperature, and hop in. The first thing you do is wash your hair using Megan's Herbal Essences shampoo and conditioner. As you wash your hair, the floral fragrances from these products seem to engulf you in the shower, a sensation completely different from the hair products you normally use. You remember how sometimes Megan's hair would smell just like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your hair is washed you turn your attention to your body. You grab Megan's Caress Daily Silk body wash and a bath puff, and later that puff up and spread it all over your body. Lovely aromas of white peach and silk blossom enter your nostrils as the body wash begins to soften your skin. It feels completely different than the soap and water you use to wash yourself. You feel the sensation of the wash all over your body. Its a sensual experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rinse yourself off and get out of the shower. You pat yourself dry using a towel. As you leave out of the shower, you can't help thinking how wonderful that shower felt. It was the best one you've had in a long time. You loved using Megan's shower products. You decide to use them from now on. You can't imagine going back to your boy shower stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back into her room and get dressed.

Looking at your legs beneath your shorts, they were nice and smooth now, and surprisingly no hairs now. That actually stood out to you, enough that you lifted your shirt a bit to check something. Even the little chest hair you had was gone, and you had none on your armpits either. No hair outside of what was on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...nice stuff,\" you said with an approving nod. That stuff didn't feel necessary anyway to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were satisfied and combed your longer hair a bit, you wondered what you should do today. The day had just begun after all. You could stay in Megan's room, imaging to be her some more like you typically did these days. However, this time, you had a different thought at seeing your typical clothes. You liked acting like a girl quite a bit in here. Maybe...you should dress like one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a daring thought, but with your smoother skin, perhaps it was a good one. Megan liked going to the mall, so perhaps you should spend some time there and have a good time. It didn't take much to convince you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds good,\" you smiled, putting your shoes on after that. \"Maybe get some new shoes too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you got to your car, driving out and making your way down the freeway and to the nearby mall. It really only took 15 minutes or so to get down there and find a parking spot. Thankfully, there were a decent amount of spots there to choose from. Parking in one of them, you stopped the car and eventually made your way inside the mall, enjoying the feeling for once. The clothing store wasn't too far from the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kind of felt like a new experience, with the way you were thinking right now. You had a decent amount of money. You could get yourself something nice and have a good time here. It felt kind of liberating to be honest, and it made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...so what should I look at?\" you wondered.</span></div></div>",

You decide that the first logical step would be to buy some underwear. So you quickly head over to the lingerie section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the racks of ladies underwear, amazed of all the different types and styles. Girls have so much more choices when it comes to underwear than guys, you think to yourself. The boxers you are currently wearing appear drab and boring in comparison. You think to yourself that you have been here in the past, but back then it was to find something nice for Megan to wear. Now you are shopping here for yourself, and whats more, you really want to buy some of these pretty things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something is stopping you from picking up some lovely lingerie to buy. Something just feels..off. For some reason you feel out of place. You remember back at the house thinking that this would be a good idea, but know you are not sure. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think what could be causing these feelings of unease when suddenly it hits you. You realize that you want to buy girls clothes, but not as a boy. You want to buy girls clothes as a GIRL, or at lease dressed as one. Of course, the problem with that is that obviously you don't own any girls clothes, that's what you came down here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you remember. DUH! How could you be so dumb? Megan as a closet full of her clothes in her room at home! You remember Tony saying how you two were the same height and had the same body type, and how her shoes fit you without any problem. You should easily be able to fit into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart starts to rush as you realize what you are going to do. You are going to go back home, get dressed up in Megan's clothes, and come back here to shop as a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the store and are about to walk out of the mall when suddenly you stop. Even though you can't buy any clothes right now, that doesn't mean you have to leave. These mall does have some other services that you could take advantage of so that when you do go back home and get dressed, you look even more like a girl. But what to do first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many other shops you could try out, and one such one was right near the clothing store. It was an ear piercing store, rather small, but good enough for what you needed. Megan did have pierced ears after all. Perhaps you could try some of hers once you got back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decided quickly, you wanted over, passing by a few people as you went inside. Nobody seemed to think oddly of you coming inside, like it was normal. Well, it helped to not make a scene after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you went to the front desk, seeing a girl named Claire there. She smiled and asked what you wanted, and you plainly said that you wanted your ears pierced. Nodding in understanding, she had you wrote your name down and other standard things, like you would typically do. As usual, you wrote your name as Alex, as was typical these days. Claire nodded as she looked at the paper, saying that it wouldn't be too long. It was kind of like waiting for a haircut, just sitting in the waiting room for a little while. Thankfully, it wasn't as long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Alex, we can take you now,\" Claire smiled as she waved you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what would happen, but you nodded eagerly as she took you back, sitting you down and beginning to do everything. You weren't sure what was happening, as your eyes were closed, but you did clench up a bit when you felt the pricking in your ears. Granted, the whole thing seemed to be done in a flash, allowing you to pay and get out rather quickly. You saw it in the mirror before you left, seeing the new little holes in your ears. It made you wonder how you would look with earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you smiled at Claire, who nodded back with a smile of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that business done, you proceeded to exit, heading back to your car. As you were driving back, it did feel kind of like a waste of gas to constantly go back and forth like this, but oh well. At least you got something out of it before coming back. Arriving back at the house now, you eagerly went inside and ran up to Megan's room. It felt oddly invigorating, now seeing the idea of wearing her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what should I go for?\" you asked yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed a bit much to go for something fancy like a sundress or anything, so you laid out something casual. You got a pair of her white bra and panties, along with a pair of shorts and a tank top, all typical colors. They were simple yet nice, and you even had a pair of Megan's flip flops to go with them. Smiling, you stripped down to naked, pulling the bra and panties on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they're soft,\" you said as you felt them on you a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted of course, the bra was left hanging a bit. Oddly enough, seeing them, it made you a bit disappointed. I mean, yeah you'd probably have to fill them up with toilet paper or something like that, but you couldn't help the thought of breasts of your own. The thought stunned you for a second, but it made sense. You could without a doubt be a girl if you had breasts. You certainly liked them on Megan, that's for sure.</span></div></div>",

Wearing Megan's bra and panties you go to pick up the phone while marveling at the softness of the underwear on your skin. It certainly beats boxers by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer the call and surprisingly enough, its Tony. \"Alex are you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply \"Yeah. Where are you at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at the airport. I was just home right now getting packed, but you weren't there. Listen, I'm sorry, but Emily had an accident and broke her leg. I need to fly to California to be with her until she gets better. I'm really sorry about this, but she's really scared and I have to go down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it man, we can always hang out when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Alex. I don't know exactly when I will be back, but hopefully it won't be long. Take care of the house for me. Hey, I gotta go, my flights leaving soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care, Tony\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end the call. Tony is such a sweet guy, you think to yourself, doing that for his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to the task at hand. Looking at the empty cups of your bra, you go into the bathroom and begin stuffing the cups with toliet paper until you create a reasonable bust. That'll do for now, you think, but I'll probably have to buy some breast enhancers at the mall later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at your panties and are disappointed to see a bulge. You reach into your panties and to the best of your abilities try to tuck away your genitals. Its not very comfortable, but soon you have the appearance of a smooth panty front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then step into a pair of Megan's denim shorts. They are a bit shorter and tighter than your own boy shorts, but you do like the way they show off your legs. You then pull her t-shirt on. Its nothing too fancy, just a white t-shirt with a pink heart on it. You slip your feet into Megan's white flip flops, and like before they fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to add just a few touches to finish the effect. You go to her vanity and clip a couple of her barrettes into your hair. You then look at her makeup. You don't want to mess around with that stuff too much just yet, but you do brush some clear lip gloss on your lips. You marvel on how just that can help the girlish effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in front of her full length mirror and look at yourself. In front of you stands a young woman, not overly made up but still quite attractive. You are amazed of the effect just a few feminine items can change the way you look. You do a few modeling poses in front of the mirror and giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look down at your feet in the flip-flops, you begin to think how plain your toes look in them. Megan always had her toes painted and you have to admit it really made it look nice when she wore sandals. You begin to think that before you go back to the mall, it might be a good idea to go the a salon and get a manicure and pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You never imagined you would before this all happened. But then again, you never thought you'd want to think like a girl too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you had an idea of the salon where Megan would go to sometimes, and knowing exactly where that was, you got into the car once again. The feeling of her flip flops on your feet made you smile, wiggling your toes a bit. It kind of made your old shoes feel obsolete. Maybe you'd wear some of her sneakers or something more daring later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for another time. Eventually, you made your way to the salon. Funny how you could recall it when it was your first time going to it. Oh well, no problems at least. You parked outside, making your way inside the place. Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said a young woman, named Penny apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Alex,\" you introduced yourself. \"Do you...remember Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of an Alex and Megan together seemed to flash a lightbulb above Penny. \"Oh her! Yeah, I do. So you're the boyfriend she'd talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah....that's me,\" you smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she'd talk about you all the time. Sad what happened to her,\" Penny said. \"You want the kind of deal she'd get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think she'd like that,\" you smiled back, making Penny smile a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting everything ready, you waited for a bit and Penny called you in eventually. She told you about what it was, and you seemed to agree to it. Megan often got pink for her nail color, so you decided on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you just sat there and relaxed as Penny and another girl got to work. You sighed in relief as you felt them work on your hands and feet, making them feel even softer than they did before. You just hoped that they would be able to work with your really short nails, both on the hands and feet. Still, they seemed to have no issues, as you felt them work with no remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done,\" Penny said as she was working on your right hand at the time. It felt a bit funny as she worked, but you didn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of time, but eventually, it came to an end. \"Perfect,\" Penny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were allowed to open your eyes and look, you were astounded. Your nails weren't short anymore, but rather longer and perfectly manicured, a bright pink color shining on each finger. You couldn't help but marvel at the color and perfect form of your nails. Looking down, your feet looked so small and soft, kind of like Megan's. Heck, you'd say that you basically had her feet (and hands). Your nails were a perfect length, with the same color on each nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're great!\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Penny smiled. \"It's nice to hear you say that. Feel free to come anytime. We can talk more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked the sound of that. In any case, you paid and left the salon, feeling more refreshed than ever. Once you were in the car again, you wiggled your toes inside, gigging at the sight. You wondered how your nails got so long now, but oh well. They looked all the better for it now.</span></div></div>",

You don't know why you weren't envious of Megan when she was alive. Looking at your fingernails, you are still amazed how much longer they look. The nail technician must have given you longer tips. Well, you definitely plan on keeping them that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the mall and walk to the department store. First things first, you need to get rid of the toilet paper in your bra. You go to the lingerie section and take a look at shapewear. There you see what you were hoping was there. Breast enhancement inserts, designed to give women a little bit more up top. Just what you need. Megan's bra was a B-cup, and since you have no breasts you a technically an a cup. So you get the enhancers made to bring a woman from A to B. B is a good size, enough to be noticeable but not too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay for them at the counter and then head for the changing room. You get in and take all of the toilet paper out of your bra. You then open the inserts box and take them out. They appear to be made out of silicone and have a nice breast shape. You slip them into your bra cups. At first they feel kinda weird, but after a while they warm to your body and stick to your skin. You look in the mirror and are pleased with the effect. You now look like you have a pair of real breasts of your own. The inserts even move and jiggle like real boobs. You feel so much more confident with your new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the changing room and decide what to do next. Since you got your ears pierced, you should probably look at some jewelry. However, with your new girlish mood you have a desire to try on a dress.</span></div></div>",

You reason that since you are now dressing like a girl, then subconsciously you have also decided to move like one as well. That must have been what happened. Its no surprise you would be doing this, as you used to love the sexy way Megan would sway her hips as she walked. You love how the swaying of your hips is making your breast enhancers jiggle in sequence. Its really cute to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take of the super-cute dress and put back on the clothes you had when you entered the room. You take the dress up to the counter to purchase it when you see a rack of earring next to the cash register. Your eyes are immediately drawn to a pair of pretty hoop earrings and you decided you simply must have them. You pay for both the dress and the earrings and walk out of the clothing store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a bench and sit down to put on your earrings. Afterwards you decide to go to the food court and get a cherry ICEE. You can feel the weight of the earrings and the clinging sound they make as they walk. You feel goosebumps at this undeniably feminine experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your ICEE and sit down at one of the tables. As you drink it, you look around at the other girls in the mall. Of course, you often looked at them in the past, but this time its different. Instead of just looking down at their bodies, you start to focus on what they are wearing, and how their hair, nails and makeup look. You decide that you are just beginning to notice more about women than you did in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at them, you begin to realize that if you plan to dress as a girl in the future, you will need to wear makeup. The clear lip gloss may have been fine for the first time, but if you want to be one of the girls you need to know how to use all of the makeup supplies. You don't need to go full glam all the time, but even a little bit will help. You know that Megan has a full vanity back home. You should really play around with her makeup supplies and see what you can do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your ICEE and leave the food court. What to do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've already done alot for the day. You decide to just take some time lounging at home. You kick off your flip-flops and lie on your back on your couch. Since you are in a feminine mood, you decide to try watching a chick flick on TV. After a while you find yourself really getting into the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou being to think back over everything that has happened since you stayed with Tony. Its amazing how you've changed since moving in. Yet you cannot deny that you have never felt happier since Megan died. There's alot of fun things about being a girl, you decide to yourself. Its almost addicting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear your cell phone ring. You answer \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex.\" Its your friend Nick from back home. \"How's everything going at Tony's house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everything is going fine. Just trying to make the most of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look man,\" Nick replies. \"Me and a bunch of guys are headed over to this baseball field we found in the countryside to play a couple of ball games. Its near the town that you are staying in, so I'd thought to invite you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man, but I've got to help Tony tonight with some errands. He's got alot of stuff on his plate right now,\" you lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry to hear that. Well, if we've ever in your area again we'll be sure to stop by. Take care man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Nick,\" you say as you hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put down the phone. You realize this is the first time you've ever turned down an opportunity to play baseball with your friends. However, you know that if you were to say yes you would have to dress as your old boy self again, and truthfully you didn't feel like doing that just yet. <br>\r\nYou've been having so much fun that you want to stay as a girl for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, you've been doing so many femme things that you really don't want to do a silly male thing like play sports. The idea just has no appeal to you at all right now. You'd really rather do something that Megan would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up off the couch and walk around. There really is no reason that you need to go back to being a boy at all while Tony is still gone. The thought of having to put on your ugly, clunky guy clothes at that moment is really disdainful. You don't want to stop feeling soft and sweet rather than rough and aggressive just yet. Megan was go lucky being able to live life as a girl. Girls just had it made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you have a horrid thought. If any of your friends come into town and recognize you, they are going to expect you to hang out with them as a guy. You can't take the chance of them ruining this much-needed vacation from your own gender. You can't take the chance that anyone could recognize you. You need to remove all traces of your male self from your appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the mirror and give yourself a good look over. Overall the effect is quite feminine. However, you know that if someone got a good look at your face they would no it was you. You need to start wearing makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, while you grew out your hair longer, it still is too much like your boy style. You need a completely different hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always go back to the salon. You know you were just there today for your nails, but you need to get your hair restyled ASAP. On the other hand, you could always just go upstairs and play around with Megans makeup.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hopefully Penny would be happy to see you again, and you wondered if your hair could look as nice as Megan's. Flipping your flip-flops on once again, you went out to your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting quite the work-out today,\" you giggled a bit as you began to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, your thoughts continued to be full of the things you've done today. It felt odd getting away from our friends and other male things, yet being a girl....felt so much better. Heck, looking down at your breast forms, you kind of wished they could be absolutely real. Breasts to actually call your own. Maybe even getting your hair all pretty if it was long enough. It was only covering your ears right now. Well, in any case, you made your way back to the salon you had been to before, walking right inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back already?\" You smiled as you saw Penny still there, obviously still on shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just had another thought,\" you said as you went up. \"I'd like to get my hair styled. Wish I had thought of that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's no problem,\" Penny smiled. \"Gives me another reason to see you. It's nice to have a friend to talk to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, were you both friends now? You knew she was friends with Megan, and you were probably the closest thing to Megan she had now. In any case, you signed up and were taken in like before, Penny helping like the last time. As you saw everyone beginning to mess with your hair, you tried to converse with Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we....really friends?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny just smiled. \"Of course. Megan was a true friend to me, and I think you are too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you feel good in your chest, especially after denying playing ball with your male friends earlier. That eased your concerns a bit, letting you relax as they worked on your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what style would you like by the way?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admit that you hadn't thought of specifics...but then you remembered Megan's beautiful straight locks of hair, flowing down her back and over her shoulders....it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like it straight...like Megan;s,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Penny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you smiled and relaxed, letting the women get to work. You just laid there, wondering how things were going to be now. At least the time waiting was rather pleasant, though you couldn't help that small feeling of hair coming out of your scalp. Must be them pulling on it so much. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\" Penny smiled, their work seemingly done. \"Just a little come work here and....okay, have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you opened your eyes, getting a look in the mirror and...you were stunned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour short hair was no more. In fact, it was longer and elegant. Perhaps not quite as long as Megan's, but still enough to go over your shoulders and down your back a bit. The locks were perfectly straight, with a nice set of bangs over your forehead. It was....almost like magic with what they did. You'd think you'd wonder how it grew so much, but who cared about specifics. It was another step towards being a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" you smiled gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Penny said in thanks.</span></div></div>",

But it has seemed like you've taken to being a girl very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Its kinda weird. Before all of this I was fine being a boy and I had no desire at all to be a girl. But since I've been staying here its just feels so good to be feminine. All of the girl things I've tried I found I've really enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well listen,\" Penny replies, \"Why worry about any of this. It doesn't matter that you lived a life as a guy before all of this. You cleary enjoy being a girl so there is no reason to go back. I think you should continue this and take it as far as you can go. I feel you are discovering a new and exciting life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" you say back \"But there is still some stuff about being a girl that I not sure of. For example, I still don't know how to wear makeup correctly. I'm going to need to wear makeup because I don't want someone to recognize me as my boy self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweetie. What you need is a good girlfriend to show you the ropes. I would be honored to help you in any way I can, hun. Tell you what, how about tonight I stop by your house and I can show you how to wear Megan's makeup. And then we can look through her closet and pick out some cute outfits for the next couple of days. And of course I'd give you a few more girl secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel so touched that Penny would be willing to do that for you. \"Thank you so much.

Heck, it felt better than your old friends to be honest. Not that you disliked your male friends. Far from it, but talking with Penny seemed to go further than that, like she really would be there for you. Did all girls have this kind of emotional attachment with other girls? Maybe Megan was always like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you spent the rest of the day just doing things yourself, while also finding a bit of time to model a bit more.

You told her what you were up to, like having your ears pierced as well as the steps you took to appear as a girl. You especially marveled at girly your nails and hair looked, like totally real. You especially mentioned your breast forms, to which Penny asked if she might have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you smiled as you lifted your top a bit, showing your bra-clad forms. Penny awed a bit as she felt them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice,\" she smiled. \"Can you imagine if they were real? Like having real breasts? It's quite a feeling, I know.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that would be like magic right?\" you laughed back, putting your top down. \"So...can we start please?\"</span></div></div>",

But if it can end all of this overtime, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will you be away?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About two weeks. So I am trusting you to take care of the castle while I'm gone. Hopefully when I come back we can get a chance to make this a memorable summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Tony back his bags for the business trip.

You know, when Megan died it kind of through everything out of whack\" Normally you make sure to keep your hair cut short, but now it was to the point where it was just covering your ears. \"I guess its time for a haircut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony replies \"Your decision man. But don't be afraid to try knew things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish him luck, and he drives to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back into the living room. For the next two weeks, this house is all yours. You'll miss Tony, but in a way its kinda freeing not having him around. You don't have to worry about what he might say or think about you. In fact, the situation you are in is quite liberating. You are in a town where almost nobody knows who you are.

Afterwards you just watched some TV until you went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you get up with a plan for the day. A couple of months ago Tony installed a large pool in the back. You've always wanted to go for a swim in it but never had the chance. You were planning on asking Tony once he had some free time but now that he's gone for the near future, you see no reason not to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the closet and look through the boxes for your swim trunks.

On you they seem almost like a pair of baggy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take them off and think about what else you can do. You can drive into town and just buy another pair of trunks, but that would take at least an hour and you really want to go swimming now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you think back to what Tony said a couple of days ago. He told you that you and Megan always had the same height and body type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder-could I possibly wear something of Megan's to the pool. The idea of you wearing one of her swimsuits seems silly. But they would probably fit and they are the only other option besides buying a new pair. The pool is in the back so no one would see you. The idea still makes you kind of uncomfortable, but you decide to push aside these overworries to enjoy the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to her dresser and find her swimsuits.

You'd never thought in a million years you would be thinking about wearing it, but its either this or go out shopping for a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need the top, of course, and the bottom is basically a pair of briefs. You take off your clothes and pull the red polka-dotted briefs up your legs. You get them over your hips and you notice how snug they are. This snugness makes your genitals very uncomfortable. You reach in the briefs and try to move your genitals to a more comfortable position. You end up having to tuck them back. You look down and can no longer see any bulge in the front. However, your discomfort is gone and soon you get used to the snugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a towel and head off to the pool. The pool looks inviting so you jump on in. The feel of the water on your skin is refreshing and you begin to swim around the pool. You're glad you decided to wear the briefs, as it gives you more time to enjoy the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of swimming you decide that is enough for the day and get out of the pool. As you towel yourself out you see the long patio chairs. You decide to take a little break and lay down on them for a while. You lay down on your stomach face down on the chair and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes you look up and see a man staring at you from over the fence. As you look up he runs off. What was that, you wander? Why was he looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to think about your situation. Your height and general body type is similar to Megan. You hair is longer now, just over your ears. You're wearing a woman's red polka dotted bikini bottom. And you're lying on your stomach on a deck chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally hits you. From where he was standing, that guy probably thought you were a young woman who was lying down on the chair with her bikini top off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to make of this. You never in a million years thought you would ever be mistaken as a girl. Yet it just happened. However, at the same time, there was a part of you that kind of liked that the guy was looking at you like that. He obviously liked what he saw, and somehow that made you feel attractive and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to brush off the incident and go back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look in the mirror and notice your hair again. Tony is right, it is longer than I'd ever had it. It's only just over your ears but it still is a big difference over how it normally looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if its time for a haircut. But then you remember Tony's parting words about not being afraid to try new things. You look in the mirror and notice that even though its not your normal style, you kinda like it. You like how just the length of your hair can make you look different than before. You decide to keep it like that for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you've never had to care for hair this long before.

Less work I suppose.\" you smiled as you began driving out of the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were driving though, you couldn't help but scratch your chest a bit. It felt kind of strange, as you never really had that happen before. Eventually, you got to a red light, and taking advantage of the chance, you looked beneath your shirt to see. Funny enough, your chest seemed a bit red. Was it irritation from your scratching? Or perhaps from your time swimming? You weren't sure, but it was definitely red for a reason. Not to mention, despite that, the skin seemed smoother, and you couldn't tell for sure, but there seemed to be less hair now. Like, none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that is a bit strange,\" you shrugged as the light turned green. \"But then again, it's not like I cared for chest hair anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got driving again, you didn't really notice that, out of all that red, your nipples were especially red, looking somewhat bigger and redder than the rest. They seemed especially sensitive to any touch now, though it didn't feel like a bad thing. Again, it was probably just swimming or something. That was your justification for that, although you couldn't see the very, very small amounts of flesh beginning to form a bit around your nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, what next?</span></div></div>",

You take off the trunks and put them into the washing machine. You plan on swimming to begin each day during your stay here, so it will be important to have these clean. You don't bother putting on any other clothes since you are in the house by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow naked, you feel like having a light lunch. You open the fridge and pull out a bowl of fruit salad. You begin eating, and by the time you are done the machine has finished washing the bikini bottoms. You place them in the dryer, and decide to watch the local news while they are being dried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dryer is finished, you look at the clock. Wow, that took even quicker that you thought it would. It's not even a quarter to one yet. You go to the dryer and take the briefs out of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hold them in your hands, your mind can't help but reflect on the incident with that guy. You caught the look on his face before he turned and ran away. You knew what it was. It was the same look you and your male friends had in the past whenever you would see a pretty girl sunbathing. There was no mistaking it. That guy clearly thought he was looking at a young woman sunbathing, not a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before people talked about your size similarities to Megan, you've always known you weren't too tall for a guy and you had a small frame. Despite that you never questioned your gender identity growing up, nor did anyone ever mistake you for a girl. And yet, right now that guy did think you were a girls. Its amazing how something like a change in attire, a change in hairstyle, and the right laying position can hide your masculinity. And the strange thing is, you didn't find that he didn't think you were a guy. There was something naughty and delicious about having someone think you were a member of a different gender. An attractive member of a different gender, no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly an idea pops into your head. \"If I could generate that kind of reaction by not even trying to look like a girl,\" you think to yourself, \"How feminine would I look if I DID try?\"</span></div></div>",

Think about it, you are in a place were nobody knows you, were you don't have to worry about the ramifications of what you do. You don't even have to worry about what Tony would say. Megan has all of her things ready for you to use. You have an opportunity right now that you're probably never going to have again in your life. Now is the time to do something new, something different, something crazy! At the very least you'll be able to kill a few hours. And based on what happened earlier, you have confidence that you can pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run upstairs, throw the bikini bottoms on the end, and grab all of Megan's shower supplies. You turn on the shower, wait for it to get to the perfect temperature, and hop in. The first thing you do is wash your hair using Megan's Herbal Essences shampoo and conditioner. You need to be as feminine as possible, and you know that having these feminine scents wafting from your hair will help towards that. This is confirmed when the floral fragrances seem to engulf you in the shower, a sensation different from the hair products you normally use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your hair is washed you turn your attention to your body. You grab Megan's Caress Daily Silk body wash and a bath puff, and later that puff up and spread it all over your body. Lovely aromas of white peach and silk blossom enter your nostrils as the body wash begins to soften your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are lathered up, you grab Megan's Venus Swirl razor, and you carefully drag that razor up and down your legs. After both of your legs are silky smooth, you then work on the rest of your body, making sure that any tattletale hairs are gone. As you see the body hair go down the drain, you are about to finish up when you remember a saying Megan had about shaving: \"You either go Hollywood or go home.\" You know what she meant by that. You very carefully take the razor and shave all the hairs on our intimate area. You are now completely hair free below the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the shower, and using a towel you pat yourself dry. You then get Megan's absolute favorite body lotion, Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy, and spread a generous amount all over your body, adding to the womanly scents emitting now from every pore. Once you are finished, you run your hands all over your body, and smile. Your skin feels as smooth and as soft as Megan's ever did, with no trace of manliness. You head to her room to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing you decide to work on is your nails, because they are going to need time to dry. You look through Megan's beauty supplies on her vanity and find a bottle of Zoya nail polish in Carmen. Its a red color, which means it will match your bikini. You carefully pull the brush out of the bottle, do each finger on one hand, then each finger on the other hand, and then give it a second coat. It's new to you, and it takes a while to get used to it. But soon you have ten beautiful red fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have confidence to do your toenails. You get out Megan's toe separators, spread your toes out, and proceed to paint each of your little piggies. A second coat is applied, and know your feet match your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then once again pick up the bikini bottoms and pull them up your legs. You tuck back you genitals, and are pleased to see that no trace of your manhood is present. You then go to the drawer and pull out the matching bikini top. Before you put it on though, you search for something you know she has. You open the third drawer and find the breast enhancers she often used to give herself a little extra \"oof\" up top. You take the bikini top, and fasten it in your back. You then take the breast enhancers and place them in the molded cups of the top. The enhancers have the effect of filling out the top and even give you a little cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the vanity again and begin brushing your hair, trying to style it like a girl would. You wish your hair was a little longer so you could put it in a ponytail or a cute up do, but you have enough to work with to give you a feminine look. You hold it in place with some hairspray, and as a finishing touch add a couple of barrettes to your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for makeup. You decided since you are supposed to be sunbathing that you shouldn't use too much, just enough to add to the illusion. You put some MAC Studio Fix foundation on a beauty sponge and dab it all over your face. You then pick up some MAC Extended Play Lash Mascara and brush a couple of times on your lashes. Finally you add some red MAC lipglass, making sure to spread it all across those lips. You are pleased with the effect. Nothing too heavy, but enough to make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open up Megan's jewelry box to see what is available. You pull out a silver flower ring and place it on the index finger of your right hand. You then get a silver and pink chain bracelet and place on your left wrist, and then place a matching anklet on your right ankle. Finally, you place a silver toe ring with small diamonds on your left foot, on the toe right next to the big toe. You wish you could wear some of her earrings, but you don't have pierced ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rummage through Megan's closet until you find a pair of thick-soled black flip-flops with a slight wedge heel. You put them on and they fit perfectly on your feet. You try walking in them and the wedge makes it a different experience, but you soon get used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to add one last touch. You get Megan's container of Katy Perry Purr perfume, and spray it all over your body to give yourself one more layer of delicious girly scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you grab a couple of girly magazines from the bookcase, and walk out of Megan's room to the full mirror in the hallway. You look at yourself and gasp. There is no trace of John the guy there anymore. No one would think that the figure in the mirror was anything other than a beautiful young woman. You hair is styled quite femininely, your makeup is light but effective, and your attire reinforced the illusion of womanhood. You are amazed that you, a regular guy, could turn into this. First the first time in your life, you get to experience what it feels like to not just feel attractive, but beautiful. Time to show the world the new you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go downstairs, open the fridge to get a Diet Coke, and prepare to go by the pool and sunbathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you look at you body, you see two noticeable mounds on your chest, and beyond that are a set of long smooth legs ending in glistening red toenails. The air around you <br>\r\n is overcome with all the feminine aromas emitting from your body. You take a sip of Diet Coke and see that you leave a red lip stain on the can. Every sensation you experience serves to reinforce the new gender that you are presenting yourself as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you see some of the other residents of the neighborhood walk by. As they do you wave to them, and they in turn smile and wave back. No one appears to give any indication that they see you as anything but female. You have pulled this off successfully. Your manhood has been hidden and you have been accepted by the public as the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a couple of young men do end up walking by and giving you that same look you saw on the first guy earlier. You feel the feeling again of being desired and a smile runs across your lips. You decide to milk this. You look straight at them, give a flirty little wave and softly say \"Hi boys.\"<br>\r\nYou then stretch your back while crossing one leg over the other at the knee and dipping your footThe boys just stand there open-jawed. You give a little giggle and then say \"Didn't mommy tell you its not nice to stare.\" The boys look embarrassed and run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle to yourself. That went great. They never suspected they were talking to another guy. You've done that to a number of sexy women over the years, but now you know how it feels on the other side. And its a good feeling, sexy, but powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish that magazine, which is better than you thought it would be. It really has a lot of useful advice for a young woman. You slip back into your flip-flops and walk back into the house, proud that you were able to have everyone see you as a woman.</span></div></div>",

As you eat, you feel like you still would like to talk to someone who may have known Megan just before the accident. You decide to finally go visit her friend Karen at the movie theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your meal and drive to the multiplex. You walk to the first concession stand and ask the employee there if Megan is still available. He doesn't know who that is. I say Karen worked there for the past couple of years and was now the assistant manager.

You just arrived and already Tony isn't going to be here for a month. You definitely weren't expecting this. If you had known Tony would be leaving on a business trip you might have not decided to come down. However, its too late to go back now. You don't want to leave and look like an asshole.

Suddenly you remember way Megan had these ballet tights to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had been trying to become a professional model for since her senior year of high school. She still planned on eventually becoming a photographer, but she was serious about going into the modeling field first. You now remember why she had that album made. You remember she did indeed show it to a modeling agency who agreed to have her as a client. As a client, though, they were allowed to made suggestions regarding her career. One of these was that it would be a big help if she were enrolled in ballet classes, and referenced her to this ballet academy. Megan had been on the dance team in high school, but she had never taken ballet lessons before. However, Megan was actually pretty excited about taking ballet. As a little girl she dreams of growing up to be a ballerina, and sometimes she would watch ballet productions on television. Megan had just started attending the classes when the accident occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the tights. These weren't the tights she wore in class. They were her spare in case the one she used got torn. You don't know what happened to the outfit she wore to class; you can't see any ballet gear anywhere else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think again. You really want to speak to someone who knew Megan before the accident. You tried to speak with Karen but she was already gone.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel kind of foolish driving all the way to this ballet academy just to see if there is a chance someone there knew Megan, but its not as if you had anything better to do today. Tony kind of left you hanging. And it couldn't hurt just to ask, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the directions you printed out until you arrive at your destination. Inland Atlantic Ballet Academy. Its a rather large building. You see that the front of the building appears to be a store selling ballet supplies, and the rest you suppose is where the classes are taught. You walk into the building with trepidation. You really hope this won't be a massive waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the enrollment office. The assistant behind the front desk asks \"Can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you think, here goes nothing. \"Yes you can miss. My name is Jonathan Alexander Smith. I came to this ballet academy because I wanted to know if there was anyone here who knew Megan Davis. She was my girlfriend for about a year, until a couple months ago when she was killed in a car crash. I know that at the time she had just begun taking ballet classes here. I really want to speak to someone else who knew Megan around the time of the accident and I just thought that someone hear might have known her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou half expect her to laugh in your face. Instead, though, she calmly states, \"Well, if your girlfriend was taking the beginner classes, then her instructor would have been Madame Olga. I'll go try to find her. She has a class later today but I think she might be available right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the assistant leaves the office. Well that was interesting. You didn't think they would go get the instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the assistant comes back with an older woman dressed in a leotard and tights, and has a stern look on her face. \"You are the boyfriend of Megan Davis, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-yes, ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Olga gestures you to come out of the office. \"Come. Let us speak outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously walk out of the office and into the hallway. Trying to disfuse the situation, you blurt out. \"I'm really sorry Ma'am, I know that you're very busy. Its just that I need to speak to someone else that knew Megan besides her dad because I want to remember her. Her best friend moved away and her mom's in California and her dad's in England for a month, so I thought maybe someone here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down.\", she suddenly says with a smile of her face. \"You have not upset me in any way. I rather think it is a very sweet thing, you driving all the way down here to reminisce about your girlfriend. You really must have been devoted to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruck by her warmth, you say, \"Yes I was, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down the hallway. \"I only had Megan in my class for two weeks when the accident occurred. Not long at all. And yet, for those two weeks. she captivated me as few others had done before. I was struck by her energy, her kindness, her willingness to do whatever it took to succeed. I could tell she had a great respect for the craft, and her fellow students adored her. I was truly saddened to hear of her undue passing. She left quite an impression on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as the memories of her come back to life. \"Yes, she did that to alot of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She never spoke much about you. But seeing you come down here leaves me with no doubt she was devoted to you as you were of her. I hope you enjoyed the time that you did spend with her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did ma'am, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns around and looks at you. \"Mr. Davis, I have something you may find very interesting....</span></div></div>",

Looking at it reminds you that you haven't taken a shower since you got here, and you really need one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stupidly remember that you left all of your shower supplies at your home, and that Tony probably took his with him to England. You would really hate to have to drive all the way back home just for shower stuff, but you know you are starting to smell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her shower items again, an idea suddenly hits you. Maybe you could shower using her stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit the idea is kinda weird since Megan is a girl, and a girl who died no less.

Its just shower supplies, after all, does it really matter if they were Megans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little nervously you strip out of your clothes and get the shower ready. Once it is the right temperature you hop on in. After a few minutes enjoying the warm water, the first thing you do is wash your hair using Megan's Herbal Essences shampoo and conditioner. As you wash your hair, the floral fragrances from these products seem to engulf you in the shower, a sensation completely different from the hair products you normally use. You remember how sometimes Megan's hair would smell just like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your hair is washed you turn your attention to your body. You grab Megan's Caress Daily Silk body wash and a bath puff, and later that puff up and spread it all over your body. Lovely aromas of white peach and silk blossom enter your nostrils as the body wash begins to soften your skin. You cant help thinking that it is  a completely different feeling than the soap and water you use to wash yourself. You feel the sensation of the wash all over your body. It is an almost sensual experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rinse yourself off, turn off the water and get out of the shower. As you begin to dry youself off, you can't help thinking how nice that shower felt. It was the best one you've had in a long time. You have admit that using Megan's shower products was a different experience, but that it also felt very nice. You feel clean in a new way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now that you are dried off, what happens next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You really want to speak to someone about Megan right now. You know that Kristen works at the movie theater downtown, and she knew Megan pretty well. They weren't BFF's or anything, but she did come over to Megan's house every now and then and the two of them seemed to be pretty friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive to the movie theater and go inside. You speak to the worker behind the concession stand if Kristen is here, and he yells out loud \"Hey Kristen! This guy wants to speak to you!\" before walking away. That was sudden, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty redheaded girl walks up and says, \"Can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Kristen Jameson?\" She nods her head. \"Hi. My name is Alex Smith.\" You always went by your middle name rather than your first; only your parents and Tony called you John. \"You probably don't know me, but I was Megan Davis' boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" She replies. \"I know who you are! Megan always used to talk about you whenever I spoke with her. I'd always wanted to meet you in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here I am in the flesh! Listen, would you be able to have some time to talk. I'd love to speak with someone else who spoke with Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going on my break in 15 min. We can go outside and talk then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for her to go on her break and the two of you go outside and begin to share your memories of Megan. You both reminisce about the time you spent with Megan in the past and how she always seemed to brighten up anyones day. It feels good to talk about her with someone else, like she is somehow alive again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan really loved you.\" Kristen said. \"She always talked about you any chance she got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hold back a tear. \"Megan was my first true love. I'd never thought me would be apart, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaw, don't be so said. I miss her too. But I'm sure eventually you'll get over your heartbreak and begin to move on, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so. The thing is, its not just Megan I miss. I also miss having a girlfriend, you know? I miss her feminine presence that was in my life. With her gone, it always feels like something is missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex, I'd love to help you with that, but I've been pretty serious about a guy for several months now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. It would be kind of weird dating one of Megan's friends anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen stands up. \"You know Alex. There may be a way for you to fill this feminine presence void in your life even with Megan gone. And it doesn't involve rushing into another relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"Since you miss her feminine presence, create some of your own. Be the feminine being in your life. Try thinking like a girl, looking at the world through a feminine lens. Be your own feminine presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her surprised. \"And how in the world do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer for that is different for each person. Don't worry. Just think about it and eventually you'll figure out what to do.\" She begins to walk back into the theater. \"I have to go back to work. But if you ever need to talk again, you know where to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back into the theater, leaving you standing alone outside.</span></div></div>",

You really don't feel like dating yet, and it would be awkward for you to be living with Tony and seeing his dead daughters boyfriend date another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back at Tony's and see his car in the driveway.

I spoke with my boss and i turns out the company needs someone to oversee their new office in Vancouver. They said if I agreed to travel to Canada that they would consider me caught up with all my work when it was all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great Tony. How long will you be gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they said two weeks, but you never know with these types of openings. However, if it means no more working weekends or overtime, I'm all for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tony, you do what you gotta do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, so I'm trusting you to look after the castle while I'm away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry John, I promise we'll do something fun when I come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tony says his final goodbyes, shuts the trunk, and drives off to the airport.</span></div></div>",
