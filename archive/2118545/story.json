You begrudgingly get out of bed, get dressed, and contemplate making your bed. \"Eh, not like making the bed matters...\" You groan as you decide to head downstairs and get your daily cup of coffee. That should perk you up, or atleast make you less grumpy. You have grown to resent your job. Always having to unclog someone's toilet after their kid flushed the car keys, or having to get rats out of people's sewage systems after they chewed their way in. You've always dreamed of doing something more with your life. You wanna be famous. Sadly, you don't really have any talents that could serve to give you \"fame and fortune\". You read over the morning paper, and see a advertisement for Avalon Genetics, this new big fancy company whose specialty is gene splicing. They're famous for creating such monstrosities as wool generating spiders, dogs with the speed of a cheetah, and sheep that can lay eggs. You're not really too big of a fan of the company, as you feel that what they do violates the laws of nature. The ad says that they're looking for volunteers to take part in an experiment that promises to bring\"multiple scientific breakthroughs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hate the company, you see this as your big chance at fame. If this experiment is supposed to bring as many \"scientific breakthroughs\" as the ad says, then you might get famous. Atleast a little bit. Who knows? Of course, you still have to go to work, but do you really wanna spend the day working on people's toilets?</span></div></div>",

Who knows? Fame could be coming your way after this. After spending a few hours in traffic, you make it to the building and enter the lobby. \"Good morning, sir! Can I help you?\" The cheery receptionist asks, giving a seemingly genuine smile. You've always been abit uneased by cheery people, since most of them tend to remind you of the Joker. You respond that you are there for the ad about the volunteers in the paper. \"Ah! You're the third person to come in just this morning! Dr. Rosa will be thrilled to have so many volunteers!\" With that, the woman picks up the phone on her desk and informs the doctor that you are wanting to participate. After the quick phonecall, she hands you a form to fill out. Just a simple form for their records. You sit in a nearby seat and fill out the form without a problem, and return the form to the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never had a felony charge? You sure about that, sir?\" the woman asks, sounding slightly confused. You respond, getting annoyed at what she seems to be implying, \"What do you mean by that? Do I look like I should have felony charges? I look like a criminal to you, lady?\". The woman's pupils dilate, and she says in a scared voice, \"N-No, sir! I was...I was j-just asking!\". \"Well, don't. I filled that form out as truthfully as I could. I won't be called a liar or anything by some receptionist.\". She tells you to go sit down, and to wait for Dr. Rosa to take you back to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour passes, and Dr. Rosa finally comes out. \"Ah, you must be...\" He glances at his clipboard, clearly reading your name off of it. \"...Mr. Walters! I must say, the fact that you have decided to participate in this experiment is great. You're going to be famous, good sir.\" You can barely understand him through his thick Brazilian accent, but comprehend enough to know what he's saying. You respond quizzically, \"Wow, you sure have a thick accent. Where you from?\". \"I grew up in Aragua\u00edna, in Brazil.\" He answers, somewhat proudly. \"Wow. Brazil. Long way from home, don't ya think?\" You jokingly respond. It is obvious that Dr. Rosa doesn't find you very funny, and he glosses over your little quip. \"Okay, follow be to the laboratory, please, Mr. Walters.\" You obey and follow him to the lab, where there are two other people standing. One of them is a 22 year old woman by the name of Marcia Herring, and the other is a slightly overweight man in his mid 30's named Bryan Atkinson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rosa instructs you to go over and stand next to the other two test subjects, and you do so. He begins explaining just what the experiment is about. \"Now, I know you three are wondering just what the experiment is that you were needed for. Well, up until this point, Avalon has only had one way of modifying the genetic makeup of an organism, and that was to edit it while it was still a mere zygote, but due to certain technological advancements, we no longer have to do that. We have managed to develop a special type of technology that allows us to...edit the DNA of a fully grown organism. We can now add and replace whatever genes we can get access to in the genome. That brings me to why you're all here. You see...</span></div></div>",

You glance in the mirror and are practically spooked out of your skin. Your hair is messed up in ways you never knew hair COULD be messed up. You walk over to the shower and turn it on, and wait for it to get decently warm. You then undress from what little you went to sleep in and step into the shower and begin washing up, taking extra care to wash your hair in order to try and fix the afro you've got going on. You spend about 25 minutes in the shower, then get up and dry off. You go to your closet and put on your work clothes. Then you head back to the bathroom to fix your hair. Afterwards, you head downstairs to get some breakfast. You decide to just make a bowl of Captain Crunch, since you don't really feel like cooking bacon or sausage or anything. You grab the milk from the fridge and pour it into the bowl full of dry cereal, and begin eating. You flip on the TV, and it is immediately on the news, where they're talking about Avalon Genetics, a fairly new company that specializes in Gene Splicing. They've managed to create sheep that lay eggs, dogs that can run as fast as cheetahs, and even spiders that can spin wool instead of silk.

You get in your car and start it up, and you glance up at the rear view mirror, only to see a girl with long, white hair and an all white outfit sitting in your backseat. You freak out and scream at the top of your lungs. The girl reaches up and places her hand over your mouth, muffling your screams. \"Shh! Be quiet!\" She whispers to you. You're still understandable scared of this mysterious girl, and contemplate getting out of the car and calling the cops or something. Maybe she escaped from a mental asylum or something. You reach for the door handle, only to have the girl reach up and lock the door, keeping you from opening it and getting out. You ask her what she wants with you, and she tells you that she needs you to drive her the the Avalon Genetics building downtown. You ask her why, and she dodges the question, saying that it's \"none of your business\". You tell her that you need to get to work, and she says that the trip to the Avalon building won't take too long, and that she just needs to do something. You bounce it around in your head, and then decide that there doesn't really seem to be any other choice, so you agree to drive her to the Avalon building. Along to way, she introduces herself as \"Dawn\" and tells you that she has had abit of a rocky relationship with Avalon, and that she was involved in one of their experiments. You tell her that your name is Alice, and about how you work at the local Walmart as a cashier. She doesn't seem to respond, and just stares out the window. Within an hour, you arrive at the Avalon building, and Dawn tells you to wait there while she goes in. You agree, and while she is in the building, you contemplate leaving and heading on to work. Not like it would matter. She's obviously got her own problems that you don't want a part of. Before you can make a decision, you notice Dawn come running out of the building...with a bulging stomach. She definitely didn't have that when she went in. what the hell?! She hops in the car and tells you to step on it. You start trying to ask what happened, but are cut off by Dawn, who yells for you to get moving. With that, you step on the gas and speed away. The inside of the car is silent for the next 30 minutes, aside from the various groans and gurgles that come from Dawn's huge gut every now and then. After awhile, you ask her just what happened in the building. \"Just took care of some business...\" She says confidently, patting her distended stomach in satisfaction. \"Um...So, what's...um...up with your...gut? It wasn't that big when you went in, right?\" You ask, not being able to get over the sounds that sound like muffled screams coming from her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks if you can keep a secret, and you say yeah. She tells you that her DNA was genetically modified while she was still a zygote, and she was raised by a scientist by the name of Luciano Rosa, who she says is pretty much the head scientist at Avalon.  You ask her just WHAT was genetically modified in her, since she doesn't look too abnormal(aside from her bulging gut that's pressing up against your seat, pushing it forwards slightly). She explains, while rubbing her stomach, that they had modified her genes to give her elastic skin and organs, and so her organ setup was pretty similar to a snake's, in that they could easily move around if they needed to. Upon hearing this, your heart skips a beat. Could Dawn have...No, she couldn't have...That would be impossible. But...what if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your mental composure and ask her about the thought that just popped into your head. \"That's not a...a person in there, r-right?\" You say, not realizing just how crazy you may sound asking that. Dawn responds that yes, it is in fact another person that is squirming around in her stomach at the moment. Your face goes pale as a ghost upon hearing this. Could she have been lying? You don't think so, as she sounded very confident when she said that, and there are still the muffled screams. Are you carrying an honest-to-god maneater in the backseat of your car? You ask her what she plans to do with the unfortunate person, and she responds that she's gonna do what she does to everything in her stomach: digest them. This whole thing causes your whole world to flip upside down twice over. Dawn asks you were you're going. You begin to think. You could always take her back home and maybe ask her more about her abilities; but then again, she could be pretty dangerous. You could easily pull over and make her get out. Could be risky to keep someone like her around you. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

You don't even feel that full or anything, so you get up and go to grab the box of cereal off the fridge. Just when you get to the fridge, you hear a sound behind you, and turn to see what it was. You don't see anything, but hear what sounds like slight footsteps coming from upstairs. It's definitely footsteps. You're sure. A burglar? This early? I mean, there isn't really a set time for burglary, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of hesitation, you grab a kitchen knife and head cautiously head upstairs. As you get to the top of the stairs, you can hear the footsteps clearer. they sound like they're coming from your room. Your first thought is someone has snuck in and is rummaging through your socks or underwear or something. Your bedroom door is closed. You didn't close it when you went downstairs. You are now absolutely sure someone's in your house. You slowly open the door, knife ready to be swung. You walk in and see that multiple drawers in your dresser have been pulled out, and your bathroom has been ransacked. You look around, but don't see anyone. Just then, the door closes behind you. You turn around, but just then, your vision goes dark. \"What the hell is going on?!\" You think to yourself. It seems the the mysterious girl that blew into town a few days ago has broken into your home, and is beginning to swallow you whole! This dawns on you once you hear the swallows. You freak out and start struggling as hard as you can, trying to get out of this impossible situation. You feel a sharp pain in your side. You've just been punched by the girl. She's trying to get you to stop struggling so much. You don't obey the punch, however and begin struggling more violently. You feel two sharp pains on either side of you. She's just punched you twice. You reluctantly stop struggling and moving about as much, as you don't want to get hit again. Of course, you don't want to get eaten alive either, which shouldn't even be possible, but the girl already has your head and your shoulders in her mouth, so that debunks that whole thing. She tilts her head back, and proceeds to let gravity begin pulling you into her throat, and within a few gulps, she manages to get up to your waist. She tilts her head back to normal in order to take a breath. She has her hands on the bulge that is you, guiding it downwards. She takes another few gulps, and only you socked feet are sticking out of her mouth. She pulls your socks off, and then sucks in your feet, and in one final gulp, sends you plummeting into her steamy, cramped stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much room to move, but with what little room you have, you start struggling and squirming as hard as you're able in your confined space. You hear a loud <span class=\"cbgreen\"><b>BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!</b></span> come from outside. \"I'm so sorry about that. You startled me. I didn't...I didn't want to...get caught.\" you hear the girl say in a muffled voice. She sounds scared. You still can't manage to wrap your head around your current predicament and end up responding with  \"How did this even happen?! This shouldn't be possible! Let me out of here!\" You hear the girl's muffled voice from outside, \"I'm...I'm sorry. I...I don't really know how to...let you...out.\" \"WHAT?!\" You exclaim upon hearing this. You mentally question whether the girl's stomach could actually digest you, as you are a full grown woman in her 20's. That should be above the human stomach capacity, right? You proceed to ask your living prison, \"Can you...are you gonna...digest me?\". \"Um...Yes, I'm afraid so...I'm so, so sorry. If I could let you out, I would, but the way I was...nevermind.\" The girl says, sounding remorseful for what she has done. The reality of your situation sets in. You realize that you are going to be digested! You begin pleading with the girl. \"Please, you gotta do something! I don't wanna die! I gotta be at work in about 15 minutes! Please! Take some antacids or something!\" You feel a slight press from outside the fleshy walls. The girl has placed her hand on her now bulging gut. \"Even if I did take some antacids, I don't think it would matter too much, and there'd still be the fact that you'd still be stuck in there, and would probably suffocate if nothing else. I'm so sorry.\" She says. \"Well, you could always cut me out-\" The girl stops you there, and with her next words, sounds abit displeased. \"No! That is out of the question! I don't want to cut myself open or anything like that! I would die!\" You reluctantly accept your new temporary place in this girl's steamy gut, and decide to introduce yourself. \"My name is Alice Mack. what's yours?\" You feel kinda weird trying to get friendly with the person who will end up being your gravesite, but there's not much else you can do. best to try and befriend her before getting digested, right? \"People just call me Dawn.\" the girl responds. You can't help but ask how she was able to even eat you in the first place, since that shouldn't be possible for humans to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says that she's abit of an experiment, and that she technically belongs to Avalon Genetics. Of course! Only they could be capable of creating something like this girl. maybe they mixed snake genes with hers, and that lead to you being one of her unwilling meals. You hear her say that she's started feeling tired, and asks if it's okay for her to use your bed. You won't be using it anymore. You say it's no problem, and she thanks you, then you feel the world around you shift and move as your captor waddles her way over to your bed and flops down on it. Within seconds, she's out like a light. Her stomach begins kicking into high gear and pumping acids in. They don't hurt at first, and just itch a little. After a few minutes, the itching turns to burning and stinging, and you start to lose consciousness from the increasing pain. You never awaken. Dawn, however, wakes up a few hours later, and immediately has to go to the bathroom. She runs into your bathroom and plops down on the toilet, and begins grunting, her intestines pushing your remains down and out of her anus. They land in the toilet in medium sized logs. She then wipes, flushes, and leaves your house, with you never to be heard from again and nobody but her knowing just what happened to you. Your family and friends are devastated by your disappearance. The police organizes a state-wide search for you. Little do they know, you are floating in the sewers in little, brown, logs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>DIGESTED</b></span>.</span></div></div>",

You mostly go there to lift weights and bulk up, but you also partially go there to see all the women working out. Sometimes, you can barely pay attention to your reps because there's so many women in tight yoga pants and shorts in there, on the treadmills mostly. You're in the middle of working out when two men wearing fancy looking suits walk up to you. \"Are you Matthew Buckner?\" One of them asked. You put away the weight you're lifting and sit up to face them. \"Yeah, that's me. Who are you two? The bougie brigade?\" You say as you wipe sweat off of your face with a towel. They introduce themselves as having been sent by Avalon Genetics to recruit you as a test subject for some gene splicing experiments. \"Lemme get this straight. You want me to go be some sort of...lab rat? Get the fuck outta here. I got a few more reps to do and some asses to check out.\" The men glance at each other, then one of them looks at you and tells you that you wouldn't just be a \"lab rat\", and that you would be paid handsomely for you services. You've never been a fan of those big sciency corporations like Avalon, but the idea of getting rich off of participating in a couple experiments is too enticing, so you accept their offer, and they ask you to follow them to their black SUV outside. They drive you to the Avalon building downtown, and escort you to the test lab, where a female scientist is looking into a microscope, observing some amoebas in a pond water sample. One of the suited goons alerts her to their, and your presence. She turns and sees you, a decently buff 25 year old guy wearing a white tank top and jeans, with messy hair and pit stains. \"Well, hello there. You must be Matthew Buckner. Well, My name is Dr. Anna Raymond. It is very nice to meet you, Mr. Buckner.\" The scientist says as she looks you over. \"Nice to meet you too. Now, why am I here?

It has also given her the ability to swallow things a human being normally wouldn't be able to, such as TVs and computer monitors, and she says that she has tested it with live animals such as rats and small birds, both of which gave positive results, but she wondered if this ability would allow for what she dubs \"same size\" ingestion, which she explains as being a creature swallowing something of a similar or same size as them. You start to get nervous as she explains this, and eventually ask some questions. \"What are you going to do?\" You ask, feeling abit of fear forming in the pit of your stomach as you fear the answer she'll give. \"Why, I'm gonna try to swallow you, of course.\" Shit. That is NOT the answer you wanted to hear. A human being can't swallow another human being whole, right? Even <b>WITH</b> DNA modifications, that would be physically impossible, right? You don't think too much of the logic on whether it's actually possible. She did say that she's managed to swallow TVs and mice and stuff. Maybe it's actually possible for her. \"W-Why me?\" You ask, wanting to know just why you were chosen out of all the other people they could've probably chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Raymond smiles again and responds that since you are a registered organ donor, they figured it would be alright. Technically you'd be donating your organs, as well as the rest of your body, to her. So they chose you. She also says that she figured you'd give a slight challenge with you being muscular. You are no longer on board, not even for the money. How can you use the money if you get digested? You turn and try to run out of the room, but the two guys in suits grab you and hold you back. Dr. Raymond tells you that since you've already agreed to the experiment, you can't bail out now. She orders you to come over to her, and when you do, she tells you to strip down to your boxers. You do so hesitantly, and before you can say anything, she shoves your whole head in her mouth, and begins swallowing. You're hoping that she won't be able to eat you and you'll be able to walk away with the huge amount they promised to pay you. Your hope starts dwindling little by little each time she lands a successful gulp. I doesn't take long for her to have half of your body down her throat. You are getting more and more scared as time goes on. She tilts her head back and allows you to slide down her throat some, while swallowing in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets to your boxers, and after some debate, she decides to take them off of you, as she doesn't know if she'll be able to digest them. She takes another gulp, and sends you further into her throat. After a few minutes, only your feet are sticking out of her mouth, and she quickly slurps them up, and gives one last good swallow, sending you sliding down into your fleshy prison. You curl up due to the cramped space, and begin struggling desperately. You didn't think she'd get this far. It's hard for you to even believe. You are at this very moment sitting in a human stomach, and it is every bit as uncomfortable as you could've imagined. You feel pressure on one of the stomach walls. Dr. Raymond has placed her hands on her now distended stomach, and your struggling causes her to let out a loud <b><span class=\"cbgreen\">BRUAAAAAAAP!</span></b>. She lets out a satisfied sigh and thanks you for participating in the experiment. You ask her when she'll be letting you out, to which she responds with \"the next time she goes to the bathroom\". You ask her what she means, and she responds that she's gonna digest you. You freak out. You knew this would be the outcome. You start pleading for her to let you out and that you don't wanna die, but it falls on deaf ears as she goes back to looking in her microscope. After a few hours of struggling, you pass out from tiredness. She goes home later that night, and in her sleep, her stomach kicks into overdrive and starts digesting you while you're asleep. You awaken one last time, for a few seconds, and feel the mind-numbingly painful digestion process, then you pass out again, dying in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Raymond wakes up the next day and notices that her stomach has gotten considerably smaller, and realizes that you have been all but mostly digested, and her stomach is now full of a mixture of bones, acid, and blood. She gets up and goes to work. While at work, she has to release you. She runs to the bathroom and quickly sprays your remains all over the first toilet she gets too. She finishes after about 20 minutes, and then wipes, and goes back to work. Never to think of you as anything more than a successful experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been <span class=\"clgreen\"><b>DIGESTED</b></span>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up at the massive Avalon Genetics building in front of you. Today's your first day, and you don't know how well you're gonna fair with this job. Sure, you've always had a huge love for science, that's what made you get a degree in Biology in college, after all. The thing is, you've always been a pretty big voraphile. Ever since you were 6, you've had a big fascination with getting eaten, and a few years ago, you stumbled across a website called Eka's Portal, which you heard was a community made up of other voraphiles and people with similar interests. You fully realize the vore potential that Avalon's gene splicing techniques have, but don't want to allow your strange sexual fantasies get in the way of your new job. With a deep breath, you make your way up the steps and enter the main lobby, where there is a receptionist, possibly in her mid 30's, sitting behind the desk in the center of the lobby. You walk up to her, and introduce yourself. \"H-hi. My name is...is Carline Mason. M-Most people just call me Carrie, though.\" You mutter, feeling understandably nervous. The receptionist looks up at you, and with a friendly smile, responds \"Ah! Mrs. Mason. Right on time. You nervous about your first day?\". You nod sheepishly, to which the woman responds with \"Oh, well, don't be. Dr. Rosa is a great man. You'll love working with him. You really look like you'd get along pretty well with him.\" You start to feel abit better, and reply \"Y-You really think so?\". \"Yeah. Definitely. Now, the way to the lab is right down that hallway over there.\" The receptionist happily replies, pointing to a hallway off to the left of her desk. You thank her and make your way to the lab. You see a sign on the wall that reads <b>Lab</b>. There it is. Where you'll be working from now on. You walk into the room, and see a male scientist writing something on a whiteboard. \"Um...D-Dr. Rosa?\" The man turns around to face you. \"Ah! You must be Caroline! You're right on time!\" he says, walking closer to you. He asks you how your day has been so far, to which you respond with the standard \"fine\". He seems to notice your nervousness, and tells you that it's normal for someone to be nervous when starting a new job, especially one as \"prestigious\" as an Avalon scientist. You are wracking your brain, trying to think of something to say. You think about the whiteboard he was writing on, and decide to ask about it. \"Um...W-What were you writing...over there?\" Dr. Rosa smiles slightly and explains that Avalon has been able to create a piece of technology that allows them to edit the genetic code of fully grown organisms, eliminating their originally used method of genetic modification of zygotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, you become intrigued, and start to get less nervous. You ask him how they know that the tech works properly and safely, and he responds that they know it works properly and is safe because they were able to safely edit the genetic code of a fellow Avalon scientist by the name of Anna Raymond. He explains that the modification gave her extremely stretchy skin and the ability to swallow objects such as televisions and cameras whole. The Vorarephilia part of your brain immediately kicks in, and you start getting excited and also scared about the prospect of vore possibly becoming a reality. As much as you don't want to, you reluctantly ask Dr. Rosa about the specifics of Dr. Raymond's abilities. \"Um...Can she...um...how do I...Can Dr. R-Raymond s...swallow a...um...I don't know if I can...Can she swallow a...living...thing?\" Dr. Rosa seems to have been caught off guard by your stammered question, and responds that she has had positive results with mice and small birds. He then asks you why you acted so weird when asking the question, and you reply that...</span></div></div>",

This shocks Dr. Rosa, who states that he never had any idea that such a disturbing fetish, and says that he wishes not to hear anymore of it. You feel embarrassed at his disgusted reaction, and wish you had never said anything about your fetish. You've never been able to explain your fetish to people without them thinking you're a total loon. Most people assume that you are into cannibalism or something, and they tend to stay away from you out of fear. That's why you've been a closeted voraphile since you discovered you had the fetish. Dr. Rosa looks over at his whiteboard, and looks to be thinking. After a few minutes of the most awkward silence you've ever felt, Dr. Rosa looks at you and tells you that...</span></div></div>",

You see, you're not a normal girl. You have special...abilities, like elastic skin and movable organs. You also have one monster of a digestive system, allowing you to swallow and digest things twice your size. You didn't become like this naturally, however. You had your genes modified while you were still a zygote, and were raised in captivity by Avalon Genetics. The scientist who was the closest to a father figure for you was a man by the name of Luciano Rosa, although, you wouldn't exactly call him a \"father figure\". He was all about data, and treated you as nothing more than a science experiment. For most of your life, you were not allowed to interact with the outside world, as the scientists feared that their data would be \"corrupted\". You recently escaped from Avalon, and have been on the run ever since. You've been planning on going back to Avalon, in order to get revenge on the person you hate the most: Dr. Rosa. You plan to walk in and catch him off guard, and send him on a one-way trip down your gullet. The problem is, you need a getaway driver, and nobody will talk to you, as they are unnerved by your white outfit and your grey irises, which make you look like a zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk by a house, see a woman walk by a window downstairs. You then notice that a window on the second floor is slightly open. You could easily climb through that window and possibly steal some clothes, in order to try and look less like an escaped mental patient. Of course, you could also hide in the woman's car. Maybe she has to go to work and you could get her to take you to the Avalon building, and she could be your getaway driver. You think about it, and decide...</span></div></div>",

It's not the best idea, but you don't really like walking around in a full white outfit. You sneak closer to the house, and see a spot where you can climb up and get to the window. You manage to make it up and you open the window, and climb inside. You look around and see a bedroom. You sneak into the bedroom, close the door, and begin rummaging through a dresser, not finding any clothes worth wearing. You then take a look in the bathroom, and find nothing also. Just then, you hear footsteps coming closer to the bedroom, and quickly hurry beside the door, in a rushed attempt to hide. Just as you press up against the wall beside the door, the door begins to slowly open, and a brown haired woman carrying a kitchen knife walks in, looking scared, and not afraid to use the knife if she has to. You think quickly, push the door closed, startling the woman and causing her to turn around. In a fit of panic, you shove her head in your mouth, and begin to swallow. You can hear the woman's muffled protests as she is slowly pulled into your throat. She is violently thrashing about, and could possibly injure you if you don't do something. You give her a quick jab in the side, in an attempt to get her to stop struggling so violently, but it doesn't work. She begins struggling more violently. Panicking, you give her a jab on both sides of her body. She then starts to calm down and stop struggling so hard. You think about letting her out, but think that if you did, she would probably stab you or call the cops or something, so you continue to swallow, and you tilt your head back, and start gulping as much as you can. Within a few minutes, only to woman's waist is sticking out of your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head back down, and take a bit of a break from swallowing. You then place your hands on the bulge in your throat, and begin guiding it down as you swallow more, and it doesn't take long for the woman's socked feet to be the only things still sticking out of your mouth. You pull off her socks, and are immediately hit with the smell of her sweaty feet. Trying to ignore the smell, you suck in her feet, and give one final, big gulp; sending the woman sliding into your steamy gut. he begins squirming around, and the movement causes you to let out a huge <span class=\"cbgreen\">BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!</span>. You then look down at your distended belly and begin to apologize for what you've just done, and try to explain the the woman scared you. She then asks you if you're going to actually digest her, and you respond that since you don't know how to let her out, you will end up digesting her. the woman begins begging and pleading for you to try and let her out, and suggests taking her kitchen knife cutting her out with it. You immediately reject the idea, as you know that would be fatal for you. After that, the woman seems to have accepted her new home in your stomach, and introduces herself as \"Alice Mack\". You tell her that your name is Dawn, and the woman begins to question how you were even able to swallow her in the first place. \"I'm a g-genetic creation of...Avalon Genetics.\" You then begin to feel tired, as your stomach is wanting to begin work on the contents. You ask her if you can sleep in her bed, to which she agrees to. You waddle over to the bed and flop down, and doze off within seconds. While you're asleep, your stomach quickly digests the woman. When you awaken, you feel immense pressure at your \"back door\" and run into the woman's bathroom, pull down your pants, sit down on the toilet, and begin pushing the woman's remains out of your anus. After a few minutes of hard grunting, you manage to empty your system of all of the woman's remains. With that, you wipe the residue away, flush the brown logs away, and decide that it would be best if you just left without touching anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel sorry for the woman's friends and family, who will discover that she has gone missing. Nobody but you will ever know just what happened to her. You attempt to push this guilt to the back of your head and continue walking, not looking back.</span></div></div>",

Seeing the parade and how many people gathered for it, you were heasitant to joining them as you didn't want to make hurt because of Avalon's ruthless hunt for her. Frantically looking for a way out, you immediately spot an alley way and rush towards it. Entering it, you slow your pace down after some time and walk down it in bliss. But you could hear two sets of foot steps following you from behind because of your enhanced hearing and a quick look behind, you see two homeless men following you, both with lechorius faces. Quickening your speed, you see that they're still gaining on you and you begin to panic as they were about an arm's reach from you.<br>\r\nHowever, Alice was still on your side, as your guts gurgled again, meaning you still had some of her inside of you, and once the men were directly behind you (unknownst to you), a sizable <span class=\"cbrown\">Pppppppfffffffffttttttttttt!</span> exited your colon. <br>\r\n\"Thanks, Alice,\" you said to your ass, giving it a hearty smack and you could have sworn you felt it respond in a jiggle, but you had other things to worry about.<br>\r\nWith the men gagging from your flatulence attack, you ran like hell and didn't bother looking forward, your eyes looking behind you.
