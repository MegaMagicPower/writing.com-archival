Your eyes dart around, wondering what the hell happened when you visited the ticket office for your favorite sports team. Wherever you are it's broiling, a dull droneing sound begins to stirr in your ears, the children seem very restless and they begin to scream, you can't make out what, but a deep instinctive fear makes you writh in your chair, Suddenly the music becomes audible over the crowd. No.. Not that. Not that horrible music. You try to cover your ears but remember they are bound tightly. closing your eyes for a moment you try to blot out the \"Barney\" theme. Some horrible person thought this was a vindictive practical joke? who. You hear a enourmous thumping sound, shaking the room as the mob of chilldren finally make a collective awe.</span></div></div>",

This is a heck of a machine you think. it's small forearms moving , then it bend down fully to grasp a microphone, it looks exceedingly clumsy at this and you almost laugh as it struggles, this might not be all bad, finnally the monster grabs the microphone and slowly straightens itself out. looking back at the audience it seems nearly as surprised as you.</span></div></div>",
